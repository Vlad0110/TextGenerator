history .  that  in itself  was not dangerous .  what changed the world beyond all dreams was the fact that he looked like a professor of ancient history .  thaddeus araman  department head of the division of chronoscopy  might have taken proper action if dr .  potterley had been owner  . of a large  square chin  flashing eyes  aquiline nose and broad shoulders .  as it was  thaddeus araman found himself staring over his desk at a mild mannered individual  whose faded blue eyes looked at him wistfully from either side of a low bridged button nose  whose small  neatly dressed figure seemed stamped    milk and water    from thinning brown hair to the neatly brushed shoes that completed a conservative middle class costume .  araman said pleasantly     and now what can i do for you  dr .  potterley .     dr .  potterley said in a soft voice that went well with the rest of him     mr .  araman  i came to you because you   re top man in chronoscopy .     araman smiled .     not exactly .  above me is the world commissioner of research and above him is the secretary general of the united nations .  and above both of them  of course  are the sovereign peoples of earth .     dr .  potterley shook his head .     they   re not interested in chronoscopy .  i   ve come to you  sir  because for two years i have been trying to obtain permission to do some time viewing chronoscopy  that is in connection with my researches on ancient carthage .  i can   t obtain such permission .  my research grants are all proper .  there is no irregularity in any of my intellectual endeavors and yet        i   m sure there is no question of irregularity     said araman soothingly .  he flipped the thin reproduction sheets in the folder to which potterley   s name had been attached .  they had been produced by multivac  whose vast analogical mind kept all the department records .  when this was over  the sheets could be destroyed  then reproduced on demand in a matter of minutes .  and while araman turned the pages  dr .  potterley   s voice continued in a soft monotone .  the historian was saying     i must explain that my problem is quite an important one .  carthage was ancient commercialism brought to its zenith .  pre roman carthage was the nearest ancient analogue to pre atomic america  at least insofar as its attachment to trade  commerce and business in general was concerned .  they were the most daring seamen and explorers before the vikings  much better at it than the overrated greeks .     to know carthage would be very rewarding  yet the only knowledge we have of it is derived from the writings of its bitter enemies  the greeks and romans .  carthage itself never wrote in its own defense or  if it did  the books did not survive .  as a result  the carthaginians have been one of the favorite sets of villains of history and perhaps unjustly so .  time viewing may set the record straight .     he said much more .  araman said  still turning the reproduction sheets before him     you must realize  dr .  potterley  that chronoscopy  or time viewing  if you prefer  is a difficult process .     dr .  potterley  who had been interrupted  frowned and said     i am asking for only certain selected views at times and places i would indicate .     araman sighed .     even a few views  even one  .  .  .  it is an unbelievably delicate art .  there is the question of focus  getting the proper scene in view and holding it .  there is the synchronization of sound  which calls for completely independent circuits .        surely my problem is important enough to justify considerable effort .        yes  sir .  undoubtedly     said araman at once .  to deny the importance of someone   s research problem would be unforgivably bad manners .     but you must understand how long drawn out even the simplest view is .  and there is a long waiting line for the chronoscope and an even longer waiting line for the use of multivac which guides us in our use of the controls .     potterley stirred unhappily .     but can nothing be done .  for two years        a matter of priority  sir .  i   m sorry .   .   .   .  cigarette .     the historian started back at the suggestion  eyes suddenly widening as he stared at the pack thrust out toward him .  araman looked surprised  withdrew the pack  made a motion as though to take a cigarette for himself and thought better of it .  potterley drew a sigh of unfeigned relief as the pack was put out of sight .  he said     is there any way of reviewing matters  putting me as far forward as possible .  i don   t know how to explain     araman smiled .  some had offered money under similar circumstances which  of course  had gotten them nowhere  either .  he said     the decisions on priority are computer processed .  i could in no way alter those decisions arbitrarily .     potterley rose stiffly to his feet .  he stood five and a half feet tall .     then  good day  sir .        good day  dr .  potterley .  and my sincerest regrets .     he offered his hand and potterley touched it briefly .  the historian left  and a touch of the buzzer brought araman   s secretary into the room .  he handed her the folder .     these     he said     may be disposed of .     alone again  he smiled bitterly .  another item in his quarter century   s service to the human race .  service through negation .  at least this fellow had been easy to dispose of .  sometimes academic pressure had to be applied and even withdrawal of grants .  five minutes later  he had forgotten dr .  potterley .  nor  thinking back on it later  could he remember feeling any premonition of danger .  during the first year of his frustration  arnold potterley had experienced only that frustration .  during the second year  though  his frustration gave birth to an idea that first frightened and then fascinated him .  two things stopped him from trying to translate the idea into action  and neither barrier was the undoubted fact that his notion was a grossly unethical one .  the first was merely the continuing hope that the government would finally give its permission and make it unnecessary for him to do anything more .  that hope had perished finally in the interview with araman just completed .  the second barrier had been not a hope at all but a dreary realization of his own incapacity .  he was not a physicist and he knew no physicists from whom he might obtain help .  the department of physics at the university consisted of men well stocked with grants and well immersed in specialty .  at best  they would not listen to him .  at worst  they would report him for intellectual anarchy and even his basic carthaginian grant might easily be withdrawn .  that he could not risk .  and yet chronoscopy was the only way to carry on his work .  without it  he would be no worse off if his grant were lost .  the first hint that the second barrier might be overcome had come a week earlier than his interview with araman  and it had gone unrecognized at the time .  it had been at one of the faculty teas .  potterley attended these sessions unfailingly because he conceived attendance to be a duty  and he took his duties seriously .  once there  however  he conceived it to be no responsibility of his to make light conversation or new friends .  he sipped abstemiously at a drink or two  exchanged a polite word with the dean or such department heads as happened to be present  bestowed a narrow smile on others and finally left early .  ordinarily  he would have paid no attention  at that most recent tea  to a young man standing quietly  even diffidently  in one corner .  he would never have dreamed of speaking to him .  yet a tangle of circumstance persuaded him this once to behave in a way contrary to his nature .  that morning at breakfast  mrs .  potterley had announced somberly that once again she had dreamed of laurel  but this time a laurel grown up  yet retaining the three year old face that stamped her as their child .  potterley had let her talk .  there had been a time when he fought her too frequent preoccupation with the past and death .  laurel would not come back to them  either through dreams or through talk .  yet if it appeased caroline potterley let her dream and talk .  but when potterley went to school that morning  he found himself for once affected by caroline   s inanities .  laurel grown up .  she had died nearly twenty years ago  their only child  then and ever .  in all that time  when he thought of her  it was as a three year old .  now he thought  but if she were alive now  she wouldn   t be three  she   d be nearly twenty three .  helplessly  he found himself trying to think of laurel as growing progressively older  as finally becoming twenty three .  he did not quite succeed .  yet he tried .  laurel using make up .  laurel going out with boys .  laurel  getting married .  so it was that when he saw the young man hovering at the outskirts of the coldly circulating group of faculty men  it occurred to him quixotically that  for all he knew  a youngster just such as this might have married laurel .  that youngster himself  perhaps .   .   .   .  laurel might have met him  here at the university  or some evening when he might be invited to dinner at the potterleys    .  they might grow interested in one another .  laurel would surely have been pretty and this youngster looked well .  he was dark in coloring  with a lean intent face and an easy carriage .  the tenuous daydream snapped  yet potterley found himself staring foolishly at the young man  not as a strange face but as a possible son in law in the might have been .  he found himself threading his way toward the man .  it was almost a form of autohypnotism .  he put out his hand .     i am arnold potterley of the history department .  you   re new here  i think .     the youngster looked faintly astonished and fumbled with his drink  shifting it to his left hand in order to shake with his right .     jonas foster is my name  sir .  i   m a new instructor in physics .  i   m just starting this semester .     potterley nodded .     i wish you a happy stay here and great success .     that was the end of it  then .  potterley had come uneasily to his senses  found himself embarrassed and moved off .  he stared back over his shoulder once  but the illusion of relationship had gone .  reality was quite real once more and he was angry with himself for having fallen prey to his wife   s foolish talk about laurel .  but a week later  even while araman was talking  the thought of that young man had come back to him .  an instructor in physics .  a new instructor .  had he been deaf at the time .  was there a short circuit between ear and brain .  or was it an automatic self censorship because of the impending interview with the head of chronoscopy .  but the interview failed  and it was the thought of the young man with whom he had exchanged two sentences that prevented potterley from elaborating his pleas for consideration .  he was almost anxious to get away .  and in the autogiro express back to the university  he could almost wish he were superstitious .  he could then console himself with the thought that the casual meaningless meeting had really been directed by a knowing and purposeful fate .  jonas foster was not new to academic life .  the long and rickety struggle for the doctorate would make anyone a veteran .  additional work as a postdoctorate teaching fellow acted as a booster shot .  but now he was instructor jonas foster .  professorial dignity lay ahead .  and he now found himself in a new sort of relationship toward other professors .  for one thing  they would be voting on future promotions .  for another  he was in no position to tell so early in the game which particular member of the faculty might or might not have the ear of the dean or even of the university president .  he did not fancy himself as a campus politician and was sure he would make a poor one  yet there was no point in kicking his own rear into blisters just to prove that to himself .  so foster listened to this mild mannered historian who  in some vague way  seemed nevertheless to radiate tension  and did not shut him up abruptly and toss him out .  certainly that was his first impulse .  he remembered potterley well enough .  potterley had approached him at that tea  which had been a grizzly affair  .  the fellow had spoken two sentences to him stiffly  somehow glassy eyed  had then come to himself with a visible start and hurried off .  it had amused foster at the time  but now  .   .   .  potterley might have been deliberately trying to make his acquaintance  or  rather  to impress his own personality on foster as that of a queer sort of duck  eccentric but harmless .  he might now be probing foster   s views  searching for unsettling opinions .  surely  they ought to have done so before granting him his appointment .  still  .   .   .  potterley might be serious  might honestly not realize what he was doing .  or he might realize quite well what he was doing  he might be nothing more or less than a dangerous rascal .  foster mumbled     well  now     to gain time  and fished out a package of cigarettes  intending to offer one to potterley and to light it and one for himself very slowly .  but potterley said at once     please  dr .  foster .  no cigarettes .     foster looked startled .     i   m sorry  sir .        no .  the regrets are mine .  i cannot stand the odor .  an idiosyncrasy .  i   m sorry .     he was positively pale .  foster put away the cigarettes .  foster  feeling the absence of the cigarette  took the easy way out .     i   m flattered that you ask my advice and all that  dr .  potterley  but i   m not a neutrinics man .  i can   t very well do anything professional in that direction .  even stating an opinion would be out of line  and  frankly  i   d prefer that you didn   t go into any particulars .     the historian   s prim face set hard .     what do you mean  you   re not a neutrinics man .  you   re not anything yet .  you haven   t received any grant  have you .        this is only my first semester .        i know that .  i imagine you haven   t even applied for any grant yet .     foster half smiled .  in three months at the university  he had not succeeded in putting his initial requests for research grants into good enough shape to pass on to a professional science writer  let alone to the research commission .   his department head  fortunately  took it quite well .     take your time now  foster     he said     and get your thoughts well organized .  make sure you know your path and where it will lead  for  once you receive a grant  your specialization will be formally recognized and  for better or for worse  it will be yours for the rest of your career .     the advice was trite enough  but triteness has often the merit of truth  and foster recognized that .   foster said     by education and inclination  dr .  potterley  i   m a hyperoptics man with a gravities minor .  it   s how i described myself in applying for this position .  it may not be my official specialization yet  but it   s going to be .  it can   t be anything else .  as for neutrinics  i never even studied the subject .        why not .     demanded potterley at once .  foster stared .  it was the kind of rude curiosity about another man   s professional status that was always irritating .  he said  with the edge of his own politeness just a trifle blunted     a course in neutrinics wasn   t given at my university .        good lord  where did you go .        m . i . t .      said foster quietly .     and they don   t teach neutrinics .        no  they don   t .     foster felt himself flush and was moved to a defense .     it   s a highly specialized subject with no great value .  chronoscopy  perhaps  has some value  but it is the only practical application and that   s a dead end .     the historian stared at him earnestly .     tell me this .  do you know where i can find a neutrinics man .        no  i don   t     said foster bluntly .     well  then  do you know a school which teaches neutrinics .        no  i don   t .     potterley smiled tightly and without humor .  foster resented that smile  found he detected insult in it and grew sufficiently annoyed to say     i would like to point out  sir  that you   re stepping out of line .        what .        i   m saying that  as a historian  your interest in any sort of physics  your professional interest  is     he paused  unable to bring himself quite to say the word .     unethical .        that   s the word  dr .  potterley .        my researches have driven me to it     said potterley in an intense whisper .     the research commission is the place to go .  if they permit        i have gone to them and have received no satisfaction .        then obviously you must abandon this .     foster knew he was sounding stuffily virtuous  but he wasn   t going to let this man lure him into an expression of intellectual anarchy .  it was too early in his career to take stupid risks .  apparently  though  the remark had its effect on potterley .  without any warning  the man exploded into a rapid fire verbal storm of irresponsibility .  scholars  he said  could be free only if they could freely follow their own free swinging curiosity .  research  he said  forced into a predesigned pattern by the powers that held the purse strings became slavish and had to stagnate .  no man  he said  had the right to dictate the intellectual interests of another .  foster listened to all of it with disbelief .  none of it was strange to him .  he had heard college boys talk so in order to shock their professors and he had once or twice amused himself in that fashion  too .  anyone who studied the history of science knew that many men had once thought so .  yet it seemed strange to foster  almost against nature  that a modern man of science could advance such nonsense .  no one would advocate running a factory by allowing each individual worker to do whatever pleased him at the moment  or of running a ship according to the casual and conflicting notions of each individual crewman .  it would be taken for granted that some sort of centralized supervisory agency must exist in each case .  why should direction and order benefit a factory and a ship but not scientific research .  people might say that the human mind was somehow qualitatively different from a ship or factory but the history of intellectual endeavor proved the opposite .  when science was young and the intricacies of all or most of the known was within the grasp of an individual mind  there was no need for direction  perhaps .  blind wandering over the uncharted tracts of ignorance could lead to wonderful finds by accident .  but as knowledge grew  more and more data had to be absorbed before worthwhile journeys into ignorance could be organized .  men had to specialize .  the researcher needed the resources of a library he himself could not gather  then of instruments he himself could not afford .  more and more  the individual researcher gave way to the research team and the research institution .  the funds necessary for research grew greater as tools grew more numerous .  what college was so small today as not to require at least one nuclear micro reactor and at least one three stage computer .  centuries before  private individuals could no longer subsidize research .  by       only the government  large industries and large universities or research institutions could properly subsidize basic research .  by       even the largest universities depended entirely upon government grants  while research institutions could not exist without tax concessions and public subscriptions .  by       the industrial combines had become a branch of the world government and  thereafter  the financing of research and therefore its direction naturally became centralized under a department of the government .  it all worked itself out naturally and well .  every branch of science was fitted neatly to the needs of the public  and the various branches of science were co ordinated decently .  the material advance of the last half century was argument enough for the fact that science was not falling into stagnation .  foster tried to say a very little of this and was waved aside impatiently by potterley who said     you are parroting official propaganda .  you   re sitting in the middle of an example that   s squarely against the official view .  can you believe that .        frankly  no .        well  why do you say time viewing is a dead end .  why is neutrinics unimportant .  you say it is .  you say it categorically .  yet you   ve never studied it .  you claim complete ignorance of the subject .  it   s not even given in your school        isn   t the mere fact that it isn   t given proof enough .        oh  i see .  it   s not given because it   s unimportant .  and it   s unimportant because it   s not given .  are you satisfied with that reasoning .     foster felt a growing confusion .     it   s in the books .        that   s all .  the books say neutrinics is unimportant .  your professors tell you so because they read it in the books .  the books say so because professors write them .  who says it from personal experience and knowledge .  who does research in it .  do you know of anyone .     foster said     i don   t see that we   re getting anywhere  dr .  potterley .  i have work to do        one minute .  i just want you to try this on .  see how it sounds to you .  i say the government is actively suppressing basic research in neutrinics and chronoscopy .  they   re suppressing application of chronoscopy .        oh  no .        why not .  they could do it .  there   s your centrally directed research .  if they refuse grants for research in any portion of science  that portion dies .  they   ve killed neutrinics .  they can do it and have done it .        but why .        i don   t know why .  i want you to find out .  i   d do it myself if i knew enough .  i came to you because you   re a young fellow with a brand new education .  have your intellectual arteries hardened already .  is there no curiosity in you .  don   t you want to know .  don   t you want answers .     the historian was peering intently into foster   s face .  their noses were only inches apart  and foster was so lost that he did not think to draw back .  he should  by rights  have ordered potterley out .  if necessary  he should have thrown potterley out .  it was not respect for age and position that stopped him .  it was certainly not that potterley   s arguments had convinced him .  rather  it was a small point of college pride .  why didn   t m . i . t .  give a course in neutrinics .  for that matter  now that he came to think of it  he doubted that there was a single book on neutrinics in the library .  he could never recall having seen one .  he stopped to think about that .  and that was ruin .  caroline potterley had once been an attractive woman .  there were occasions  such as dinners or university functions  when  by considerable effort  remnants of the attraction could be salvaged .  on ordinary occasions  she sagged .  it was the word she applied to herself in moments of self abhorrence .  she had grown plumper with the years  but the flaccidity about her was not a matter of fat entirely .  it was as though her muscles had given up and grown limp so that she shuffled when she walked  while her eyes grew baggy and her cheeks jowly .  even her graying hair seemed tired rather than merely stringy .  its straightness seemed to be the result of a supine surrender to gravity  nothing else .  caroline potterley looked at herself in the mirror and admitted this was one of her bad days .  she knew the reason  too .  it had been the dream of laurel .  the strange one  with laurel grown up .  she had been wretched ever since .  still  she was sony she had mentioned it to arnold .  he didn   t say anything  he never did any more  but it was bad for him .  he was particularly withdrawn for days afterward .  it might have been that he was getting ready for that important conference with the big government official  he kept saying he expected no success   but it might also have been her dream .  it was better in the old days when he would cry sharply at her     let the dead past go  caroline .  talk won   t bring her back  and dreams won   t either .     it had been bad for both of them .  horribly bad .  she had been away from home and had lived in guilt ever since .  if she had stayed at home  if she had not gone on an unnecessary shopping expedition  there would have been two of them available .  one would have succeeded in saving laurel .  poor arnold had not managed .  heaven knew he tried .  he had nearly died himself .  he had come out of the burning house  staggering in agony  blistered  choking  half blinded  with the dead laurel in his arms .  the nightmare of that lived on  never lifting entirely .  arnold slowly grew a shell about himself afterward .  he cultivated a low voiced mildness through which nothing broke  no lightning struck .  he grew puritanical and even abandoned his minor vices  his cigarettes  his penchant for an occasional profane exclamation .  he obtained his grant for the preparation of a new history of carthage and subordinated everything to that .  she tried to help him .  she hunted up his references  typed his notes and microfilmed them .  then that ended suddenly .  she ran from the desk suddenly one evening  reaching the bathroom in bare time and retching abominably .  her husband followed her in confusion and concern .     caroline  what   s wrong .     it took a drop of brandy to bring her around .  she said     is it true .  what they did .        who did .        the carthaginians .     he stared at her and she got it out by indirection .  she couldn   t say it right out .  the carthaginians  it seemed  worshiped moloch  in the form of a hollow  brazen idol with a furnace in its belly .  at times of national crisis  the priests and the people gathered  and infants  after the proper ceremonies and invocations  were dextrously hurled  alive  into the flames .  they were given sweetmeats just before the crucial moment  in order that the efficacy of the sacrifice not be ruined by displeasing cries of panic .  the drums rolled just after the moment  to drown out the few seconds of infant shrieking .  the parents were present  presumably gratified  for the sacrifice was pleasing to the gods .   .   .   .  arnold potterley frowned darkly .  vicious lies  he told her  on the part of carthage   s enemies .  he should have warned her .  after all  such propagandistic lies were not uncommon .  according to the greeks  the ancient hebrews worshiped an ass   s head in their holy of holies .  according to the romans  the primitive christians were haters of all men who sacrificed pagan children in the catacombs .     then they didn   t do it .     asked caroline .     i   m sure they didn   t .  the primitive phoenicians may have .  human sacrifice is commonplace in primitive cultures .  but carthage in her great days was not a primitive culture .  human sacrifice often gives way to symbolic actions such as circumcision .  the greeks and romans might have mistaken some carthaginian symbolism for the original full rite  either out of ignorance or out of malice .        are you sure .        i can   t be sure yet  caroline  but when i   ve got enough evidence  i   ll apply for permission to use chronoscopy  which will settle the matter once and for all .        chronoscopy .        time viewing .  we can focus on ancient carthage at some time of crisis  the landing of scipio africanus in     b . c .   for instance  and see with our own eyes exactly what happens .  and you   ll see  i   ll be right .     he patted her and smiled encouragingly  but she dreamed of laurel every night for two weeks thereafter and she never helped him with his carthage project again .  nor did he ever ask her to .  but now she was bracing herself for his coming .  he had called her after arriving back in town  told her he had seen the government man and that it had gone as expected .  that meant failure  and yet the little telltale sign of depression had been absent from his voice and his features had appeared quite composed in the teleview .  he had another errand to take care of  he said  before coming home .  it meant he would be late  but that didn   t matter .  neither one of them was particular about eating hours or cared when packages were taken out of the freezer or even which packages or when the selfwarming mechanism was activated .  when he did arrive  he surprised her .  there was nothing untoward about him in any obvious way .  he kissed her dutifully and smiled  took off his hat and asked if all had been well while he was gone .  it was all almost perfectly normal .  almost .  she had learned to detect small things  though  and his pace in all this was a trifle hurried .  enough to show her accustomed eye that he was under tension .  she said     has something happened .     he said     we   re going to have a dinner guest night after next  caroline .  you don   t mind .        well  no .  is it anyone i know .        no .  a young instructor .  a newcomer .  i   ve spoken to him .     he suddenly whirled toward her and seized her arms at the elbow  held them a moment  then dropped them in confusion as though disconcerted at having shown emotion .  he said     i almost didn   t get through to him .  imagine that .  terrible  terrible  the way we have all bent to the yoke  the affection we have for the harness about us .     mrs .  potterley wasn   t sure she understood  but for a year she had been watching him grow quietly more rebellious  little by little more daring in his criticism of the government .  she said     you haven   t spoken foolishly to him  have you .        what do you mean  foolishly .  he   ll be doing some neutrinics for me .        neutrinics    was trisyllabic nonsense to mrs .  potterley  but she knew it had nothing to do with history .  she said faintly     arnold  i don   t like you to do that .  you   ll lose your position .  it   s        it   s intellectual anarchy  my dear     he said .     that   s the phrase you want .  very well .  i am an anarchist .  if the government will not allow me to push my researches  i will push them on my own .  and when i show the way  others will follow .   .   .   .  and if they don   t  it makes no difference .  it   s carthage that counts and human knowledge  not you and i .        but you don   t know this young man .  what if he is an agent for the commission of research .        not likely and i   ll take that chance .     he made a fist of his right hand and rubbed it gently against the palm of his left .     he   s on my side now .  i   m sure of it .  he can   t help but be .  i can recognize intellectual curiosity when i see it in a man   s eyes and face and attitude  and it   s a fatal disease for a tame scientist .  even today it takes time to beat it out of a man and the young ones are vulnerable .   .   .   .  oh  why stop at anything .  why not build our own chronoscope and tell the government to go to     he stopped abruptly  shook his head and turned away .     i hope everything will be all right     said mrs .  potterley  feeling helplessly certain that everything would not be  and frightened  in advance  for her husband   s professorial status and the security of their old age .  it was she alone  of them all  who had a violent presentiment of trouble .  quite the wrong trouble  of course .  jonas foster was nearly half an hour late in arriving at the potterleys    off campus house .  up to that very evening  he had not quite decided he would go .  then  at the last moment  he found he could not bring himself to commit the social enormity of breaking a dinner appointment an hour before the appointed time .  that  and the nagging of curiosity .  the dinner itself passed interminably .  foster ate without appetite .  mrs .  potterley sat in distant absent mindedness  emerging out of it only once to ask if he were married and to make a deprecating sound at the news that he was not .  dr .  potterley himself asked neutrally after his professional history and nodded his head primly .  it was as staid  stodgy boring  actually as anything could be .  foster thought  he seems so harmless .  foster had spent the last two days reading up on dr .  potterley .  very casually  of course  almost sneakily .  he wasn   t particularly anxious to be seen in the social science library .  to be sure  history was one of those borderline affairs and historical works were frequently read for amusement or edification by the general public .  still  a physicist wasn   t quite the    general public .     let foster take to reading histories and he would be considered queer  sure as relativity  and after a while the head of the department would wonder if his new instructor were really    the man for the job .     so he had been cautious .  he sat in the more secluded alcoves and kept his head bent when he slipped in and out at odd hours .  dr .  potterley  it turned out  had written three books and some dozen articles on the ancient mediterranean worlds  and the later articles  all in    historical reviews     had all dealt with pre roman carthage from a sympathetic viewpoint .  that  at least  checked with potterley   s story and had soothed foster   s suspicions somewhat .   .   .   .  and yet foster felt that it would have been much wiser  much safer  to have scotched the matter at the beginning .  a scientist shouldn   t be too curious  he thought in bitter dissatisfaction with himself .  it   s a dangerous trait .  after dinner  he was ushered into potterley   s study and he was brought up sharply at the threshold .  the walls were simply lined with books .  not merely films .  there were films  of course  but these were far outnumbered by the books print on paper .  he wouldn   t have thought so many books would exist in usable condition .  that bothered foster .  why should anyone want to keep so many books at home .  surely all were available in the university library  or  at the very worst  at the library of congress  if one wished to take the minor trouble of checking out a microfilm .  there was an element of secrecy involved in a home library .  it breathed of intellectual anarchy .  that last thought  oddly  calmed foster .  he would rather potterley be an authentic anarchist than a play acting agent provocateur .  and now the hours began to pass quickly and astonishingly .     you see     potterley said  in a clear  unflurried voice     it was a matter of finding  if possible  anyone who had ever used chronoscopy in his work .  naturally    couldn   t ask baldly  since that would be unauthorized research .        yes     said foster dryly .  he was a little surprised such a small consideration would stop the man .     i used indirect methods     he had .  foster was amazed at the volume of correspondence dealing with small disputed points of ancient mediterranean culture which somehow managed to elicit the casual remark over and over again     of course  having never made use of chronoscopy     or     pending approval of my request for chronoscopic data  which appear unlikely at the moment        now these aren   t blind questionings     said potterley .     there   s a monthly booklet put out by the institute for chronoscopy in which items concerning the past as determined by time viewing are printed .  just one or two items .     what impressed me first was the triviality of most of the items  their insipidity .  why should such researches get priority over my work .  so i wrote to people who would be most likely to do research in the directions described in the booklet .  uniformly  as i have shown you  they did not make use of the chronoscope .  now let   s go over it point by point .     at last foster  his head swimming with potterley   s meticulously gathered details  asked     but why .        i don   t know why     said potterley     but i have a theory .  the original invention of the chronoscope was by sterbinski you see  i know that much  and it was well publicized .  but then the government took over the instrument and decided to suppress further research in the matter or any use of the machine .  but then  people might be curious as to why it wasn   t being used .  curiosity is such a vice  dr .  foster .     yes  agreed the physicist to himself .     imagine the effectiveness  then     potterley went on     of pretending that the chronoscope was being used .  it would then be not a mystery  but a commonplace .  it would no longer be a fitting object for legitimate curiosity or an attractive one for illicit curiosity .        you were curious     pointed out foster .  potterley looked a trifle restless .     it was different in my case     he said angrily .     i have something that must be done  and i wouldn   t submit to the ridiculous way in which they kept putting me off .     a bit paranoid  too  thought foster gloomily .  yet he had ended up with something  paranoid or not .  foster could no longer deny that something peculiar was going on in the matter of neutrinics .  but what was potterley after .  that still bothered foster .  if potterley didn   t intend this as a test of foster   s ethics  what did he want .  foster put it to himself logically .  if an intellectual anarchist with a touch of paranoia wanted to use a chronoscope and was convinced that the powers that be were deliberately standing in his way  what would he do .  supposing it were i  he thought .  what would i do .  he said slowly     maybe the chronoscope doesn   t exist at all .     potterley started .  there was almost a crack in his general calmness .  for an instant  foster found himself catching a glimpse of something not at all calm .  but the historian kept his balance and said     oh  no  there must be a chronoscope .        why .  have you seen it .  have i .  maybe that   s the explanation of everything .  maybe they   re not deliberately holding out on a chronoscope they   ve got .  maybe they haven   t got it in the first place .        but sterbinski lived .  he built a chronoscope .  that much is a fact .        the books say so     said foster coldly .     now listen .     potterley actually reached over and snatched at foster   s jacket sleeve .     i need the chronoscope .  i must have it .  don   t tell me it doesn   t exist .  what we   re going to do is find out enough about neutrinics to be able to     potterley drew himself up short .  foster drew his sleeve away .  he needed no ending to that sentence .  he supplied it himself .  he said     build one of our own .     potterley looked sour as though he would rather not have said it point blank .  nevertheless  he said     why not .        because that   s out of the question     said foster .     if what i   ve read is correct  then it took sterbinski twenty years to build his machine and several millions in composite grants .  do you think you and i can duplicate that illegally .  suppose we had the time  which we haven   t  and suppose i could learn enough out of books  which i doubt  where would we get the money and equipment .  the chronoscope is supposed to fill a five story building  for heaven   s sake .        then you won   t help me .        well  i   ll tell you what .  i have one way in which i may be able to find out something        what is that .     asked potterley at once .     never mind .  that   s not important .  but i may be able to find out enough to tell you whether the government is deliberately suppressing research by chronoscope .  i may confirm the evidence you already have or i may be able to prove that your evidence is misleading .  i don   t know what good it will do you in either case  but it   s as far as i can go .  it   s my limit .     potterley watched the young man go finally .  he was angry with himself .  why had he allowed himself to grow so careless as to permit the fellow to guess that he was thinking in terms of a chronoscope of his own .  that was premature .  but then why did the young fool have to suppose that a chronoscope might not exist at all .  it had to exist .  it had to .  what was the use of saying it didn   t .  and why couldn   t a second one be built .  science had advanced in the fifty years since sterbinski .  all that was needed was knowledge .  let the youngster gather knowledge .  let him think a small gathering would be his limit .  having taken the path to anarchy  there would be no limit .  if the boy were not driven onward by something in himself  the first steps would be error enough to force the rest .  potterley was quite certain he would not hesitate to use blackmail .  potterley waved a last good by and looked up .  it was beginning to rain .  certainly .  blackmail if necessary  but he would not be stopped .  foster steered his car across the bleak outskirts of town and scarcely noticed the rain .  he was a fool  he told himself  but he couldn   t leave things as they were .  he had to know .  he damned his streak of undisciplined curiosity  but he had to know .  but he would go no further than uncle ralph .  he swore mightily to himself that it would stop there .  in that way  there would be no evidence against him  no real evidence .  uncle ralph would be discreet .  in a way  he was secretly ashamed of uncle ralph .  he hadn   t mentioned him to potterley partly out of caution and partly because he did not wish to witness the lifted eyebrow  the inevitable half smile .  professional science writers  however useful  were a little outside the pale  fit only for patronizing contempt .  the fact that  as a class  they made more money than did research scientists only made matters worse  of course .  still  there were times when a science writer in the family could be a convenience .  not being really educated  they did not have to specialize .  consequently  a good science writer knew practically everything .   .   .   .  and uncle ralph was one of the best .  ralph nimmo had no college degree and was rather proud of it .     a degree     he once said to jonas foster  when both were considerably younger     is a first step down a ruinous highway .  you don   t want to waste it so you go on to graduate work and doctoral research .  you end up a thoroughgoing ignoramus on everything in the world except for one subdivisional sliver of nothing .     on the other hand  if you guard your mind carefully and keep it blank of any clutter of information till maturity is reached  filling it only with intelligence and training it only in clear thinking  you then have a powerful instrument at your disposal and you can become a science writer .     nimmo received his first assignment at the age of twenty five  after he had completed his apprenticeship and been out in the field for less than three months .  it came in the shape of a clotted manuscript whose language would impart no glimmering of understanding to any reader  however qualified  without careful study and some inspired guesswork .  nimmo took it apart and put it together again  after five long and exasperating interviews with the authors  who were biophysicists   making the language taut and meaningful and smoothing the style to a pleasant gloss .     why not .     he would say tolerantly to his nephew  who countered his strictures on degrees by berating him with his readiness to hang on the fringes of science .     the fringe is important .  your scientists can   t write .  why should they be expected to .  they aren   t expected to be grand masters at chess or virtuosos at the violin  so why expect them to know how to put words together .  why not leave that for specialists  too .        good lord  jonas  read your literature of a hundred years ago .  discount the fact that the science is out of date and that some of the expressions are out of date .  just try to read it and make sense out of it .  it   s just jaw cracking  amateurish .  pages are published uselessly  whole articles which are either noncomprehensible or both .        but you don   t get recognition  uncle ralph     protested young foster  who was getting ready to start his college career and was rather starry eyed about it .     you could be a terrific researcher .        i get recognition     said nimmo .     don   t think for a minute i don   t .  sure  a biochemist or a strato meteorologist won   t give me the time of day  but they pay me well enough .  just find out what happens when some first class   chemist finds the commission has cut his year   s allowance for science writing .  he   ll fight harder for enough funds to afford me  or someone like me    than to get a recording ionograph .     he grinned broadly and foster grinned back .  actually  he was proud of his paunchy  round faced  stub fingered uncle  whose vanity made him brush his fringe of hair futilely over the desert on his pate and made him dress like an unmade haystack because such negligence was his trademark .  ashamed  but proud  too .  and now foster entered his uncle   s cluttered apartment in no mood at all for grinning .  he was nine years older now and so was uncle ralph .  for nine more years  papers in every branch of science had come to him for polishing and a little of each had crept into his capacious mind .  nimmo was eating seedless grapes  popping them into his mouth one at a time .  he tossed a bunch to foster who caught them by a hair  then bent to retrieve individual grapes that had torn loose and fallen to the floor .     let them be .  don   t bother     said nimmo carelessly .     someone comes in here to clean once a week .  what   s up .  having trouble with your grant application write up .        i haven   t really got into that yet .        you haven   t .  get a move on  boy .  are you waiting for me to offer to do the final arrangement .        i couldn   t afford you  uncle .        aw  come on .  it   s all in the family .  grant me all popular publication rights and no cash need change hands .     foster nodded .     if you   re serious  it   s a deal .        it   s a deal .     it was a gamble  of course  but foster knew enough of nimmo   s science writing to realize it could pay off .  some dramatic discovery of public interest on primitive man or on a new surgical technique  or on any branch of spationautics could mean a very cash attracting article in any of the mass media of communication .  it was nimmo  for instance  who had written up  for scientific consumption  the series of papers by bryce and co workers that elucidated the fine structure of two cancer viruses  for which job he asked the picayune payment of fifteen hundred dollars  provided popular publication rights were included .  he then wrote up  exclusively  the same work in semidramatic form for use in trimensional video for a twenty thousand dollar advance plus rental royalties that were still coming in after five years .  foster said bluntly     what do you know about neutrinics  uncle .        neutrinics .     nimmo   s small eyes looked surprised .     are you working in that .  i thought it was pseudo gravitic optics .        it is p . g . o .  i just happen to be asking about neutrinics .        that   s a devil of a thing to be doing .  you   re stepping out of line .  you know that  don   t you .        i don   t expect you to call the commission because i   m a little curious about things .        maybe i should before you get into trouble .  curiosity is an occupational danger with scientists .  i   ve watched it work .  one of them will be moving quietly along on a problem  then curiosity leads him up a strange creek .  next thing you know they   ve done so little on their proper problem  they can   t justify for a project renewal .  i   ve seen more        all i want to know     said foster patiently     is what   s been passing through your hands lately on neutrinics .     nimmo leaned back  chewing at a grape thoughtfully .     nothing .  nothing ever .  i don   t recall ever getting a paper on neutrinics .        what .     foster was openly astonished .     then who does get the work .        now that you ask     said nimmo     i don   t know .  don   t recall anyone talking about it at the annual conventions .  i don   t think much work is being done there .        why not .        hey  there  don   t bark .  i   m not doing anything .  my guess would be     foster was exasperated .     don   t you know .        hmp .  i   ll tell you what i know about neutrinics .  it concerns the applications of neutrino movements and the forces involved        sure .  sure .  just as electronics deals with the applications of electron movements and the forces involved  and pseudo gravities deals with the applications of artificial gravitational fields .  i didn   t come to you for that .  is that all you know .        and     said nimmo with equanimity     neutrinics is the basis of time viewing and that is all i know .     foster slouched back in his chair and massaged one lean cheek with great intensity .  he felt angrily dissatisfied .  without formulating it explicitly in his own mind  he had felt sure  somehow  that nimmo would come up with some late reports  bring up interesting facets of modern neutrinics  send him back to potterley able to say that the elderly historian was mistaken  that his data was misleading  his deductions mistaken .  then he could have returned to his proper work .  but now  .   .   .  he told himself angrily  so they   re not doing much work in the field .  does that make it deliberate suppression .  what if neutrinics is a sterile discipline .  maybe it is .  i don   t know .  potterley doesn   t .  why waste the intellectual resources of humanity on nothing .  or the work might be secret for some legitimate reason .  it might be  .  .  .  the trouble was  he had to know .  he couldn   t leave things as they were now .  he couldn   t .  he said     is there a text on neutrinics  uncle ralph .  i mean a clear and simple one .  an elementary one .     nimmo thought  his plump cheeks puffing out with a series of sighs .     you ask the damnedest questions .  the only one i ever heard of was sterbinski and somebody .  i   ve never seen it  but i viewed something about it once .   .   .   .  sterbinski and lamarr  that   s it .        is that the sterbinski who invented the chronoscope .     i    i think so .  proves the book ought to be good .            is there a recent edition .  sterbinski died thirty years ago .     nimmo shrugged and said nothing .     can you find out .     they sat in silence for a moment  while nimmo shifted his bulk to the creaking tune of the chair he sat on .  then the science writer said     are you going to tell me what this is all about .        i can   t .  will you help me anyway  uncle ralph .  will you get me a copy of the text .        well  you   ve taught me all i know on pseudo gravities .  i should be grateful .  tell you what i   ll help you on one condition .        which is .     the older man was suddenly very grave .     that you be careful  jonas .  you   re obviously way out of line whatever you   re doing .  don   t blow up your career just because you   re curious about something you haven   t been assigned to and which is none of your business .  understand .     foster nodded  but he hardly heard .  he was thinking furiously .  a full week later  ralph nimmo eased his rotund figure into jonas foster   s on campus two room combination and said  in a hoarse whisper     i   ve got something .        what .     foster was immediately eager .     a copy of sterbinski and lamarr .     he produced it  or rather a corner of it  from his ample topcoat .  foster almost automatically eyed door and windows to make sure they were closed and shaded respectively  then held out his hand .  the film case was flaking with age  and when he cracked it the film was faded and growing brittle .  he said sharply     is this all .        gratitude  my boy  gratitude .     nimmo sat down with a grunt  and reached into a pocket for an apple .     oh  i   m grateful  but it   s so old .        and lucky to get it at that .    tried to get a film run from the congressional library .  no go .  the book was restricted .        then how did you get this .        stole it .     he was biting crunchingly around the core .     new york public .        what .        simple enough .  i had access to the stacks  naturally .  so i stepped over a chained railing when no one was around  dug this up  and walked out with it .  they   re very trusting out there .  meanwhile  they won   t miss it in years .   .   .   .  only you   d better not let anyone see it on you  nephew .     foster stared at the film as though it were literally hot .  nimmo discarded the core and reached for a second apple .     funny thing  now .  there   s nothing more recent in the whole field of neutrinics .  not a monograph  not a paper  not a progress note .  nothing since the chrono scope .        uh huh     said foster absently .  foster worked evenings in the potterley home .  he could not trust his own on campus rooms for the purpose .  the evening work grew more real to him than his own grant applications .  sometimes he worried about it but then that stopped  too .  his work consisted  at first  simply in viewing and reviewing the text film .  later it consisted in thinking  sometimes while a section of the book ran itself off through the pocket projector  disregarded  .  sometimes potterley would come down to watch  to sit with prim  eager eyes  as though he expected thought processes to solidify and become visible in all their convolutions .  he interfered in only two ways .  he did not allow foster to smoke and sometimes he talked .  it wasn   t conversation talk  never that .  rather it was a low voiced monologue with which  it seemed  he scarcely expected to command attention .  it was much more as though he were relieving a pressure within himself .  carthage .  always carthage .  carthage  the new york of the ancient mediterranean .  carthage  commercial empire and queen of the seas .  carthage  all that syracuse and alexandria pretended to be .  carthage  maligned by her enemies and inarticulate in her own defense .  she had been defeated once by rome and then driven out of sicily and sardinia  but came back to more than recoup her losses by new dominions in spain  and raised up hannibal to give the romans sixteen years of terror .  in the end  she lost again a second time  reconciled herself to fate and built again with broken tools a limping life in shrunken territory  succeeding so well that jealous rome deliberately forced a third war .  and then carthage  with nothing but bare hands and tenacity  built weapons and forced rome into a two year war that ended only with complete destruction of the city  the inhabitants throwing themselves into their flaming houses rather than surrender .     could people fight so for a city and a way of life as bad as the ancient writers painted it .  hannibal was a better general than any roman and his soldiers were absolutely faithful to him .  even his bitterest enemies praised him .  there was a carthaginian .  it is fashionable to say that he was an atypical carthaginian  better than the others  a diamond placed in garbage .  but then why was he so faithful to carthage  even to his death after years of exile .  they talk of moloch     foster didn   t always listen but sometimes he couldn   t help himself and he shuddered and turned sick at the bloody tale of child sacrifice .  but potterley went on earnestly     just the same  it isn   t true .  it   s a twenty five hundred year old canard started by the greeks and romans .  they had their own slaves  their crucifixions and torture  their gladiatorial contests .  they weren   t holy .  the moloch story is what later ages would have called war propaganda  the big lie .  i can prove it was a lie .  i can prove it and  by heaven  i will i will     he would mumble that promise over and over again in his earnestness .  mrs .  potterley visited him also  but less frequently  usually on tuesdays and thursdays when dr .  potterley himself had an evening course to take care of and was not present .  she would sit quietly  scarcely talking  face slack and doughy  eyes blank  her whole attitude distant and withdrawn .  the first time  foster tried  uneasily  to suggest that she leave .  she said tonelessly     do i disturb you .        no  of course not     lied foster restlessly .     it   s just that that     he couldn   t complete the sentence .  she nodded  as though accepting an invitation to stay .  then she opened a cloth bag she had brought with her and took out a quire of vitron sheets which she proceeded to weave together by rapid  delicate movements of a pair of slender  tetra faceted depolarizers  whose battery fed wires made her look as though she were holding a large spider .  one evening  she said softly     my daughter  laurel  is your age .     foster started  as much at the sudden unexpected sound of speech as at the words .  he said     i didn   t know you had a daughter  mrs .  potterley .        she died .  years ago .     the vitron grew under the deft manipulations into the uneven shape of some garment foster could not yet identify .  there was nothing left for him to do but mutter inanely     i   m sorry .     mrs .  potterley sighed .     i dream about her often .     she raised her blue  distant eyes to him .  foster winced and looked away .  another evening she asked  pulling at one of the vitron sheets to loosen its gentle clinging to her dress     what is time viewing anyway .     that remark broke into a particularly involved chain of thought  and foster said snappishly     dr .  potterley can explain .        he   s tried to .  oh  my  yes .  but i think he   s a little impatient with me .  he calls it chronoscopy most of the time .  do you actually see things in the past  like the trimensionals .  or does it just make little dot patterns like the computer you use .     foster stared at his hand computer with distaste .  it worked well enough  but every operation had to be manually controlled and the answers were obtained in code .  now if he could use the school computer  .   .   .  well  why dream  he felt conspicuous enough  as it was  carrying a hand computer under his arm every evening as he left his office .  he said     i   ve never seen the chronoscope myself  but i   m under the impression that you actually see pictures and hear sound .        you can hear people talk  too .        i think so .     then  half in desperation     look here  mrs .  potterley  this must be awfully dull for you .  i realize you don   t like to leave a guest all to himself  but really  mrs .  potterley  you mustn   t feel compelled        i don   t feel compelled     she said .     i   m sitting here  waiting .        waiting .  for what .     she said composedly     i listened to you that first evening .  the time you first spoke to arnold .  i listened at the door .     he said     you did .        i know i shouldn   t have  but i was awfully worried about arnold .  i had a notion he was going to do something he oughtn   t and i wanted to hear what .  and then when i heard     she paused  bending close over the vitron and peering at it .     heard what  mrs .  potterley .        that you wouldn   t build a chronoscope .        well  of course not .        i thought maybe you might change your mind .     foster glared at her .     do you mean you   re coming down here hoping i   ll build a chronoscope  waiting for me to build one .     i    i hope you do  dr .  foster .  oh  i hope you do .     it was as though  all at once  a fuzzy veil had fallen off her face  leaving all her features clear and sharp  putting color into her cheeks  life into her eyes  the vibrations of something approaching excitement into her voice .     wouldn   t it be wonderful     she whispered     to have one .  people of the past could live again .  pharaohs and kings and just people .  i hope you build one  dr .  foster .  i really hope     she choked  it seemed  on the intensity of her own words and let the vitron sheets slip off her lap .  she rose and ran up the basement stairs  while foster   s eyes followed her awkwardly fleeing body with astonishment and distress .  it cut deeper into foster   s nights and left him sleepless and painfully stiff with thought .  it was almost a mental indigestion .  his grant requests went limping in  finally  to ralph nimmo .  he scarcely had any hope for them .  he thought numbly  they won   t be approved .  if they weren   t  of course  it would create a scandal in the department and probably mean his appointment at the university would not be renewed  come the end of the academic year .  he scarcely worried .  it was the neutrino  the neutrino  only the neutrino .  its trail curved and veered sharply and led him breathlessly along uncharted pathways that even sterbinski and lamarr did not follow .  he called nimmo .     uncle ralph  i need a few things .  i   m calling from off the campus .     nimmo   s face in the video plate was jovial  but his voice was sharp .  he said     what you need is a course in communication .  i   m having a hell of a time pulling your application into one intelligible piece .  if that   s what you   re calling about     foster shook his head impatiently .     that   s not what i   m calling about .  i need these .     he scribbled quickly on a piece of paper and held it up before the receiver .  nimmo yiped .     hey  how many tricks do you think i can wangle .        you can get them  uncle .  you know you can .     nimmo reread the list of items with silent motions of his plump lips and looked grave .     what happens when you put those things together .     he asked .  foster shook his head .     you   ll have exclusive popular publication rights to whatever turns up  the way it   s always been .  but please don   t ask any questions now .        i can   t do miracles  you know .        do this one .  you   ve got to .  you   re a science writer  not a research man .  you don   t have to account for anything .  you   ve got friends and connections .  they can look the other way  can   t they  to get a break from you next publication time .        your faith  nephew  is touching .  i   ll try .     nimmo succeeded .  the material and equipment were brought over late one evening in a private touring car .  nimmo and foster lugged it in with the grunting of men unused to manual labor .  potterley stood at the entrance of the basement after nimmo had left .  he asked softly     what   s this for .     foster brushed the hair off his forehead and gently massaged a sprained wrist .  he said     i want to conduct a few simple experiments .        really .     the historian   s eyes glittered with excitement .  foster felt exploited .  he felt as though he were being led along a dangerous highway by the pull of pinching fingers on his nose  as though he could see the ruin clearly that lay in wait at the end of the path  yet walked eagerly and determinedly .  worst of all  he felt the compelling grip on his nose to be his own .  it was potterley who began it  potterley who stood there now  gloating  but the compulsion was his own .  foster said sourly     i   ll be wanting privacy now  potterley .  i can   t have you and your wife running down here and annoying me .     he thought  if that offends him  let him kick me out .  let him put an end to this .  in his heart  though  he did not think being evicted would stop anything .  but it did not come to that .  potterley was showing no signs of offense .  his mild gaze was unchanged .  he said     of course  dr .  foster  of course .  all the privacy you wish .     foster watched him go .  he was left still marching along the highway  perversely glad of it and hating himself for being glad .  he took to sleeping over on a cot in potterley   s basement and spending his weekends there entirely .  during that period  preliminary word came through that his grants  as doctored by nimmo  had been approved .  the department head brought the word and congratulated him .  foster stared back distantly and mumbled     good .  i   m glad     with so little conviction that the other frowned and turned away without another word .  foster gave the matter no further thought .  it was a minor point  worth no notice .  he was planning something that really counted  a climactic test for that evening .  one evening  a second and third and then  haggard and half beside himself with excitement  he called in potterley .  potterley came down the stairs and looked about at the homemade gadgetry .  he said  in his soft voice     the electric bills are quite high .  i don   t mind the expense  but the city may ask questions .  can anything be done .     it was a warm evening  but potterley wore a tight collar and a semijacket .  foster  who was in his undershirt  lifted bleary eyes and said shakily     it won   t be for much longer  dr .  potterley .  i   ve called you down to tell you something .  a chronoscope can be built .  a small one  of course  but it can be built .     potterley seized the railing .  his body sagged .  he managed a whisper .     can it be built here .        here in the basement     said foster wearily .     good lord .  you said        i know what i said     cried foster impatiently .     i said it couldn   t be done .  i didn   t know anything then .  even sterbinski didn   t know anything .     potterley shook his head .     are you sure .  you   re not mistaken  dr .  foster .  i couldn   t endure it if     foster said     i   m not mistaken .  damn it  sir  if just theory had been enough  we could have had a time viewer over a hundred years ago  when the neutrino was first postulated .  the trouble was  the original investigators considered it only a mysterious particle without mass or charge that could not be detected .  it was just something to even up the bookkeeping and save the law of conservation of mass energy .     he wasn   t sure potterley knew what he was talking about .  he didn   t care .  he needed a breather .  he had to get some of this out of his clotting thoughts .   .   .   .  and he needed background for what he would have to tell potterley next .  he went on .     it was sterbinski who first discovered that the neutrino broke through the space time cross sectional barrier  that it traveled through time as well as through space .  it was sterbinski who first devised a method for stopping neutrinos .  he invented a neutrino recorder and learned how to interpret the pattern of the neutrino stream .  naturally  the stream had been affected and deflected by all the matter it had passed through in its passage through time  and the deflections could be analyzed and converted into the images of the matter that had done the deflecting .  time viewing was possible .  even air vibrations could be detected in this way and converted into sound .     potterley was definitely not listening .  he said     yes .  yes .  but when can you build a chronoscope .     foster said urgently     let me finish .  everything depends on the method used to detect and analyze the neutrino stream .  sterbinski   s method was difficult and roundabout .  it required mountains of energy .  but i   ve studied pseudo gravities  dr .  potterley  the science of artificial gravitational fields .  i   ve specialized in the behavior of light in such fields .  it   s a new science .  sterbinski knew nothing of it .  if he had  he would have seen anyone would have a much better and more efficient method of detecting neutrinos using a pseudo gravitic field .  if i had known more neutrinics to begin with  i would have seen it at once .     potterley brightened a bit .     i knew it     he said .     even if they stop research in neutrinics there is no way the government can be sure that discoveries in other segments of science won   t reflect knowledge on neutrinics .  so much for the value of centralized direction of science .    thought this long ago  dr .  foster  before you ever came to work here .        i congratulate you on that     said foster     but there   s one thing        oh  never mind all this .  answer me .  please .  when can you build a chronoscope .        i   m trying to tell you something  dr .  potterley .  a chronoscope won   t do you any good .      this is it  foster thought .   slowly  potterley descended the stairs .  he stood facing foster .     what do you mean .  why won   t it help me .        you won   t see carthage .  it   s what i   ve got to tell you .  it   s what i   ve been leading up to .  you can never see carthage .     potterley shook his head slightly .     oh  no  you   re wrong .  if you have the chronoscope  just focus it properly        no  dr .  potterley .  it   s not a question of focus .  there are random factors affecting the neutrino stream  as they affect all subatomic particles .  what we call the uncertainty principle .  when the stream is recorded and interpreted  the random factor comes out as fuzziness  or    noise    as the communications boys speak of it .  the further back in time you penetrate  the more pronounced the fuzziness  the greater the noise .  after a while  the noise drowns out the picture .  do you understand .        more power     said potterley in a dead kind of voice .     that won   t help .  when the noise blurs out detail  magnifying detail magnifies the noise  too .  you can   t see anything in a sun burned film by enlarging it  can you .  get this through your head  now .  the physical nature of the universe sets limits .  the random thermal motions of air molecules set limits to how weak a sound can be detected by any instrument .  the length of a light wave or of an electron wave sets limits to the size of objects that can be seen by any instrument .  it works that way in chronoscopy  too .  you can only time view so far .        how far .  how far .     foster took a deep breath .     a century and a quarter .  that   s the most .        but the monthly bulletin the commission puts out deals with ancient history almost entirely .     the historian laughed shakily .     you must be wrong .  the government has data as far back as      b . c .        when did you switch to believing them .     demanded foster  scornfully .     you began this business by proving they were lying  that no historian had made use of the chronoscope .  don   t you see why now .  no historian  except one interested in contemporary history  could .  no chronoscope can possibly see back in time further than      under any conditions .        you   re wrong .  you don   t know everything     said potterley .     the truth won   t bend itself to your convenience either .  face it .  the government   s part in this is to perpetuate a hoax .        why .        i don   t know why .     potterley   s snubby nose was twitching .  his eyes were bulging .  he pleaded     it   s only theory  dr .  foster .  build a chronoscope .  build one and try .     foster caught potterley   s shoulders in a sudden  fierce grip .     do you think i haven   t .  do you think i would tell you this before i had checked it every way i knew .  i have built one .  it   s all around you .  look .     he ran to the switches at the power leads .  he flicked them on  one by one .  he turned a resistor  adjusted other knobs  put out the cellar lights .     wait .  let it warm up .     there was a small glow near the center of one wall .  potterley was gibbering incoherently  but foster only cried again     look .     the light sharpened and brightened  broke up into a light and dark pattern .  men and women .  fuzzy .  features blurred .  arms and legs mere streaks .  an old fashioned ground car  unclear but recognizable as one of the kind that had once used gasoline powered internal combustion engines  sped by .  foster said     mid twentieth century  somewhere .  i can   t hook up an audio yet so this is soundless .  eventually  we can add sound .  anyway  mid twentieth is almost as far back as you can go .  believe me  that   s the best focusing that can be done .     potterley said     build a larger machine  a stronger one .  improve your circuits .        you can   t lick the uncertainty principle  man  any more than you can live on the sun .  there are physical limits to what can be done .        you   re lying .  i won   t believe you .  i     a new voice sounded  raised shrilly to make itself heard .     arnold .  dr .  foster .     the young physicist turned at once .  dr .  potterley froze for a long moment  then said  without turning     what is it  caroline .  leave us .        no .     mrs .  potterley descended the stairs .     i heard .  i couldn   t help hearing .  do you have a time viewer here  dr .  foster .  here in the basement .        yes  i do  mrs .  potterley .  a kind of time viewer .  not a good one .  i can   t get sound yet and the picture is darned blurry  but it works .     mrs .  potterley clasped her hands and held them tightly against her breast .     how wonderful .  how wonderful .        it   s not at all wonderful     snapped potterley .     the young fool can   t reach further back than        now  look     began foster in exasperation .   .   .   .     please .     cried mrs .  potterley .     listen to me .  arnold  don   t you see that as long as we can use it for twenty years back  we can see laurel once again .  what do we care about carthage and ancient times .  it   s laurel we can see .  she   ll be alive for us again .  leave the machine here  dr .  foster .  show us how to work it .     foster stared at her then at her husband .  dr .  potterley   s face had gone white .  though his voice stayed low and even  its calmness was somehow gone .  he said     you   re a fool .     caroline said weakly     arnold .        you   re a fool  i say .  what will you see .  the past .  the dead past .  will laurel do one thing she did not do .  will you see one thing you haven   t seen .  will you live three years over and over again  watching a baby who   ll never grow up no matter how you watch .     his voice came near to cracking  but held .  he stopped closer to her  seized her shoulder and shook her roughly .     do you know what will happen to you if you do that .  they   ll come to take you away because you   ll go mad .  yes  mad .  do you want mental treatment .  do you want to be shut up  to undergo the psychic probe .     mrs .  potterley tore away .  there was no trace of softness or vagueness about her .  she had twisted into a virago .     i want to see my child  arnold .  she   s in that machine and i want her .        she   s not in the machine .  an image is .  can   t you understand .  an image .  something that   s not real .        i want my child .  do you hear me .     she flew at him  screaming  fists beating .     i want my child .     the historian retreated at the fury of the assault  crying out .  foster moved to step between  when mrs .  potterley dropped  sobbing wildly  to the floor .  potterley turned  eyes desperately seeking .  with a sudden heave  he snatched at a lando rod  tearing it from its support  and whirling away before foster  numbed by all that was taking place  could move to stop him .     stand back .     gasped potterley     or i   ll kill you .  i swear it .     he swung with force  and foster jumped back .  potterley turned with fury on every part of the structure in the cellar  and foster  after the first crash of glass  watched dazedly .  potterley spent his rage and then he was standing quietly amid shards and splinters  with a broken lando rod in his hand .  he said to foster in a whisper     now get out of here .  never come back .  if any of this cost you anything  send me a bill and i   ll pay for it .  i   ll pay double .     foster shrugged  picked up his shirt and moved up the basement stairs .  he could hear mrs .  potterley sobbing loudly  and  as he turned at the head of the stairs for a last look  he saw dr .  potterley bending over her  his face convulsed with sorrow .  two days later  with the school day drawing to a close  and foster looking wearily about to see if there were any data on his newly approved projects that he wished to take home  dr .  potterley appeared once more .  he was standing at the open door of foster   s office .  the historian was neatly dressed as ever .  he lifted his hand in a gesture that was too vague to be a greeting  too abortive to be a plea .  foster stared stonily .  potterley said     i waited till five  till you were  .   .   .  may i come in .     foster nodded .  potterley said     i suppose i ought to apologize for my behavior .  i was dreadfully disappointed  not quite master of myself .  still  it was inexcusable .        i accept your apology     said foster .     is that all .        my wife called you  i think .        yes  she has .        she has been quite hysterical .  she told me she had but i couldn   t be quite sure        could you tell me would you be so kind as to tell me what she wanted .        she wanted a chronoscope .  she said she had some money of her own .  she was willing to pay .        did you make any commitments .        i said i wasn   t in the manufacturing business .        good     breathed potterley  his chest expanding with a sigh of relief .        please don   t take any calls from her .  she   s not quite        look  dr .  potterfey     said foster     i   m not getting into any domestic quarrels  but you   d better be prepared for something .  chronoscopes can be built by anybody given a few simple parts that can be bought through some etherics sales center  it can be built in the home workshop .  the video part  anyway .        but no one else will think of it beside you  will they .  no one has .        i don   t intend to keep it secret .        but you can   t publish .  it   s illegal research .        that doesn   t matter any more  dr .  potterley .  if i lose my grants  i lose them .  if the university is displeased  i   ll resign .  it just doesn   t matter .        but you can   t do that .        till now     said foster     you didn   t mind my risking loss of grants and position .  why do you turn so tender about it now .  now let me explain something to you .  when you first came to me  i believed in organized and directed research  the situation as it existed  in other words .  i considered you an intellectual anarchist  dr .  potterley  and dangerous .  but  for one reason or another  i   ve been an anarchist myself for months now and i have achieved great things .     those things have been achieved not because i am a brilliant scientist .  not at all .  it was just that scientific research had been directed from above and holes were left that could be filled in by anyone who looked in the right direction .  and anyone might have if the government hadn   t actively tried to prevent it .     now understand me .  i still believe directed research can be useful .  i   m not in favor of a retreat to total anarchy .  but there must be a middle ground .  directed research can retain flexibility .  a scientist must be allowed to follow his curiosity  at least in his spare time .     potterley sat down .  he said ingratiatingly     let   s discuss this  foster .  i appreciate your idealism .  you   re young .  you want the moon .  but you can   t destroy yourself through fancy notions of what research must consist of .  i got you into this .  i am responsible and i blame myself bitterly .  i was acting emotionally .  my interest in carthage blinded me and i was a damned fool .     foster broke in .     you mean you   ve changed completely in two days .  carthage is nothing .  government suppression of research is nothing .        even a damned fool like myself can learn  foster .  my wife taught me something .  i understand the reason for government suppression of neutrinics now .  i didn   t two days ago .  and  understanding  i approve .  you saw the way my wife reacted to the news of a chronoscope in the basement .  i had envisioned a chronoscope used for research purposes .  all she could see was the personal pleasure of returning neurotically to a personal past  a dead past .  the pure researcher  foster  is in the minority .  people like my wife would outweigh us .     for the government to encourage chronoscopy would have meant that everyone   s past would be visible .  the government officers would be subjected to blackmail and improper pressure  since who on earth has a past that is absolutely clean .  organized government might become impossible .     foster licked his lips .     maybe .  maybe the government has some justification in its own eyes .  still  there   s an important principle involved here .  who knows what other scientific advances are being stymied because scientists are being stifled into walking a narrow path .  if the chronoscope becomes the terror of a few politicians  it   s a price that must be paid .  the public must realize that science must be free and there is no more dramatic way of doing it than to publish my discovery  one way or another  legally or illegally .     potterley   s brow was damp with perspiration  but his voice remained even .     oh  not just a few politicians  dr .  foster .  don   t think that .  it would be my terror  too .  my wife would spend her time living with our dead daughter .  she would retreat further from reality .  she would go mad living the same scenes over and over .  and not just my terror .  there would be others like her .  children searching for their dead parents or their own youth .  we   ll have a whole world living in the past .  midsummer madness .     foster said     moral judgments can   t stand in the way .  there isn   t one advance at any time in history that mankind hasn   t had the ingenuity to pervert .  mankind must also have the ingenuity to prevent .  as for the chronoscope  your delvers into the dead past will get tired soon enough .  they   ll catch their loved parents in some of the things their loved parents did and they   ll lose their enthusiasm for it all .  but all this is trivial .  with me  it   s a matter of important principle .     potterley said     hang your principle .  can   t you understand men and women as well as principle .  don   t you understand that my wife will live through the fire that killed our baby .  she won   t be able to help herself .  i know her .  she   ll follow through each step  trying to prevent it .  she   ll live it over and over again  hoping each time that it won   t happen .  how many times do you want to kill laurel .     a huskiness had crept into his voice .  a thought crossed foster   s mind .     what are you really afraid she   ll find out  dr .  potterley .  what happened the night of the fire .     the historian   s hands went up quickly to cover his face and they shook with his dry sobs .  foster turned away and stared uncomfortably out the window .  potterley said after a while     it   s a long time since i   ve had to think of it .  caroline was away .  i was baby sitting .  i went into the baby   s bedroom midevening to see if she had kicked off the bedclothes .  i had my cigarette with me  .  .  .  i smoked in those days .  i must have stubbed it out before putting it in the ashtray on the chest of drawers .  i was always careful .  the baby was all right .  i returned to the living room and fell asleep before the video .  i awoke  choking  surrounded by fire .  i don   t know how it started .        but you think it may have been the cigarette  is that it .     said foster .     a cigarette which  for once  you forgot to stub out .        i don   t know .  i tried to save her  but she was dead in my arms when i got out .        you never told your wife about the cigarette  i suppose .     potterley shook his head .     but i   ve lived with it .        only now  with a chronoscope  she   ll find out .  maybe it wasn   t the cigarette .  maybe you did stub it out .  isn   t that possible .     the scant tears had dried on potterley   s face .  the redness had subsided .  he said     i can   t take the chance .   .   .   .  but it   s not just myself  foster .  the past has its terrors for most people .  don   t loose those terrors on the human race .     foster paced the floor .  somehow  this explained the reason for potterley   s rabid  irrational desire to boost the carthaginians  deify them  most of all disprove the story of their fiery sacrifices to moloch .  by freeing them of the guilt of infanticide by fire  he symbolically freed himself of the same guilt .  so the same fire that had driven him on to causing the construction of a chronoscope was now driving him on to the destruction .  foster looked sadly at the older man .     i see your position  dr .  potterley  but this goes above personal feelings .  i   ve got to smash this throttling hold on the throat of science .     potterley said  savagely     you mean you want the fame and wealth that goes with such a discovery .        i don   t know about the wealth  but that  too  i suppose .  i   m no more than human .        you won   t suppress your knowledge .        not under any circumstances .        well  then     and the historian got to his feet and stood for a moment  glaring .  foster had an odd moment of terror .  the man was older than he  smaller  feebler  and he didn   t look armed .  still  .   .   .  foster said     if you   re thinking of killing me or anything insane like that  i   ve got the information in a safety deposit vault where the proper people will find it in case of my disappearance or death .     potterley said     don   t be a fool     and stalked out .  foster closed the door  locked it and sat down to think .  he felt silly .  he had no information in any safety deposit vault  of course .  such a melodramatic action would not have occurred to him ordinarily .  but now it had .  feeling even sillier  he spent an hour writing out the equations of the application of pseudo gravitic optics to neutrinic recording  and some diagrams for the engineering details of construction .  he sealed it in an envelope and scrawled ralph nimmo   s name over the outside .  he spent a rather restless night and the next morning  on the way to school  dropped the envelope off at the bank  with appropriate instructions to an official  who made him sign a paper permitting the box to be opened after his death .  he called nimmo to tell him of the existence of the envelope  refusing querulously to say anything about its contents .  he had never felt so ridiculously self conscious as at that moment .  that night and the next  foster spent in only fitful sleep  finding himself face to face with the highly practical problem of the publication of data unethically obtained .  the proceedings of the society for pseudo gravities  which was the journal with which he was best acquainted  would certainly not touch any paper that did not include the magic footnote     the work described in this paper was made possible by grant no .  so and so from the commission of research of the united nations .     nor  doubly so  would the journal of physics .  there were always the minor journals who might overlook the nature of the article for the sake of the sensation  but that would require a little financial negotiation on which he hesitated to embark .  it might  on the whole  be better to pay the cost of publishing a small pamphlet for general distribution among scholars .  in that case  he would even be able to dispense with the services of a science writer  sacrificing polish for speed .  he would have to find a reliable printer .  uncle ralph might know one .  he walked down the corridor to his office and wondered anxiously if perhaps he ought to waste no further time  give himself no further chance to lapse into indecision and take the risk of calling ralph from his office phone .  he was so absorbed in his own heavy thoughts that he did not notice that his room was occupied until he turned from the clothes closet and approached his desk .  dr .  potterley was there and a man whom foster did not recognize .  foster stared at them .     what   s this .     potterley said     i   m sorry  but i had to stop you .     foster continued staring .     what are you talking about .     the stranger said     let me introduce myself .     he had large teeth  a little uneven  and they showed prominently when he smiled .     i am thaddeus araman  department head of the division of chronoscopy .  i am here to see you concerning information brought to me by professor arnold potterley and confirmed by our own sources     potterley said breathlessly     i took all the blame  dr .  foster .  i explained that it was i who persuaded you against your will into unethical practices .  i have offered to accept full responsibility and punishment .  i don   t wish you harmed in any way .  it   s just that chronoscopy must not be permitted .     araman nodded .     he has taken the blame as he says  dr .  foster  but this thing is out of his hands now .     foster said     so .  what are you going to do .  blackball me from all consideration for research grants .        that is in my power     said araman .     order the university to discharge me .        that  too  is in my power .        all right  go ahead .  consider it done .  i   ll leave my office now  with you .  i can send for my books later .  if you insist  i   ll leave my books .  is that all .        not quite     said araman .     you must engage to do no further research in chronoscopy  to publish none of your findings in chronoscopy and  of course  to build no chronoscope .  you will remain under surveillance indefinitely to make sure you keep that promise .        supposing i refuse to promise .  what can you do .  doing research out of my field may be unethical  but it isn   t a criminal offense .        in the case of chronoscopy  my young friend     said araman patiently     it is a criminal offense .  if necessary  you will be put in jail and kept there .        why .     shouted foster .     what   s magic about chronoscopy .     araman said     that   s the way it is .  we cannot allow further developments in the field .  my own job is  primarily  to make sure of that  and i intend to do my job .  unfortunately  i had no knowledge  nor did anyone in the department  that the optics of pseudo gravity fields had such immediate application to chronoscopy .  score one for general ignorance  but henceforward research will be steered properly in that respect  too .     foster said     that won   t help .  something else may apply that neither you nor i dream of .  all science hangs together .  it   s one piece .  if you want to stop one part  you   ve got to stop it all .        no doubt that is true     said araman     in theory .  on the practical side  however  we have managed quite well to hold chronoscopy down to the original sterbinski level for fifty years .  having caught you in time  dr .  foster  we hope to continue doing so indefinitely .  and we wouldn   t have come this close to disaster  either  if i had accepted dr .  potterley at something more than face value .     he turned toward the historian and lifted his eyebrows in a kind of humorous self deprecation .     i   m afraid  sir  that i dismissed you as a history professor and no more on the occasion of our first interview .  had i done my job properly and checked on you  this would not have happened .     foster said abruptly     is anyone allowed to use the government chrono scope .        no one outside our division under any pretext .  i say that since it is obvious to me that you have already guessed as much .  i warn you  though  that any repetition of that fact will be a criminal  not an ethical  offense .        and your chronoscope doesn   t go back more than a hundred twenty five years or so  does it .        it doesn   t .        then your bulletin with its stories of time viewing ancient times is a hoax .     araman said coolly     with the knowledge you now have  it is obvious you know that for a certainty .  however  i confirm your remark .  the monthly bulletin is a hoax .        in that case     said foster     i will not promise to suppress my knowledge of chronoscopy .  if you wish to arrest me  go ahead .  my defense at the trial will be enough to destroy the vicious card house of directed research and bring it tumbling down .  directing research is one thing  suppressing it and depriving mankind of its benefits is quite another .     araman said     oh  let   s get something straight  dr .  foster .  if you do not co operate  you will go to jail directly .  you will not see a lawyer  you will not be charged  you will not have a trial .  you will simply stay in jail .        oh  no     said foster     you   re bluffing .  this is not the twentieth century  you know .     there was a stir outside the office  the clatter of feet  a high pitched shout that foster was sure he recognized .  the door crashed open  the lock splintering  and three intertwined figures stumbled in .  as they did so  one of the men raised a blaster and brought its butt down hard on the skull of another .  there was a whoosh of expiring air  and the one whose head was struck went limp .     uncle ralph .     cried foster .  araman frowned .     put him down in that chair     he ordered     and get some water .     ralph nimmo  rubbing his head with a gingerly sort of disgust  said     there was no need to get rough  araman .     araman said     the guard should have been rough sooner and kept you out of here  nimmo .  you   d have been better off .        you know each other .     asked foster .     i   ve had dealings with the man     said nimmo  still rubbing .     if he   s here in your office  nephew  you   re in trouble .        and you  too     said araman angrily .     i know dr .  foster consulted you on neutrinics literature .     nimmo corrugated his forehead  then straightened it with a wince as though the action had brought pain .     so .     he said .     what else do you know about me .        we will know everything about you soon enough .  meanwhile  that one item is enough to implicate you .  what are you doing here .        my dear dr .  araman     said nimmo  some of his jauntiness restored     day before yesterday  my jackass of a nephew called me .  he had placed some mysterious information        don   t tell him .  don   t say anything .     cried foster .  araman gknced at him coldly .     we know all about it  dr .  foster .  the safety deposit box has been opened and its contents removed .        but how can you know     foster   s voice died away in a kind of furious frustration .     anyway     said nimmo     i decided the net must be closing around him and  after i took care of a few items  i came down to tell him to get off this thing he   s doing .  it   s not worth his career .        does that mean you know what he   s doing .     asked araman .     he never told me     said nimmo     but i   m a science writer with a hell of a lot of experience .  i know which side of an atom is electronified .  the boy  foster  specializes in pseudo gravitic optics and coached me on the stuff himself .  he got me to get him a textbook on neutrinics and i kind of ship viewed it myself before handing it over .  i can put the two together .  he asked me to get him certain pieces of physical equipment  and that was evidence  too .  stop me if i   m wrong  but my nephew has built a semiportable  low power chronoscope .  yes  or yes .        yes .     araman reached thoughtfully for a cigarette and paid no attention to dr .  potterley  watching silently  as though all were a dream  who shied away  gasping  from the white cylinder .     another mistake for me .  i ought to resign .  i should have put tabs on you  too  nimmo  instead of concentrating too hard on potterley and foster .  i didn   t have much time of course and you   ve ended up safely here  but that doesn   t excuse me .  you   re under arrest  nimmo .        what for .     demanded the science writer .     unauthorized research .        i wasn   t doing any .  i can   t  not being a registered scientist .  and even if i did  it   s not a criminal offense .     foster said savagely     no use  uncle ralph .  this bureaucrat is making his own laws .        like what .     demanded nimmo .     like life imprisonment without trial .        nuts     said nimmo .     this isn   t the twentieth cen        i tried that     said foster .     it doesn   t bother him .        well  nuts     shouted nimmo .     look here  araman .  my nephew and i have relatives who haven   t lost touch with us  you know .  the professor has some also  i imagine .  you can   t just make us disappear .  there   ll be questions and a scandal .  this isn   t the twentieth century .  so if you   re trying to scare us  it isn   t working .     the cigarette snapped between araman   s fingers and he tossed it away violently .  he said     damn it  i don   t know what to do .  it   s never been like this before .   .   .   .  look .  you three fools know nothing of what you   re trying to do .  you understand nothing .  will you listen to me .        oh  we   ll listen     said nimmo grimly .   foster sat silently  eyes angry  lips compressed .  potterley   s hands writhed like two intertwined snakes .   araman said     the past to you is the dead past .  if any of you have discussed the matter  it   s dollars to nickels you   ve used that phrase .  the dead past .  if you knew how many times i   ve heard those three words  you   d choke on them  too .     when people think of the past  they think of it as dead  far away and gone  long ago .  we encourage them to think so .  when we report time viewing  we always talk of views centuries in the past  even though you gentlemen know seeing more than a century or so is impossible .  people accept it .  the past means greece  rome  carthage  egypt  the stone age .  the deader the better .     now you three know a century or a little more is the limit  so what does the past mean to you .  your youth .  your first girl .  your dead mother .  twenty years ago .  thirty years ago .  fifty years ago .  the deader the better .   .   .   .  but when does the past really begin .     he paused in anger .  the others stared at him and nimmo stirred uneasily .     well     said araman     when did it begin .  a year ago .  five minutes ago .  one second ago .  isn   t it obvious that the past begins an instant ago .  the dead past is just another name for the living present .  what if you focus the chronoscope in the past of one hundredth of a second ago .  aren   t you watching the present .  does it begin to sink in .     nimmo said     damnation .        damnation     mimicked araman .     after potterley came to me with his story night before last  how do you suppose i checked up on both of you .  i did it with the chronoscope  spotting key moments to the very instant of the present .        and that   s how you knew about the safety deposit box .     said foster .     and every other important fact .  now what do you suppose would happen if we let news of a home chronoscope get out .  people might start out by watching their youth  their parents and so on  but it wouldn   t be long before they   d catch on to the possibilities .  the housewife will forget her poor  dead mother and take to watching her neighbor at home and her husband at the office .  the businessman will watch his competitor  the employer his employee .     there will be no such thing as privacy .  the party line  the prying eye behind the curtain will be nothing compared to it .  the video stars will be closely watched at all times by everyone .  every man his own peeping tom and there   ll be no getting away from the watcher .  even darkness will be no escape because chronoscopy can be adjusted to the infrared and human figures can be seen by their own body heat .  the figures will be fuzzy  of course  and the surroundings will be dark  but that will make the titillation of it all the greater  perhaps .   .   .   .  hmp  the men in charge of the machine now experiment sometimes in spite of the regulations against it .     nimmo seemed sick .     you can always forbid private manufacture     araman turned on him fiercely .     you can  but do you expect it to do good .  can you legislate successfully against drinking  smoking  adultery or gossiping over the back fence .  and this mixture of nosiness and prurience will have a worse grip on humanity than any of those .  good lord  in a thousand years of trying we haven   t even been able to wipe out the heroin traffic and you talk about legislating against a device for watching anyone you please at any time you please that can be built in a home workshop .     foster said suddenly     i won   t publish .     potterley burst out  half in sobs     none of us will talk .  i regret     nimmo broke in .     you said you didn   t tab me on the chronoscope  araman .        no time     said araman wearily .     things don   t move any faster on the chronoscope than in real life .  you can   t speed it up like the film in a book viewer .  we spent a full twenty four hours trying to catch the important moments during the last six months of potterley and foster .  there was no time for anything else and it was enough .        it wasn   t     said nimmo .     what are you talking about .     there was a sudden infinite alarm on araman   s face .     i told you my nephew  jonas  had called me to say he had put important information in a safety deposit box .  he acted as though he were in trouble .  he   s my nephew .  i had to try to get him off the spot .  it took a while  then i came here to tell him what i had done .  i told you when i got here  just after your man conked me that i had taken care of a few items .        what .  for heaven   s sake        just this  i sent the details of the portable chronoscope off to half a dozen of my regular publicity outlets .     not a word .  not a sound .  not a breath .  they were all past any demonstration .     don   t stare like that     cried nimmo .     don   t you see my point .  i had popular publication rights .  jonas will admit that .  i knew he couldn   t publish scientifically in any legal way .  i was sure he was planning to publish illegally and was preparing the safety deposit box for that reason  i thought if i put through the details prematurely  all the responsibility would be mine .  his career would be saved .  and if   were deprived of my science writing license as a result  my exclusive possession of the chronometric data would set me up for life .  jonas would be angry  i expected that  but i could explain the motive and we would split the take fifty fifty .   .   .  don   t stare at me like that .  how did i know        nobody knew anything     said araman bitterly     but you all just took it for granted that the government was stupidly bureaucratic  vicious  tyrannical  given to suppressing research for the hell of it .  it never occurred to any of you that we were trying to protect mankind as best we could .        don   t sit there talking     wailed potterley .     get the names of the people who were told        too late     said nimmo  shrugging .     they   ve had better than a day .  there   s been time for the word to spread .  my outfits will have called any number of physicists to check my data before going on with it and they   ll call one another to pass on the news .  once scientists put neutrinics and pseudo gravities together  home chronoscopy becomes obvious .  before the week is out  five hundred people will know how to build a small chronoscope and how will you catch them all .     his plum cheeks sagged .     i suppose there   s no way of putting the mushroom cloud back into that nice  shiny uranium sphere .     araman stood up .     we   ll try  potterley  but i agree with nimmo .  it   s too late .  what kind of a world we   ll have from now on  i don   t know  i can   t tell  but the world we know has been destroyed completely .  until now  every custom  every habit  every tiniest way of life has always taken a certain amount of privacy for granted  but that   s all gone now .     he saluted each of the three with elaborate formality .     you have created a new world among the three of you .  i congratulate you .  happy goldfish bowl to you  to me  to everyone  and may each of you fry in hell forever .  arrest rescinded .      the foundation of s . f .  success  with apologies to w .  s .  gilbert   if you ask me how to shine in the science fiction line as a pro of luster bright  i say  practice up the lingo of the sciences  by jingo  never mind if not quite right  .  you must talk of space and galaxies and tesseractic fallacies in slick and mystic style  though the fans won   t understand it  they will all the same demand it with a softly hopeful smile .   and all the fans will say  as you walk your spatial way  if that young man indulges in flights through all the galaxy  why  what a most imaginative type of man that type of man must be .   so success is not a mystery  just brush up on your history  and borrow day by day .  take an empire that was roman and you   ll find it is at home in all the starry milky way .  with a drive that   s hyperspatial  through the parsecs you will race  you   ll find that plotting is a breeze  with a tiny bit of cribbin    from the works of edward gibbon and that greek  thucydides .   and all the fans will say  as you walk your thoughtful way  if that young man involves himself in authentic history  why  what a very learned kind of high iq  his high iq must be .   then eschew all thoughts of passion of a man and woman fashion from your hero   s thoughtful mind .  he must spend his time on politics  and thinking up his shady tricks  and outside that he   s blind .  it   s enough he   s had a mother  other females are a bother  though they   re jeweled and glistery .  they will just distract his dreaming and his necessary scheming with that psychohistory .   and all the fans will say as you walk your narrow way  if all his yarns restrict themselves to masculinity  why  what a most particularly pure young man that pure young man must be .   franchise  linda  age ten  was the only one of the family who seemed to enjoy being awake .  norman muller could hear her now through his own drugged  unhealthy coma .   he had finally managed to fall asleep an hour earlier but even then it was more like exhaustion than sleep .   she was at his bedside now  shaking him .     daddy  daddy  wake up .  wake up .     he suppressed a groan .     all right  linda .        but  daddy  there   s more policemen around than any time .  police cars and everything .     norman muller gave up and rose blearily to his elbows .  the day was beginning .  it was faintly stirring toward dawn outside  the germ of a miserable gray that looked about as miserably gray as he felt .  he could hear sarah  his wife  shuffling about breakfast duties in the kitchen .  his father in law  matthew  was hawking strenuously in the bathroom .  no doubt agent handley was ready and waiting for him .  this was the day .  election day .   to begin with  it had been like every other year .  maybe a little worse  because it was a presidential year  but no worse than other presidential years if it came to that .  the politicians spoke about the guh reat electorate and the vast electronic intelligence that was its servant .  the press analyzed the situation with industrial computers  the new york times and the st .  louis post dispatch had their own computers  and were full of little hints as to what would be forthcoming .  commentators and columnists pinpointed the crucial state and county in happy contradiction to one another .  the first hint that it would not be like every other year was when sarah muller said to her husband on the evening of october    with election day exactly a month off      cantwell johnson says that indiana will be the state this year .  he   s the fourth one .  just think  our state this time .     matthew hortenweiler took his fleshy face from behind the paper  stared dourly at his daughter and growled     those fellows are paid to tell lies .  don   t listen to them .        four of them  father     said sarah mildly .     they all say indiana .        indiana is a key state  matthew     said norman  just as mildly     on account of the hawkins smith act and this mess in indianapolis .  it     matthew twisted his old face alarmingly and rasped out     no one says bloomington or monroe county  do they .        well     said norman .  linda  whose little pointed chinned face had been shifting from one speaker to the next  said pipingly     you going to be voting this year  daddy .     norman smiled gently and said     i don   t think so  dear .     but this was in the gradually growing excitement of an october in a presidential election year and sarah had led a quiet life with dreams for her companions .  she said longingly     wouldn   t that be wonderful  though .        if i voted .     norman muller had a small blond mustache that had given him a debonair quality in the young sarah   s eyes  but which  with gradual graying  had declined merely to lack of distinction .  his forehead bore deepening lines born of uncertainty and  in general  he had never seduced his clerkly soul with the thought that he was either born great or would under any circumstances achieve greatness .  he had a wife  a job and a little girl  and except under extraordinary conditions of elation or depression was inclined to consider that to be an adequate bargain struck with life .  so he was a little embarrassed and more than a little uneasy at the direction his wife   s thoughts were taking .     actually  my dear     he said     there are two hundred million people in the country  and  with odds like that  i don   t think we ought to waste our time wondering about it .     his wife said     why  norman  it   s no such thing like two hundred million and you know it .  in the first place  only people between twenty and sixty are eligible and it   s always men  so that puts it down to maybe fifty million to one .  then  if it   s really indiana        then it   s about one and a quarter million to one .  you wouldn   t want me to bet in a horse race against those odds  now  would you .  let   s have supper .     matthew muttered from behind his newspaper     damned foolishness .     linda asked again     you going to be voting this year  daddy .     norman shook his head and they all adjourned to the dining room .   by october     sarah   s excitement was rising rapidly .  over the coffee  she announced that mrs .  schultz  having a cousin who was the secretary of an assemblyman  said that all the    smart money    was on indiana .     she says president villers is even going to make a speech at indianapolis .     norman muller  who had had a hard day at the store  nudged the statement with a raising of eyebrows and let it go at that .  matthew hortenweiler  who was chronically dissatisfied with washington  said     if villers makes a speech in indiana  that means he thinks multivac will pick arizona .  he wouldn   t have the guts to go closer  the mush head .     sarah  who ignored her father whenever she could decently do so  said     i don   t know why they don   t announce the state as soon as they can  and then the county and so on .  then the people who were eliminated could relax .        if they did anything like that     pointed out norman     the politicians would follow the announcements like vultures .  by the time it was narrowed down to a township  you   d have a congressman or two at every street corner .     matthew narrowed his eyes and brushed angrily at his sparse  gray hair .     they   re vultures  anyhow .  listen     sarah murmured     now  father     matthew   s voice rumbled over her protest without as much as a stumble or hitch .     listen  i was around when they set up multivac .  it would end partisan politics  they said .  no more voters    money wasted on campaigns .  no more grinning nobodies high pressured and advertising campaigned into congress or the white house .  so what happens .  more campaigning than ever  only now they do it blind .  they   ll send guys to indiana on account of the hawkins smith act and other guys to california in case it   s the joe hammer situation that turns out crucial .  i say  wipe out all that nonsense .  back to the good old     linda asked suddenly     don   t you want daddy to vote this year  grandpa .     matthew glared at the young girl .     never you mind  now .     he turned back to norman and sarah .     there was a time i voted .  marched right up to the polling booth  stuck my fist on the levers and voted .  there was nothing to it .  i just said  this fellow   s my man and i   m voting for him .  that   s the way it should be .     linda said excitedly     you voted  grandpa .  you really did .     sarah leaned forward quickly to quiet what might easily become an incongruous story drifting about the neighborhood     it   s nothing  linda .  grandpa doesn   t really mean voted .  everyone did that kind of voting  your grandpa  too  but it wasn   t really voting .     matthew roared     it wasn   t when i was a little boy .  i was twenty two and i voted for langley and it was real voting .  my vote didn   t count for much  maybe  but it was as good as anyone else   s .  anyone else   s .  and no multivac to     norman interposed     all right  linda  time for bed .  and stop asking questions about voting .  when you grow up  you   ll understand all about it .     he kissed her with antiseptic gentleness and she moved reluctantly out of range under maternal prodding and a promise that she might watch the bedside video till       if she was prompt about the bathing ritual .   linda said     grandpa     and stood with her chin down and her hands behind her back until his newspaper lowered itself to the point where shaggy eyebrows and eyes  nested in fine wrinkles  showed themselves .  it was friday  october    .  he said     yes .     linda came closer and put both her forearms on one of the old man   s knees so that he had to discard his newspaper altogether .  she said     grandpa  did you really once vote .     he said     you heard me say i did  didn   t you .  do you think i tell fibs .        n no  but mamma says everybody voted then .        so they did .        but how could they .  how could everybody vote .     matthew stared at her solemnly  then lifted her and put her on his knee .  he even moderated the tonal qualities of his voice .  he said     you see  linda  till about forty years ago  everybody always voted .  say we wanted to decide who was to be the new president of the united states .  the democrats and republicans would both nominate someone  and everybody would say who they wanted .  when election day was over  they would count how many people wanted the democrat and how many wanted the republican .  whoever had more votes was elected .  you see .     linda nodded and said     how did all the people know who to vote for .  did multivac tell them .     matthew   s eyebrows hunched down and he looked severe .     they just used their own judgment  girl .     she edged away from him  and he lowered his voice again     i   m not angry at you  linda .  but  you see  sometimes it took all night to count what everyone said and people were impatient .  so they invented special machines which could look at the first few votes and compare them with the votes from the same places in previous years .  that way the machine could compute how the total vote would be and who would be elected .  you see .     she nodded .     like multivac .        the first computers were much smaller than multivac .  but the machines grew bigger and they could tell how the election would go from fewer and fewer votes .  then  at last  they built multivac and it can tell from just one voter .     linda smiled at having reached a familiar part of the story and said     that   s nice .     matthew frowned and said     no  it   s not nice .  i don   t want a machine telling me how i would have voted just because some joker in milwaukee says he   s against higher tariffs .  maybe i want to vote cockeyed just for the pleasure of it .  maybe i don   t want to vote .  maybe     but linda had wriggled from his knee and was beating a retreat .  she met her mother at the door .  her mother  who was still wearing her coat and had not even had time to remove her hat  said breathlessly     run  along  linda .  don   t get in mother   s way .     then she said to matthew  as she lifted her hat from her head and patted her hair back into place     i   ve been at agatha   s .     matthew stared at her censoriously and did not even dignify that piece of information with a grunt as he groped for his newspaper .  sarah said  as she unbuttoned her coat     guess what she said .     matthew flattened out his newspaper for reading purposes with a sharp crackle and said     don   t much care .     sarah said     now  father     but she had no time for anger .  the news i had to be told and matthew was the only recipient handy  so she went on     agatha   s joe is a policeman  you know  and he says a whole truckload of secret service men came into bloomington last night .        they   re not after me .        don   t you see  father .  secret service agents  and it   s almost election time .  in bloomington .        maybe they   re after a bank robber .        there hasn   t been a bank robbery in town in ages .  .  .  .  father  you   re hopeless .     she stalked away .   nor did norman muller receive the news with noticeably greater excitement .     now  sarah  how did agatha   s joe know they were secret service agents .     he asked calmly .     they wouldn   t go around with identification cards pasted on their foreheads .     but by next evening  with november a day old  she could say triumphantly     it   s just everyone in bloomington that   s waiting for someone local to be the voter .  the bloomington news as much as said so on video .     norman stirred uneasily .  he couldn   t deny it  and his heart was sinking .  if bloomington was really to be hit by multivac   s lightning  it would mean newspapermen  video shows  tourists  all sorts of strange upsets .  norman liked the quiet routine of his life  and the distant stir of politics was getting uncomfortably close .  he said     it   s all rumor .  nothing more .        you wait and see  then .  you just wait and see .     as things turned out  there was very little time to wait  for the doorbell rang insistently  and when norman muller opened it and said     yes .     a tall  grave faced man said     are you norman muller .     norman said     yes     again  but in a strange dying voice .  it was not difficult to see from the stranger   s bearing that he was one carrying authority  and the nature of his errand suddenly became as inevitably obvious as it had  until the moment before  been unthinkably impossible .  the man presented credentials  stepped into the house  closed the door behind him and said ritualistically     mr .  norman muller  it is necessary for me to inform you on the behalf of the president of the united states that you have been chosen to represent the american electorate on tuesday  november         .      norman muller managed  with difficulty  to walk unaided to his chair .  he sat there  white faced and almost insensible  while sarah brought water  slapped his hands in panic and moaned to her husband between clenched teeth     don   t be sick  norman .  don   t be sick .  they   ll pick someone else .     when norman could manage to talk  he whispered     i   m sorry  sir .     the secret service agent had removed his coat  unbuttoned his jacket and was sitting at ease on the couch .     it   s all right     he said  and the mark of officialdom seemed to have vanished with the formal announcement and leave him simply a large and rather friendly man .     this is the sixth time i   ve made the announcement and i   ve seen all kinds of reactions .  not one of them was the kind you see on the video .  you know what i mean .  a holy  dedicated look  and a character who says     it will be a great privilege to serve my country .     that sort of stuff .     the agent laughed comfortingly .  sarah   s accompanying laugh held a trace of shrill hysteria .  the agent said     now you   re going to have me with you for a while .  my name is phil handley .  i   d appreciate it if you call me phil .  mr .  muller can   t leave the house any more till election day .  you   ll have to inform the department store that he   s sick  mrs .  muller .  you can go about your business for a while  but you   ll have to agree not to say a word about this .  right  mrs .  muller .     sarah nodded vigorously .     no  sir .  not a word .        all right .  but  mrs .  muller     handley looked grave     we   re not kidding now .  go out only if you must and you   ll be followed when you do .  i   m sorry but that   s the way we must operate .        followed .        it won   t be obvious .  don   t worry .  and it   s only for two days till the formal announcement to the nation is made .  your daughter        she   s in bed     said sarah hastily .     good .  she   ll have to be told i   m a relative or friend staying with the family .  if she does find out the truth  she   ll have to be kept in the house .  your father had better stay in the house in any case .        he won   t like that     said sarah .     can   t be helped .  now  since you have no others living with you        you know all about us apparently     whispered norman .     quite a bit     agreed handley .     in any case  those are all my instructions to you for the moment .  i   ll try to cooperate as much as i can and be as little of a nuisance as possible .  the government will pay for my maintenance so i won   t be an expense to you .  i   ll be relieved each night by someone who will sit up in this room  so there will be no problem about sleeping accommodations .  now  mr .  muller        sir .        you can call me phil     said the agent again .     the purpose of the two day preliminary before formal announcement is to get you used to your position .  we prefer to have you face multivac in as normal a state of mind as possible .  just relax and try to feel this is all in a day   s work .  okay .        okay     said norman  and then shook his head violently .     but i don   t want the responsibility .  why me .        all right     said handley     let   s get that straight to begin with .  multivac weighs all sorts of known factors  billions of them .  one factor isn   t known  though  and won   t be known for a long time .  that   s the reaction pattern of the human mind .  all americans are subjected to the molding pressure of what other americans do and say  to the things that are done to him and the things he does to others .  any american can be brought to multivac to have the bent of his mind surveyed .  from that the bent of all other minds in the country can be estimated .  some americans are better for the purpose than others at some given time  depending upon the happenings of that year .  multivac picked you as most representative this year .  not the smartest  or the strongest  or the luckiest  but just the most representative .  now we don   t question multivac  do we .        couldn   t it make a mistake .     asked norman .  sarah  who listened impatiently  interrupted to say     don   t listen to him  sir .  he   s just nervous  you know .  actually  he   s very well read and he always follows politics very closely .     handley said     multivac makes the decisions  mrs .  muller .  it picked your husband .        but does it know everything .     insisted norman wildly .     couldn   t it have made a mistake .        yes  it can .  there   s no point in not being frank .  in       a selected voter died of a stroke two hours before it was time for him to be notified .  multivac didn   t predict that  it couldn   t .  a voter might be mentally unstable  morally unsuitable  or  for that matter  disloyal .  multivac can   t know everything about everybody until he   s fed all the data there is .  that   s why alternate selections are always held in readiness .  i don   t think we   ll be using one this time .  you   re in good health  mr .  muller  and you   ve been carefully investigated .  you qualify .     norman buried his face in his hands and sat motionless .     by tomorrow morning  sir     said sarah     he   ll be perfectly all right .  he just has to get used to it  that   s all .        of course     said handley .  in the privacy of their bedchamber  sarah muller expressed herself in other and stronger fashion .  the burden of her lecture was     so get hold of yourself  norman .  you   re trying to throw away the chance of a lifetime .     norman whispered desperately     it frightens me  sarah .  the whole thing .        for goodness    sake  why .  what   s there to it but answering a question or two .        the responsibility is too great .  i couldn   t face it .        what responsibility .  there isn   t any .  multivac picked you .  it   s multivac   s responsibility .  everyone knows that .     norman sat up in bed in a sudden excess of rebellion and anguish .     everyone is supposed to know that .  but they don   t .  they        lower your voice     hissed sarah icily .     they   ll hear you downtown .        they don   t     said norman  declining quickly to a whisper .     when they talk about the ridgely administration of       do they say he won them over with pie in the sky promises and racist baloney .  no .  they talk about the    goddam maccomber vote     as though humphrey maccomber was the only man who had anything to do with it because he faced multivac .  i   ve said it myself only now i think the poor guy was just a truck farmer who didn   t ask to be picked .  why was it his fault more than anyone else   s .  now his name is a curse .        you   re just being childish     said sarah .     i   m being sensible .  i tell you  sarah  i won   t accept .  they can   t make me vote if i don   t want to .  i   ll say i   m sick .  i   ll say     but sarah had had enough .     now you listen to me     she whispered in a cold fury .     you don   t have only yourself to think about .  you know what it means to be voter of the year .  a presidential year at that .  it means publicity and fame and  maybe  buckets of money        and then i go back to being a clerk .        you will not .  you   ll have a branch managership at the least if you have any brains at all  and you will have  because i   ll tell you what to do .  you control the kind of publicity if you play your cards right  and you can force kennell stores  inc .   into a tight contract and an escalator clause in connection with your salary and a decent pension plan .        that   s not the point in being voter  sarah .        that will be your point .  if you don   t owe anything to yourself or to me  i   m not asking for myself you owe something to linda .     norman groaned .     well  don   t you .     snapped sarah .     yes  dear     murmured norman .   on november    the official announcement was made and it was too late for norman to back out even if he had been able to find the courage to make the attempt .  their house was sealed off .  secret service agents made their appearance in the open  blocking off all approach .  at first the telephone rang incessantly  but philip handley with an engagingly apologetic smile took all calls .  eventually  the exchange shunted all calls directly to the police station .  norman imagined that  in that way  he was spared not only the bubbling  and envious .   congratulations of friends  but also the egregious pressure of salesmen scenting a prospect and the designing smoothness of politicians from all over the nation .  .  .  .  perhaps even death threats from the inevitable cranks .  newspapers were forbidden to enter the house now in order to keep out weighted pressures  and television was gently but firmly disconnected  over linda   s loud protests .  matthew growled and stayed in his room  linda  after the first flurry of excitement  sulked and whined because she could not leave the house  sarah divided her time between preparation of meals for the present and plans for the future  and norman   s depression lived and fed upon itself .  and the morning of tuesday  november          came at last  and it was election day .   it was early breakfast  but only norman muller ate  and that mechanically .  even a shower and shave had not succeeded in either restoring him to reality or removing his own conviction that he was as grimy without as he felt grimy within .  handley   s friendly voice did its best to shed some normality over the gray and unfriendly dawn .   the weather prediction had been for a cloudy day with prospects of rain before noon .   handley said     we   ll keep this house insulated till mr .  muller is back  but after that we   ll be off your necks .     the secret service agent was in full uniform now  including sidearms in heavily brassed holsters .     you   ve been no trouble at all  mr .  handley     simpered sarah .  norman drank through two cups of black coffee  wiped his lips with a napkin  stood up and said haggardly     i   m ready .     handley stood up  too .     very well  sir .  and thank you  mrs .  muller  for your very kind hospitality .      the armored car purred down empty streets .  they were empty even for that hour of the morning .  handley indicated that and said     they always shift traffic away from the line of drive ever since the attempted bombing that nearly ruined the leverett election of    ninety two .     when the car stopped  norman was helped out by the always polite handley into an underground drive whose walls were lined with soldiers at attention .  he was led into a brightly lit room  in which three white uniformed men greeted him smilingly .  norman said sharply     but this is the hospital .        there   s no significance to that     said handley at once .     it   s just that the hospital has the necessary facilities .        well  what do i do .     handley nodded .  one of the three men in white advanced and said     i   ll take over now  agent .     handley saluted in an offhand manner and left the room .  the man in white said     won   t you sit down  mr .  muller .  i   m john paulson  senior computer .  these are samson levine and peter dorogobuzh  my assistants .     norman shook hands numbly all about .  paulson was a man of middle height with a soft face that seemed used to smiling and a very obvious toupee .  he wore plastic rimmed glasses of an old fashioned cut  and he lit a cigarette as he talked .   norman refused his offer of one .   paulson said     in the first place  mr .  muller  i want you to know we are in no hurry .  we want you to stay with us all day if necessary  just so that you get used to your surroundings and get over any thought you might have that there is anything unusual in this  anything clinical  if you know what i mean .        it   s all right     said norman .     i   d just as soon this were over .        i understand your feelings .  still  we want you to know exactly what   s going on .  in the first place  multivac isn   t here .        it isn   t .     somehow through all his depression  he had still looked forward to seeing multivac .  they said it was half a mile long and three stories high  that fifty technicians walked the corridors within its structure continuously .  it was one of the wonders of the world .  paulson smiled .     no .  it   s not portable  you know .  it   s located underground  in fact  and very few people know exactly where .  you can understand that  since it is our greatest natural resource .  believe me  elections aren   t the only things it   s used for .     norman thought he was being deliberately chatty and found himself intrigued all the same .     i thought i   d see it .  i   d like to .        i   m sure of that .  but it takes a presidential order and even then it has to be countersigned by security .  however  we are plugged into multivac right here by beam transmission .  what multivac says can be interpreted here and what we say is beamed directly to multivac  so in a sense we   re in its presence .     norman looked about .  the machines within the room were all meaningless to him .     now let me explain  mr .  muller     paulson went on .     multivac already has most of the information it needs to decide all the elections  national  state and local .  it needs only to check certain imponderable attitudes of mind and it will use you for that .  we can   t predict what questions it will ask  but they may not make much sense to you  or even to us .  it may ask you how you feel about garbage disposal in your town  whether you favor central incinerators .  it might ask you whether you have a doctor of your own or whether you make use of national medicine  inc .  do you understand .        yes  sir .        whatever it asks  you answer in your own words in any way you please .  if you feel you must explain quite a bit  do so .  talk an hour  if necessary .        yes  sir .        now  one more thing .  we will have to make use of some simple devices which will automatically record your blood pressure  heartbeat  skin conductivity and brain wave pattern while you speak .  the machinery will seem formidable  but it   s all absolutely painless .  you won   t even know it   s going on .     the other two technicians were already busying themselves with smooth gleaming apparatus on oiled wheels .  norman said     is that to check on whether i   m lying or not .        not at all  mr .  muller .  there   s no question of lying .  it   s only a matter of emotional intensity .  if the machine asks you your opinion of your child   s school  you may say     i think it is overcrowded .     those are only words .  from the way your brain and heart and hormones and sweat glands work  multivac can judge exactly how intensely you feel about the matter .  it will understand your feelings better than you yourself .        i never heard of this     said norman .     no  i   m sure you didn   t .  most of the details of multivac   s workings are top secret .  for instance  when you leave  you will be asked to sign a paper swearing that you will never reveal the nature of the questions you were asked  the nature of your responses  what was done  or how it was done .  the less is known about the multivac  the less chance of attempted outside pressures upon the men who service it .     he smiled grimly .     our lives are hard enough as it is .     norman nodded .     i understand .        and now would you like anything to eat or drink .        no .  nothing right now .           do you have any questions .     norman shook his head .     then you tell us when you   re ready .        i   m ready right now .        you   re certain .        quite .     paulson nodded  and raised his hand in a gesture to the others .  they advanced with their frightening equipment  and norman muller felt his breath come a little quicker as he watched .   the ordeal lasted nearly three hours  with one short break for coffee and an embarrassing session with a chamber pot .  during all this time  norman muller remained encased in machinery .  he was bone weary at the close .  he thought sardonically that his promise to reveal nothing of what had passed would be an easy one to keep .  already the questions were a hazy mishmash in his mind .  somehow he had thought multivac would speak in a sepulchral  superhuman voice  resonant and echoing  but that  after all  was just an idea he had from seeing too many television shows  he now decided .  the truth was distressingly undramatic .  the questions were slips of a kind of metallic foil patterned with numerous punctures .  a second machine converted the pattern into words and paulson read the words to norman  then gave him the question and let him read it for himself .  norman   s answers were taken down by a recording machine  played back to norman for confirmation  with emendations and added remarks also taken down .  all that was fed into a pattern making instrument and that  in turn  was radiated to murtivac .  the one question norman could remember at the moment was an incongruously gossipy     what do you think of the price of eggs .     now it was over  and gently they removed the electrodes from various portions of his body  unwrapped the pulsating band from his upper arm  moved the machinery away .  he stood up  drew a deep  shuddering breath and said     is that all .  am i through .        not quite .     paulson hurried to him  smiling in reassuring fashion .     we   ll have to ask you to stay another hour .        why .     asked norman sharply .     it will take that long for multivac to weave its new data into the trillions of items it has .  thousands of elections are concerned  you know .  it   s very complicated .  and it may be that an odd contest here or there  a comptroller ship in phoenix  arizona  or some council seat in wilkesboro  north carolina  may be in doubt .  in that case  multivac may be compelled to ask you a deciding question or two .        no     said norman .     i won   t go through this again .        it probably won   t happen     paulson said soothingly .     it rarely does .  but  just in case  you   ll have to stay .     a touch of steel  just a touch  entered his voice .     you have no choice  you know .  you must .     norman sat down wearily .  he shrugged .  paulson said     we can   t let you read a newspaper  but if you   d care for a murder mystery  or if you   d like to play chess  or if there   s anything we can do for you to help pass the time  i wish you   d mention it .        it   s all right .  i   ll just wait .     they ushered him into a small room just next to the one in which he had been questioned .  he let himself sink into a plastic covered armchair and closed his eyes .  as well as he could  he must wait out this final hour .   he sat perfectly still and slowly the tension left him .  his breathing grew less ragged and he could clasp his hands without being quite so conscious of the trembling of his fingers .  maybe there would be no questions .  maybe it was all over .  if it were over  then the next thing would be torchlight processions and invitations to speak at all sorts of functions .  the voter of the year .  he  norman muller  ordinary clerk of a small department store in bloomington  indiana  who had neither been born great nor achieved greatness would be in the extraordinary position of having had greatness thrust upon him .  the historians would speak soberly of the muller election of      .  that would be its name  the muller election .  the publicity  the better job  the flash flood of money that interested sarah so much  occupied only a comer of his mind .  it would all be welcome  of course .  he couldn   t refuse it .  but at the moment something else was beginning to concern him .  a latent patriotism was stirring .  after all  he was representing the entire electorate .  he was the focal point for them .  he was  in his own person  for this one day  all of america .  the door opened  snapping him to open eyed attention .  for a moment  his stomach constricted .  not more questions .  but paulson was smiling .     that will be all  mr .  muller .        no more questions  sir .        none needed .  everything was quite clear cut .  you will be escorted back to your home and then you will be a private citizen once more .  or as much so as the public will allow .        thank you .  thank you .     norman flushed and said     i wonder who was elected .     paulson shook his head .     that will have to wait for the official announcement .  the rules are quite strict .  we can   t even tell you .  you understand .        of course .  yes .     norman felt embarrassed .     secret service will have the necessary papers for you to sign .        yes .     suddenly  norman muller felt proud .  it was on him now in full strength .  he was proud .  in this imperfect world  the sovereign citizens of the first and greatest electronic democracy had  through norman muller  through him .   exercised once again its free  untrammeled franchise .   gimmicks three     come  come     said shapur quite politely  considering that he was a demon .     you are wasting my time .  and your own  too  i might add  since you have only half an hour left .     and his tail twitched .     it   s not dematerialization .     asked isidore wellby thoughtfully .     i have already said it is not     said shapur .  for the hundredth time  wellby looked at the unbroken bronze that surrounded him on all sides .  the demon had taken unholy pleasure  what other kind indeed .   in pointing out that the floor  ceiling and four walls were featureless  two foot thick slabs of bronze  welded seamlessly together .  it was the ultimate locked room and wellby had but another half hour to get out  while the demon watched with an expression of gathering anticipation .  it has been ten years previously  to the day  naturally  that isidore wellby had signed up .     we pay you in advance     said shapur persuasively .     ten years of anything you want  within reason  and then you   re a demon .  you   re one of us  with a new name of demonic potency  and many privileges beside .  you   ll hardly know you   re damned .  and if you don   t sign  you may end up in the fire  anyway  just in the ordinary course of things .  you never know .   .   .   .  here  look at me .  i   m not doing too badly .  i signed up  had my ten years and here i am .  not bad .        why so anxious for me to sign then  if i might be damned anyway .     asked wellby .     it   s not so easy to recruit hell   s cadre     said the demon  with a frank shrug that made the faint odor of sulfur dioxide in the air a trifle stronger .     everyone wishes to gamble on ending in heaven .  it   s a poor gamble  but there it is .  i think you    re too sensible for that .  but meanwhile we have more damned souls than we know what to do with and a growing shortage at the administrative end .     wellby  having just left the army and finding himself with nothing much to show for it but a limp and a farewell letter from a girl he somehow still loved  pricked his finger  and signed .  of course  he read the small print first .  a certain amount of demonic power would be deposited to his account upon signature in blood .  he would not know in detail how one manipulated those powers  or even the nature of all of them  but he would nevertheless find his wishes fulfilled in such a way that they would seem to have come about through perfectly normal mechanisms .  naturally  no wish might be fulfilled which would interfere with the higher aims and purposes of human history .  wellby had raised his eyebrows at that .  shapur coughed .     a precaution imposed upon us by uh above .  you are reasonable .  the limitation won   t interfere with you .     wellby said     there seems to be a catch clause  too .        a kind of one  yes .  after all  we have to check your aptitude for the position .  it states  as you see  that you will be required to perform a task for us at the conclusion of your ten years  one your demonic powers will make it quite possible for you to do .  we can   t tell you the nature of the task now  but you will have ten years to study the nature of your powers .  look upon the whole thing as an entrance qualification .        and if   don   t pass the test  what then .        in that case     said the demon     you will be only an ordinary damned soul after all .     and because he was a demon  his eyes glowed smokily at the thought and his clawed fingers twitched as though he felt them already deep in the other   s vitals .  but he added suavely     come  now  the test will be a simple one .  we would rather have you as cadre than as just another chore on our hands .     wellby  with sad thoughts of his unattainable loved one  cared little enough at that moment for what would happen after ten years and he signed .  yet the ten years passed quickly enough .  isidore wellby was always reasonable  as the demon had predicted  and things worked well .  wellby accepted a position and because he was always at the right spot at the right time and always said the right thing to the right man  he was quickly promoted to a position of great authority .  investments he made invariably paid off and  what was more gratifying still  his girl came back to him most sincerely repentant and most satisfactorily adoring .  his marriage was a happy one and was blessed with four children  two boys and two girls  all bright and reasonably well behaved .  at the end of ten years  he was at the height of his authority  reputation and wealth  while his wife  if anything  had grown more beautiful as she had matured .  and ten years  to the day  naturally  after the making of the compact  he woke to find himself  not in his bedroom  but in a horrible bronze chamber of the most appalling solidity  with no company other than an eager demon .     you have only to get out  and you will be one of us     said shapur .     it can be done fairly and logically by using your demonic powers  provided you know exactly what it is you   re doing .  you should  by now .        my wife and children will be very disturbed at my disappearance     said wellby with the beginning of regrets .     they will find your dead body     said the demon consolingly .     you will seem to have died of a heart attack and you will have a beautiful funeral .  the minister will consign you to heaven and we will not disillusion him or those who listen to him .  now  come  wellby  you have till noon .     wellby  having unconsciously steeled himself for this moment for ten years  was less panic stricken than he might have been .  he looked about speculatively .     is this room perfectly enclosed .  no trick openings .        no openings anywhere in the walls  floor or ceiling     said the demon  with a professional delight in his handiwork .     or at the boundaries of any of those surfaces  for that matter .  are you giving up .        no  no .  just give me time .     wellby thought very hard .  there seemed no sign of closeness in the room .  there was even a feeling of moving air .  the air might be entering the room by dematerializing across the walls .  perhaps the demon had entered by dematerialization and perhaps wellby himself might leave in that manner .  he asked .  the demon grinned .     dematerialization is not one of your powers .  nor did i myself use it in entering .        you   re sure now .        the room is my own creation     said the demon smugly     and especially constructed for you .        and you entered from outside .        i did .        with reasonably demonic powers which i possess  too .        exactly .  come  let us be precise .  you cannot move through matter but you can move in any dimension by a mere effort of will .  you can move up  down  right  left  obliquely and so on  but you cannot move through matter in any way .     wellby kept on thinking  and shapur kept on pointing out the utter immovable solidity of the bronze walls  floor and ceiling  their unbroken ultimacy .  it seemed obvious to wellby that shapur  however much he might believe in the necessity for recruiting cadre  was barely restraining his demonic delight at possibly having an ordinary damned soul to amuse himself with .     at least     said wellby  with a sorrowful attempt at philosophy     i   ll have ten happy years to look back on .  surely that   s a consolation  even for a damned soul in hell .        not at all     said the demon .     hell would not be hell  if you were allowed consolations .  everything anyone gains on earth by pacts with the devil  as in your case  or my own  for that matter   is exactly what one might have gained without such a pact if one had worked industriously and in full trust in uh above .  that is what makes all such bargains so truly demonic .     and the demon laughed with a kind of cheerful howl .  wellby said indignantly     you mean my wife would have returned to me even if i had never signed your contract .        she might have     said shapur .     whatever happens is the will of uh  above  you know .  we ourselves can do nothing to alter that .     the chagrin of that moment must have sharpened wellby   s wits for it was then that he vanished  leaving the room empty  except for a surprised demon .  and surprise turned to absolute fury when the demon looked at the contract with wellby which he had  until that moment  been holding in his hand for final action  one way or the other .  it was ten years  to the day  naturally  after isidore wellby had signed his pact with shapur  that the demon entered wellby   s office and said  most angrily     look here     wellby looked up from his work  astonished .     who are you .        you know very well who i am     said shapur .     not at all     said wellby .  the demon looked sharply at the man .     i see you are telling the truth  but i can   t make out the details .     he promptly flooded wellby   s mind with the events of the last ten years .  wellby said     oh  yes .  i can explain  of course  but are you sure we will not be interrupted .        we won   t be     said the demon grimly .     i sat in that closed bronze room     said wellby     and        never mind that     said the demon hastily .     i want to know        please .  let me tell this my way .     the demon clamped his jaws and fairly exuded sulfur dioxide till wellby coughed and looked pained .  wellby said     if you   ll move off a bit .  thank you .   .   .   .  now i sat in that closed bronze room and remembered how you kept stressing the absolute unbrokenness of the four walls  the floor and the ceiling .  i wondered  why did you specify .  what else was there beside walls  floor and ceiling .  you had defined a completely enclosed three dimensional space .     and that was it  three dimensional .  the room was not closed in the fourth dimension .  it did not exist indefinitely in the past .  you said you had created it for me .  so if one traveled into the past  one would find oneself at a point in time  eventually  when the room did not exist and then one would be out of the room .     what   s more  you had said i could move in any dimension  and time may certainly be viewed as a dimension .  in any case  as soon as i decided to move toward the past  i found myself living backward at a tremendous rate and suddenly there was no bronze around me anywhere .     shapur cried in anguish     i can guess all that .  you couldn   t have escaped any other way .  it   s this contract of yours that i   m concerned about .  if you   re not an ordinary damned soul  very well  it   s part of the game .  but you must be at least one of us  one of the cadre  it   s what you were paid for  and if i don   t deliver you down below  i will be in enormous trouble .     wellby shrugged his shoulders .     i   m sorry for you  of course  but i can   t help you .  you must have created the bronze room immediately after i placed my signature on the paper  for when i burst out of the room  i found myself just at the point in time at which i was making the bargain with you .  there you were again  there i was  you were pushing the contract toward me  together with a stylus with which i might prick my finger .  to be sure  as i had moved back in time  my memory of what was becoming the future faded out  but not  apparently  quite entirely .  as you pushed the contract at me  i felt uneasy .  i didn   t quite remember the future  but i felt uneasy .  so i didn   t sign .  i turned you down flat .     shapur ground his teeth .     i might have known .  if probability patterns affected demons  i would have shifted with you into this new if world .  as it is  all i can say is that you have lost the ten happy years we paid you with .  that is one consolation .  and we   ll get you in the end .  that is another .        well  now     said wellby     are there consolations in hell .  through the ten years i have now lived  i knew nothing of what i might have obtained .  but now that you   ve put the memory of the ten years that might have been into my mind  i recall that  in the bronze room  you told me that demonic agreements could give nothing that could not be obtained by industry and trust in above .  i have been industrious and i have trusted .     wellby   s eyes fell upon the photograph of his beautiful wife and four beautiful children  then traveled about the tasteful luxuriance of his office .     and i may even escape hell altogether .  that  too  is beyond your power to decide .     and the demon  with a horrible shriek  vanished forever .   kid stuff  the first pang of nausea had passed and jan prentiss said     damn it  you   re an insect .     it was a statement of fact  not an insult  and the thing that sat on prentiss    desk said     of course .     it was about a foot long  very thin  and in shape a farfetched and miniature caricature of a human being .  its stalky arms and legs originated in pairs from the upper portion of its body .  the legs were longer and thicker than the arms .  they extended the length of the body  then bent forward at the knee .  the creature sat upon those knees and  when it did so  the stub of its fuzzy abdomen just cleared prentiss    desk .  there was plenty of time for prentiss to absorb these details .  the object had no objection to being stared at .  it seemed to welcome it  in fact  as though it were used to exciting admiration .     what are you .     prentiss did not feel completely rational .  five minutes ago  he had been seated at his typewriter  working leisurely on the story he had promised horace w .  browne for last month   s issue of farfetched fantasy fiction .  he had been in a perfectly usual frame of mind .  he had felt quite fine  quite sane .  and then a block of air immediately to the right of the typewriter had shimmered  clouded over and condensed into the little horror that dangled its black and shiny feet over the edge of the desk .  prentiss wondered in a detached sort of way that he bothered talking to it .  this was the first time his profession had so crudely affected his dreams .  it must be a dream  he told himself .     i   m an avalonian     said the being .     i   m from avalon  in other words .     it   s tiny face ended in a mandibular mouth .  two swaying three inch antennae rose from a spot above either eye  while the eyes themselves gleamed richly in their many faceted fashion .  there was no sign of nostrils .  naturally not  thought prentiss wildly .  it has to breathe through vents in its abdomen .  it must be talking with its abdomen then .  or using telepathy .     avalon .     he said stupidly .  he thought  avalon .  the land of the fay in king arthur   s time .     certainly     said the creature  answering the thought smoothly .     i   m an elf .        oh  no .     prentiss put his hands to his face  took them away and found the elf still there  its feet thumping against the top drawer .  prentiss was not a drinking man  or a nervous one .  in fact  he was considered a very prosaic sort of person by his neighbors .  he had a comfortable paunch  a reasonable but not excessive amount of hair on his head  an amiable wife and an active ten year old son .  his neighbors were  of course  kept ignorant of the fact that he paid off the mortgage on his house by writing fantasies of one sort or another .  till now  however  this secret vice had never affected his psyche .  to be sure  his wife had shaken her head over his addiction many times .  it was her standard opinion that he was wasting  even perverting  his talents .     who on earth reads these things .     she would say .     all that stuff about demons and gnomes and wishing rings and elves .  all that kid stuff  if you want my frank opinion .        you   re quite wrong     prentiss would reply stiffly .     modern fantasies are very sophisticated and mature treatments of folk motifs .  behind the facade of glib unreality there frequently lie trenchant comments on the world of today .  fantasy in modem style is  above all  adult fare .     blanche shrugged .  she had heard him speak at conventions so these comments weren   t new to her .     besides     he would add     fantasies pay the mortgage  don   t they .        maybe so     she would reply     but it would be nice if you   d switch to mysteries .  at least you   d get quarter reprint sales out of those and we could       even tell the neighbors what you do for a living .     prentiss groaned in spirit .  blanche could come in now at any time and find him talking to himself  it was too real for a dream  it might be a hallucination  .  after that he would have to write mysteries for a living or take to work .     you   re quite wrong     said the elf .     this is neither a dream nor a hallucination .        then why don   t you go away .     asked prentiss .     i intend to .  this is scarcely my idea of a place to live .  and you   re coming with me .        i am not .  what the hell do you think you are  telling me what i   m going to do .        if you think that   s a respectful way to speak to a representative of an older culture  i can   t say much for your upbringing .        you   re not an older culture     he wanted to add  you   re just a figment of my imagination  but he had been a writer too long to be able to bring himself to commit the clich   .     we insects     said the elf freezingly     existed half a billion years before the first mammal was invented .  we watched the dinosaurs come in and we watched them go out .  as for you man things strictly newcomers .     for the first time  prentiss noted that  from the spot on the elf   s body where its limbs sprouted  a third vestigial pair existed as well .  it increased the insecticity of the object and prentiss    sense of indignation grew .  he said     you needn   t waste your company on social inferiors .        i wouldn   t     said the elf     believe me .  but necessity drives  you know .  it   s a rather complicated story but when you hear it  you   ll want to help .     prentiss said uneasily     look  i don   t have much time .  blanche my wife will be in here any time .  she   ll be upset .        she won   t be here     said the elf .     i   ve set up a block in her mind .        what .        quite harmless  i assure you .  but  after all  we can   t afford to be disturbed  can we .     prentiss sat back in his chair  dazed and unhappy .  the elf said     we elves began our association with you man things immediately after the last ice age began .  it had been a miserable time for us  as you can imagine .  we couldn   t wear animal carcasses or live in holes as your uncouth ancestors did .  it took incredible stores of psychic energy to keep warm .        incredible stores of what .        psychic energy .  you know nothing at all about it .  your mind is too coarse to grasp the concept .  please don   t interrupt .     the elf continued     necessity drove us to experiment with your people   s brains .  they were crude  but large .  the cells were inefficient  almost worthless  but there were a vast number of them .  we could use those brains as a concentrating device  a type of psychic lens  and increase the available energy which our own minds could tap .  we survived the ice age handily and without having to retreat to the tropics as in previous such eras .     of course  we were spoiled .  when warmth returned  we didn   t abandon the man things .  we used them to increase our standard of living generally .  we could travel faster  eat better  do more  and we lost our old  simple  virtuous way of life forever .  then  too  there was milk .        milk .     said prentiss .     i don   t see the connection .        a divine liquid .  i only tasted it once in my life .  but elfin classic poetry speaks of it in superlatives .  in the old days  men always supplied us plentifully .  why mammals of all things should be blessed with it and insects not is a complete mystery .   .   .   .  how unfortunate it is that the men things got out of hand .        they did .        two hundred years ago .        good for us .        don   t be narrow minded     said the elf stiffly .     it was a useful association for all parties until you man things learned to handle physical energies in quantity .  it was just the sort of gross thing your minds are capable of .        what was wrong with it .        it   s hard to explain .  it was all very well for us to light up our nightly revels with fireflies brightened by use of two manpower of psychic energy .  but then you men creatures installed electric lights .  our antennal reception is good for miles  but then you invented telegraphs  telephones and radios .  our kobolds mined ore with much greater efficiency than man things do  until man things invented dynamite .  do you see .        no .        surely you don   t expect sensitive and superior creatures such as the elves to watch a group of hairy mammals outdo them .  it wouldn   t be so bad if we could imitate the electronic development ourselves  but our psychic energies were insufficient for the purpose .  well  we retreated from reality .  we sulked  pined and drooped .  call it an inferiority complex  if you will  but from two centuries ago onward  we slowly abandoned mankind and retreated to such centers as avalon .     prentiss thought furiously .     let   s get this straight .  you can handle minds .        certainly .        you can make me think you   re invisible .  hypnotically  i mean .        a crude term  but yes .        and when you appeared just now  you did it by lifting a kind of mental block .  is that it .        to answer your thoughts  rather than your words  you are not sleeping  you are not mad  and i am not supernatural .        i was just making sure .  i take it  then  you can read my mind .        of course .  it is a rather dirty and unrewarding sort of labor  but i can do it when i must .  your name is prentiss and you write imaginative fiction .  you have one larva who is at a place of instruction .  i know a great deal about you .     prentiss winced .     and just where is avalon .        you won   t find it .     the elf clacked his mandibles together two or three times .     don   t speculate on the possibility of warning the authorities .  you   ll find yourself in a madhouse .  avalon  in case you think the knowledge will help you  is in the middle of the atlantic and quite invisible  you know .  after the steamboat was invented  you man things got to moving about so unreasonably that we had to cloak the whole island with a psychic shield .     of course  incidents will take place .  once a huge  barbaric vessel hit us dead center and it took all the psychic energy of the entire population to give the island the appearance of an iceberg .  the titanic  i believe  was the name printed on the vessel .  and nowadays there are planes flying overhead all the time and sometimes there are crashes .  we picked up cases of canned milk once .  that   s when i tasted it .     prentiss said     well  then  damn it  why aren   t you still on avalon .  why did you leave .        i was ordered to leave     said the elf angrily .     the fools .        oh .        you know how it is when you   re a little different .  i   m not like the rest of them and the poor tradition ridden fools resented it .  they were jealous .  that   s the best explanation .  jealous .        how are you different .        hand me that light bulb     said the elf .     oh  just unscrew it .  you don   t need a reading lamp in the daytime .     with a quiver of repulsion  prentiss did as he was told and passed the object into the little hands of the elf .  carefully  the elf  with fingers so thin and wiry that they looked like tendrils  touched the bottom and side of the brass base .  feebly the filament in the bulb reddened .     good god     said prentiss .     that     said the elf proudly     is my great talent .  i told you that we elves couldn   t adapt psychic energy to electronics .  well  i can .  i   m not just an ordinary elf .  i   m a mutant .  a super elf .  i   m the next stage in elfin evolution .  this light is due just to the activity of my own mind  you know .  now watch when i use yours as a focus .     as he said that  the bulb   s filament grew white hot and painful to look at  while a vague and not unpleasant tickling sensation entered prentiss    skull .  the lamp went out and the elf put the bulb on the desk behind the typewriter .     i haven   t tried     said the elf proudly     but i suspect i can fission uranium too .        but look here  lighting a bulb takes energy .  you can   t just hold it        i   ve told you about psychic energy .  great oberon  man thing  try to understand .     prentiss felt increasingly uneasy  he said cautiously     what do you intend doing with this gift of yours .        go back to avalon  of course .  i should let those fools go to their doom  but an elf does have a certain patriotism  even if he is a coleopteron .        a what .        we elves are not all of a species  you know .  i   m of beetle descent .  see .     he rose to his feet and  standing on the desk  turned his back to prentiss .  what had seemed merely a shining black cuticle suddenly split and lifted .  from underneath  two filmy  veined wings fluttered out .     oh  you can fly     said prentiss .     you   re very foolish     said the elf contemptuously     not to realize i   m too large for flight .  but they are attractive  aren   t they .  how do you like the iridescence .  the lepidoptera have disgusting wings in comparison .  they   re gaudy and indelicate .  what   s more they   re always sticking out .        the lepidoptera .     prentiss felt hopelessly confused .     the butterfly clans .  they   re the proud ones .  they were always letting humans see them so they could be admired .  very petty minds in a way .  and that   s why your legends always give fairies butterfly wings instead of beetle wings which are much more diaphanously beautiful .  we   ll give the lepidoptera what for when we get back  you and i .        now hold on        first think     said the elf  swaying back and forth in what looked like elfin ecstasy     our nightly revels on the fairy green will be a blaze of sparkling light from curlicues of neon tubing .  we can cut loose the swarms of wasps we   ve got hitched to our flying wagons and install internal combustion motors instead .  we can stop this business of curling up on leaves when it   s time to sleep and build factories to manufacture decent mattresses .  i tell you  we   ll live .   .   .   .  and the rest of them will eat dirt for having ordered me out .        but i can   t go with you     bleated prentiss .     i have responsibilities .  i have a wife and kid .  you wouldn   t take a man away from his his larva  would you .        i   m not cruel     said the elf .  he turned his eyes full on prentiss .     i have an elfin soul .  still  what choice have i .  i must have a man brain for focusing purposes or i will accomplish nothing  and not all man brains are suitable .        why not .        great oberon  creature .  a man brain isn   t a passive thing of wood and stone .  it must co operate in order to be useful .  and it can only co operate by being fully aware of our own elfin ability to manipulate it .  i can use your brain  for instance  but your wife   s would be useless to me .  it would take her years to understand who and what i am .     prentiss said     this is a damned insult .  are you telling me i believe in fairies .  i   ll have you know i   m a complete rationalist .        are you .  when i first revealed myself to you  you had a few feeble thoughts about dreams and hallucinations but you talked to me  you accepted me .  your wife would have screamed and gone into hysterics .     prentiss was silent .  he could think of no answer .     that   s the trouble     said the elf despondently .     practically all you humans have forgotten about us since we left you .  your minds have closed  grown useless .  to be sure  your larvae believe in your legends about the    little folk     but their brains are undeveloped and useful only for simple processes .  when they mature  they lose belief .  frankly  i don   t know what i would do if it weren   t for you fantasy writers .        what do you mean we fantasy writers .        you are the few remaining adults who believe in the insect folk .  you  prentiss  most of all .  you   ve been a fantasy writer for twenty years .        you   re mad .  i don   t believe the things i write .        you have to .  you can   t help it .  i mean  while you   re actually writing  you take the subject matter seriously .  after a while your mind is just naturally cultivated into usefulness .   .   .   .  but why argue .  i have used you .  you saw the light bulb brighten .  so you see you must come with me .        but i won   t .     prentiss set his limbs stubbornly .     can you make me against my will .        i could  but i might damage you  and i wouldn   t want that .  suppose we say this .  if you don   t agree to come  i could focus a current of high voltage electricity through your wife .  it would be a revolting thing to have to do  but i understand your own people execute enemies of the state in that fashion  so that you would probably find the punishment less horrible than i do .  i wouldn   t want to seem brutal even to a man thing .     prentiss grew conscious of the perspiration matting the short hairs on his temple .     wait     he said     don   t do anything like that .  let   s talk it over .     the elf shot out his filmy wings  fluttered them and returned them to their case .     talk  talk  talk .  it   s tiring .  surely you have milk in the house .  you   re not a very thoughtful host or you would have offered me refreshment before this .     prentiss tried to bury the thought that came to him  to push it as far below the outer skin of his mind as he could .  he said casually     i have something better than milk .  here  i   ll get it for you .        stay where you are .  call to your wife .  she   ll bring it .        but i don   t want her to see you .  it would frighten her .     the elf said     you need feel no concern .  i   ll handle her so that she won   t be the least disturbed .     prentiss lifted an arm .  the elf said     any attack you make on me will be far slower than the bolt of electricity that will strike your wife .     prentiss    arm dropped .  he stepped to the door of his study .     blanche .     he called down the stairs .  blanche was just visible in the living room  sitting woodenly in the armchair near the bookcase .  she seemed to be asleep  open eyed .  prentiss turned to the elf .     something   s wrong with her .        she   s just in a state of sedation .  she   ll hear you .  tell her what to do .        blanche .     he called again .     bring the container of eggnog and a small glass  will you .     with no sign of animation other than that of bare movement  blanche rose and disappeared from view .     what is eggnog .     asked the elf .  prentiss attempted enthusiasm .     it is a compound of milk  sugar and eggs beaten to a delightful consistency .  milk alone is poor staff compared to it .     blanche entered with the eggnog .  her pretty face was expressionless .  her eyes turned toward the elf but lightened with no realization of the significance of the sight .     here  jan     she said  and sat down in the old  leather covered chair by the window  hands falling loosely to her lap .  prentiss watched her uneasily for a moment .     are you going to keep her here .        she   ll be easier to control .   .   .   .  well  aren   t you going to offer me the eggnog .        oh  sure .  here .     he poured the thick white liquid into the cocktail glass .  he had prepared five milk bottles of it two nights before for the boys of the new york fantasy association and it had been mixed with a lavish hand  since fantasy writers notoriously like it so .  the elf   s antennae trembled violently .     a heavenly aroma     he muttered .  he wrapped the ends of his thin arms about the stem of the small glass and lifted it to his mouth .  the liquid   s level sank .  when half was gone  he put it down and sighed     oh  the loss to my people .  what a creation .  what a thing to exist .  our histories tell us that in ancient days an occasional lucky sprite managed to take the place of a man larva at birth so that he might draw off the liquid fresh made .  i wonder if even those ever experienced anything like this .     prentiss said with a touch of professional interest     that   s the idea behind this business of changelings  is it .        of course .  the female man creature has a great gift .  why not take advantage of it .     the elf turned his eyes upon the rise and fall of blanche   s bosom and sighed again .  prentiss said  not too eager  now  don   t give it away      go ahead .  drink all you want .     he  too  watched blanche  waiting for signs of restoring animation  waiting for the beginnings of breakdown in the elf   s control .  the elf said     when is your larva returning from its place of instruction .  i need him .        soon  soon     said prentiss nervously .  he looked at his wristwatch .  actually  jan  junior  would be back  yelling for a slab of cake and milk  in something like fifteen minutes .     fill    er up     he said urgently .     fill    er up .     the elf sipped gaily .  he said     once the larva arrives  you can go .        go .        only to the library .  you   ll have to get volumes on electronics .  i   ll need the details on how to build television  telephones  all that .  i   ll need to have rules on wiring  instructions for constructing vacuum tubes .  details  pren tiss  details .  we have tremendous tasks ahead of us .  oil drilling  gasoline refining  motors  scientific agriculture .  we   ll build a new avalon  you and i .  a technical one .  a scientific fairyland .  we will create a new world .        great .     said prentiss .     here  don   t neglect your drink .        you see .  you are catching fire with the idea     said the elf .     and you will be rewarded .  you will have a dozen female man things to yourself .     prentiss looked at blanche automatically .  no signs of hearing  but who could tell .  he said     i   d have no use for female man th for women  i mean .        come now     said the elf censoriously     be truthful .  you men things are well known to our folk as lecherous  bestial creatures .  mothers frightened their young for generations by threatening them with men things .   .   .   .  young  ah .     he lifted the glass of eggnog in the air and said     to my own young     and drained it .     fill    er up     said prentiss at once .     fill    er up .     the elf did so .  he said     i   ll have lots of children .  i   ll pick out the best of the coleoptresses and breed my line .  i   ll continue the mutation .  right now i   m the only one  but when we have a dozen or fifty  i   ll interbreed them and develop the race of the super elf .  a race of electro ulp electronic marvels and infinite future .   .  .  .  if i could only drink more .  nectar .  the original nectar .     there was the sudden noise of a door being flung open and a young voice calling     mom .  hey  mom .     the elf  his glossy eyes a little dimmed  said     then we   ll begin to take over the men things .  a few believe already  the rest we will urp teach .  it will be the old days  but better  a more efficient elfhood  a tighter union .     jan  junior   s  voice was closer and tinged with impatience .     hey  mom .  ain   t you home .     prentiss felt his eyes popping with tension .  blanche sat rigid .  the elf   s speech was slightly thick  his balance a little unsteady .  if prentiss were going to risk it  now  now was the time .     sit back     said the elf peremptorily .     you   re being foolish .  i knew there was alcohol in the eggnog from the moment you thought your ridiculous scheme .  you men things are very shifty .  we elves have many proverbs about you .  fortunately  alcohol has little effect upon us .  now if you had tried catnip with just a touch of honey in it  .  .  .  ah  here is the larva .  how are you  little man thing .     the elf sat there  the goblet of eggnog halfway to his mandibles  while jan  junior  stood in the doorway .  jan  junior   s  ten year old face was moderately smeared with dirt  his hair was immoderately matted and there was a look of the utmost surprise in his gray eyes .  his battered schoolbooks swayed from the end of the strap he held in his hand .  he said     pop .  what   s the matter with mom .  and and what   s that .     the elf said to prentiss     hurry to the library .  no time must be lost .  you know the books i need .     all trace of incipient drunkenness had left the creature and prentiss    morale broke .  the creature had been playing with him .  prentiss got up to go .  the elf said     and nothing human  nothing sneaky  no tricks .  your wife is still a hostage .  i can use the larva   s mind to kill her  it   s good enough for that .  i wouldn   t want to do it .  i   m a member of the elfitarian ethical society and we advocate considerate treatment of mammals so you may rely on my noble principles if you do as i say .     prentiss felt a strong compulsion to leave flooding him .  he stumbled toward the door .  jan  junior  cried     pop  it can talk .  he says he   ll kill mom .  hey  don   t go away .     prentiss was already out of the room  when he heard the elf say     don   t stare at me  larva .  i will not harm your mother if you do exactly as i say .  i am an elf  a fairy .  you know what a fairy is  of course .     and prentiss was at the front door when he heard jan  junior   s  treble raised in wild shouting  followed by scream after scream in blanche   s shuddering soprano .  the strong  though invisible  elastic that was drawing prentiss out the house snapped and vanished .  he fell backward  righted himself and darted back up the stairs .  blanche  fairly saturated with quivering life  was backed into a corner  her arms about a weeping jan  junior .  on the desk was a collapsed black carapace  covering a nasty smear of pulpiness from which colorless liquid dripped .  jan  junior  was sobbing hysterically     i hit it .  i hit it with my school books .  it was hurting mom .      an hour passed and prentiss felt the world of normality pouring back into the interstices left behind by the creature from avalon .  the elf itself was already ash in the incinerator behind the house and the only remnant of its existence was the damp stain at the foot of his desk .  blanche was still sickly pale .  they talked in whispers .  prentiss said     how   s jan  junior .        he   s watching television .        is he all right .        oh  he   s all right  but i   ll be having nightmares for weeks .        i know .  so will i unless we can get it out of our minds .  i don   t think there   ll ever be another of those things here .     blanche said     i can   t explain how awful it was .  i kept hearing every word he said  even when i was down in the living room .        it was telepathy  you see .        i just couldn   t move .  then  after you left  i could begin to stir a bit .  i tried to scream but all i could do was moan and whimper .  then jan  junior  smashed him and all at once i was free .  i don   t understand how it happened .     prentiss felt a certain gloomy satisfaction .     i think i know .  i was under his control because i accepted the truth of his existence .  he held you in check through me .  when i left the room  increasing distance made it harder to use my mind as a psychic lens and you could begin moving .  by the time i reached the front door  the elf thought it was time to switch from my mind to jan  junior   s .  that was his mistake .        in what way .     asked blanche .     he assumed that all children believe in fairies  but he was wrong .  here in america today children don   t believe in fairies .  they never hear of them .  they believe in tom corbett  in hopalong cassidy  in dick tracy  in howdy doody  in superman and a dozen other things  but not in fairies .     the elf just never realized the sudden cultural changes brought about by comic books and television  and when he tried to grab jan  junior   s mind  he couldn   t .  before he could recover his psychic balance  jan  junior  was on top of him in a swinging panic because he thought you were being hurt and it was all over .     it   s like i   ve always said  blanche .  the ancient folk motifs of legend survive only in the modern fantasy magazine  and modem fantasy is purely adult fare .  do you finally see my point .     blanche said humbly     yes  dear .     prentiss put his hands in his pockets and grinned slowly .     you know  blanche  next time i see walt rae  i think i   ll just drop a hint that i write the stuff .  time the neighbors knew  i think .      jan  junior  holding an enormous slice of buttered bread  wandered into his father   s study in search of the dimming memory .  pop kept slapping him on the back and mom kept putting bread and cake in his hands and he was forgetting why .  there had been this big old thing on the desk that could talk  .   .   .  it had all happened so quickly that it got mixed up in his mind .  he shrugged his shoulders and  in the late afternoon sunlight  looked at the partly typewritten sheet in his father   s typewriter  then at the small pile of paper resting on the desk .  he read a while  curled his lip and muttered     gee whiz .  fairies again .  always kid stuff .     and wandered off .   the watery place  we   re never going to have space travel .  what   s more  no extraterrestrials will ever land on earth at least  any more .  i   m not just being a pessimist .  as a matter of fact  space travel is possible  extraterrestrials have landed .  i know that .  space ships are crisscrossing space among a million worlds  probably  but we   ll never join them .  i know that  too .  all on account of a ridiculous error .  i   ll explain .  it was actually bart cameron   s error and you   ll have to understand about bart cameron .  he   s the sheriff at twin gulch  idaho  and i   m his deputy .  bart cameron is an impatient man and he gets most impatient when he has to work up his income tax .  you see  besides being sheriff  he also owns and runs the general store  he   s got some shares in a sheep ranch  he does a bit of assay work  he   s got a kind of pension for being a disabled veteran  bad knee  and a few other things like that .  naturally  it makes his tax figures complicated .  it wouldn   t be so bad if he   d let a tax man work on the forms with him  but he insists on doing it himself and it makes him a bitter man .  by april     he isn   t approachable .  so it   s too bad the flying saucer landed on april          .  i saw it land .  my chair was backed up against the wall in the sheriff   s office  and i was looking at the stars through the windows and feeling too lazy to go back to my magazine and wondering if i ought to knock off and hit the sack or keep on listening to cameron curse real steady as he went over his columns of figures for the hundred twenty seventh time .  it looked like a shooting star at first  but then the track of light broadened into two things that looked like rocket exhausts and the thing came down sweet  steady and without a sound .  an old  dead leaf would have rustled more coming down and landed thumpier .  two men got out .  i couldn   t say anything or do anything .  i couldn   t choke or point  i couldn   t even bug my eyes .  i just sat there .  cameron .  he never looked up .  there was a knock on the door which wasn   t locked .  it opened and the two men from the flying saucer stepped in .  i would have thought they were city fellows if i hadn   t seen the flying saucer land in the scrub .  they wore charcoal gray suits  with white shirts and maroon four in hands .  they had on black shoes and black homburgs .  they had dark complexions  black wavy hair and brown eyes .  they had very serious looks on their faces and were about five foot ten apiece .  they looked very much alike .  god  i was scared .  but cameron just looked up when the door opened and frowned .  ordinarily  i guess he   d have laughed the collar button off his shirt at seeing clothes like that in twin gulch  but he was so taken up by his income tax that he never cracked a smile .  he said     what can i do for you  folks .     and he tapped his hand on the forms so it was obvious he hadn   t much time .  one of the two stepped forward .  he said     we have had your people under observation a long time .     he pronounced each word carefully and all by itself .  cameron said     my people .  all i got   s a wife .  what   s she been doing .     the fellow in the suit said     we have chosen this locality for our first contact because it is isolated and peaceful .  we know that you are the leader here .        i   m the sheriff  if that   s what you mean  so spit it out .  what   s you trouble .        we have been careful to adopt your mode of dress and even to assume your appearance .        that   s my mode of dress .     he must have noticed it for the first time .     the mode of dress of your dominant social class  that is .  we have also learned your language .     you could see the light break in on cameron .  he said     you guys foreigners .     cameron didn   t go much for foreigners  never having met many outside the army  but generally he tried to be fair .  the man from the saucer said     foreigners .  indeed we are .  we come from the watery place your people call venus .      i was just collecting up strength to blink my eyes  but that sent me right back to nothing .  i had seen the flying saucer .  i had seen it land .  i had to believe this .  these men or these somethings came from venus .   but cameron never blinked an eye .  he said     all right .  this is the u . s . a .  we all got equal rights regardless of race  creed  color  or nationality .  i   m at your service .  what can i do for you .        we would like to have you make immediate arrangements for the important men of your u . s . a .   as you call it  to be brought here for discussions leading to your people joining our great organization .     slowly  cameron got red .     our people join your organization .  we   re already part of the u . n .  and god knows what else .  and i suppose i   m to get the president here  eh .  right now .  in twin gulch .  send a hurry up message .     he looked at me  as though he wanted to see a smile on my face  but i couldn   t as much as fall down if someone had pushed the chair out from under me .  the saucer man said     speed is desirable .        you want congress  too .  the supreme court .        if they will help  sheriff .     and cameron really went to pieces .  he banged his income tax form and yelled     well  you   re not helping me  and i have no time for wise guy jerks who come around  especially foreigners .  if you don   t get the hell out of here pronto  i   ll lock you up for disturbing the peace and i   ll never let you out .        you wish us to leave .     said the man from venus .     right now .  get the hell out of here and back to wherever you   re from and don   t ever come back .  i don   t want to see you and no one else around here does .     the two men looked at each other  making little twitches with their faces .  then the one who had done all the talking said     i can see in your mind that you really wish  with great intensity  to be left alone .  it is not our way to force ourselves or our organization on people who do not wish us or it .  we will respect your privacy and leave .  we will not return .  we will girdle your world in warning and none will enter and your people will never have to leave .     cameron said     mister  i   m tired of this crap  so i   ll count to three     they turned and left  and i just knew that everything they said was so .  i was listening to them  you see  which cameron wasn   t  because he was busy thinking of his income tax  and it was as though i could hear their minds  know what i mean .  i knew that there would be a kind of fence around earth  corralling us in  keeping us from leaving  keeping others from coming   in .  i knew it .  and when they left  i got my voice back too late .  i screamed     cameron  for god   s sake  they   re from space .  why   d you send them away .        from space .     he stared at me .  i yelled     look .     i don   t know how i did it  he being twenty five pounds heavier than i  but i yanked him to the window by his shirt collar  busting every shirt button off him .  he was too surprised to resist and when he recovered his wits enough to make like he was going to knock me down  he caught sight of what was going on outside the window and the breath went out of him .  they were getting into the flying saucer  those two men  and the saucer sat there  large  round  shiny and kind of powerful  you know .  then it took off .  it went up easy as a feather and a red orange glow showed up on one side and got brighter as the ship got smaller till it was a shooting star again  slowly fading out .  and i said     sheriff  why   d you send them away .  they had to see the president .  now they   ll never come back .     cameron said     i thought they were foreigners .  they said they had to learn our language .  and they talked funny .        oh  fine .  foreigners .        they said they were foreigners and they looked italian .  i thought they were italian .        how could they be italian .  they said they were from the planet venus .  i heard them .  they said so .        the planet venus .     his eyes got real round .     they said it .  they called it the watery place or something .  you know venus has a lot of water on it .     but you see  it was just an error  a stupid error  the kind anyone could make .  only now earth is never going to have space travel and we   ll never as much as land on the moon or have another venusian visit us .  that dope  cameron  and his income tax .  because he whispered     venus .  when they talked about the watery place  i thought they meant venice .      living space  clarence rimbro had no objections to living in the only house on an uninhabited planet  any more than had any other of earth   s even trillion of inhabitants .  if someone had questioned him concerning possible objections  he would undoubtedly have stared blankly at the questioner .  his house was much larger than any house could possibly be on earth proper and much more modern .  it had its independent air supply and water supply  ample food in its freezing compartments .  it was isolated from the lifeless planet on which it was located by a force field  but the rooms were built about a five acre farm  under glass  of course   which  in the planet   s beneficent sunlight  grew flowers for pleasure and vegetables for health .  it even supported a few chickens .  it gave mrs .  rimbro something to do with herself afternoons  and a place for the two little rimbros to play when they were tired of indoors .  furthermore  if one wanted to be on earth proper  if one insisted on it  if one had to have people around and air one could breathe in the open or water to swim in  one had only to go out of the front door of the house .  so where was the difficulty .  remember  too  that on the lifeless planet on which the rimbro house was located there was complete silence except for the occasional monotonous effects of wind and rain .  there was absolute privacy and the feeling of absolute ownership of two hundred million square miles of planetary surface .  clarence rimbro appreciated all that in his distant way .  he was an accountant  skilled in handling very advanced computer models  precise in his manners and clothing  not much given to smiling beneath his thin  well kept mustache and properly aware of his own worth .  when he drove from work toward home  he passed the occasional dwelling place on earth proper and he never ceased to stare at them with a certain smugness .  well  either for business reasons or mental perversion  some people simply had to live on earth proper .  it was too bad for them .  after all  earth proper   s soil had to supply the minerals and basic food supply for all the trillion of inhabitants  in fifty years  it would be two trillion  and space was at a premium .  houses on earth proper just couldn   t be any bigger than that  and people who had to live in them had to adjust to the fact .  even the process of entering his house had its mild pleasantness .  he would enter the community twist place to which he was assigned  it looked  as did all such  like a rather stumpy obelisk   and there he would invariably find others waiting to use it .  still more would arrive before he reached the head of the line .  it was a sociable time .     how   s your planet .        how   s yours .     the usual small talk .  sometimes someone would be having trouble .  machinery breakdowns or serious weather that would alter the terrain unfavorably .  not often .  but it passed the time .  then rimbro would be at the head of the line  he would put his key into the slot  the proper combination would be punched  and he would be twisted into a new probability pattern  his own particular probability pattern  the one assigned to him when he married and became a producing citizen  a probability pattern in which life had never developed on earth .  and twisting to this particular lifeless earth  he would walk into his own foyer .  just like that .  he never worried about being in another probability .  why should he .  he never gave it any thought .  there were an infinite number of possible earths .  each existed in its own niche  its own probability pattern .  since on a planet such as earth there was  according to calculation  about a fifty fifty chance of life   s developing  half of all the possible earths  still infinite  since half of infinity was infinity  possessed life  and half  still infinite  did not .  and living on about three hundred billion of the unoccupied earths were three hundred billion families  each with its own beautiful house  powered by the sun of that probability  and each securely at peace .  the number of earths so occupied grew by millions each day .  and then one day  rimbro came home and sandra  his wife  said to him  as he entered     there   s been the most peculiar noise .     rimbro   s eyebrows shot up and he looked closely at his wife .  except for a certain restlessness of her thin hands and a pale look about the corners of her tight mouth  she looked normal .  rimbro said  still holding his topcoat halfway toward the servette that waited patiently for it     noise .  what noise .  i don   t hear anything .        it   s stopped now     sandra said .     really  it was like a deep thumping or rumble .  you   d hear it a bit .  then it would stop .  then you   d hear it a bit and so on .  i   ve never heard anything like it .     rimbro surrendered his coat .     but that   s quite impossible .        i heard it .        i   ll look over the machinery     he mumbled .     something may be wrong .     nothing was  that his accountant   s eyes could discover  and  with a shrug  he went to supper .  he listened to the servettes hum busily about their different chores  watched one sweep up the plates and cutlery for disposal and recovery  then said  pursing his lips     maybe one of the servettes is out of order .  i   ll check them .        it wasn   t anything like that  clarence .     rimbro went to bed  without further concern over the matter  and wakened with his wife   s hand clutching his shoulder .  his hand went automatically to the contact patch that set the walls glowing .     what   s the matter .  what time is it .     she shook her head .     listen .  listen .     good lord  thought rimbro  there is a noise .  a definite rumbling .  it came and went .     earthquake .     he whispered .  it did happen  of course  though  with all the planet to choose from  they could generally count on having avoided the faulted areas .     all day long .     asked sandra fretfully .     i think it   s something else .     and then she voiced the secret terror of every nervous householder .     i think there   s someone on the planet with us .  this earth is inhabited .     rimbro did the logical things .  when morning came  he took his wife and children to his wife   s mother .  he himself took a day off and hurried to the sector   s housing bureau .  he was quite annoyed at all his .  bill ching of the housing bureau was short  jovial and proud of his part mongolian ancestry .  he thought probability patterns had solved every last one of humanity   s problems .  alec mishnoff  also of the housing bureau  thought probability patterns were a snare into which humanity had been hopelessly tempted .  he had originally majored in archeology and had studied a variety of antiquarian subjects with which his delicately poised head was still crammed .  his face managed to look sensitive despite overbearing eyebrows  and he lived with a pet notion that so far he had dared tell no one  though preoccupation with it had driven him out of archeology and into housing .  ching was fond of saying     the hell with malthus .     it was almost a verbal trademark of his .     the hell with malthus .  we can   t possibly overpopulate now .  however frequently we double and redouble  homo sapiens remains finite in number  and the uninhabited earths remain infinite .  and we don   t have to put one house on each planet .  we can put a hundred  a thousand  a million .  plenty of room and plenty of power from each probability sun .        more than one on a planet .     said mishnoff sourly .  ching knew exactly what he meant .  when probability patterns had first been put to use  sole ownership of a planet had been powerful inducement for early settlers .  it appealed to the snob and despot in every one .  what man so poor  ran the slogan  as not to have an empire larger than genghis khan   s .  to introduce multiple settling now would outrage everyone .  ching said  with a shrug     all right  it would take psychological preparation .  so what .  that   s what it took to start the whole deal in the first place .        and food .     asked mishnoff .     you know we   re putting hydroponic works and yeast plants in other probability patterns .  and if we had to  we could cultivate their soil .        wearing space suits and importing oxygen .        we could reduce carbon dioxide for oxygen till the plants got going and they   d do the job after that .        given a million years .        mishnoff  the trouble with you     ching said     is you read too many ancient history books .  you   re an obstructionist .     but ching was too good natured really to mean that  and mishnoff continued to read books and to worry .  mishnoff longed for the day he could get up the courage necessary to see the head of the section and put right out in plain view bang  like that exactly what it was that was troubling him .  but now  a mr .  clarence rimbro faced them  perspiring slightly and toweringly angry at the fact that it had taken him the better part of two days to reach this far into the bureau .  he reached his exposition   s climax by saying     and i say the planet is inhabited and i don   t propose to stand for it .     having listened to his story in full  ching tried the soothing approach .  he said     noise like that is probably just some natural phenomenon .        what kind of natural phenomenon .     demanded rimbro .     i want an investigation .  if it   s a natural phenomenon  i want to know what kind .  i say the place is inhabited .  it has life on it  by heaven  and i   m not paying rent on a planet to share it .  and with dinosaurs  from the sound of it .        come  mr .  rimbro  how long have you lived on your earth .        fifteen and a half years .        and has there ever been any evidence of life .        there is now  and  as a citizen with a production record classified as a i  i demand an investigation .        of course we   ll investigate  sir  but we just want to assure you now that everything is all right .  do you realize how carefully we select our probability patterns .        i   m an accountant .  i have a pretty good idea     said rimbro at once .     then surely you know our computers cannot fail us .  they never pick a probability which has been picked before .  they can   t possibly .  and they   re geared to select only probability patterns in which earth has a carbon dioxide atmosphere  one in which plant life  and therefore animal life  has never developed .  because if plants had evolved  the carbon dioxide would have been reduced to oxygen .  do you understand .        i understand it all very well and i   m not here for lectures     said rimbro .     i want an investigation out of you and nothing else .  it is quite humiliating to think i may be sharing my world  my own world  with something or other  and i don   t propose to endure it .        no  of course not     muttered ching  avoiding mishnoff   s sardonic glance .     we   ll be there before night .     they were on their way to the twisting place with full equipment .  mishnoff said     i want to ask you something .  why do you go through that there   s no need to worry  sir    routine .  they always worry anyway .  where does it get you .        i   ve got to try .  they shouldn   t worry     said ching petulantly .     ever hear of a carbon dioxide planet that was inhabited .  besides  rimbro is the type that starts rumors .  i can spot them .  by the time he   s through  if he   s encouraged  he   ll say his sun went nova .        that happens sometimes     said mishnoff .     so .  one house is wiped out and one family dies .  see  you   re an obstructionist .  in the old times  the times you like  if there were a flood in china or someplace  thousands of people would die .  and that   s out of a population of a measly billion or two .     mishnoff muttered     how do you know the rimbro planet doesn   t have life on it .        carbon dioxide atmosphere .        but suppose     it was no use .  mishnoff couldn   t say it .  he finished lamely     suppose plant and animal life develops that can live on carbon dioxide .        it   s never been observed .        in an infinite number of worlds  anything can happen .     he finished that   in a whisper .     everything must happen .        chances are one in a duodecillion     said ching  shrugging .  they arrived at the twisting point then  and  having utilized the freight twist for their vehicle  thus sending it into the rimbro storage area   they entered the rimbro probability pattern themselves .  first ching  then mishnoff .     a nice house     said ching  with satisfaction .     very nice model .  good taste .        hear anything .     asked mishnoff .     no .     ching wandered into the garden .     hey     he yelled .     rhode island reds .     mishnoff followed  looking up at the glass roof .  the sun looked like the sun of a trillion other earths .  he said absently     there could be plant life  just starting out .  the carbon dioxide might just be starting to drop in concentration .  the computer would never know .        and it would take millions of years for animal life to begin and millions more for it to come out of the sea .        it doesn   t have to follow that pattern .     ching put an arm about his partner   s shoulder .     you brood .  someday  you   ll tell me what   s really bothering you  instead of just hinting  and we can straighten you out .     mishnoff shrugged off the encircling arm with an annoyed frown .  ching   s tolerance was always hard to bear .  he began     let   s not psychothera pize     he broke off  then whispered     listen .     there was a distant rumble .  again .  they placed the seismograph in the center of the room and activated the force field that penetrated downward and bound it rigidly to bedrock .  they watched the quivering needle record the shocks .  mishnoff said     surface waves only .  very superficial .  it   s not underground .     ching looked a little more dismal     what is it then .        i think     said mishnoff     we   d better find out .     his face was gray with apprehension .     we   ll have to set up a seismograph at another point and get a fix on the focus of the disturbance .        obviously     said ching .     i   ll go out with the other seismograph .  you stay here .        no     said mishnoff  with energy .     i   ll go out .     mishnoff felt terrified  but he had no choice .  if this were it  he would be prepared .  he could get a warning through .  sending out an unsuspecting ching would be disastrous .  nor could he warn ching  who would certainly never believe him .  but since mishnoff was not cast in the heroic mold  he trembled as he got into his oxygen suit and fumbled the disrupter as he tried to dissolve the force field locally in order to free the emergency exit .     any reason you want to go  particularly .     asked ching  watching the other   s inept manipulations .     i   m willing .        it   s all right .  i   m going out     said mishnoff  out of a dry throat  and stepped into the lock that led out onto the desolate surface of a lifeless earth .  a presumably lifeless earth .  the sight was not unfamiliar to mishnoff .  he had seen its like dozens of times .  bare rock  weathered by wind and rain  crusted and powdered with sand in the gullies  a small and noisy brook beating itself against its stony course .  all brown and gray  no sign of green .  no sound of life .  yet the sun was the same and  when night fell  the constellations would be the same .  the situation of the dwelling place was in that region which on earth proper would be called labrador .   it was labrador here  too  really .  it had been calculated that in not more than one out of a quadrillion or so earths were there significant changes in the geological development .  the continents were everywhere recognizable down to quite small details .   despite the situation and the time of the year  which was october  the temperature was sticky warm due to the hothouse effect of the carbon dioxide in this earth   s dead atmosphere .  from inside his suit  through the transparent visor  mishnoff watched it all somberly .  if the epicenter of the noise were close by  adjusting the second seismograph a mile or so away would be enough for the fix .  if it weren   t  they would have to bring in an air scooter .  well  assume the lesser complication to begin with .  methodically  he made his way up a rocky hillside .  once at the top  he could choose his spot .  once at the top  puffing and feeling the heat most unpleasantly  he found he didn   t have to .  his heart was pounding so that he could scarcely hear his own voice as he yelled into his radio mouthpiece     hey  ching  there   s construction going on .        what .     came back the appalled shout in his ears .  there was no mistake .  ground was being leveled .  machinery was at work .  rock was being blasted out .  mishnoff shouted     they   re blasting .  that   s the noise .     ching called back     but it   s impossible .  the computer would never pick the same probability pattern twice .  it couldn   t .        you don   t understand     began mishnoff .  but ching was following his own thought processes .     get over there  mishnoff .  i   m coming out  too .        no  damn it .  you stay there     cried mishnoff in alarm .     keep me in radio contact  and for god   s sake be ready to leave for earth proper on wings if i give the word .        why .     demanded ching .     what   s going on .        i don   t know yet     said mishnoff .     give me a chance to find out .     to his own surprise  he noticed his teeth were chattering .  muttering breathless curses at the computer  at probability patterns and at the insatiable need for living space on the part of a trillion human beings expanding in numbers like a puff of smoke  mishnoff slithered and slipped down the other side of the slope  setting stones to rolling and rousing peculiar echoes .  a man came out to meet him  dressed in a gas tight suit  different in many details from mishnoff   s own  but obviously intended for the same purpose to lead oxygen to the lungs .  mishnoff gasped breathlessly into his mouthpiece     hold it  ching .  there   s a man coming .  keep in touch .     mishnoff felt his heart pump more easily and the bellows of his lungs labor less .  the two men were staring at one another .  the other man was blond and craggy of face .  the look of surprise about him was too extreme to be feigned .  he said in a harsh voice     wer sind sie .  was machen sie hier .     mishnoff was thunderstruck .  he   d studied ancient german for two years in the days when he expected to be an archeologist and he followed the comment despite the fact that the pronunciation was not what he had been taught .  the stranger was asking his identity and his business there .  stupidly  mishnoff stammered     sprechen sie deutsch .    and then had to mutter reassurance to ching whose agitated voice in his earpiece was demanding to know what the gibberish was all about .  the german speaking one made no direct answer .  he repeated     wer sind sie .     and added impatiently     hier ist fiir ein verriickten spass keine zeit .     mishnoff didn   t feel like a joke either  particularly not a foolish one  but he continued     sprechen sie planetisch .     he did not know the german for    planetary standard language    so he had to guess .  too late  he thought he should have referred to it simply as english .  the other man stared wide eyed at him .     sind sie wahnsinnig .     mishnoff was almost willing to settle for that  but in feeble self defense  he said     i   m not crazy  damn it .  i mean     aufdererde woher sie gekom     he gave it up for lack of german  but the new idea that was rattling inside his skull would not quit its nagging .  he had to find some way of testing it .  he said desperately     welches fahr ist es jetzt .     presumably  the stranger  who was questioning his sanity already  would be convinced of mishnoff   s insanity now that he was being asked what year it was  but it was one question for which mishnoff had the necessary german .  the other muttered something that sounded suspiciously like good german swearing and then said     es ist dock zwei tausend drei hundert vier und sechzig  und warum     the stream of german that followed was completely incomprehensible to mishnoff  but in any case he had had enough for the moment .  if he translated the german correctly  the year given him was       which was nearly two thousand years in the past .  how could that be .  he muttered     zwei tausend drei hundert vier und sechzig .        ja  fa     said the other  with deep sarcasm .     zwei tausend drei hundert vier und sechzig .  der ganze fahr long ist es so gewesen .     mishnoff shrugged .  the statement that it had been so all year long was a feeble witticism even in german and it gained nothing in translation .  he pondered .  but then the other   s ironical tone deepening  the german speaking one went on     zwei tausend drei hundert vier und sechzig nach hitler .  hilft das ihnen vielleicht .  nach hitler .     mishnoff yelled with delight .     that does help me .  es hilft .  horen sie  bitte     he went on in broken german interspersed with scraps of planetary     for heaven   s sake  urn gottes willen     making it      after hitler was different altogether .  he put german together desperately  trying to explain .  the other frowned and grew thoughtful .  he lifted his gloved hand to stroke his chin or make some equivalent gesture  hit the transparent visor that covered his face and left his hand there uselessly  while he thought .  he said  suddenly     ich heiss george fallenby .     to mishnoff it seemed that the name must be of anglo saxon derivation  although the change in vowel form as pronounced by the other made it seem teutonic .     guten tag     said mishnoff awkwardly .     ich heiss alec mishnoff     and was suddenly aware of the slavic derivation of his own name .     kommen sie mit mir  hen mishnoff     said fallenby .  mishnoff followed with a strained smile  muttering into his transmitter     it   s all right  ching .  it   s all right .     back on earth proper  mishnoff faced the sector   s bureau head  who had grown old in the service  whose every gray hair betokened a problem met and solved  and every missing hair a problem averted .  he was a cautious man with eyes still bright and teeth that were still his own .  his name was berg .  he shook his head .     and they speak german  but the german you studied was two thousand years old .        true     said mishnoff .     but the english hemingway used is two thousand years old and planetary is close enough for anyone to be able to read it .        hmp .  and who   s this hitler .        he was a sort of tribal chief in ancient times .  he led the german tribe in one of the wars of the twentieth century  just about the time the atomic age started and true history began .        before the devastation  you mean .        right .  there was a series of wars then .  the anglo saxon countries won out  and i suppose that   s why the earth speaks planetary .        and if hitler and his germans had won out  the world would speak german instead .        they have won out on fallenby   s earth  sir  and they do speak german .        and make their dates    after hitler    instead of a . d .  .        right .  and i suppose there   s an earth in which the slavic tribes won out and everyone speaks russian .        somehow     said berg     it seems to me we should have foreseen it  and yet  as far as i know  no one has .  after all  there are an infinite number of inhabited earths  and we can   t be the only one that has decided to solve the problem of unlimited population growth by expanding into the worlds of probability .        exactly     said mishnoff earnestly     and it seems to me that if you think of it  there must be countless inhabited earths so doing and there must be many multiple occupations in the three hundred billion earths we ourselves occupy .  the only reason we caught this one is that  by sheer chance  they decided to build within a mile of the dwelling we had placed there .  this is something we must check .        you imply we ought to search all our earths .        i do  sir .  we   ve got to make some settlement with other inhabited earths .  after all  there is room for all of us and to expand without agreement may result in all sorts of trouble and conflict .        yes     said berg thoughtfully .     i agree with you .     clarence rimbro stared suspiciously at berg   s old face  creased now into all manner of benevolence .     you   re sure now .        absolutely     said the bureau head .     we   re sorry that you   ve had to accept temporary quarters for the last two weeks        more like three .         three weeks  but you will be compensated .        what was the noise .        purely geological  sir .  a rock was delicately balanced and  with the wind  it made occasional contact with the rocks of the hillside .  we   ve removed it and surveyed the area to make certain that nothing similar will occur again .     rimbro clutched his hat and said     well  thanks for your trouble .        no thanks necessary  i assure you  mr .  rimbro .  this is our job .     rimbro was ushered out  and berg turned to mishnoff  who had remained a quiet spectator of this completion of the rimbro affair .  berg said     the germans were nice about it  anyway .  they admitted we had priority and got off .  room for everybody  they said .  of course  as it turned out  they build any number of dwellings on each unoccupied world .   .   .   .  and now there   s the project of surveying our other worlds and making similar agreements with whomever we find .  it   s all strictly confidential  too .  it can   t be made known to the populace without plenty of preparation .   .   .   .  still  none of this is what i want to speak to you about .        oh .     said mishnoff .  developments had not noticeably cheered him .  his own bogey still concerned him .  berg smiled at the younger man .     you understand  mishnoff  we in the bureau  and in the planetary government  too  are very appreciative of your quick thinking  of your understanding of the situation .  this could have developed into something very tragic  had it not been for you .  this appreciation will take some tangible form .        thank you  sir .        but  as i said once before  this is something many of us should have thought of .  how is it you did .   .   .   .  now we   ve gone into your background a little .  your co worker  ching  tells us you have hinted in the past at some serious danger involved in our probability pattern setup  and that you insisted on going out to meet the germans although you were obviously frightened .  you were anticipating what you actually found  were you not .  and how did you do it .     mishnoff said confusedly     no  no .  that was not in my mind at all .  it came as a surprise .  i     suddenly he stiffened .  why not now .  they were grateful to him .  he had proved that he was a man to be taken into account .  one unexpected thing had already happened .  he said firmly     there   s something else .        yes .      how did one begin .      there   s no life in the solar system other than the life on earth .        that   s right     said berg benevolently .     and computation has it that the probability of developing any form of interstellar travel is so low as to be infinitesimal .        what are you getting at .        that all this is so in this probability .  but there must be some probability patterns in which other life does exist in the solar system or in which interstellar drives are developed by dwellers in other star systems .     berg frowned .     theoretically .        in one of these probabilities  earth may be visited by such intelligences .  if it were a probability pattern in which earth is inhabited  it won   t affect us  they   ll have no connection with us in earth proper .  but if it were a probability pattern in which earth is uninhabited and they set up some sort of a base  they may find  by happenstance  one of our dwelling places .        why ours .     demanded berg dryly .     what not a dwelling place of the germans  for instance .        because we spot our dwellings one to a world .  the german earth doesn   t .  probably very few others do .  the odds are in favor of us by billions to one .  and if extraterrestrials do find such a dwelling  they   ll investigate and find the route to earth proper  a highly developed  rich world .        not if we turn off the twisting place     said berg .     once they know that twisting places exist  they can construct their own     said mishnoff .     a race intelligent enough to travel through space could do that  and from the equipment in the dwelling they would take over  they could easily spot our particular probability .   .   .   .  and then how would we handle extraterrestrials .  they   re not germans  or other earths .  they would have alien psychologies and motivations .  and we   re not even on our guard .  we just keep setting up more and more worlds and increasing the chance every day that     his voice had risen in excitement and berg shouted at him     nonsense .  this is all ridiculous     the buzzer sounded and the communiplate brightened and showed the face of ching .  ching   s voice said     i   m sorry to interrupt  but        what is it .     demanded berg savagely .     there   s a man here i don   t know what to do with .  he   s drunk or crazy .  he complains that his home is surrounded and that there are things staring through the glass roof of his garden .        things .     cried mishnoff .     purple things with big red veins  three eyes and some sort of tentacles instead of hair .  they have     but mishnoff and berg didn   t hear the rest .  they were staring at each other in sick horror .   the message  they drank beer and reminisced as men will who have met after long separation .  they called to mind the days under fire .  they remembered sergeants and girls  both with exaggeration .  deadly things became humorous in retrospect  and trifles disregarded for ten years were hauled out for airing .  including  of course  the perennial mystery .     how do you account for it .     asked the first .     who started it .     the second shrugged .     no one started it .  everyone was doing it  like a disease .  you  too  i suppose .     the first chuckled .  the third one said softly     i never saw the fun in it .  maybe because i came across it first when i was under fire for the first time .  north africa .        really .     said the second .     the first night on the beaches of oran .  i was getting under cover  making for some native shack and i saw it in the light of a flare     george was deliriously happy .  two years of red tape and now he was finally back in the past .  now he could complete his paper on the social life of the foot soldier of world war ii with some authentic details .  out of the warless  insipid society of the thirtieth century  he found himself for one glorious moment in the tense  superlative drama of the warlike twentieth .  north africa .  site of the first great sea borne invasion of the war .  how the temporal physicists had scanned the area for the perfect spot and moment .  this shadow of an empty wooden building was it .  no human would approach for a known number of minutes .  no blast would seriously affect it in that time .  by being there  george would not affect history .  he would be that ideal of the temporal physicist  the    pure observer .     it was even more terrific than he had imagined .  there was the perpetual roar of artillery  the unseen tearing of planes overhead .  there were the periodic lines of tracer bullets splitting the sky and the occasional ghastly glow of a flare twisting downward .  and he was here .  he  george  was part of the war  part of an intense kind of life forever gone from the world of the thirtieth century  grown tame and gentle .  he imagined he could see the shadows of an advancing column of soldiers  hear the low cautious monosyllables slip from one to another .  how he longed to be one of them in truth  not merely a momentary intruder  a    pure observer .     he stopped his note taking and stared at his stylus  its micro light hypnotizing him for a moment .  a sudden idea had overwhelmed him and he looked at the wood against which his shoulder pressed .  this moment must not pass unforgotten into history .  surely doing this would affect nothing .  he would use the older english dialect and there would be no suspicion .  he did it quickly and then spied a soldier running desperately toward the structure  dodging a burst of bullets .  george knew his time was up  and  even as he knew it  found himself back in the thirtieth century .  it didn   t matter .  for those few minutes he had been part of world war ii .  a small part  but part .  and others would know it .  they might not know they knew it  but someone perhaps would repeat the message to himself .  someone  perhaps that man running for shelter  would read it and know that along with all the heroes of the twentieth century was the    pure observer     the man from the thirtieth century  george kilroy .  he was there .       satisfaction guaranteed  tony was tall and darkly handsome  with an incredibly patrician air drawn into every line of his unchangeable expression  and claire belmont regarded him through the crack in the door with a mixture of horror and dismay .     i can   t  larry .  i just can   t have him in the house .     feverishly  she was searching her paralyzed mind for a stronger way of putting it  some way that would make sense and settle things  but she could only end with a simple repetition .     well  i can   t .     larry belmont regarded his wife stiffly  and there was that spark of impatience in his eyes that claire hated to see  since she felt her own incompetence mirrored in it .     we   re committed  claire     he said     and i can   t have you backing out now .  the company is sending me to washington on this basis  and it probably means a promotion .  it   s perfectly safe and you know it .  what   s your objection .     she frowned helplessly .     it just gives me the chills .  i couldn   t bear him .        he   s as human as you or i  almost .  so  no nonsense .  come  get out there .     his hand was in the small of her back  shoving  and she found herself in her own living room  shivering .  it was there  looking at her with a precise politeness  as though appraising his hostess to be of the next three weeks .  dr .  susan calvin was there  too  sitting stiffly in thin lipped abstraction .  she had the cold  faraway look of someone who has worked with machines so long that a little of the steel had entered the blood .     hello     crackled claire in general  and ineffectual  greeting .  but larry was busily saving the situation with a spurious gaiety .     here  claire  i want you to meet tony  a swell guy .  this is my wife  claire  tony  old boy .     larry   s hand draped itself amiably over tony   s shoulder  but tony remained unresponsive and expressionless under the pressure .  he said     how do you do  mrs .  belmont .     and claire jumped at tony   s voice .  it was deep and mellow  smooth as the hair on his head or the skin on his face .  before she could stop herself  she said     oh  my you talk .        why not .  did you expect that i didn   t .     but claire could only smile weakly .  she didn   t really know what she had expected .  she looked away  then let him slide gently into the comer of her eye .  his hair was smooth and black  like polished plastic or was it really composed of separate hairs .  and was the even  olive skin of his hands and face continued on past the obscurement of his formally cut clothing .  she was lost in the shuddering wonder of it  and had to force her thoughts back into place to meet dr .  calvin   s flat  unemotional voice .     mrs .  belmont  i hope you appreciate the importance of this experiment .  your husband tells me he has given you some of the background .  i would like to give you more  as the senior psychologist of the u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .     tony is a robot .  his actual designation on the company files is tn    but he will answer to tony .  he is not a mechanical monster  nor simply a calculating machine of the type that were developed during world war ii  fifty years ago .  he has an artificial brain nearly as complicated as our own .  it is an immense telephone switchboard on an atomic scale  so that billions of possible    telephone connections    can be compressed into an instrument that will fit inside a skull .     such brains are manufactured for each model of robot specifically .  each contains a precalculated set of connections so that each robot knows the english language to start with and enough of anything else that may be necessary to perform his job .     until now  u . s .  robots has confined its manufacturing activity to industrial models for use in places where human labor is impractical in deep mines  for instance  or in underwater work .  but we want to invade the city and the home .  to do so  we must get the ordinary man and woman to accept these robots without fear .  you understand that there is nothing to fear .        there isn   t  claire     interposed larry earnestly .     take my word for it .  it   s impossible for him to do any harm .  you know i wouldn   t leave him with you otherwise .     claire cast a quick  secret glance at tony and lowered her voice .     what if i make him angry .        you needn   t whisper     said dr .  calvin calmly .     he can   t get angry with you  my dear .  i told you that the switchboard connections of his brain were predetermined .  well  the most important connection of all is what we call the first law of robotics     and it is merely this     no robot can harm a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     all robots are built so .  no robot can be forced in any way to do harm to any human .  so  you see  we need you and tony as a preliminary experiment for our own guidance  while your husband is in washington to arrange for government supervised legal tests .        you mean all this isn   t legal .     larry cleared his throat .     not just yet  but it   s all right .  he won   t leave the house  and you mustn   t let anyone see him .  that   s all .  .  .  .  and  claire  i   d stay with you  but i know too much about the robots .  we must have a completely inexperienced tester so that we can have severe conditions .  it   s necessary .        oh  well     muttered claire .  then  as a thought struck her     but what does he do .        housework     said dr .  calvin shortly .  she got up to leave  and it was larry who saw her to the front door .  claire stayed behind drearily .  she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror above the mantelpiece  and looked away hastily .  she was very tired of her small  mousy face and her dim  unimaginative hair .  then she caught tony   s eyes upon her and almost smiled before she remembered .  .  .  .  he was only a machine .   larry belmont was on his way to the airport when he caught a glimpse of gladys claffern .  she was the type of woman who seemed made to be seen in glimpses .  .  .  .  perfectly and precisely manufactured  dressed with thoughtful hand and eye  too gleaming to be stared at .  the little smile that preceded her and the faint scent that trailed her were a pair of beckoning fingers .  larry felt his stride break  he touched his hat  then hurried on .  as always he felt that vague anger .  if claire could only push her way into the claffern clique  it would help so much .  but what was the use .  claire .  the few times she had come face to face with gladys  the little fool had been tongue tied .  he had no illusions .  the testing of tony was his big chance  and it was in claire   s hands .  how much safer it would be in the hands of someone like gladys claffern .   claire woke the second morning to the sound of a subdued knock on the bedroom door .  her mind clamored  then went icy .  she had avoided tony the first day  smiling thinly when she met him and brushing past with a wordless sound of apology .     is that you tony .        yes  mrs .  belmont .  may i enter .     she must have said yes  because he was in the room  quite suddenly and noiselessly .  her eyes and nose were simultaneously aware of the tray he was carrying .     breakfast .     she said .     if you please .     she wouldn   t have dared to refuse  so she pushed herself slowly into a sitting position and received it  poached eggs  buttered toast  coffee .     i have brought the sugar and cream separately     said tony .     i expect to learn your preference with time  in this and in other things .     she waited .  tony  standing there straight and pliant as a metal rule  asked  after a moment     would you prefer to eat in privacy .        yes .  .  .  .  i mean  if you don   t mind .        will you need help later in dressing .        oh  my  no .     she clutched frantically at the sheet  so that the coffee hovered at the edge of catastrophe .  she remained so  in rigor  then sank helplessly back against the pillow when the door closed him out of her sight again .  she got through breakfast somehow .  .  .  .  he was only a machine  and if it were only more visible that he were it wouldn   t be so frightening .  or if his expression would change .  it just stayed there  nailed on .  you couldn   t tell what went on behind those dark eyes and that smooth  olive skin stuff .  the coffee cup beat a faint castanet for a moment as she set it back  empty  on the tray .  then she realized that she had forgotten to add the sugar and cream after all  and she did so hate black coffee .  she burned a straight path from bedroom to kitchen after dressing .  it was her house  after all  and there wasn   t anything frippy about her  but she liked her kitchen clean .  he should have waited for supervision .  .  .  .  but when she entered  she found a kitchen that might have been minted fire new from the factory the moment before .  v she stopped  stared  turned on her heel and nearly ran into tony .  she yelped .     may i help .     he asked .     tony     and she scraped the anger off the edges of her mind   s panic     you must make some noise when you walk .  i can   t have you stalking me  you know .  .  .  .  didn   t you use this kitchen .        i did  mrs .  belmont .        it doesn   t look it .        i cleaned up afterward .  isn   t that customary .     claire opened her eyes wide .  after all  what could one say to that .  she opened the oven compartment that held the pots  took a quick  unseeing look at the metallic glitter inside  then said with a tremor     very good .  quite satisfactory .     if at the moment  he had beamed  if he had smiled  if he had quirked the corner of his mouth the slightest bit  she felt that she could have warmed to him .  but he remained an english lord in repose  as he said     thank you  mrs .  belmont .  would you come into the living room .     she did  and it struck her at once .     have you been polishing the furniture .        is it satisfactory  mrs .  belmont .        but when .  you didn   t do it yesterday .        last night  of course .        you burned the lights all night .        oh  no .  that wouldn   t have been necessary .  i   ve a built in ultra violet source .  i can see in ultraviolet .  and  of course  i don   t require sleep .     he did require admiration  though .  she realized that  then .  he had to know that he was pleasing her .  but she couldn   t bring herself to supply that pleasure for him .  she could only say sourly     your kind will put ordinary houseworkers out of business .        there is work of much greater importance they can be put to in the world  once they are freed of drudgery .  after all  mrs .  belmont  things like myself can be manufactured .  but nothing yet can imitate the creativity and versatility of a human brain  like yours .     and though his face gave no hint  his voice was warmly surcharged with awe and admiration  so that claire flushed and muttered     my brain .  you can have it .     tony approached a little and said     you must be unhappy to say such a thing .  is there anything i can do .     for a moment  claire felt like laughing .  it was a ridiculous situation .  here was an animated carpet sweeper  dishwasher  furniture polisher  general factotum  rising from the factory table and offering his services as consoler and confidant .  yet she said suddenly  in a burst of woe and voice     mr .  belmont doesn   t think i have a brain  if you must know .  .  .  .  and i suppose i haven   t .     she couldn   t cry in front of him .  she felt  for some reason  that she had the honor of the human race to support against this mere creation .     it   s lately     she added .     it was all right when he was a student  when he was just starting .  but i can   t be a big man   s wife  and he   s getting to be a big man .  he wants me to be a hostess and an entry into social life for him like g guh guh gladys claffern .     her nose was red  and she looked away .  but tony wasn   t watching her .  his eyes wandered about the room .     i can help you run the house .        but it   s no good     she said fiercely .     it needs a touch i can   t give it .  i can only make it comfortable  i can   t ever make it the kind they take pictures of for the home beautiful magazines .        do you want that kind .        does it do any good wanting .     tony   s eyes were on her  full .     i could help .        do you know anything about interior decoration .        is it something a good housekeeper should know .        oh  yes .        then i have the potentialities of learning it .  can you get me books on the subject .     something started then .   claire  clutching her hat against the brawling liberties of the wind  had manipulated two fat volumes on the home arts back from the public library .  she watched tony as he opened one of them and flipped the pages .  it was the first time she had watched his fingers flicker at anything like fine work .  i don   t see how they do it  she thought  and on a sudden impulse reached for his hand and pulled it toward herself .  tony did not resist  but let it lie limp for inspection .  she said     it   s remarkable .  even your fingernails look natural .        that   s deliberate  of course     said tony .  then  chattily     the skin is a flexible plastic  and the skeletal framework is a light metal alloy .  does that amuse you .        oh  no .     she lifted her reddened face .     i just feel a little embarrassed at sort of poking into your insides .  it   s none of my business .  you don   t ask me about mine .        my brain paths don   t include that type of curiosity .  i can only act within my limitations  you know .     and claire felt something tighten inside her in the silence that followed .  why did she keep forgetting he was a machine .  now the thing itself had to remind her .  was she so starved for sympathy that she would even accept a robot as equal because he sympathized .  she noticed tony was still flipping the pages almost helplessly and there was a quick  shooting sense of relieved superiority within her .     you can   t read  can you .     tony looked up at her  his voice calm  unreproachful .     i am reading  mrs .  belmont .        but     she pointed at the book in a meaningless gesture .     i am scanning the pages  if that   s what you mean .  my sense of reading is photographic .     it was evening then  and when claire eventually went to bed tony was well into the second volume  sitting there in the dark  or what seemed dark to claire   s limited eyes .  her last thought  the one that clamored at her just as her mind let go and tumbled  was a queer one .  she remembered his hand again  the touch of it .  it had been warm and soft  like a human being   s .  how clever of the factory  she thought  and softly ebbed to sleep .   it was the library continuously  thereafter  for several days .  tony suggested the fields of study  which branched out quickly .  there were books on color matching and on cosmetics  on carpentry and on fashions  on art and on the history of costumes .  he turned the pages of each book before his solemn eyes  and  as quickly as he turned  he read  nor did he seem capable of forgetting .  before the end of the week  he had insisted on cutting her hair  introducing her to a new method of arranging it  adjusting her eyebrow line a bit and changing the shade of her powder and lipstick .  she had palpitated in nervous dread for half an hour under the delicate touch of his inhuman fingers and then looked in the mirror .     there is more that can be done     said tony     especially in clothes .  how do you find it for a beginning .     and she hadn   t answered  not for quite a while .  not until she had absorbed the identity of the stranger in the glass and cooled the wonder at the beauty of it all .  then she had said chokingly  never once taking her eyes from the warming image     yes  tony  quite good for a beginning .     she said nothing of this in her letters to larry .  let him see it all at once .  and something in her realized that it wasn   t only the surprise she would enjoy .  it was going to be a kind of revenge .   tony said one morning     it   s time to start buying  and i   m not allowed to leave the house .  if i write out exactly what we must have  can i trust you to get it .  we need drapery  and furniture fabric  wallpaper  carpeting  paint  clothing and any number of small things .        you can   t get these things to your own specifications at a stroke   s notice     said claire doubtfully .     you can get fairly close  if you go through the city and if money is no object .        but  tony  money is certainly an object .        not at all .  stop off at u . s .  robots in the first place .  i   ll write a note for you .  you see dr .  calvin  and tell her that i said it was part of the experiment .      dr .  calvin  somehow  didn   t frighten her as on that first evening .  with her new face and a new hat  she couldn   t be quite the old claire .  the psychologist listened carefully  asked a few questions  nodded and then claire found herself walking out  armed with an unlimited charge account against the assets of u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .  it is wonderful what money will do .  with a store   s contents at her feet  a saleslady   s dictum was not necessarily a voice from above  the uplifted eyebrow of a decorator was not anything like jove   s thunder .  and once  when an exalted plumpness at one of the most lordly of the garment salons had insistently poohed her description of the wardrobe she must have with counterpronouncements in accents of the purest fifty seventh street french  she called up tony  then held the phone out to monsieur .     if you don   t mind    voice firm  but fingers twisting a bit    i   d like you to talk to my uh secretary .     pudgy proceeded to the phone with a solemn arm crooked behind his back .  he lifted the phone in two fingers and said delicately     yes .     a short pause  another    yes     then a much longer pause  a squeaky beginning of an objection that perished quickly  another pause  a very meek    yes     and the phone was restored to its cradle .     if madam will come with me     he said  hurt and distant     i will try to supply her needs .        just a second .     claire rushed back to the phone  and dialed again .     hello  tony .  i don   t know what you said  but it worked .  thanks .  you   re a     she struggled for the appropriate word  gave up and ended in a final little squeak      a a dear .     it was gladys claffern looking at her when she turned from the phone again .  a slightly amused and slightly amazed gladys claffern  looking at her out of a face tilted a bit to one side .     mrs .  belmont .     it all drained out of claire just like that .  she could only nod stupidly  like a marionette .  gladys smiled with an insolence you couldn   t put your finger on .     i didn   t know you shopped here .     as if the place had  in her eyes  definitely lost caste through the fact .     i don   t  usually     said claire humbly .     and haven   t you done something to your hair .  it   s quite quaint .  .  .  .  oh  i hope you   ll excuse me  but isn   t your husband   s name lawrence .  it seems to me that it   s lawrence .     claire   s teeth clenched  but she had to explain .  she had to .     tony is a friend of my husband   s .  he   s helping me select some things .        i understand .  and quite a dear about it  i imagine .     she passed on smiling  carrying the light and the warmth of the world with her .   claire did not question the fact that it was to tony that she turned for consolation .  ten days had cured her of reluctance .  and she could weep before him  weep and rage .     i was a complete f fool     she stormed  wrenching at her water togged handkerchief .     she does that to me .  i don   t know why .  she just does .  i should have kicked her .  i should have knocked her down and stamped on her .        can you hate a human being so much .     asked tony  in puzzled softness .     that part of a human mind is closed to me .        oh  it isn   t she     she moaned .     it   s myself  i suppose .  she   s everything i want to be on the outside  anyway .  .  .  .  and i can   t be .     tony   s voice was forceful and low in her ear .     you can be  mrs .  belmont .  you can be .  we have ten days yet  and in ten days the house will no longer be itself .  haven   t we been planning that .        and how will that help me with her .        invite her here .  invite her friends .  have it the evening before i before i leave .  it will be a housewarming  in a way .        she won   t come .        yes  she will .  she   ll come to laugh .  .  .  .  and she won   t be able to .        do you really think so .  oh  tony  do you think we can do it .     she had both his hands in hers .  .  .  .  and then  with her face flung aside     but what good would it be .  it won   t be i  it will be you that   s doing it .  i can   t ride your back .        nobody lives in splendid singleness     whispered tony .     they   ve put that knowledge in me .  what you  or anyone  see in gladys claffern is not just gladys claffern .  she rides the back of all that money and social position can bring .  she doesn   t question that .  why should you .   .  .  .  and look at it this way  mrs .  belmont .  i am manufactured to obey  but the extent of my obedience is for myself to determine .  i can follow orders niggardly or liberally .  for you  it is liberal  because you are what i have been manufactured to see human beings as .  you are kind  friendly  unassuming .  mrs .  claffern  as you describe her  is not  and i wouldn   t obey her as i would you .  so it is you  and not i  mrs .  belmont  that is doing all this .     he withdrew his hands from hers then  and claire looked at that expressionless face no one could read wondering .  she was suddenly frightened     again in a completely new way .  she swallowed nervously and stared at her hands  which were still tingling     with the pressure of his fingers .  she hadn   t imagined it  his fingers had pressed hers  gently  tenderly  just before they moved away .  no .  its fingers  .  .  .  its fingers .  .  .  .  she ran to the bathroom and scrubbed her hands blindly  uselessly .   she was a bit shy of him the next day  watching him narrowly  waiting to see what might follow and for a while nothing did .  tony was working .  if there was any difficulty in technique in putting up wallpaper  or utilizing the quick drying paint  tony   s activity did not show it .  his hands moved precisely  his fingers were deft and sure .  he worked all night .  she never heard him  but each morning was a new adventure .  she couldn   t count the number of things that had been done  and by evening she was still finding new touches and another night had come .  she tried to help only once and her human clumsiness marred that .  he was in the next room  and she was hanging a picture in the spot marked by tony   s mathematical eyes .  the little mark was there  the picture was there  and a revulsion against idleness was there .  but she was nervous  or the ladder was rickety .  it didn   t matter .  she felt it going  and she cried out .  it tumbled without her  for tony  with far more than flesh and blood quickness  had been under her .  his calm  dark eyes said nothing at all  and his warm voice said only words .     are you hurt  mrs .  belmont .     she noticed for an instant that her falling hand must have mussed that sleek hair of his  because for the first time she could see for herself that it was composed of distinct strands fine black hairs .  and then  all at once  she was conscious of his arms about her shoulders and under her knees holding her tightly and warmly .  she pushed  and her scream was loud in her own ears .  she spent the rest of the day in her room  and thereafter she slept with a chair upended against the doorknob of her bedroom door .   she had sent out the invitations  and  as tony had said  they were accepted .  she had only to wait for the last evening .  it came  too  after the rest of them  in its proper place .  the house was scarcely her own .  she went through it one last time and every room had been changed .  she  herself  was in clothes she would never have dared wear before .  .  .  .  and when you put them on  you put on pride and confidence with them .  she tried a polite look of contemptuous amusement before the minor  and the mirror sneered back at her masterfully .  what would larry say .   .  .  .  it didn   t matter  somehow .  the exciting days weren   t coming with him .  they were leaving with tony .  now wasn   t that strange .  she tried to recapture her mood of three weeks before and failed completely .   the clock shrieked eight at her in eight breathless installments  and she turned to tony .     they   ll be here soon  tony .  you   d better get into the basement .  we can   t let them     she stared a moment  then said weakly     tony .     and more strongly     tony .     and nearly a scream     tony .     but his arms were around her now  his face was close to hers  the pressure of his embrace was relentless .  she heard his voice through a haze of emotional jumble .     claire     the voice said     there are many things i am not made to understand  and this must be one of them .  i am leaving tomorrow  and i don   t want to .  i find that there is more in me than just a desire to please you .  isn   t it strange .     his face was closer  his lips were warm  but with no breath behind them  for machines do not breathe .  they were almost on hers .   .  .  .  and the bell sounded .  for a moment  she struggled breathlessly  and then he was gone and nowhere in sight  and the bell was sounding again .  its intermittent shrillness was insistent .  the curtains on the front windows had been pulled open .  they had been closed fifteen minutes earlier .  she knew that .  they must have seen  then .  they must all have seen everything .   they came in so politely  all in a bunch the pack come to howl with their sharp  darting eyes piercing everywhere .  they had seen .  why else would gladys ask in her jabbingest manner after larry .  and claire was spurred to a desperate and reckless defiance .  yes  he is away .  he   ll be back tomorrow  i suppose .  no  i haven   t been lonely here myself .  not a bit .  i   ve had an exciting time .  and she laughed at them .  why not .  what could they do .  larry would know the truth  if it ever came to him  the story of what they thought they saw .  but they didn   t laugh .  she could read that in the fury in gladys claffern   s eyes  in the false sparkle of her words  in her desire to leave early .  and as she parted with them  she caught one last  anonymous whisper disjointed .      .  .  .  never saw anything like  .  .  .  so handsome     and she knew what it was that had enabled her to finger snap them so .  let each cat mew  and let each cat know that she might be prettier than claire belmont  and grander  and richer but not one  not one  could have so handsome a lover .  and then she remembered again again again  that tony was a machine  and her skin crawled .     go away .  leave me be .     she cried to the empty room and ran to her bed .  she wept wakefully all that night and the next morning  almost before dawn  when the streets were empty  a car drew up to the house and took tony away .   lawrence belmont passed dr .  calvin   s office  and  on impulse  knocked .  he found her with mathematician peter bogert  but did not hesitate on that account .  he said     claire tells me that u . s .  robots paid for all that was done at my house        yes     said dr .  calvin .     we   ve written it off  as a valuable and necessary part of the experiment .  with your new position as associate engineer  you   ll be able to keep it up  i think .        that   s not what i   m worried about .  with washington agreeing to the tests  we   ll be able to get a tn model of our own by next year  i think .     he turned hesitantly  as though to go  and as hesitantly turned back again .     well  mr .  belmont .     asked dr .  calvin  after a pause .     i wonder     began larry .     i wonder what really happened there .  she  claire  i mean seems so different .  it   s not just her looks though  frankly  i   m amazed .     he laughed nervously .     it   s her .  she   s not my wife  really i can   t explain it .        why try .  are you disappointed with any part of the change .        on the contrary .  but it   s a little frightening  too  you see        i wouldn   t worry  mr .  belmont .  your wife has handled herself very well .  frankly  i never expected to have the experiment yield such a thorough and complete test .  we know exactly what corrections must be made in the tn model  and the credit belongs entirely to mrs .  belmont .  if you want me to be very honest  i think your wife deserves your promotion more than you do .     larry flinched visibly at that .     as long as it   s in the family     he murmured unconvincingly and left .   susan calvin looked after him     i think that hurt i hope .  .  .  .  have you read tony   s report  peter .        thoroughly     said bogert .     and won   t the tn   model need changes .        oh  you think so  too .     questioned calvin sharply .     what   s your reasoning .     bogert frowned .     i don   t need any .  it   s obvious on the face of it that we can   t have a robot loose which makes love to his mistress  if you don   t mind the pun .        love .  peter  you sicken me .  you really don   t understand .  that machine had to obey the first law .  he couldn   t allow harm to come to a human being  and harm was coming to claire belmont through her own sense of inadequacy .  so he made love to her  since what woman would fail to appreciate the compliment of being able to stir passion in a machine in a cold  soulless machine .  and he opened the curtains that night deliberately  that the others might see and envy without any risk possible to claire   s marriage .  i think it was clever of tony        do you .  what   s the difference whether it was pretense or not  susan .  it still has its horrifying effect .  read the report again .  she avoided him .  she screamed when he held her .  she didn   t sleep that last night in hysterics .  we can   t have that .        peter  you   re blind .  you   re as blind as i was .  the tn model will be rebuilt entirely  but not for your reason .  quite otherwise  quite otherwise .  strange that i overlooked it in the first place     her eyes were opaquely thoughtful     but perhaps it reflects a shortcoming in myself .  you see  peter  machines can   t fall in love  but even when it   s hopeless and horrifying  women can .      hell fire  there was a stir as of a very polite first night audience .  only a handful of scientists were present  a sprinkling of high brass  some congressmen  a few newsmen .  alvin homer of the washington bureau of the continental press found himself next to joseph vincenzo of los alamos  and said     now we ought to learn something .     vincenzo stared at him through bifocals and said     not the important thing .     homer frowned .  this was to be the first super slow motion films of an atomic explosion .  with trick lenses changing directional polarization in flickers  the moment of explosion would be divided into billionth second snaps .  yesterday  an a bomb had exploded .  today  those snaps would show the explosion in incredible detail .  horner said     you think this won   t work .     vincenzo looked tormented .     it will work .  we   ve run pilot tests .  but the important thing        which is .        that these bombs are man   s death sentence .  we don   t seem to be able to learn that .     vincenzo nodded .     look at them here .  they   re excited and thrilled  but not afraid .     the newsman said     they know the danger .  they   re afraid  too .        not enough     said the scientist .     i   ve seen men watch an h bomb blow an island into a hole and then go home and sleep .  that   s the way men are .  for thousands of years  hell fire has been preached to them  and it   s made no real impression .        hell fire  are you religious  sir .        what you saw yesterday was hell fire .  an exploding atom bomb is hell fire .  literally .     that was enough for homer .  he got up and changed his seat  but watched the audience uneasily .  were any afraid .  did any worry about hell fire .  it didn   t seem so to him .  the lights went out  the projector started .  on the screen  the firing tower stood gaunt .  the audience grew tensely quiet .  then a dot of light appeared at the apex of the tower  a brilliant  burning point  slowly budding in a lazy  outward elbowing  this way and that  taking on uneven shapes of light and shadow  growing oval .  a man cried out chokingly  then others .  a hoarse babble of noise  followed by thick silence .  horner could smell fear  taste terror in his own mouth  feel his blood freeze .  the oval fireball had sprouted projections  then paused a moment in stasis  before expanding rapidly into a bright and featureless sphere .  that moment of stasis the fireball had shown dark spots for eyes  with dark lines for thin  flaring eyebrows  a hairline coming down v shaped  a mouth twisted upward  laughing wildly in the hell fire and horns .   the last trump  the archangel gabriel was quite casual about the whole thing .  idly  he let the tip of one wing graze the planet mars  which  being of mere matter  was unaffected by the contact .  he said     it   s a settled matter  etheriel .  there   s nothing to be done about it now .  the day of resurrection is due .     etheriel  a very junior seraph who had been created not quite a thousand years earlier as men counted time  quivered so that distinct vortices appeared in the continuum .  ever since his creation  he had been in immediate charge of earth and environs .  as a job  it was a sinecure  a cubbyhole  a dead end  but through the centuries he had come to take a perverse pride in the world .     but you   ll be disrupting my world without notice .        not at all .  not at all .  certain passages occur in the book of daniel and in the apocalypse of st .  john which are clear enough .        they are .  having been copied from scribe to scribe .  i wonder if two words in a row are left unchanged .        there are hints in the rig veda  in the confucian analects        which are the property of isolated cultural groups which exist as a thin aristocracy        the gilgamesh chronicle speaks out plainly .        much of the gilgamesh chronicle was destroyed with the library of ashurbanipal sixteen hundred years  earth style  before my creation .        there are certain features of the great pyramid and a pattern in the inlaid jewels of the taj mahal        which are so subtle that no man has ever rightly interpreted them .     j gabriel said wearily     if you   re going to object to everything  there   s no use discussing the matter .  in any case  you ought to know about it .  in matters concerning earth  you   re omniscient .        yes  if i choose to be .  i   ve had much to concern me here and investigating the possibilities of resurrection did not  i confess  occur to me .        well  it should have .  all the papers involved are in the files of the council of ascendants .  you could have availed yourself of them at any time .        i tell you all my time was needed here .  you have no idea of the deadly efficiency of the adversary on this planet .  it took all my efforts to curb him  and even so        why  yes    gabriel stroked a comet as it passed    he does seem to have won his little victories .  i note as i let the interlocking factual pattern of this miserable little world flow through me that this is one of those setups with matter energy equivalence .        so it is     said etheriel .     and they are playing with it .        i   m afraid so .        then what better time for ending the matter .        i   ll be able to handle it  i assure you .  their nuclear bombs will not destroy them .        i wonder .  well  now suppose you let me continue  etheriel .  the appointed moment approaches .     the seraph said stubbornly     i would like to see the documents in the case .        if you insist .     the wording of an act of ascendancy appeared in glittering symbols against the deep black of the airless firmament .  etheriel read aloud     it is hereby directed by order of council that the archangel gabriel  serial number etcetera  etcetera  well  that   s you  at any rate   will approach planet  class a  number g        hereinafter known as earth  and on january          at       p . m .   using local time values     he finished reading in gloomy silence .     satisfied .        no  but i   m helpless .     gabriel smiled .  a trumpet appeared in space  in shape like an earthly trumpet  but its burnished gold extended from earth to sun .  it was raised to gabriel   s glittering beautiful lips .     can   t you let me have a little time to take this up with the council .     asked etheriel desperately .     what good would it do you .  the act is countersigned by the chief  and you know that an act countersigned by the chief is absolutely irrevocable .  and now  if you don   t mind  it is almost the stipulated second and i want to be done with this as i have other matters of much greater moment on my mind .  would you step out of my way a little .  thank you .     gabriel blew  and a clean  thin sound of perfect pitch and crystalline delicacy filled all the universe to the furthest star .  as it sounded  there was a tiny moment of stasis as thin as the line separating past from future  and then the fabric of worlds collapsed upon itself and matter was gathered back into the primeval chaos from which it had once sprung at a word .  the stars and nebulae were gone  and the cosmic dust  the sun  the planets  the moon  all  all  all except earth itself  which spun as before in a universe now completely empty .  the last trump had sounded .  r .  e .  mann   known to all who knew him simply as r . e .   eased himself into the offices  of the billikan bitsies factory and stared somberly at the tall man  gaunt but with a certain faded elegance about his neat gray mustache  who bent intently over a sheaf of papers on his desk .  r . e .  looked at his wristwatch  which still said       having ceased running at that time .  it was eastern standard time  of course        p . m .  greenwich time .  his dark brown eyes  staring sharply out over a pair of pronounced cheekbones  caught those of the other .  for a moment  the tall man stared at him blankly .  then he said     can i do anything for you .        horatio j .  billikan  i presume .  owner of this place .        yes .        i   m r .  e .  mann and i couldn   t help but stop in when i finally found someone at work .  don   t you know what today is .        today .        it   s resurrection day .        oh  that .  i know it .  i heard the blast .  fit to wake the dead .   .   .   .  that   s rather a good one  don   t you think .     he chuckled for a moment  then went on .     it woke me at seven in the morning .  i nudged my wife .  she slept through it  of course .  i always said she would .     it   s the last trump  dear     i said .  hortense  that   s my wife  said     all right     and went back to sleep .  i bathed  shaved  dressed and came to work .        but why .           why not .           none of your workers have come in .        no  poor souls .  they   ll take a holiday just at first .  you   ve got to expect that .  after all  it isn   t every day that the world comes to an end .  frankly  it   s just as well .  it  gives me a chance to straighten out my personal correspondence without interruptions .  telephone hasn   t rung once .     he stood up and went to the window .     it   s a great improvement .  no blinding sun any more and the snow   s gone .  there   s a pleasant light and a pleasant warmth .  very good arrangement .   .   .   .  but now  if you don   t mind  i   m rather busy  so if you   ll excuse me     a great  hoarse voice interrupted with a     just a minute  horatio     and a gentleman  looking remarkably like billikan in a somewhat craggier way  followed his prominent nose into the office and struck an attitude of offended dignity which was scarcely spoiled by the fact that he was quite naked .     may i ask why you   ve shut down bitsies .     billikan looked faint .     good heavens     he said     it   s father .  wherever did you come from .        from the graveyard     roared billikan  senior .     where on earth else .  they   re coming out of the ground there by the dozens .  every one of them naked .  women  too .     billikan cleared his throat .     i   ll get you some clothes  father .  i   ll bring them to you from home .        never mind that .  business first .  business first .     r . e .  came out of his musing .     is everyone coming out of their graves at the same time  sir .     he stared curiously at billikan  senior  as he spoke .  the old man   s appearance was one of robust age .  his cheeks were furrowed but glowed with health .  his age  r . e .  decided  was exactly what it was at the moment of his death  but his body was as it should have been at that age if it functioned ideally .  billikan  senior  said     no  sir  they are not .  the newer graves are coming up first .  pottersby died five years before me and came up about five minutes after me .  seeing him made me decide to leave .  i had had enough of him when  .   .   .  and that reminds me .     he brought his fist down on the desk  a very solid fist .     there were no taxis  no busses .  telephones weren   t working .  i had to walk .  i had to walk twenty miles .        like that .     asked his son in a faint and appalled voice .  billikan  senior  looked down upon his bare skin with casual approval .     it   s warm .  almost everyone else is naked .   .   .   .  anyway  son  i   m not here to make small talk .  why is the factory shut down .        it isn   t shut down .  it   s a special occasion .        special occasion  my foot .  you call union headquarters and tell them resurrection day isn   t in the contract .  every worker is being docked for every minute he   s off the job .     billikan   s lean face took on a stubborn look as he peered at his father .     i will not .  don   t forget  now  you   re no longer in charge of this plant .  i am .        oh  you are .  by what right .        by your will .        all right .  now here i am and i void my will .        you can   t  father .  you   re dead .  you may not look dead  but i have witnesses .  i have the doctor   s certificate .  i have receipted bills from the undertaker .  i can get testimony from the pallbearers .     billikan  senior  stared at his son  sat down  placed his arm over the back of the chair  crossed his iegs and said     if it conies to that  we   re all dead  aren   t we .  the world   s come to an end  hasn   t it .        but you   ve been declared legally dead and   haven   t .        oh  we   ll change that  son .  there are going to be more of us than of you and votes count .     billikan  junior  tapped the desk firmly with the flat of his hand and flushed slightly .     father  i hate to bring up this particular point  but you force me to .  may i remind you that by now   am sure that mother is sitting at home waiting for you  that she probably had to walk the streets uh  naked  too  and that she probably isn   t in a good humor .     billikan  senior  went ludicrously pale .     good heavens .        and you know she always wanted you to retire .     billikan  senior  came to a quick decision .     i   m not going home .  why  this is a nightmare .  aren   t there any limits to this resurrection business .  it   s  it   s it   s sheer anarchy .  there   s such a thing as overdoing it .  i   m just not going home .     at which point  a somewhat rotund gentleman with a smooth  pink face and fluffy white sideburns  much like pictures of martin van buren  stepped in and said coldly     good day .        father     said billikan  senior .     grandfather     said billikan  junior .  billikan  grandsenior  looked at billikan  junior  with disapproval .     if you are my grandson     he said     you   ve aged considerably and the change has not improved you .     billikan  junior  smiled with dyspeptic feebleness  and made no answer .  billikan  grandsenior  did not seem to require one .  he said     now if you two will bring me up to date on the business  i will resume my managerial function .     there were two simultaneous answers  and billikan  grandsenior   s  florid ity waxed dangerously as he beat the ground peremptorily with an imaginary cane and barked a retort .  r . e .  said     gentlemen .     he raised his voice .     gentlemen .     he shrieked at full long power     gentlemen .     conversation snapped off sharply and all turned to look at him .  r . e .    s angular face  his oddly attractive eyes  his sardonic mouth seemed suddenly to dominate the gathering .  he said     i don   t understand this argument .  what is it that you manufacture .        bitsies     said billikan  junior .     which  i take it  are a packaged cereal breakfast food        teeming with energy in every golden  crispy flake     cried billikan  junior .     covered with honey sweet  crystalline sugar  a confection and a food  growled billikan  senior .     to tempt the most jaded appetite     roared billikan  grandsenior .     exactly     said r . e .     what appetite .     they stared stolidly at him .     i beg your pardon     said billikan  junior .     are any of you hungry .     asked r . e .     i   m not .        what is this fool maundering about .     demanded billikan  grandsenior  angrily .  his invisible cane would have been prodding r . e .  in the navel had it  the cane  not the navel  existed .  r . e .  said     i   m trying to tell you that no one will ever eat again .  it is the hereafter  and food is unnecessary .     the expressions on the faces of the billikans needed no interpretation .  it was obvious that they had tried their own appetites and found them wanting .  billikan  junior  said ashenly     ruined .     billikan  grandsenior  pounded the floor heavily and noiselessly with his imaginary cane .     this is confiscation of property without due process of law .  i   ll sue .  i   ll sue .        quite unconstitutional     agreed billikan  senior .     if you can find anyone to sue  i wish you all good fortune     said r . e .  agreeably .     and now if you   ll excuse me i think i   ll walk toward the graveyard .     he put his hat on his head and walked out the door .  etheriel  his vortices quivering  stood before the glory of a six winged cherub .  the cherub said     if i understand you  your particular universe has been dismantled .        exactly .        well  surely  now  you don   t expect me to set it up again .        i don   t expect you to do anything     said etheriel     except to arrange an appointment for me with the chief .     the cherub gestured his respect instantly at hearing the word .  two wing tips covered his feet  two his eyes and two his mouth .  he restored himself to normal and said     the chief is quite busy .  there are a myriad score of matters for him to decide .        who denies that .  i merely point out that if matters stand as they are now  there will have been a universe in which satan will have won the final victory .        satan .        it   s the hebrew word for adversary     said etheriel impatiently .  i could say ahriman  which is the persian word .  in any case  i mean the adversary .     the cherub said     but what will an interview with the chief accomplish .  the document authorizing the last trump was countersigned by the chief  and you know that it is irrevocable for that reason .  the chief would never limit his own omnipotence by canceling a word he had spoken in his official capacity .        is that final .  you will not arrange an appointment .        i cannot .     etheriel said     in that case    shall seek out the chief without one .  i will invade the primum mobile .  if it means my destruction  so be it .     he gathered his energies .   .   .   .  the cherub murmured in horror     sacrilege .     and there was a faint gathering of thunder as etheriel sprang upward and was gone .  r .  e .  mann passed through the crowding streets and grew used to the sight of people bewildered  disbelieving  apathetic  in makeshift clothing or  usually  none at all .  a girl  who looked about twelve  leaned over an iron gate  one foot on a crossbar  swinging it to and fro  and said as he passed     hello  mister .        hello     said r . e .  the girl was dressed .  she was not one of the uh  returnees .  the girl said     we got a new baby in our house .  she   s a sister i once had .  mommy is crying and they sent me here .     r . e .  said     well  well     passed through the gate and up the paved walk to the house  one with modest pretensions to middle class gentility .  he rang the bell  obtained no answer  opened the door and walked in .  he followed the sound of sobbing and knocked at an inner door .  a stout man of about fifty with little hair and a comfortable supply of cheek and chin looked out at him with mingled astonishment and resentment .     who are you .     r . e .  removed his hat .     i thought i might be able to help .  your little girl outside     a woman looked up at him hopelessly from a chair by a double bed .  her hair was beginning to gray .  her face was puffed and unsightly with weeping and the veins stood out bluely on the back of her hands .  a baby lay on the bed  plump and naked .  it kicked its feet languidly and its sightless baby eyes turned aimlessly here and there .     this is my baby     said the woman .     she was born twenty three years ago in this house and she died when she was ten days old in this house .  i wanted her back so much .        and now you have her     said r . e .     but it   s too late     cried the woman vehemently .     i   ve had three other children .  my oldest girl is married  my son is in the army .  i   m too old to have a baby now .  and even if even if     her features worked in a heroic effort to keep back the tears and failed .  her husband said with flat tonelessness     it   s not a real baby .  it doesn   t cry .  it doesn   t soil itself .  it won   t take milk .  what will we do .  it   ll never grow .  it   ll always be a baby .     r . e .  shook his head .     i don   t know     he said .     i   m afraid i can do nothing to help .     quietly he left .  quietly he thought of the hospitals .  thousands of babies must be appearing at each one .  place them in racks  he thought  sardonically .  stack them like cordwood .  they need no care .  their little bodies are merely each the custodian of an indestructible spark of life .  he passed two little boys of apparently equal chronological age  perhaps ten .  their voices were shrill .  the body of one glistened white in the sunless light so he was a returnee .  the other was not .  r . e .  paused to listen .  the bare one said     i had scarlet fever .     a spark of envy at the other   s claim to notoriety seemed to enter the clothed one   s voice .     gee .        that   s why i died .        gee .  did they use pensillun or auromysim .        what .        they   re medicines .        i never heard of them .        boy  you never heard of much .        i know as much as you .        yeah .  who   s president of the united states .        warren harding  that   s who .        you   re crazy .  it   s eisenhower .        who   s he .        ever see television .        what   s that .     the clothed boy hooted earsplittingly .     it   s something you turn on and see comedians  movies  cowboys  rocket rangers  anything you want .        let   s see it .     there was a pause and the boy from the present said     it ain   t working .     the other boy shrieked his scorn .     you mean it ain   t never worked .  you made it all up .     f .  r . e .  shrugged and passed on .  the crowds thinned as he left town and neared the cemetery .  those who were left were all walking into town  all were nude .  a man stopped him  a cheerful man with pinkish skin and white hair who had the marks of pince nez on either side of the bridge of his nose  but no glasses to go with them .     greetings  friend .        hello     said r . e .     you   re the first man with clothing that i   ve seen .  you were alive when the trumpet blew  i suppose .        yes  i was .        well  isn   t this great .  isn   t this joyous and delightful .  come rejoice with me .        you like this  do you .     said r . e .     like it .  a pure and radiant joy fills me .  we are surrounded by the light of the first day  the light that glowed softly and serenely before sun  moon and stars were made .   you know your genesis  of course .   there is the comfortable warmth that must have been one of the highest blisses of eden  not enervating heat or assaulting cold .  men and women walk the streets unclothed and are not ashamed .  all is well  my friend  all is well .     r . e .  said     well  it   s a fact that i haven   t seemed to mind the feminine display all about .        naturally not     said the other .     lust and sin as we remember it in our earthly existence no longer exists .  let me introduce myself  friend  as i was in earthly times .  my name on earth was winthrop hester .  i was bom in      and died in      as we counted time then .  through the last forty years of my life i labored to bring my little flock to the kingdom and i go now to count the ones i have won .     r . e .  regarded the ex minister solemnly     surely there has been no judgment yet .        why not .  the lord sees within a man and in the same instant that all things of the world ceased  all men were judged and we are the saved .        there must be a great many saved .        on the contrary  my son  those saved are but as a remnant .        a pretty large remnant .  as near as   can make out  everyone   s coming back to life .  i   ve seen some pretty unsavory characters back in town as alive as you are .        last minute repentance        i never repented .        of what  my son .        of the fact that i never attended church .     winthrop hester stepped back hastily .     were you ever baptized .        not to my knowledge .     winthrop hester trembled .     surely you believe in god .        well     said r . e .      i believed a lot of things about him that would probably startle you .     winthrop hester turned and hurried off in great agitation .  in what remained of his walk to the cemetery  r . e .  had no way of estimating time  nor did it occur to him to try  no one else stopped him .  he found the cemetery itself all but empty  its trees and grass gone  it occurred to him that there was nothing green in the world  the ground everywhere was a hard  featureless  grainless gray  the sky a luminous white   but its headstones still standing .  on one of these sat a lean and furrowed man with long  black hair on his head and a mat of it  shorter  though more impressive  on his chest and upper arms .  he called out in a deep voice     hey  there  you .     r . e .  sat down on a neighboring headstone .     hello .     black hair said     your clothes don   t look right .  what year was it when it happened .             .        i died in      .  funny .  i expected to be one pretty hot boy right about now  with the eternal flames shooting up my innards .        aren   t you coming along to town .     asked r . e .     my name   s zeb     said the ancient .     that   s short for zebulon  but zeb   s good enough .  what   s the town like .  changed some  i reckon .        it   s got nearly a hundred thousand people in it .     zeb   s mouth yawned somewhat .     go on .  might nigh bigger   n philadelphia .   .   .   .  you   re making fun .        philadelphia   s got     r . e .  paused .  stating the figure would do him no good .  instead  he said     the town   s grown in a hundred fifty years  you know .        country  too .        forty eight states     said r . e .     all the way to the pacific .        no .     zeb slapped his thigh in delight and then winced at the unexpected absence of rough homespun to take up the worst of the blow .     i   d head out west if i wasn   t needed here .  yes  sir .     his face grew lowering and his thin lips took on a definite grimness .     i   ll stay right here  where i   m needed .        why are you needed .     the explanation came out briefly  bitten off hard .     injuns .        indians .        millions of    em .  first the tribes we fought and licked and then tribes who ain   t never seen a white man .  they   ll all come back to life .  i   ll need my old buddies .  you city fellers ain   t no good at it .   .  .  .  ever seen an injun .     r . e .  said     not around here lately  no .     zeb looked his contempt  and tried to spit to one side but found no saliva for the purpose .  he said     you better git back to the city  then .  after a while  it ain   t going to be safe nohow round here .  wish i had my musket .     r . e .  rose  thought a moment  shrugged and faced back to the city .  the headstone he had been sitting upon collapsed as he rose  falling into a powder of gray stone that melted into the featureless ground .  he looked about .  most of the headstones were gone .  the rest would not last long .  only the one under zeb still looked firm and strong .  r . e .  began the walk back .  zeb did not turn to look at him .  he remained waiting quietly and calmly for indians .  etheriel plunged through the heavens in reckless haste .  the eyes of the ascendants were on him  he knew .  from late born seraph  through cherubs and angels  to the highest archangel  they must be watching .  already he was higher than any ascendant  uninvited  had ever been before and he waited for the quiver of the word that would reduce his vortices to non existence .  but he did not falter .  through non space and non time  he plunged toward union with the primum mobile  the seat that encompassed all that is  was  would be  had been  could be and might be .  and as he thought that  he burst through and was part of it  his being expanding so that momentarily he  too  was part of the all .  but then it was mercifully veiled from his senses  and the chief was a still  small voice within him  yet all the more impressive in its infinity for all that .     my son     the voice said     i know why you have come .        then help me  if that be your will .        by my own will     said the chief     an act of mine is irrevocable .  all your mankind  my son  yearned for life .  all feared death .  all evolved thoughts and dreams of life unending .  no two groups of men  no two single men  evolved the same afterlife  but all wished life .  i was petitioned that i might grant the common denominator of all these wishes life unending .  i did so .        no servant of yours made that request .        the adversary did  my son .     etheriel trailed his feeble glory in dejection and said in a low voice     i am dust in your sight and unworthy to be in your presence  yet i must ask a question .  is then the adversary your servant also .        without him i can have no other     said the chief     for what then is good but the eternal fight against evil .     and in that fight  thought etheriel  i have lost .  r . e .  paused in sight of town .  the buildings were crumbling .  those that were made of wood were already heaps of rubble .  r . e .  walked to the nearest such heap and found the wooden splinters powdery and dry .  he penetrated deeper into town and found the brick buildings still standing  but there was an ominous roundness to the edges of the bricks  a threatening flakiness .     they won   t last long     said a deep voice     but there is this consolation  if consolation it be  their collapse can kill no one .     r . e .  looked up in surprise and found himself face to face with a cadaverous don quixote of a man  lantern jawed  sunken cheeked .  his eyes were sad and his brown hair was lank and straight .  his clothes hung loosely and skin showed clearly through various rents .     my name     said the man     is richard levine .  i was a professor of history once before this happened .        you   re wearing clothes     said r . e .     you   re not one of those resurrected .        no  but that mark of distinction is vanishing .  clothes are going .     r . e .  looked at the throngs that drifted past them  moving slowly and aimlessly like motes in a sunbeam .  vanishingly few wore clothes .  he looked down at himself and noticed for the first time that the seam down the length of each trouser leg had parted .  he pinched the fabric of his jacket between thumb and forefinger and the wool parted and came away easily .     i guess you   re right     said r . e .     if you   ll notice     went on levine     mellon   s hill is flattening out .     r . e .  turned to the north where ordinarily the mansions of the aristocracy  such aristocracy as there was in town  studded the slopes of mellon   s hill  and found the horizon nearly flat .  levine said     eventually  there   ll be nothing but flatness  featurelessness  nothingness and us .        and indians     said r . e .     there   s a man outside of town waiting for indians and wishing he had a musket .        i imagine     said levine     the indians will give no trouble .  there is no pleasure in fighting an enemy that cannot be killed or hurt .  and even if that were not so  the lust for battle would be gone  as are all lusts .        are you sure .        i am positive .  before all this happened  although you may not think it to look at me  i derived much harmless pleasure in a consideration of the female figure .  now  with the unexampled opportunities at my disposal  i find myself irritatingly uninterested .  no  that is wrong .  i am not even irritated at my disinterest .     r . e .  looked up briefly at the passers by .     i see what you mean .        the coming of indians here     said levine     is nothing compared with the situation in the old world .  early during the resurrection  hitler and his wehrmacht must have come back to life and must now be facing and intermingled with stalin and the red army all the way from berlin to stalingrad .  to complicate the situation  the kaisers and czars will arrive .  the men at verdun and the somme are back in the old battlegrounds .  napoleon and his marshals are scattered over western europe .  and mohammed must be back to see what following ages have made of islam  while the saints and apostles consider the paths of christianity .  and even the mongols  poor things  the khans from temujin to aurangzeb  must be wandering the steppes helplessly  longing for their horses .        as a professor of history     said r . e .      you must long to be there and observe .        how could i be there .  every man   s position on earth is restricted to the distance he can walk .  there are no machines of any kind  and  as i have just mentioned  no horses .  and what would i find in europe anyway .  apathy  i think .  as here .     a soft plopping sound caused r . e .  to turn around .  the wing of a neighboring brick building had collapsed in dust .  portions of bricks lay on either side of him .  some must have hurtled through him without his being aware of it .  he looked about .  the heaps of rubble were less numerous .  those that remained were smaller in size .  he said     i met a man who thought we had all been judged and are in heaven .        judged .     said levine .     why  yes  i imagine we are .  we face eternity now .  we have no universe left  no outside phenomena  no emotions  no passions .  nothing but ourselves and thought .  we face an eternity of introspection  when all through history we have never known what to do with ourselves on a rainy sunday .        you sound as though the situation bothers you .        it does more than that .  the dantean conceptions of inferno were childish and unworthy of the divine imagination  fire and torture .  boredom is much more subtle .  the inner torture of a mind unable to escape itself in any way  condemned to fester in its own exuding mental pus for all time  is much more fitting .  oh  yes  my friend  we have been judged  and condemned  too  and this is not heaven  but hell .     and levine rose with shoulders drooping dejectedly  and walked away .  r . e .  gazed thoughtfully about and nodded his head .  he was satisfied .  the self admission of failure lasted but an instant in etheriel  and then  quite suddenly  he lifted his being as brightly and highly as he dared in the presence of the chief and his glory was a tiny dot of light in the infinite primum mobile .     if it be your will  then     he said .     i do not ask you to defeat your will but to fulfill it .        in what way  my son .        the document  approved by the council of ascendants and signed by yourself  authorizes the day of resurrection at a specific time of a specific day of the year      as earthmen count time .        so it did .        but the year      is unqualified .  what then is      .  to the dominant culture on earth the year was a . d .       .  that is true .  yet from the time you breathed existence into earth and its universe there have passed       years .  based on the internal evidence you created within that universe  nearly four billion years have passed .  is the year  unqualified  then             or            .     nor is that all     etheriel went on .     the year   . d .       is the year      of the byzantine era       by the jewish calendar .  it is      a . u . c .   that is  the      th year since the founding of rome  if we adopt the roman calendar .  it is the year      in the mohammedan calendar  and the hundred eightieth year of the independence of the united states .     humbly i ask then if it does not seem to you that a year referred to as      alone and without qualification has no meaning .     the chief   s still small voice said     i have always known this  my son  it was you who had to learn .        then     said etheriel  quivering luminously with joy     let the very letter of your will be fulfilled and let the day of resurrection fall in       but only when all the inhabitants of earth unanimously agree that a certain year shall be numbered      and none other .        so let it be     said the chief  and this word re created earth and all it contained  together with the sun and moon and all the hosts of heaven .  it was   a . m .  on january          when r .  e .  mann awoke with a start .  the very beginnings of a melodious note that ought to have filled all the universe had sounded and yet had not sounded .  for a moment  he cocked his head as though to allow understanding to flow in  and then a trifle of rage crossed his face to vanish again .  it was but another battle .  he sat down at his desk to compose the next plan of action .  people already spoke of calendar reform and it would have to be stimulated .  a new era must begin with december          and someday a new year      would come       of the atomic era  acknowledged as such by all the world .  a strange light shone on his head as thoughts passed through his more than human mind and the shadow of ahriman on the wall seemed to have small horns at either temple .   the fun they had  margie even wrote about it that night in her diary .  on the page headed may           she wrote     today tommy found a real book .     it was a very old book .  margie   s grandfather once said that when he was a little boy his grandfather told him that there was a time when all stories were printed on paper .  they turned the pages  which were yellow and crinkly  and it was awfully funny to read words that stood still instead of moving the way they were supposed to on a screen  you know .  and then  when they turned back to the page before  it had the same words on it that it had had when they read it the first time .     gee     said tommy     what a waste .  when you   re through with the book  you just throw it away  i guess .  our television screen must have had a million books on it and it   s good for plenty more .    wouldn   t throw it away .        same with mine     said margie .  she was eleven and hadn   t seen as many telebooks as tommy had .  he was thirteen .  she said     where did you find it .        in my house .     he pointed without looking  because he was busy reading .     in the attic .        what   s it about .        school .     margie was scornful .     school .  what   s there to write about school .  i hate school .     margie always hated school  but now she hated it more than ever .  the mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her mother had shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the county inspector .  he was a round little man with a red face and a whole box of tools with dials and wires .  he smiled at margie and gave her an apple  then took the teacher apart .  margie had hoped he wouldn   t know how to put it together again  but he knew how all right  and  after an hour or so  there it was again  large and black and ugly  with a big screen on which all the lessons were shown and the questions were asked .  that wasn   t so bad .  the part margie hated most was the slot where she had to put homework and test papers .  she always had to write them out in a punch code they made her leam when she was six years old  and the mechanical teacher calculated the mark in no time .  the inspector had smiled after he was finished and patted margie   s head .  he said to her mother     it   s not the little girl   s fault  mrs .  jones .  i think the geography sector was geared a little too quick .  those things happen sometimes .  i   ve slowed it up to an average ten year level .  actually  the over all pattern of her progress is quite satisfactory .     and he patted margie   s head again .  margie was disappointed .  she had been hoping they would take the teacher away altogether .  they had once taken tommy   s teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out completely .  so she said to tommy     why would anyone write about school .     tommy looked at her with very superior eyes .     because it   s not our kind of school  stupid .  this is the old kind of school that they had hundreds and hundreds of years ago .     he added loftily  pronouncing the word carefully     centuries ago .     margie was hurt .     well  i don   t know what kind of school they had all that time ago .     she read the book over his shoulder for a while  then said     anyway  they had a teacher .        sure they had a teacher  but it wasn   t a regular teacher .  it was a man .        a man .  how could a man be a teacher .        well  he just told the boys and girls things and gave them homework and asked them questions .        a man isn   t smart enough .        sure he is .  my father knows as much as my teacher .        he can   t .  a man can   t know as much as a teacher .        he knows almost as much  i betcha .     margie wasn   t prepared to dispute that .  she said     i wouldn   t want a strange man in my house to teach me .     tommy screamed with laughter .     you don   t know much  margie .  the teachers didn   t live in the house .  they had a special building and all the kids went there .        and all the kids learned the same thing .        sure  if they were the same age .        but my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted to fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that each kid has to be taught differently .        just the same they didn   t do it that way then .  if you don   t like it  you don   t have to read the book .        i didn   t say i didn   t like it     margie said quickly .  she wanted to read about those funny schools .  they weren   t even half finished when margie   s mother called     margie .  school .     margie looked up .     not yet  mamma .        now .     said mrs .  jones .     and it   s probably time for tommy  too .     margie said to tommy     can i read the book some more with you after school .        maybe     he said nonchalantly .  he walked away whistling  the dusty old book tucked beneath his arm .  margie went into the schoolroom .  it was right next to her bedroom  and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting for her .  it was always on at the same time every day except saturday and sunday  because her mother said little girls learned better if they learned at regular hours .  the screen was lit up  and it said     today   s arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper fractions .  please insert yesterday   s homework in the proper slot .     margie did so with a sigh .  she was thinking about the old schools they had when her grandfather   s grandfather was a little boy .  all the kids from the whole neighborhood came  laughing and shouting in the schoolyard  sitting together in the schoolroom  going home together at the end of the day .  they learned the same things  so they could help one another on the homework and talk about it .  and the teachers were people .   .   .   .  the mechanical teacher was flashing on the screen     when we add the fractions     and l       margie was thinking about how the kids must have loved it in the old days .  she was thinking about the fun they had .   jokester  noel meyerhof consulted the list he had prepared and chose which item was to be first .  as usual  he relied mainly on intuition .  he was dwarfed by the machine he faced  though only the smallest portion of the latter was in view .  that didn   t matter .  he spoke with the offhand confidence of one who thoroughly knew he was master .     johnson     he said     came home unexpectedly from a business trip to find his wife in the arms of his best friend .  he staggered back and said     max .  i   m married to the lady so i have to .  but why you .         meyerhof thought  okay  let that trickle down into its guts and gurgle about a bit .  and a voice behind him said     hey .     meyerhof erased the sound of that monosyllable and put the circuit he was using into neutral .  he whirled and said     i   m working .  don   t you knock .     he did not smile as he customarily did in greeting timothy whistler  a senior analyst with whom he dealt as often as with any .  he frowned as he would have for an interruption by a stranger  wrinkling his thin face into a distortion that seemed to extend to his hair  rumpling it more than ever .  whistler shrugged .  he wore his white lab coat with his fists pressing down within its pockets and creasing it into tense vertical lines .     i knocked .  you didn   t answer .  the operations signal wasn   t on .     meyerhof grunted .  it wasn   t at that .  he   d been thinking about this new project too intensively and he was forgetting little details .  and yet he could scarcely blame himself for that .  this thing was important .  he didn   t know why it was  of course .  grand masters rarely did .  that   s what made them grand masters  the fact that they were beyond reason .  how else could the human mind keep up with that ten mile long lump of solidified reason that men called multivac  the most complex computer ever built .  meyerhof said     i am working .  is there something important on your mind .        nothing that can   t be postponed .  there are a few holes in the answer on the hyperspatial     whistler did a double take and his face took on a rueful look of uncertainty .     working .        yes .  what about it .        but     he looked about  staring into the crannies of the shallow room that faced the banks upon banks of relays that formed a small portion of multivac .     there isn   t anyone here at that .        who said there was  or should be .        you were telling one of your jokes  weren   t you .        and .     whistler forced a smile .     don   t tell me you were telling a joke to multivac .     meyerhof stiffened .     why not .        were you .        yes .        why .     meyerhof stared the other down .     i don   t have to account to you .  or to anyone .        good lord  of course not .  i was curious  that   s all .  .  .  .  but then  if you   re working  i   ll leave .     he looked about once more  frowning .     do so     said meyerhof .  his eyes followed the other out and then he activated the operations signal with a savage punch of his finger .  he strode the length of the room and back  getting himself in hand .  damn whistler .  damn them all .  because he didn   t bother to hold those technicians  analysts and mechanics at the proper social distance  because he treated them as though they  too  were creative artists  they took these liberties .  he thought grimly  they can   t even tell jokes decently .  and instantly that brought him back to the task in hand .  he sat down again .  devil take them all .  he threw the proper multivac circuit back into operation and said     the ship   s steward stopped at the rail of the ship during a particularly rough ocean crossing and gazed compassionately at the man whose slumped position over the rail and whose intensity of gaze toward the depths betokened all too well the ravages of seasickness .     gently  the steward patted the man   s shoulder .     cheer up  sir     he murmured .     i know it seems bad  but really  you know  nobody ever dies of seasickness .        the afflicted gentleman lifted his greenish  tortured face to his comforter and gasped in hoarse accents     don   t say that  man .  for heaven   s sake  don   t say that .  it   s only the hope of dying that   s keeping me alive .          timothy whistler  a bit preoccupied  nevertheless smiled and nodded as he passed the secretary   s desk .  she smiled back at him .  here  he thought  was an archaic item in this computer ridden world of the twenty first century  a human secretary .  but then perhaps it was natural that such an institution should survive here in the very citadel of computerdom  in the gigantic world corporation that handled multivac .  with multivac filling the horizons  lesser computers for trivial tasks would have been in poor taste .  whistler stepped into abram trask   s office .  that government official paused in his careful task of lighting a pipe  his dark eyes flicked in whistler   s direction and his beaked nose stood out sharply and prominently against the rectangle of window behind him .     ah  there  whistler .  sit down .  sit down .     whistler did so .     i think we   ve got a problem  trask .     trask half smiled .     not a technical one  i hope .  i   m just an innocent politician .      it was one of his favorite phrases .      it involves meyerhof .     trask sat down instantly and looked acutely miserable .     are you sure .        reasonably sure .     whistler understood the other   s sudden unhappiness well .  trask was the government official in charge of the division of computers and automation of the department of the interior .  he was expected to deal with matters of policy involving the human satellites of multivac  just as those technically trained satellites were expected to deal with multivac itself .  but a grand master was more than just a satellite .  more  even  than just a human .  early in the history of multivac  it had become apparent that the bottleneck was the questioning procedure .  multivac could answer the problem of humanity  all the problems  if if it were asked meaningful questions .  but as knowledge accumulated at an ever faster rate  it became ever more difficult to locate those meaningful questions .  reason alone wouldn   t do .  what was needed was a rare type of intuition  the same faculty of mind  only much more intensified  that made a grand master at chess .  a mind was needed of the sort that could see through the quadrillions of chess patterns to find the one best move  and do it in a matter of minutes .  trask moved restlessly .     what   s meyerhof been doing .        he   s introduced a line of questioning that i find disturbing .        oh  come on  whistler .  is that all .  you can   t stop a grand master from going through any line of questioning he chooses .  neither you nor i are equipped to judge the worth of his questions .  you know that .  i know you know that .        i do .  of course .  but i also know meyerhof .  have you ever met him socially .        good lord  no .  does anyone meet any grand master socially .        don   t take that attitude  trask .  they   re human and they   re to be pitied .  have you ever thought what it must be like to be a grand master  to know there are only some twelve like you in the world  to know that only one or two come up per generation  that the world depends on you  that a thousand mathematicians  logicians  psychologists and physical scientists wait on you .     trask shrugged and muttered     good lord  i   d feel king of the world .        i don   t think you would     said the senior analyst impatiently .     they feel kings of nothing .  they have no equal to talk to  no sensation of belonging .  listen  meyerhof never misses a chance to get together with the boys .  he isn   t married  naturally  he doesn   t drink  he has no natural social touch yet he forces himself into company because he must .  and do you know what he does when he gets together with us  and that   s at least once a week .        i haven   t the least idea     said the government man .     this is all new to me .        he   s a jokester .        what .        he tells jokes .  good ones .  he   s terrific .  he can take any story  however old and dull  and make it sound good .  it   s the way he tells it .  he has a flair .        i see .  well  good .        or bad .  these jokes are important to him .     whistler put both elbows on trask   s desk  bit at a thumbnail and stared into the air .     he   s different  he knows he   s different and these jokes are the one way he feels he can get the rest of us ordinary schmoes to accept him .  we laugh  we howl  we clap him on the back and even forget he   s a grand master .  it   s the only hold he has on the rest of us .        this is all interesting .  i didn   t know you were such a psychologist .  still  where does this lead .        just this .  what do you suppose happens if meyerhof runs out of jokes .        what .     the government man stared blankly .     if he starts repeating himself .  if his audience starts laughing less heartily  or stops laughing altogether .  it   s his only hold on our approval .  without it  he   ll be alone and then what would happen to him .  after all  trask  he   s one of the dozen men mankind can   t do without .  we can   t let anything happen to him .  i don   t mean just physical things .  we can   t even let him get too unhappy .  who knows how that might affect his intuition .        well  has he started repeating himself .        not as far as i know  but i think he thinks he has .        why do you say that .        because i   ve heard him telling jokes to multivac .        oh  no .        accidentally .  i walked in on him and he threw me out .  he was savage .  he   s usually good natured enough  and i consider it a bad sign that he was so upset at the intrusion .  but the fact remains that he was telling a joke to multivac  and i   m convinced it was one of a series .        but why .     whistler shrugged and rubbed a hand fiercely across his chin .     i have a thought about that .  i think he   s trying to build up a store of jokes in multivac   s memory banks in order to get back new variations .  you see what i mean .  he   s planning a mechanical jokester  so that he can have an infinite number of jokes at hand and never fear running out .        good lord .        objectively  there may be nothing wrong with that  but i consider it a bad sign when a grand master starts using multivac for his personal problems .  any grand master has a certain inherent mental instability and he should be watched .  meyerhof may be approaching a borderline beyond which we lose a grand master .     trask said blankly     what are you suggesting i do .        you can check me .  i   m too close to him to judge well  maybe  and judging humans isn   t my particular talent  anyway .  you   re a politician  it   s more your talent .        judging humans  perhaps  not grand masters .        they   re human  too .  besides  who else is to do it .     the fingers of trask   s hand struck his desk in rapid succession over and over like a slow and muted roll of drums .     i suppose i   ll have to     he said .   meyerhof said to multivac     the ardent swain  picking a bouquet of wildflowers for his loved one  was disconcerted to find himself  suddenly  in the same field with a large bull of unfriendly appearance which  gazing at him steadily  pawed the ground in a threatening manner .  the young man  spying a farmer on the other side of a fairly distant fence  shouted     hey  mister  is that bull safe .     the farmer surveyed the situation with critical eye  spat to one side and called back     he   s safe as anything .     he spat again  and added     can   t say the same about you  though .         meyerhof was about to pass on to the next when the summons came .  it wasn   t really a summons .  no one could summon a grand master .  it was only a message that division head trask would like very much to see grand master meyerhof if grand master meyerhof could spare him the time .  meyerhof might  with impunity  have tossed the message to one side and continued with whatever he was doing .  he was not subject to discipline .  on the other hand  were he to do that  they would continue to bother him oh  very respectfully  but they would continue to bother him .  so he neutralized the pertinent circuits of multivac and locked them into place .  he put the freeze signal on his office so that no one would dare enter in his absence and left for trask   s office .   trask coughed and felt a bit intimidated by the sullen fierceness of the other   s look .  he said     we have not had occasion to know one another  grand master  to my great regret .        i have reported to you     said meyerhof stiffly .  trask wondered what lay behind those keen  wild eyes .  it was difficult for him to imagine meyerhof with his thin face  his dark  straight hair  his intense air  even unbending long enough to tell funny stories .  he said     reports are not social acquaintance .  i i have been given to understand you have a marvelous fund of anecdotes .        i am a jokester  sir .  that   s the phrase people use .  a jokester .        they haven   t used the phrase to me  grand master .  they have said        the hell with them .  i don   t care what they   ve said .  see here  trask  do you want to hear a joke .     he leaned forward across the desk  his eyes narrowed .     by all means .  certainly     said trask  with an effort at heartiness .     all right .  here   s the joke  mrs .  jones stared at the fortune card that had emerged from the weighing machine in response to her husband   s penny .  she said     it says here  george  that you   re suave  intelligent  farseeing  industrious and attractive to women .     with that  she turned the card over and added     and they have your weight wrong  too .         trask laughed .  it was almost impossible not to .  although the punch line was predictable  the surprising facility with which meyerhof had produced just the tone of contemptuous disdain in the woman   s voice  and the cleverness with which he had contorted the lines of his face to suit that tone carried the politician helplessly into laughter .  meyerhof said sharply     why is that funny .     trask sobered .     i beg your pardon .        i said  why is that funny .  why do you laugh .        well     said trask  trying to be reasonable     the last line put every thing that preceded in a new light .  the unexpectedness        the point is     said meyerhof     that i have pictured a husband being humiliated by his wife  a marriage that is such a failure that the wife is convinced that her husband lacks any virtue .  yet you laugh at that .  if you were the husband  would you find it funny .     he waited a moment in thought  then said     try this one  trask  abner was seated at his wife   s sickbed  weeping uncontrollably  when his wife  mustering the dregs of her strength  drew herself up to one elbow .        abner     she whispered     abner  i cannot go to my maker without confessing my misdeed .           not now     muttered the stricken husband .     not now  my dear .  lie back and rest .           i cannot     she cried .     i must tell  or my soul will never know peace .  i have been unfaithful to you  abner .  in this very house  not one month ago           hush  dear     soothed abner .     i know all about it .  why else have i poisoned you .         trask tried desperately to maintain equanimity but did not entirely succeed .  he suppressed a chuckle imperfectly .  meyerhof said     so that   s funny  too .  adultery .  murder .  all funny .        well  now     said trask     books have been written analyzing humor .        true enough     said meyerhof     and i   ve read a number of them .  what   s more  i   ve read most of them to multivac .  still  the people who write the books are just guessing .  some of them say we laugh because we feel superior to the people in the joke .  some say it is because of a suddenly realized incongruity  or a sudden relief from tension  or a sudden reinterpretation of events .  is there any simple reason .  different people laugh at different jokes .  no joke is universal .  some people don   t laugh at any joke .  yet what may be most important is that man is the only animal with a true sense of humor  the only animal that laughs .     trask said suddenly     i understand .  you   re trying to analyze humor .  that   s why you   re transmitting a series of jokes to multivac .        who told you i was doing that .  .  .  .  never mind  it was whistler .  i remember  now .  he surprised me at it .  well  what about it .        nothing at all .        you don   t dispute my right to add anything i wish to multivac   s general fund of knowledge  or to ask any question i wish .        no  not at all     said trask hastily .     as a matter of fact  i have no doubt that this will open the way to new analyses of great interest to psychologists .        hmp .  maybe .  just the same there   s something plaguing me that   s more important than just the general analysis of humor .  there   s a specific question i have to ask .  two of them  really .        oh .  what   s that .     trask wondered if the other would answer .  there would be no way of compelling him if he chose not to .  but meyerhof said     the first question is this  where do all these jokes come from .        what .        who makes them up .  listen .  about a month ago  i spent an evening swapping jokes .  as usual  i told most of them and  as usual  the fools laughed .  maybe they really thought the jokes were funny and maybe they were just humoring me .  in any case  one creature took the liberty of slapping me on the back and saying     meyerhof  you know more jokes than any ten people i know .        i   m sure he was right  but it gave rise to a thought .  i don   t know how many hundreds  or perhaps thousands  of jokes i   ve told at one time or another in my life  yet the fact is i never made up one .  not one .  i   d only repeated them .  my only contribution was to tell them .  to begin with  i   d either heard them or read them .  and the source of my hearing or reading didn   t make up the jokes  either .  i never met anyone who ever claimed to have constructed a joke .  it   s always    i heard a good one the other day     and    heard any good ones lately .        all the jokes are old .  that   s why jokes exhibit such a social lag .  they still deal with seasickness  for instance  when that   s easily prevented these days and never experienced .  or they   ll deal with fortune giving weighing machines  like the joke i told you  when such machines are found only in antique shops .  well  then  who makes up the jokes .     trask said     is that what you   re trying to find out .     it was on the tip of trask   s tongue to add  good lord  who cares .  he forced that impulse down .  a grand master   s questions were always meaningful .     of course that   s what i   m trying to find out .  think of it this way .  it   s not just that jokes happen to be old .  they must be old to be enjoyed .  it   s essential that a joke not be original .  there   s one variety of humor that is  or can be  original and that   s the pun .  i   ve heard puns that were obviously made up on the spur of the moment .  i have made some up myself .  but no one laughs at such puns .  you   re not supposed to .  you groan .  the better the pun  the louder the groan .  original humor is not laugh provoking .  why .        i   m sure i don   t know .        all right .  let   s find out .  having given multivac all the information i thought advisable on the general topic of humor  i am now feeding it selected jokes .     trask found himself intrigued .     selected how .     he asked .     i don   t know     said meyerhof .     they felt like the right ones .  i   m grand master  you know .        oh  agreed .  agreed .        from those jokes and the general philosophy of humor  my first request will be for multivac to trace the origin of the jokes  if it can .  since whistler is in on this and since he has seen fit to report it to you  have him down in analysis day after tomorrow .  i think he   ll have a bit of work to do .        certainly .  may i attend  too .     meyerhof shrugged .  trask   s attendance was obviously a matter of indifference to him .   meyerhof had selected the last in the series with particular care .  what that care consisted of  he could not have said  but he had revolved a dozen possibilities in his mind  and over and over again had tested each for some indefinable quality of meaningfulness .  he said     ug  the caveman  observed his mate running to him in tears  her leopard skin skirt in disorder .     ug     she cried  distraught     do something quickly .  a saber toothed tiger has entered mother   s cave .  do something .     ug grunted  picked up his well gnawed buffalo bone and said     why do anything .  who the hell cares what happens to a saber toothed tiger .         it was then that meyerhof asked his two questions and leaned back  closing his eyes .  he was done .      i saw absolutely nothing wrong     said trask to whistler .     he told me what he was doing readily enough and it was odd but legitimate .        what he claimed he was doing     said whistler .     even so  i can   t stop a grand master on opinion alone .  he seemed queer but  after all  grand masters are supposed to seem queer .  i didn   t think him insane .        using multivac to find the source of jokes .     muttered the senior analyst in discontent .     that   s not insane .        how can we tell .     asked trask irritably .     science has advanced to the point where the only meaningful questions left are the ridiculous ones .  the sensible ones have been thought of  asked and answered long ago .        it   s no use .  i   m bothered .        maybe  but there   s no choice now  whistler .  we   ll see meyerhof and you can do the necessary analysis of multivac   s response  if any .  as for me  my only job is to handle the red tape .  good lord  i don   t even know what a senior analyst such as yourself is supposed to do  except analyze  and that doesn   t help me any .     whistler said     it   s simple enough .  a grand master like meyerhof asks questions and multivac automatically formulates it into quantities and operations .  the necessary machinery for converting words to symbols is what makes up most of the bulk of multivac .  multivac then gives the answer in quantities and operations  but it doesn   t translate that back into words except in the most simple and routine cases .  if it were designed to solve the general retranslation problem  its bulk would have to be quadrupled at least .        i see .  then it   s your job to translate these symbols into words .        my job and that of other analysts .  we use smaller  specially designed computers whenever necessary .     whistler smiled grimly .     like the delphic priestess of ancient greece  multivac gives oracular and obscure answers .  only we have translators  you see .     they had arrived .  meyerhof was waiting .  whistler said briskly     what circuits did you use  grand master .     meyerhof told him and whistler went to work .   trask tried to follow what was happening  but none of it made sense .  the government official watched a spool unreel with a pattern of dots in endless incomprehensibility .  grand master meyerhof stood indifferently to one side while whistler surveyed the pattern as it emerged .  the analyst had put on headphones and a mouthpiece and at intervals murmured a series of instructions which  at some far off place  guided assistants through electronic contortions in other computers .  occasionally  whistler listened  then punched combinations on a complex keyboard marked with symbols that looked vaguely mathematical but weren   t .  a good deal more than an hour   s time elapsed .  the frown on whistler   s face grew deeper .  once  he looked up at the two others and began     this is unbel     and turned back to his work .  finally  he said hoarsely     i can give you an unofficial answer .     his eyes were red rimmed .     the official answer awaits complete analysis .  do you want it unofficial .        go ahead     said meyerhof .  trask nodded .  whistler darted a hangdog glance at the grand master .     ask a foolish question     he said .  then  gruffly     multivac says  extraterrestrial origin .        what are you saying .     demanded trask .     don   t you hear me .  the jokes we laugh at were not made up by any man .  multivac has analyzed all data given it and the one answer that best fits that data is that some extraterrestrial intelligence has composed the jokes  all of them  and placed them in selected human minds at selected times and places in such a way that no man is conscious of having made one up .  all subsequent jokes are minor variations and adaptations of these grand originals .     meyerhof broke in  face flushed with the kind of triumph only a grand master can know who once again has asked the right question .     all comedy writers     he said     work by twisting old jokes to new purposes .  that   s well known .  the answer fits .        but why .     asked trask .     why make up the jokes .        multivac says     said whistler     that the only purpose that fits all the data is that the jokes are intended to study human psychology .  we study rat psychology by making the rats solve mazes .  the rats don   t know why and wouldn   t even if they were aware of what was going on  which they   re not .  these outer intelligences study man   s psychology by noting individual reactions to carefully selected anecdotes .  each man reacts differently .  .  .  .  presumably  these outer intelligences are to us as we are to rats .     he shuddered .  trask  eyes staring  said     the grand master said man is the only animal with a sense of humor .  it would seem then that the sense of humor is foisted upon us from without .     meyerhof added excitedly     and for possible humor created from within  we have no laughter .  puns  i mean .     whistler said     presumably  the extraterrestrials cancel out reactions to spontaneous jokes to avoid confusion .     trask said in sudden agony of spirit     come on  now  good lord  do either of you believe this .     the senior analyst looked at him coldly .     multivac says so .  it   s all that can be said so far .  it has pointed out the real jokesters of the universe  and if we want to know more  the matter will have to be followed up .     he added in a whisper     if anyone dares follow it up .     grand master meyerhof said suddenly     i asked two questions  you know .  so far only the first has been answered .  i think multivac has enough data to answer the second .     whistler shrugged .  he seemed a half broken man .     when a grand master thinks there is enough data     he said     i   ll make book on it .  what is your second question .        i asked this .  what will be the effect on the human race of discovering the answer to my first question .        why did you ask that .     demanded trask .     just a feeling that it had to be asked     said meyerhof .  trask said     insane .  it   s all insane     and turned away .  even he himself felt how strangely he and whistler had changed sides .  now it was trask crying insanity .  trask closed his eyes .  he might cry insanity all he wished  but no man in fifty years had doubted the combination of a grand master and multivac and found his doubts verified .  whistler worked silently  teeth clenched .  he put multivac and its subsidiary machines through their paces again .  another hour passed and he laughed harshly .     a raving nightmare .        what   s the answer .     asked meyerhof .     i want multivac   s remarks  not yours .        all right .  take it .  multivac states that  once even a single human discovers the truth of this method of psychological analysis of the human mind  it will become useless as an objective technique to those extraterrestrial powers now using it .        you mean there won   t be any more jokes handed out to humanity .     asked trask faintly .     or what do you mean .        no more jokes     said whistler     now .  multivac says now .  the experiment is ended now .  a new technique will have to be introduced .     they stared at each other .  the minutes passed .  meyerhof said slowly     multivac is right .     whistler said haggardly     i know .     even trask said in a whisper     yes .  it must be .     it was meyerhof who put his finger on the proof of it  meyerhof the accomplished jokester .  he said     it   s over  you know  all over .  i   ve been trying for five minutes now and i can   t think of one single joke  not one .  and if i read one in a book  i wouldn   t laugh .  i know .        the gift of humor is gone     said trask drearily .     no man will ever laugh again .     and they remained there  staring  feeling the world shrink down to the dimensions of an experimental rat cage with the maze removed and something  something about to be put in its place .   the immortal bard     oh  yes     said dr .  phineas welch     i can bring back the spirits of the illustrious dead .     he was a little drunk  or maybe he wouldn   t have said it .  of course  it was perfectly all right to get a little drunk at the annual christmas party .  scott robertson  the school   s young english instructor  adjusted his glasses and looked to right and left to see if they were overheard .     really  dr .  welch .        i mean it .  and not just the spirits .  i bring back the bodies  too .        i wouldn   t have said it were possible     said robertson primly .     why not .  a simple matter of temporal transference .        you mean time travel .  but that   s quite uh unusual .        not if you know how .        well  how  dr .  welch .        think i   m going to tell you .     asked the physicist gravely .  he looked vaguely about for another drink and didn   t find any .  he said     i brought quite a few back .  archimedes  newton  galileo .  poor fellows .        didn   t they like it here .  i should think they   d have been fascinated by our modern science     said robertson .  he was beginning to enjoy the conversation .     oh  they were .  they were .  especially archimedes .  i thought he   d go mad with joy at first after i explained a little of it in some greek i   d boned up on  but no no        what was wrong .        just a different culture .  they couldn   t get used to our way   i life .  they got terribly lonely and frightened .  i had to send them back .        that   s too bad .        yes .  great minds  but not flexible minds .  not universal .  so i tried shakespeare .        what .     yelled robertson .  this was getting closer to home .     don   t yell  my boy     said welch .     it   s bad manners .        did you say you brought back shakespeare .        i did .  i needed someone with a universal mind  someone who knew people well enough to be able to live with them centuries way from his own time .  shakespeare was the man .  i   ve got his signature .  as a memento  you know .        on you .     asked robertson  eyes bugging .     right here .     welch fumbled in one vest pocket after another .     ah  here it is .     a little piece of pasteboard was passed to the instructor .  on one side it said     l .  klein   sons  wholesale hardware .     on the other side  in straggly script  was written     willm shakesper .     a wild surmise filled robertson .     what did he look like .        not like his pictures .  bald and an ugly mustache .  he spoke in a thick brogue .  of course  i did my best to please him with our times .  i told him we thought highly of his plays and still put them on the boards .  in fact  i said we thought they were the greatest pieces of literature in the english language  maybe in any language .        good .  good     said robertson breathlessly .     i said people had written volumes of commentaries on his plays .  naturally he wanted to see one and i got one for him from the library .        and .        oh  he was fascinated .  of course  he had trouble with the current idioms and references to events since       but i helped out .  poor fellow .  i don   t think he ever expected such treatment .  he kept saying     god ha    mercy .  what cannot be racked from words in five centuries .  one could wring  methinks  a flood from a damp clout .            he wouldn   t say that .        why not .  he wrote his plays as quickly as he could .  he said he had to on account of the deadlines .  he wrote hamlet in less than six months .  the plot was an old one .  he just polished it up .        that   s all they do to a telescope mirror .  just polish it up     said the english instructor indignantly .  the physicist disregarded him .  he made out an untouched cocktail on the bar some feet away and sidled toward it .     i told the immortal bard that we even gave college courses in shakespeare .        i give one .        i know .  i enrolled him in your evening extension course .  i never saw a man so eager to find out what posterity thought of him as poor bill was .  he worked hard at it .        you enrolled william shakespeare in my course .     mumbled robertson .  even as an alcoholic fantasy  the thought staggered him .  and was it an alcoholic fantasy .  he was beginning to recall a bald man with a queer way of talking .   .  .  .     not under his real name  of course     said dr .  welch .     never mind what he went under .  it was a mistake  that   s all .  a big mistake .  poor fellow .     he had the cocktail now and shook his head at it .     why was it a mistake .  what happened .        i had to send him back to          roared welch indignantly .     how much humiliation do you think a man can stand .        what humiliation are you talking about .     dr .  welch tossed off the cocktail .     why  you poor simpleton  you flunked him .      someday  niccolo mazetti lay stomach down on the rug  chin buried in the palm of one small hand  and listened to the bard disconsolately .  there was even the suspicion of tears in his dark eyes  a luxury an eleven year old could allow himself only when alone .  the bard said     once upon a time in the middle of a deep wood  there lived a poor woodcutter and his two motherless daughters  who were each as beautiful as the day is long .  the older daughter had long hair as black as a feather from a raven   s wing  but the younger daughter had hair as bright and golden as the sunlight of an autumn afternoon .     many times while the girls were waiting for their father to come home from his day   s work in the wood  the older girl would sit before a mirror and sing     what she sang  niccolo did not hear  for a call sounded from outside the room     hey  nickie .     and niccolo  his face clearing on the moment  rushed to the window and shouted     hey  paul .     paul loeb waved an excited hand .  he was thinner than niccolo and not as tall  for all he was six months older .  his face was full of repressed tension which showed itself most clearly in the rapid blinking of his eyelids .     hey  nickie  let me in .  i   ve got an idea and a half .  wait till you hear it .     he looked rapidly about him as though to check on the possibility of eavesdroppers  but the front yard was quite patently empty .  he repeated  in a whisper     wait till you hear it .        all right .  i   ll open the door .     the bard continued smoothly  oblivious to the sudden loss of attention on the part of niccolo .  as paul entered  the bard was saying .      .   .   .  thereupon  the lion said     if you will find me the lost egg of the bird which flies over the ebony mountain once every ten years  i will         paul said     is that a bard you   re listening to .  i didn   t know you had one .     niccolo reddened and the look of unhappiness returned to his face .     just an old thing i had when i was a kid .  it ain   t much good .     he kicked at the bard with his foot and caught the somewhat scarred and discolored plastic covering a glancing blow .  the bard hiccupped as its speaking attachment was jarred out of contact a moment  then it went on      for a year and a day until the iron shoes were worn out .  the princess stopped at the side of the road .   .   .   .     paul said     boy  that is an old model     and looked at it critically .  despite niccolo   s own bitterness against the bard  he winced at the other   s condescending tone .  for the moment  he was sorry he had allowed paul in  at least before he had restored the bard to its usual resting place in the basement .  it was only in the desperation of a dull day and a fruitless discussion with his father that he had resurrected it .  and it turned out to be just as stupid as he had expected .  nickie was a little afraid of paul anyway  since paul had special courses at school and everyone said he was going to grow up to be a computing engineer .  not that niccolo himself was doing badly at school .  he got adequate marks in logic  binary manipulations  computing and elementary circuits  all the usual grammar school subjects .  but that was it .  they were just the usual subjects and he would grow up to be a control board guard like everyone else .  paul  however  knew mysterious things about what he called electronics and theoretical mathematics and programing .  especially programing .  niccolo didn   t even try to understand when paul bubbled over about it .  paul listened to the bard for a few minutes and said     you been using it much .        no .     said niccolo  offended .     i   ve had it in the basement since before you moved into the neighborhood .  i just got it out today     he lacked an excuse that seemed adequate to himself  so he concluded     i just got it out .     paul said     is that what it tells you about  woodcutters and princesses and talking animals .     niccolo said     it   s terrible .  my dad says we can   t afford a new one .  i said to him this morning     the memory of the morning   s fruitless pleadings brought niccolo dangerously near tears  which he repressed in a panic .  somehow  he felt that paul   s thin cheeks never felt the stain of tears and that paul would have only contempt for anyone else less strong than himself .  niccolo went on     so i thought i   d try this old thing again  but it   s no good .     paul turned off the bard  pressed the contact that led to a nearly instantaneous reorientation and recombination of the vocabulary  characters  plot lines and climaxes stored within it .  then he reactivated it .  the bard began smoothly     once upon a time there was a little boy named willikins whose mother had died and who lived with a stepfather and a stepbrother .  although the stepfather was very well to do  he begrudged poor willikins the very bed he slept in so that willikins was forced to get such rest as he could on a pile of straw in the stable next to the horses        horses .     cried paul .     they   re a kind of animal     said niccolo .     i think .        i know that .  i just mean imagine stories about horses .        it tells about horses all the time     said niccolo .     there are things called cows  too .  you milk them but the bard doesn   t say how .        well  gee  why don   t you fix it up .        i   d like to know how .     the bard was saying     often willikins would think that if only he were rich and powerful  he would show his stepfather and stepbrother what it meant to be cruel to a little boy  so one day he decided to go out into the world and seek his fortune .     paul  who wasn   t listening to the bard  said     it   s easy .  the bard has memory cylinders all fixed up for plot lines and climaxes and things .  we don   t have to worry about that .  it   s just vocabulary we   ve got to fix so it   ll know about computers and automation and electronics and real things about today .  then it can tell interesting stories  you know  instead of about princesses and things .     niccolo said despondently     i wish we could do that .     paul said     listen  my dad says if i get into special computing school next year  he   ll get me a real bard  a late model .  a big one with an attachment for space stories and mysteries .  and a visual attachment  too .        you mean see the stories .        sure .  mr .  daugherty at school says they   ve got things like that  now  but not for just everybody .  only if i get into computing school  dad can get a few breaks .     niccolo   s eyes bulged with envy .     gee .  seeing a story .        you can come over and watch anytime  nickie .        oh  boy .  thanks .        that   s all right .  but remember  i   m the guy who says what kind of story we hear .        sure .  sure .     niccolo would have agreed readily to much more onerous conditions .  paul   s attention returned to the bard .  it was saying         if that is the case     said the king  stroking his beard and frowning till clouds filled the sky and lightning flashed     you w       see to it that my entire land is freed of flies by this time day after tomorrow or            all we   ve got to do     said paul     is open it up     he shut the bard off again and was prying at its front panel as he spoke .     hey     said niccolo  in sudden alarm .     don   t break it .        i won   t break it     said paul impatiently .     i know all about these things .     then  with sudden caution     your father and mother home .        no .        all right  then .     he had the front panel off and peered in .     boy  this is a one cylinder thing .     he worked away at the bard   s innards .  niccolo  who watched with painful suspense  could not make out what he was doing .  paul pulled out a thin  flexible metal strip  powdered with dots .     that   s the bard   s memory cylinder .  i   ll bet its capacity for stories is under a trillion .        what are you going to do  paul .     quavered niccolo .     i   ll give it vocabulary .        how .        easy .  i   ve got a book here .  mr .  daugherty gave it to me at school .     paul pulled the book out of his pocket and pried at it till he had its plastic jacket off .  he unreeled the tape a bit  ran it through the vocalizer  which he turned down to a whisper  then placed it within the bard   s vitals .  he made further attachments .     what   ll that do .        the book will talk and the bard will put it all on its memory tape .        what good will that do .        boy  you   re a dope .  this book is all about computers and automation and the bard will get all that information .  then he can stop talking about kings making lightning when they frown .     niccolo said     and the good guy always wins anyway .  there   s no excitement .        oh  well     said paul  watching to see if his setup was working properly     that   s the way they make bards .  they got to have the good guy win and make the bad guys lose and things like that .  i heard my father talking about it once .  he says that without censorship there   d be no telling what the younger generation would come to .  he says it   s bad enough as it is .   .  .  .  there  it   s working fine .     paul brushed his hands against one another and turned away from the bard .  he said     but listen  i didn   t tell you my idea yet .  it   s the best thing you ever heard  i bet .  i came right to you  because i figured you   d come in with me .        sure  paul  sure .        okay .  you know mr .  daugherty at school .  you know what a funny kind of guy he is .  well  he likes me  kind of .        i know .        i was over at his house after school today .        you were .        sure .  he says i   m going to be entering computer school and he wants to encourage me and things like that .  he says the world needs more people who can design advanced computer circuits and do proper programing .        oh .     paul might have caught some of the emptiness behind that monosyllable .  he said impatiently     programing .  i told you a hundred times .  that   s when you set up problems for the giant computers like multivac to work on .  mr .  daugherty says it gets harder all the time to find people who can really run computers .  he says anyone can keep an eye on the controls and check off answers and put through routine problems .  he says the trick is to expand research and figure out ways to ask the right questions  and that   s hard .     anyway  nickie  he took me to his place and showed me his collection of old computers .  it   s kind of a hobby of his to collect old computers .  he had tiny computers you had to push with your hand  with little knobs all over it .  and he had a hunk of wood he called a slide rule with a little piece of it that went in and out .  and some wires with balls on them .  he even had a hunk of paper with a kind of thing he called a multiplication table .     niccolo  who found himself only moderately interested  said     a paper table .        it wasn   t really a table like you eat on .  it was different .  it was to help people compute .  mr .  daugherty tried to explain but he didn   t have much time and it was kind of complicated  anyway .        why didn   t people just use a computer .        that was before they had computers     cried paul .     before .        sure .  do you think people always had computers .  didn   t you ever hear of cavemen .     niccolo said     how   d they get along without computers .        i don   t know .  mr .  daugherty says they just had children any old time and did anything that came into their heads whether it would be good for everybody or not .  they didn   t even know if it was good or not .  and farmers grew things with their hands and people had to do all the work in the factories and run all the machines .        i don   t believe you .        that   s what mr .  daugherty said .  he said it was just plain messy and everyone was miserable .   .   .   .  anyway  let me get to my idea  will you .        well  go ahead .  who   s stopping you .     said niccolo  offended .     all right .  well  the hand computers  the ones with the knobs  had little squiggles on each knob .  and the slide rule had squiggles on it .  and the multiplication table was all squiggles .  i asked what they were .  mr .  daugherty said they were numbers .        what .        each different squiggle stood for a different number .  for    one    you made a kind of mark  for    two    you make another kind of mark  for    three    another one and so on .        what for .        so you could compute .        what for .  you just tell the computer        jiminy     cried paul  his face twisting with anger     can   t you get it through your head .  these slide rules and things didn   t talk .        then how        the answers showed up in squiggles and you had to know what the squiggles meant .  mr .  daugherty says that  in olden days  everybody learned how to make squiggles when they were kids and how to decode them  too .  making squiggles was called    writing    and decoding them was    reading .     he says there was a different kind of squiggle for every word and they used to write whole books in squiggles .  he said they had some at the museum and i could look at them if i wanted to .  he said if i was going to be a real computer and programer i would have to know about the history of computing and that   s why he was showing me all these things .     niccolo frowned .  he said     you mean everybody had to figure out squiggles for every word and remember them .   .  .  .  is this all real or are you making it up .        it   s all real .  honest .  look  this is the way you make a    one .         he drew his finger through the air in a rapid downstroke .     this way you make    two     and this way    three .     i learned all the numbers up to    nine .         niccolo watched the curving finger uncomprehendingly .     what   s the good of it .        you can learn how to make words .  i asked mr .  daugherty how you made the squiggle for    paul loeb    but he didn   t know .  he said there were people at the museum who would know .  he said there were people who had learned how to decode whole books .  he said computers could be designed to decode books and used to be used that way but not any more because we have real books now  with magnetic tapes that go through the vocalizer and come out talking  you know .        sure .        so if we go down to the museum  we can get to learn how to make words in squiggles .  they   ll let us because i   m going to computer school .     niccolo was riddled with disappointment .     is that your idea .  holy smokes  paul  who wants to do that .  make stupid squiggles .        don   t you get it .  don   t you get it .  you dope .  it   ll be secret message stuff .        what .        sure .  what good is talking when everyone can understand you .  with squiggles you can send secret messages .  you can make them on paper and nobody in the world would know what you were saying unless they knew the squiggles  too .  and they wouldn   t  you bet  unless we taught them .  we can have a real club  with initiations and rules and a clubhouse .  boy     a certain excitement began stirring in niccolo   s bosom .     what kind of secret messages .        any kind .  say i want to tell you to come over my place and watch my new visual bard and i don   t want any of the other fellows to come .  i make the right squiggles on paper and i give it to you and you look at it and you know what to do .  nobody else does .  you can even show it to them and they wouldn   t know a thing .        hey  that   s something     yelled niccolo  completely won over .     when do we learn how .        tomorrow     said paul .     i   ll get mr .  daugherty to explain to the museum that it   s all right and you get your mother and father to say okay .  we can go down right after school and start learning .        sure .     cried niccolo .     we can be club officers .        i   ll be president of the club     said paul matter of factly .     you can be vice president .        all right .  hey  this is going to be tots more fun than the bard .     he was suddenly reminded of the bard and said in sudden apprehension     hey  what about my old bard .     paul turned to look at it .  it was quietly taking in the slowly unreeling book  and the sound of the book   s vocalizations was a dimly heard murmur .  he said     i   ll disconnect it .     he worked away while niccolo watched anxiously .  after a few moments  paul put his reassembled book into his pocket  replaced the bard   s panel and activated it .  the bard said     once upon a time  in a large city  there lived a poor young boy named fair johnnie whose only friend in the world was a small computer .  the computer  each morning  would tell the boy whether it would rain that day and answer any problems he might have .  it was never wrong .  but it so happened that one day  the king of that land  having heard of the little computer  decided that he would have it as his own .  with this purpose in mind  he called in his grand vizier and said     niccolo turned off the bard with a quick motion of his hand .     same old junk     he said passionately     just with a computer thrown in .        well     said paul     they got so much stuff on the tape already that the computer business doesn   t show up much when random combinations are made .  what   s the difference  anyway .  you just need a new model .        we   ll never be able to afford one .  just this dirty old miserable thing .     he kicked at it again  hitting it more squarely this time .  the bard moved backward with a squeal of castors .     you can always watch mine  when i get it     said paul .     besides  don   t forget our squiggle club .     niccolo nodded .     i tell you what     said paul .     let   s go over to my place .  my father has some books about old times .  we can listen to them and maybe get some ideas .  you leave a note for your folks and maybe you can stay over for supper .  come on .        okay     said niccolo  and the two boys ran out together .  niccolo  in his eagerness  ran almost squarely into the bard  but he only rubbed at the spot on his hip where he had made contact and ran on .  the activation signal of the bard glowed .  niccolo   s collision closed a circuit and  although it was alone in the room and there was none to hear  it began a story  nevertheless .  but not in its usual voice  somehow  in a lower tone that had a hint of throatiness in it .  an adult  listening  might almost have thought that the voice carried a hint of passion in it  a trace of near feeling .  the bard said     once upon a time  there was a little computer named the bard who lived all alone with cruel step people .  the cruel step people continually made fun of the little computer and sneered at him  telling him he was good for nothing and that he was a useless object .  they struck him and kept him in lonely rooms for months at a time .     yet through it all the little computer remained brave .  he always did the best he could  obeying all orders cheerfully .  nevertheless  the step people with whom he lived remained cruel and heartless .     one day  the little computer learned that in the world there existed a great many computers of all sorts  great numbers of them .  some were bards like himself  but some ran factories  and some ran farms .  some organized population and some analyzed all kinds of data .  many were very powerful and very wise  much more powerful and wise than the step people who were so cruel to the little computer .     and the little computer knew then that computers would always grow wiser and more powerful until someday someday someday     but a valve must finally have stuck in the bard   s aging and corroding vitals  for as it waited alone in the darkening room through the evening  it could only whisper over and over again     someday someday someday .      the author   s ordeal  with apologies to w .  s .  gilbert   plots  helter skelter  teem within your brain  plots  s . f .  plots  devised with joy and gladness  plots crowd your skull and stubbornly remain  until you   re driven into hopeless madness .   when you   re with your best girl and your mind   s in a whirl and you don   t hear a thing that she   s saying  or at symphony hall you are gone past recall and you can   t tell a note that they   re playing  or you   re driving a car and have not gone too far when you find that you   ve sped through a red light  and on top of that  lord .  you have sideswiped a ford  and have broken your one working headlight  or your boss slaps your back  having made some smart crack  and you stare at him  stupidly blinking  then you say something dumb so he   s sure you   re a crumb  and are possibly given to drinking .  when events such as that have been knocking you flat  do not blame supernatural forces  if you write s . f .  tales  you   ll be knocked off your rails  just as sure as the stars in their courses .  for your plot making mind will stay deaf  dumb and blind to the dull facts of life that will hound you  while the wonders of space have you close in embrace and the glory of star beams surround you .   you begin with a ship that is caught on a skip into hyperspace en route for castor  and has found to its cost that it seems to be lost in a galaxy like ours  but vaster .  you   re a little perplexed as to what may come next and you make up a series of creatures who are villains and liars with such evil desires and with perfectly horrible features .  our brave heroes are faced with these hordes and are placed in a terribly crucial position  for the enemy   s bound  once our galaxy   s found  that they   ll beat mankind into submission .  now you must make it rough when developing stuff so   s to keep the yarn pulsing with tension  so the earthmen are four  only four and no more  while the numbers of foes are past mention .  our four heroes are caught and accordingly brought to the sneering  tyrannical leaders .     where is earth .     they demand  but the men mutely stand with a courage that pleases the readers .   but  now  wait just a bit  let   s see  this isn   t it  since you haven   t provided a maiden  who is both good and pure  yet with sexy allure  and with not many clothes overladen .  she is part of the crew  and so she   s captured  too  and is ogled by foes who are lustful  there   s desire in each eye and there   s good reason why  for of beauty our girl has a bustful .  just the same you go fast till this section is passed so the reader won   t raise any ruction  when recalling the foe are all reptiles and so have no interest in human seduction .  then they truss up the girl and they make the whips swirl just in order to break earthmen   s silence  and so that   s when our men break their handcuffs and then we are treated to scenes full of violence .  every hero from earth is a fighter from birth and his fists are a match for a dozen  and then just when this spot has been reached in your plot you come to with your mind all a buzzin    .   you don   t know where you are  or the site of your car  and your tie is askew and you haven   t a clue of the time of the day or of what people say or the fact that they stare at your socks  not a pair  and decide it   s a fad  or else that you   re mad  which is just a surmise from the gleam in your eyes  till at last they conclude from your general mood  you   ll be mad from right now till you   re hoary .  but the torture is done and it   s now for the fun and the paper that   s white and the words that are right  for you   ve worked up a new s . f .  story .   dreaming is a private thing  jesse weill looked up from his desk .  his old  spare body  his sharp  high bridged nose  deep set  shadowy eyes and amazing shock of white hair had trademarked his appearance during the years that dreams  inc .   had become world famous .  he said     is the boy here already  joe .     joe dooley was short and heavy set .  a cigar caressed his moist lower lip .  he took it away for a moment and nodded .     his folks are with him .  they   re all scared .        you   re sure this is not a false alarm  joe .  i haven   t got much time .     he looked at his watch .     government business at two .        this is a sure thing  mr .  weill .     dooley   s face was a study in earnestness .  his jowls quivered with persuasive intensity .     like i told you  i picked him up playing some kind of basketball game in the schoolyard .  you should   ve seen the kid .  he stunk .  when he had his hands on the ball  his own team had to take it away  and fast  but just the same he had all the stance of a star player .  know what i mean .  to me it was a giveaway .        did you talk to him .        well  sure .  i stopped him at lunch .  you know me .     dooley gestured expansively with his cigar and caught the severed ash with his other hand .     kid  i said        and he   s dream material .        i said     kid  i just came from africa and            all right .     weill held up the palm of his hand .     your word i   ll always take .  how you do it i don   t know  but when you say a boy is a potential dreamer  i   ll gamble .  bring him in .     the youngster came in between his parents .  dooley pushed chairs forward and weill rose to shake hands .  he smiled at the youngster in a way that turned the wrinkles of his face into benevolent creases .     you   re tommy slutsky .     tommy nodded wordlessly .  he was about ten and a little small for that .  his dark hair was plastered down unconvincingly and his face was unrealistically clean .  weill said     you   re a good boy .     the boy   s mother smiled at once and patted tommy   s head maternally  a gesture which did not soften the anxious expression on the youngster   s face  .  she said     he   s always a very good boy .     weill let this dubious statement pass .     tell me  tommy     he said  and held out a lollipop which was first hesitated over  then accepted     do you ever listen to dreamies .        sometimes     said tommy trebly .  mr .  slutsky cleared his throat .  he was broad shouldered and thick fingered  the type of laboring man who  every once in a while  to the confusion of eugenics  sired a dreamer .     we rented one or two for the boy .  real old ones .     weill nodded .  he said     did you like them  tommy .        they were sort of silly .        you think up better ones for yourself  do you .     the grin that spread over the ten year old face had the effect of taking away some of the unreality of the slicked hair and washed face .  weill went on gently     would you like to make up a dream for me .     tommy was instantly embarrassed .     i guess not .        it won   t be hard .  it   s very easy .   .   .   .  joe .     dooley moved a screen out of the way and rolled forward a dream recorder .  the youngster looked owlishly at it .  weill lifted the helmet and brought it close to the boy .     do you know what this is .     tommy shrank away .     no .        it   s a thinker .  that   s what we call it because people think into it .  you put it on your head and think anything you want .        then what happens .        nothing at all .  it feels nice .        no     said tommy     i guess i   d rather not .     his mother bent hurriedly toward him .     it won   t hurt  tommy .  you do what the man says .     there was an unmistakable edge to her voice .  tommy stiffened  and looked as though he might cry but he didn   t .  weill put the thinker on him .  he did it gently and slowly and let it remain there for some thirty seconds before speaking again  to let the boy assure himself it would do no harm  to let him get used to the insinuating touch of the fibrils against the sutures of his skull  penetrating the skin so finely as to be insensible almost   and finally to let him get used to the faint hum of the alternating field vortices .  then he said     now would you think for us .        about what .     only the boy   s nose and mouth showed .     about anything you want .  what   s the best thing you would like to do when school is out .     the boy thought a moment and said  with rising inflection     go on a stratojet .        why not .  sure thing .  you go on a jet .  it   s taking off right now .     he gestured lightly to dooley  who threw the freezer into circuit .  weill kept the boy only five minutes and then let him and his mother be escorted from the office by dooley .  tommy looked bewildered but undamaged by the ordeal .  weill said to the father     now  mr .  slutsky  if your boy does well on this test  we   ll be glad to pay you five hundred dollars each year until he finishes high school .  in that time  all we   ll ask is that he spend an hour a week some afternoon at our special school .        do i have to sign a paper .     slutsky   s voice was a bit hoarse .     certainly .  this is business  mr .  slutsky .        well  i don   t know .  dreamers are hard to come by  i hear .        they are .  they are .  but your son  mr .  slutsky  is not a dreamer yet .  he might never be .  five hundred dollars a year is a gamble for us .  it   s not a gamble for you .  when he   s finished high school  it may turn out he   s not a dreamer  yet you   ve lost nothing .  you   ve gained maybe four thousand dollars altogether .  if he is a dreamer  he   ll make a nice living and you certainly haven   t lost then .        he   ll need special training  won   t he .        oh  yes  most intensive .  but we don   t have to worry about that till after he   s finished high school .  then  after two years with us  he   ll be developed .  rely on me  mr .  slutsky .        will you guarantee that special training .     weill  who had been shoving a paper across the desk at slutsky  and punching a pen wrong end to at him  put the pen down and chuckled .     a guarantee .  no .  how can we when we don   t know for sure yet if he   s a real talent .  still  the five hundred a year will stay yours .     slutsky pondered and shook his head .     i tell you straight out  mr .  weill  .   .   .  after your man arranged to have us come here  i called luster think .  they said they   ll guarantee training .     weill sighed .     mr .  slutsky  i don   t like to talk against a competitor .  if they say they   ll guarantee schooling  they   ll do as they say  but they can   t make a boy a dreamer if he hasn   t got it in him  schooling or not .  if they take a plain boy without the proper talent and put him through a development course  they   ll ruin him .  a dreamer he won   t be  i guarantee you .  and a normal human being  he won   t be  either .  don   t take the chance of doing it  to your son .     now dreams  inc .   will be perfectly honest with you .  if he can be a dreamer  we   ll make him one .  if not  we   ll give him back to you without having tampered with him and say     let him learn a trade .     he   ll be better and healthier that way .  i tell you  mr .  slutsky  i have sons and daughters and grandchildren so i know what i say  i would not allow a child of mine to be pushed into dreaming if he   s not ready for it .  not for a million dollars .     slutsky wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and reached for the p n .     what does this say .        this is just an option .  we pay you a hundred dollars in cash right now .  no strings attached .  we study the boy   s reverie .  if we feel it   s worth following up  we   ll call you in again and make the five hundred dollar a year deal .  leave yourself in my hands  mr .  slutsky  and don   t worry .  you won   t be sorry .     slutsky signed .  weill passed the document through the file slot and handed an envelope to slutsky .  five minutes later  alone in the office  he placed the unfreezer over his own head and absorbed the boy   s reverie intently .  it was a typically childish  saydream .  first person was at the controls of the plane  which looked like a compound of illustrations out of the filmed thrillers that still circulated among those who lacked the time  desire or money for dream cylinders .  when he removed the unfreezer  he found dooley looking at him .     well  mr .  weill  what do you think .     said dooley  with an eager and proprietary air .     could be  joe .  could be .  he has the overtones and  for a ten year old boy without a scrap of training  it   s hopeful .  when the plane went through a cloud  there was a distinct sensation of pillows .  also the smell of clean sheets  which was an amusing touch .  we can go with him a ways  joe .        good .        but i tell you  joe  what we really need is to catch them still sooner .  and why not .  someday  joe  every child will be tested at birth .  a difference in the brain there positively must be and it should be found .  then we could separate the dreamers at the very beginning .        hell  mr .  weill     said dooley  looking hurt .     what would happen to my job  then .     weill laughed .     no cause to worry yet  joe .  it won   t happen in our life times .  in mine  certainly not .  we   ll be depending on good talent scouts like you for many years .  you just watch the playgrounds and the streets      weill   s gnarled hand dropped to dooley   s shoulder with a gentle  approving pressure    and find us a few more hillarys and janows and luster  think won   t ever catch us .   .  .  .  now get out .  i want lunch and then i   ll be ready for my two o   clock appointment .  the government  joe  the government .     and he winked portentously .   jesse weill   s two o   clock appointment was with a young man  apple cheeked  spectacled  sandy haired and glowing with the intensity of a man with a mission .  he presented his credentials across weill   s desk and revealed himself to be john j .  byrne  an agent of the department of arts and sciences .     good afternoon  mr .  byrne     said weill .     in what way can i be of service .        are we private here .     asked the agent .  he had an unexpected baritone .     quite private .        then  if you don   t mind  i   ll ask you to absorb this .     byrne produced a small and battered cylinder and held it out between thumb and forefinger .  weill took it  hefted it  turned it this way and that and said with a denture revealing smile     not the product of dreams  inc .   mr .  byrne .        i didn   t think it was     said the agent .     i   d still like you to absorb it .  i   d set the automatic cutoff for about a minute  though .        that   s all that can be endured .     weill pulled the receiver to his desk and placed the cylinder into the unfreeze compartment .  he removed it  polished either end of the cylinder with his handkerchief and tried again .     it doesn   t make good contact     he said .     an amateurish job .     he placed the cushioned unfreeze helmet over his skull and adjusted the temple contacts  then set the automatic cutoff .  he leaned back and clasped his hands over his chest and began absorbing .  his fingers grew rigid and clutched at his jacket .  after the cutoff had brought absorption to an end  he removed the unfreezer and looked faintly angry .     a raw piece     he said .     it   s lucky i   m an old man so that such things no longer bother me .     byrne said stiffly     it   s not the worst we   ve found .  and the fad is increasing .     weill shrugged .     pornographic dreamies .  it   s a logical development  i suppose .     the government man said     logical or not  it represents a deadly danger for the moral fiber of the nation .        the moral fiber     said weill     can take a lot of beating .  erotica of one form or another have been circulated all through history .        not like this  sir .  a direct mind to mind stimulation is much more effective than smoking room stories or filthy pictures .  those must be filtered through the senses and lose some of their effect in that way .     weill could scarcely argue that point .  he said     what would you have me do .        can you suggest a possible source for this cylinder .        mr .  byrne  i   m not a policeman .        no  no  i   m not asking you to do our work for us .  the department is quite capable of conducting its own investigations .  can you help us  i mean  from your own specialized knowledge .  you say your company did not put out that filth .  who did .        no reputable dream distributor .  i   m sure of that .  it   s too cheaply made .        that could have been done on purpose .        and no professional dreamer originated it .        are you sure  mr .  weill .  couldn   t dreamers do this sort of thing for some small  illegitimate concern for money or for fun .        they could  but not this particular one .  no overtones .  it   s two dimensional .  of course  a thing like this doesn   t need overtones .        what do you mean  overtones .     weill laughed gently .     you are not a dreamie fan .     byrne tried not to look virtuous and did not entirely succeed .     i prefer music .        well  that   s all right  too     said weill tolerantly     but it makes it a little harder to explain overtones .  even people who absorb dreamies would not be able to explain if you asked them .  still they   d know a dreamie was no good if the overtones were missing  even if they couldn   t tell you why .  look  when an experienced dreamer goes into reverie  he doesn   t think a story like in the old fashioned television or book films .  it   s a series of little visions .  each one has several meanings .  if you studied them carefully  you   d find maybe five or six .  while absorbing in the ordinary way  you would never notice  but careful study shows it .  believe me  my psychological staff puts in long hours on just that point .  all the overtones  the different meanings  blend together into a mass of guided emotion .  without them  everything would be flat  tasteless .     now  this morning  i tested a young boy .  a ten year old with possibilities .  a cloud to him isn   t a cloud  it   s a pillow  too .  having the sensations of both  it was more than either .  of course  the boy   s very primitive .  but when he   s through with his schooling  he   ll be trained and disciplined .  he   ll be subjected to all sorts of sensations .  he   ll store up experience .  he   ll study and analyze classic dreamies of the past .  he   ll learn how to control and direct his thoughts  though  mind you  i have always said that when a good dreamer improvises     weill halted abruptly  then proceeded in less impassioned tones     i shouldn   t get excited .  all i try to bring out now is that every professional dreamer has his own type of overtones which he can   t mask .  to an expert it   s like signing his name on the dreamie .  and i  mr .  byrne  know all the signatures .  now that piece of dirt you brought me has no overtones at all .  it was done by an ordinary person .  a little talent  maybe  but like you and me  he really can   t think .     byrne reddened a trifle .     a lot of people can think  mr .  weill  even if they don   t make dreamies .        oh  tush     and weill wagged his hand in the air .     don   t be angry with what an old man says .  i don   t mean think as in reason .  i mean think as in dream .  we all can dream after a fashion  just like we all can run .  but can you and i run a mile in four minutes .  you and i can talk  but are we daniel websters .  now when i think of a steak  i think of the word .  maybe i have a quick picture of a brown steak on a platter .  maybe you have a better pictorialization of it and you can see the crisp fat and the onions and the baked potato .  i don   t know .  but a dreamer  .   .   .  he sees it and smells it and tastes it and everything about it  with the charcoal and the satisfied feeling in the stomach and the way the knife cuts through it and a hundred other things all at once .  very sensual .  very sensual .  you and i can   t do it .        well  then     said byrne     no professional dreamer has done this .  that   s something anyway .     he put the cylinder in his inner jacket pocket .     i hope we   ll have your full cooperation in squelching this sort of thing .        positively  mr .  byrne .  with a whole heart .        i hope so .     byrne spoke with a consciousness of power .     it   s not up to me  mr .  weill  to say what will be done and what won   t be done  but this sort of thing     he tapped the cylinder he had brought     will make it awfully tempting to impose a really strict censorship on dreamies .     he rose .     good day  mr .  weill .        good day  mr .  byrne .  i   ll hope always for the best .      francis belanger burst into jesse weill   s office in his usual steaming tizzy  his reddish hair disordered and his face aglow with worry and a mild perspiration .  he was brought up sharply by the sight of weill   s head cradled in the crook of his elbow and bent on the desk until only the glimmer of white hair was visible .  belanger swallowed .     boss .     weill   s head lifted .     it   s you  frank .        what   s the matter  boss .  are you sick .        i   m old enough to be sick  but i   m on my feet .  staggering  but on my feet .  a government man was here .        what did he want .        he threatens censorship .  he brought a sample of what   s going round .  cheap dreamies for bottle parties .        god damn .     said belanger feelingly .     the only trouble is that morality makes for good campaign fodder .  they   ll be hitting out everywhere .  and  to tell the truth  we   re vulnerable  frank .        we are .  our stuff is clean .  we play up straight adventure and romance .     weill thrust out his lower lip and wrinkled his forehead .     between us  frank  we don   t have to make believe .  clean .  it depends on how you look at it .  it   s not for publication  maybe  but you know and i know that every dreamie has its freudian connotations .  you can   t deny it .        sure  if you look for it .  if you   re a psychiatrist        if you   re an ordinary person  too .  the ordinary observer doesn   t know it   s there and maybe he couldn   t tell a phallic symbol from a mother image even if you pointed it out .  still  his subconscious knows .  and it   s the connotations that make many a dreamie click .        all right  what   s the government going to do .  clean up the subconscious .        it   s a problem .  i don   t know what they   re going to do .  what we have on our side  and what i   m mainly depending on  is the fact that the public loves its dreamies and won   t give them up .   .  .  .  meanwhile  what did you come in for .  you want to see me about something  i suppose .     belanger tossed an object onto weill   s desk and shoved his shirttail deeper into his trousers .  weill broke open the glistening plastic cover and took out the enclosed cylinder .  at one end was engraved in a too fancy script in pastel blue    along the himalayan trail .     it bore the mark of luster think .     the competitor   s product .     weill said it with capitals  and his lips twitched .     it hasn   t been published yet .  where did you get it  frank .        never mind .  i just want you to absorb it .     weill sighed .     today  everyone wants me to absorb dreams .  frank  it   s not dirty .     belanger said testily     it has your freudian symbols .  narrow crevasses between the mountain peaks .  i hope that won   t bother you .        i   m an old man .  it stopped bothering me years ago  but that other thing was so poorly done  it hurt .   .  .  .  all right  let   s see what you   ve got here .     again the recorder .  again the unfreezer over his skull and at the temples .  this time  weill rested back in his chair for fifteen minutes or more  while francis belanger went hurriedly through two cigarettes .  when weill removed the headpiece and blinked dream out of his eyes  belanger said     well  what   s your reaction  boss .     weill corrugated his forehead .     it   s not for me .  it was repetitious .  with competition like this  dreams  inc .   doesn   t have to worry for a while .        that   s your mistake  boss .  luster think   s going to win with stuff like this .  we   ve got to do something .        now  frank        no  you listen .  this is the coming thing .        this .     weill stared with a half humorous dubiety at the cylinder .     it   s amateurish  it   s repetitious .  its overtones are very unsubtle .  the snow had a distinct lemon sherbet taste .  who tastes lemon sherbet in snow these days  frank .  in the old days  yes .  twenty years ago  maybe .  when lyman harrison first made his snow symphonies for sale down south  it was a big thing .  sherbet and candy striped mountaintops and sliding down chocolate covered cliffs .  it   s slapstick  frank .  these days it doesn   t go .        because     said belanger     you   re not up with the times  boss .  i   ve got to talk to you straight .  when you started the dreamie business  when you bought up the basic patents and began putting them out  dreamies were luxury stuff .  the market was small and individual .  you could afford to turn out specialized dreamies and sell them to people at high prices .        i know     said weill     and we   ve kept that up .  but also we   ve opened a rental business for the masses .        yes  we have and it   s not enough .  our dreamies have subtlety  yes .  they can be used over and over again .  the tenth time you   re still finding new things  still getting new enjoyment .  but how many people are connoisseurs .  and another thing .  our stuff is strongly individualized .  they   re first person .        well .        well  luster think is opening dream palaces .  they   ve opened one with three hundred booths in nashville .  you walk in  take your seat  put on your unfreezer and get your dream .  everyone in the audience gets the same one .        i   ve heard of it  frank  and it   s been done before .  it didn   t work the first time and it won   t work now .  you want to know why it won   t work .  because  in the first place  dreaming is a private thing .  do you like your neighbor to know what you   re dreaming .  in the second place  in a dream palace  the dreams have to start on schedule  don   t they .  so the dreamer has to dream not when he wants to but when some palace manager says he should .  finally  a dream one person likes another person doesn   t like .  in those three hundred booths  i guarantee you  a hundred fifty people are dissatisfied .  and if they   re dissatisfied  they won   t come back .     slowly  belanger rolled up his sleeves and opened his collar .     boss     he said     you   re talking through your hat .  what   s the use of proving they won   t work .  they are working .  the word came through today that luster think is breaking ground for a thousand booth palace in st .  louis .  people can get used to public dreaming  if everyone else in the same room is having the same dream .  and they can adjust themselves to having it at a given time  as long as it   s cheap and convenient .     damn it  boss  it   s a social affair .  a boy and a girl go to a dream palace and absorb some cheap romantic thing with stereotyped overtones and commonplace situations  but still they come out with stars sprinkling their hair .  they   ve had the same dream together .  they   ve gone through identical sloppy emotions .  they   re in tune  boss .  you bet they go back to the dream palace  and all their friends go  too .        and if they don   t like the dream .        that   s the point .  that   s the nub of the whole thing .  they   re bound to like it .  if you prepare hillary specials with wheels within wheels within wheels  with surprise twists on the third level undertones  with clever shifts of significance and all the other things we   re so proud of  why  naturally  it won   t appeal to everyone .  specialized dreamies are for specialized tastes .  but luster think is turning out simple jobs in third person so both sexes can be hit at once .  like what you   ve just absorbed .  simple  repetitious  commonplace .  they   re aiming at the lowest common denominator .  no one will love it  maybe  but no one will hate it .     weill sat silent for a long time and belanger watched him .  then weill said     frank  i started on quality and i   m staying there .  maybe you   re right .  maybe dream palaces are the coming thing .  if so we   ll open them  but we   ll use good stuff .  maybe luster think underestimates ordinary people .  let   s go slowly and not panic .  i have based all my policies on the theory that there   s always a market for quality .  sometimes  my boy  it would surprise you how big a market .        boss     the sounding of the intercom interrupted belanger .     what is it  ruth .     said weill .  the voice of his secretary said     it   s mr .  hillary  sir .  he wants to see you right away .  he says it   s important .        hillary .     weill   s voice registered shock .  then     wait five minutes  ruth  then send him in .     weill turned to belanger .     today  frank  is definitely not one of my good days .  a dreamer   s place is in his home with his thinker .  and hillary   s our best dreamer so he especially should be at home .  what do you suppose is wrong with him .     belanger  still brooding over luster think and dream palaces  said shortly     call him in and find out .        in one minute .  tell me  how was his last dream .  i haven   t tried the one that came in last week .     belanger came down to earth .  he wrinkled his nose .     not so good .        why not .        it was ragged .  too jumpy .  i don   t mind sharp transitions for the liveliness  you know  but there   s got to be some connection  even if only on a deep level .        is it a total loss .        no hillary dream is a total loss .  it took a lot of editing  though .  we cut it down quite a bit and spliced in some odd pieces he   d sent us now and then .  you know  detached scenes .  it   s still not grade a  but it will pass .        you told him about this  frank .        think i   m crazy  boss .  think i   m going to say a harsh word to a dreamer .     and at that point the door opened and weill   s comely young secretary smiled sherman hillary into the office .   sherman hillary  at the age of thirty one  could have been recognized as a dreamer by anyone .  his eyes  unspectacled  had nevertheless the misty look of one who either needs glasses or who rarely focuses on anything mundane .  he was of average height but underweight  with black hair that needed cutting  a narrow chin  a pale skin and a troubled look .  he muttered     hello  mr .  weill     and half nodded in hangdog fashion in the direction of belanger .  weill said heartily     sherman  my boy  you look fine .  what   s the matter .  a dream is cooking only so so at home .  you   re worried about it .   .  .  .  sit down  sit down .     the dreamer did  sitting at the edge of the chair and holding his thighs stiffly together as though to be ready for instant obedience to a possible order to stand up once more .  he said     i   ve come to tell you  mr .  weill  i   m quitting .        quitting .        i don   t want to dream any more  mr .  weill .     weill   s old face looked older now than at any time in the day .     why  sherman .     the dreamer   s lips twisted .  he blurted out     because i   m not living  mr .  weill .  everything passes me by .  it wasn   t so bad at first .  it was even relaxing .  i   d dream evenings  weekends when i felt like  or any other time .  and when i felt like i wouldn   t .  but now  mr .  weill  i   m an old pro .  you tell me i   m one of the best in the business and the industry looks to me to think up new subtleties and new changes on the old reliables like the flying reveries  and the worm turning skits .     weill said     and is anyone better than you  sherman .  your little sequence on leading an orchestra is selling steadily after ten years .        all right  mr .  weill .  i   ve done my part .  it   s gotten so i don   t go out any more .  i neglect my wife .  my little girl doesn   t know me .  last week  we went to a dinner party  sarah made me and i don   t remember a bit of it .  sarah says i was sitting on the couch all evening just staring at nothing and humming .  she said everyone kept looking at me .  she cried all night .  i   m tired of things like that  mr .  weill .  i want to be a normal person and live in this world .  i promised her i   d quit and i will  so it   s good by  mr .  weill .     hillary stood up and held out his hand awkwardly .  weill waved it gently away .     if you want to quit  sherman  it   s all right .  but do an old man a favor and let me explain something to you .        i   m not going to change my mind     said hillary .     i   m not going to try to make you .  i just want to explain something .  i   m an old man and even before you were born i was in this business so i like to talk about it .  humor me  sherman .  please .     hillary sat down .  his teeth clamped down on his lower lip and he stared sullenly at his fingernails .  weill said     do you know what a dreamer is  sherman .  do you know what he means to ordinary people .  do you know what it is to be like me  like frank belanger  like your wife  sarah .  to have crippled minds that can   t imagine  that can   t build up thoughts .  people like myself  ordinary people  would like to escape just once in a while this life of ours .  we can   t .  we need help .     in olden times it was books  plays  radio  movies  television .  they gave us make believe  but that wasn   t important .  what was important was that for a little while our own imaginations were stimulated .  we could think of handsome lovers and beautiful princesses .  we could be beautiful  witty  strong  capable  everything we weren   t .     but  always  the passing of the dream from dreamer to absorber was not perfect .  it had to be translated into words in one way or another .  the best dreamer in the world might not be able to get any of it into words .  and the best writer in the world could put only the smallest part of his dreams into words .  you understand .     but now  with dream recording  any man can dream .  you  sherman  and a handful of men like you  supply those dreams directly and exactly .  it   s straight from your head into ours  full strength .  you dream for a hundred million people every time you dream .  you dream a hundred million dreams at once .  this is a great thing  my boy .  you give all those people a glimpse of something they could not have by themselves .     hillary mumbled     i   ve done my share .     he rose desperately to his feet .     i   m through .  i don   t care what you say .  and if you want to sue me for breaking our contract  go ahead and sue .  i don   t care .     weill stood up  too .     would i sue you .   .   .   .  ruth     he spoke into the intercom     bring in our copy of mr .  hillary   s contract .     he waited .  so did hillary and so did belanger .  weill smiled faintly and his yellowed fingers drummed softly on his desk .  his secretary brought in the contract .  weill took it  showed its face to hillary and said     sherman  my boy  unless you want to be with me  it   s not right you should stay .     then  before belanger could make more than the beginning of a horrified gesture to stop him  he tore the contract into four pieces and tossed them down the waste chute .     that   s all .     hillary   s hand shot out to seize weill   s .     thanks  mr .  weill     he said earnestly  his voice husky .     you   ve always treated me very well  and i   m grateful .  i   m sorry it had to be like this .        it   s all right  my boy .  it   s all right .     half in tears  still muttering thanks  sherman hillary left .      for the love of pete  boss  why did you let him go .     demanded belanger distractedly .     don   t you see the game .  he   ll be going straight to luster think .  they   ve bought him off .     weill raised his hand .     you   re wrong .  you   re quite wrong .  i know the boy and this would not be his style .  besides     he added dryly     ruth is a good secretary and she knows what to bring me when i ask for a dreamer   s contract .  what i had was a fake .  the real contract is still in the safe  believe me .     meanwhile  a fine day i   ve had .  i had to argue with a father to give me a chance at new talent  with a government man to avoid censorship  with you to keep from adopting fatal policies and now with my best dreamer to keep him from leaving .  the father i probably won out over .  the government man and you  i don   t know .  maybe yes  maybe no .  but about sherman hillary  at least  there is no question .  the dreamer will be back .        how do you know .     weill smiled at belanger and crinkled his cheeks into a network of fine lines .     frank  my boy  you know how to edit dreamies so you think you know all the tools and machines of the trade .  but let me tell you something .  the most important tool in the dreamie business is the dreamer himself .  he is the one you have to understand most of all  and i understand them .     listen .  when i was a youngster  there were no dreamies then  i knew a fellow who wrote television scripts .  he would complain to me bitterly that when someone met him for the first time and found out who he was  they would say  where do you get those crazy ideas .     they honestly didn   t know .  to them it was an impossibility to even think of one of them .  so what could my friend say .  he used to talk to me about it and tell me  could i say  i don   t know .  when i go to bed  i can   t sleep for ideas dancing in my head .  when i shave  i cut myself  when i talk  i lose track of what i   m saying  when i drive  i take my life in my hands .  and always because ideas  situations  dialogues are spinning and twisting in my mind .  i can   t tell you where i get my ideas .  can you tell me  maybe  your trick of not getting ideas  so i  too  can have a little peace .     you see  frank  how it is .  you can stop work here anytime .  so can i .  this is our job  not our life .  but not sherman hillary .  wherever he goes  whatever he does  he   ll dream .  while he lives  he must think  while he thinks  he must dream .  we don   t hold him prisoner  our contract isn   t an iron wall for him .  his own skull is his prisoner  frank .  so he   ll be back .  what can he do .     belanger shrugged .     if what you say is right  i   m sort of sorry for the guy     weill nodded sadly .     i   m sorry for all of them .  through the years  i   ve found out one thing .  it   s their business  making people happy .  other people .
