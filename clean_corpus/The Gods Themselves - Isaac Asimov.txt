the gods themselves    copyright         by isaac asimov .     e book ver .    .        dedication    to mankind    and the hope that the war against folly may someday be won  after all      note  the story starts with section   .  this is not a mistake .  i have my own subtle reasoning .  so just read and  i hope  enjoy .              against stupidity  .   .   .               no good .   said lamont  sharply .   i didn t get anywhere .   he had a brooding look about him that went with his deep set eyes and the slight asymmetry of his long chin .  there was a brooding look about him at the best of times  and this was not the best of times .  his second formal interview with hallam had been a greater fiasco than the first .    don t be dramatic   said myron bronowski  placidly .   you didn t expect to .  you told me that .   he was tossing peanuts into the air and catching them in his plump lipped mouth as they came down .  he never missed .  he was not very tall  not very thin .    that doesn t make it pleasant .  but you re right  it doesn t matter .  there are other things i can do and intend to do and  besides that  i depend on you .  if you could only find out       don t finish  pete .  i ve heard it all before .  all i have to do is decipher the thinking of a non human intelligence .     a better than human intelligence .  those creatures from the para universe are trying to make themselves understood .     that may be   sighed bronowski   but they re trying to do it through my intelligence  which is better than human i sometimes think  but not much .  sometimes  in the dark of the night  i lie awake and wonder if different intelligences can communicate at all  or  if i ve had a particularly bad day  whether the phrase  different intelligences  has meaning at all .     it does   said lamont savagely  his hands clearly balling into fists within his lab coat pockets .   it means hallam and me .  it means that fool hero  dr .  frederick hallam and me .  we re different intelligences because when i talk to him he doesn t understand .  his idiot face gets redder and his eyes bulge and his ears block .  i d say his mind stops functioning  but i lack the proof of any other state from which it might stop .    bronowski murmured   what a way to speak of the father of the electron pump .     that s it .  reputed father of the electron pump .  a bastard birth  if ever there was one .  his contribution was least in substance .  i know .     i know  too .  you ve told me often   and bronowski tossed another peanut into the air .  he didn t miss .              it had happened thirty years before  frederick hallam was a radiochemist  with the print on his doctoral dissertation still wet and with no sign whatever of being a world shaker .   what began the shaking of the world was the fact that a dusty reagent bottle marked  tungsten metal  stood on his desk .  it wasn t his  he had never used it .  it was a legacy from some dim day when some past inhabitant of the office had wanted tungsten for some long forgotten reason .  it wasn t even really tungsten any more .  it consisted of small pellets of what was now heavily layered with oxide    gray and dusty .  no use to anyone .   and one day hallam entered the laboratory  well  it was october          to be exact   got to work  stopped shortly before   a . m .   stared transfixed at the bottle  and lifted it .  it was as dusty as ever  the label as faded  but he called out   god damn it  who the hell has been tampering with this .    that  at least  was the account of denison  who overheard the remark and who told it to lamont a generation later .  the official tale of the discovery  as reported in the books  leaves out the phraseology .  one gets the impression of a keen eyed chemist  aware of change and instantly drawing deep seated deductions .   not so .  hallam had no use for the tungsten  it was of no earthly value to him and any tampering with it could be of no possible importance to him .  however  he hated any interference with his desk  as so many do  and he suspected others of possessing keen desires to engage in such interference out of sheer malice .   no one at the time admitted to knowing anything about the matter .  benjamin allan denison  who overheard the initial remark  had an office immediately across the corridor and both doors were open .  he looked up and met hallam s accusatory eye .   he didn t particularly like hallam  no one particularly did  and he had slept badly the night before .  he was  as it happened and as he later recalled  rather pleased to have someone on whom to vent his spleen  and hallam made the perfect candidate .   when hallam held the bottle up to his face  denison pulled back with clear distaste .   why the devil should i be interested in your tungsten .   he demanded .   why should anyone .  if you ll look at the bottle  you ll see that the thing hasn t been opened for twenty years  and if you hadn t put your own grubby paws on it  you would have seen no one had touched it   hallam flushed a slow  angry red .  he said  tightly   listen  denison  someone has changed the contents .  that s not the tungsten .    denison allowed himself a small  but distinct sniff .   how would you know .    of such things  petty annoyance and aimless thrusts  is history made .   it would have been an unfortunate remark in any case .  denison s scholastic record  as fresh as hallam s  was far more impressive and he was the bright young man of the department .  hallam knew this and  what was worse  denison knew it too  and made no secret of it denison s  how would you know .   with the clear and unmistakable emphasis on the  you   was ample motivation for all that followed .  without it  hallam would never have become the greatest and most revered scientist in history  to use the exact phrase denison later used in his interview with lament .   officially  hallam had come in on that fateful morning  noticed the dusty gray pellets gone   not even the dust on the inside surface remaining   and clear iron gray metal in their place .  naturally  he investigated     but place the official version to  one side .  it was denison .  had he confined himself to a simple negative  or a shrug  the chances are that hallam would have asked others  then eventually weariest of the unexplained event  put the bottle to one side  and let subsequent tragedy  whether subtle or drastic  depending on how long the ultimate discovery was delayed   guide the future .  in any event  it would not have been hallam who rode the whirlwind to the heights .   with the  how would you know .   cutting him down  however  hallam could only retort wildly   i   ll show you that i know .    and after that  nothing could prevent him from going to extremes .  the analysis of the metal in the old container became his number one priority  and his prime goal was to wipe the haughtiness from denison s thin nosed face and the perpetual trace of a sneer from his pale lips .   denison never forgot that moment for it was his own remark that drove hallam to the nobel price and himself to oblivion .   he had no way of knowing  or if he knew he would not then have cared  that there was an overwhelming stubbornness in hallam  the mediocrity s frightened need to safeguard his pride  that would carry the day at that time more than all denison s native brilliance would have .   hallam moved at once and directly .  he carried his metal to the mass spectrography department .  as a radiation chemist it was a natural move .  he knew the technicians there  he had worked with them  and he was forceful .  he was forceful to such an effect  indeed  that the job was placed ahead of projects of much greater pith and moment .   the mass spectrographer said eventually   well  it isn t tungsten .    hallam s broad and humorless face wrinkled into a harsh smile .   all right .  well tell that to bright boy denison .  i want a report and       but wait awhile  dr .  hallam .  i m telling you it s not tungsten  but that doesn t mean i know what it is .     what do you mean you don t know what it is .     i mean the results are ridiculous .   the technician thought a while .   impossible  actually .  the charge mass ratio is all wrong .     all wrong in what way .     too high .  it just can t be .     well  then   said hallam and  regardless of the motive that was driving him  his next remark set him on the road to the nobel prize and  it might even be argued  a deserved one   get the frequency of its characteristic x radiation and figure out the charge .  don t just sit around and talk about something being impossible .    it was a troubled technician who came into hallam s office a few days later .   hallam ignored the trouble on the other s face   he was never sensitive   and said   did you find     he then cast a troubled look of his own at denison  sitting at the desk in his own lab and shut the door .   did you find the nuclear charge .     yes  but it s wrong .     all right  tracy .  do it over .     i did it over a dozen times .  it s wrong .     if you made the measurement  that s it  don t argue with the facts .    tracy rubbed his ear and said   i ve got to  doc .  if i take the measurements seriously  then what you ve given me is plutonium     .     plutonium     . plutonium      .     the charge is     .  the mass is     .     but that s impossible .  there s no such isotope .  there can t be .     that s what i m saying to you .  but those are the measurements .     but a situation like that leaves the nucleus over fifty neutrons short .  you can t have plutonium     .  you couldn t squeeze ninety four protons into one nucleus with only ninety two neutrons and expect it to hang together for even a trillion trillionth of a second .     that s what i m telling you  doc   said tracy  patiently .   and then hallam stopped to think .  it was tungsten he was missing and one of its isotopes  tungsten      was stable .  tungsten     had    protons and     neutrons in its nucleus .  could something have turned twenty neutrons into twenty protons .  surely that was impossible .    are there any signs of radioactivity .   asked hallam  groping somehow for a road out of the maze .    i thought of that   said the technician .   it s stable .  absolutely stable .     then it can t be plutonium     .     i keep telling you  doc .    hallam said  hopelessly   well  give me the stuff .   alone once more  he sat and looked at the bottle in stupefaction .  the most nearly stable isotope of plutonium was plutonium      where     neutrons were needed to make the    protons stick together with some semblance of partial stability .   what could he do now .  it was beyond him and he was .  sorry he had started .  after all  he had real work begging to be done  and this thing   this mystery   had nothing to do with him .  tracy had made some stupid mistake or the mass spectrometer was out of whack  or    well  what of it .  forget the whole thing .  except that hallam couldn t do that .  sooner or later  denison would be bound to stop by and  with that irritating half smile of his  ask after the tungsten .  then what could hallam say .  could he say   it isn t tungsten  just as i told you   surely denison would ask   oh  and what is it  then .   and nothing imaginable could have made hallam expose himself to the kind of derision that would follow any claim that it was plutonium     .  he had to find out what it was  and he had to do it himself .  clearly  he couldn t trust anyone .   so about two weeks later he entered tracy s laboratory in what can fairly be described as a first class fury .    hey  didn t you tell me that stuff was non radioactive .     what stuff .   said tracy automatically  before he remembered .    that stuff you called plutonium       said hallam .    oh .  well it was stable .     about as stable as your mental state .  if you call this non radioactive  you belong in a plumber s shop .    tracy frowned .   okay  doc .  pass it over and let s try .   and then he said   beats me .  it is radioactive .  not much  but it is .  i don t see how i could have missed that .     and how far can i trust your crap about plutonium     .    the matter had hallam by the throat now .  the mystery had become so exasperating as to be a personal affront whoever had switched bottles  or switched contents  must either have switched again or have devised a metal for the specific purpose of making a fool of him .  in either case  he was ready to pull the world apart to solve the matter if he had to   and if he could .   he had his stubbornness  and an intensity that could not easily be brushed aside  and he went straight to g .  c .  kantrowitsch  who was then in the final year of his own rather remarkable career .  kantrowitsch s aid was difficult to enlist but  once enlisted  it quickly caught fire .   two days later  in fact  he was storming into hallam s office in a blaze of excitement .   have you been handling this thing with your hands .     not much   said hallam .    well  don t if you ve got any mere  don t .  it s emitting positrons .     oh .     the most energetic positrons i   ve ever seen .   .   .   .  and your figures on its radioactivity are too low .     too low .     distinctly .  and what bothers me is that every measurement i take is just a trifle higher than the one before .           continued       bronowski came across an apple in the capacious pocket of his jacket and bit into it .   okay  you ve seen hallam and been kicked out as expected .  what next .     i haven t quite decided .  but whatever it is  it s going to dump him on his fat behind .  i saw him once before  you know  years ago  when i first came here  when i thought he was a great man .  a great man    he s the greatest villain in the history of science .  he s rewritten the history of the pump  you know  rewritten it here     lamont tapped his temple .   he believes his own fantasy and fights for it with a diseased fury .  he s a pygmy with only one talent  the ability to convince others he s a giant .    lamont looked up at bronowski s wide and placid face  wreathed now in amusement  and forced a laugh .   oh  well  that doesn t do any good  and i ve told it all to you before anyway .     many times   agreed bronowski .    but it just gravels me to have the whole world                 peter lament had been two years old when hallam had picked up his altered tungsten for the first time .  when he was twenty five  he joined pump station one with the print on his own doctoral dissertation still fresh and accepted a simultaneous appointment on the physics faculty of the university .   it was a remarkably satisfactory achievement for the young man .  pump station one was lacking in the glisten of the later stations but it was the granddaddy of them all  of the entire chain that girdled the planet now even though the entire technology was only a couple of decades old .  no major technological advance had ever caught hold so rapidly and so entirely and why not .  it meant free energy without limit and without problems .  it was the santa claus and the aladdin s lamp of the whole world .   lament had taken the job in order to deal with problems of the highest theoretical abstraction and yet he found himself interested in the amazing story of the development of the electron pump .  it had never been written up in its entirety by someone who truly understood the theoretical principles  in so far as they could be understood  and who had some ability in translating the complexities for the general public .  to be sure  hallam himself had written a number of articles for the popular media  but these did not represent a connected  reasoned history    something lament yearned to supply .   he used hallam s articles to begin with  other reminiscences in published form    the official documents so to speak   carrying them through to hallam s world shaking remark  the great insight  as it was often called  invariably with capital letters  .   afterward  of course  when lament had experienced his disillusionment  he began digging deeper  and the question arose in his mind as to whether hallam s great remark had really been hallam s .  it had been advanced at the seminar which marked the true beginning of the electron pump and yet  as it turned out  it was extraordinarily difficult to get the details of that seminar and quite impossible to get the voice recordings .   eventually  lamont began to suspect that the dimness of the footprints left on the sands of time by that seminar was not entirely accidental .  putting several items ingeniously together  it began to seem that there was a reasonable chance that john f .  x .  mcfarland had said something very nearly like the crucial statement hallam had made   and had done so before hallam .   he went to see mcfarland  who was featured not at all in the official accounts  and who was now doing upper atmosphere research  with particular reference to the solar wind .  it was not a top echelon job  but it had its perquisites  and it had more than a little to do with pump effects .  mcfarland had clearly avoided suffering the fate of oblivion that had overtaken denison .   he was polite enough to lament and willing to .  talk on any subject except the events of that seminar .  that he simply didn t remember .   lamont insisted  quoted the evidence he had gathered .   mcfarland took out a pipe  filled it  inspected its contents thoroughly  and said  with a queer intentness .   i don t choose to remember  because it doesn t matter  it really doesn t .  suppose i laid claim to having said something .  no one would believe it .  i would look like an idiot and a megalomaniac one .     and hallam would see to it that you were retired .     i m not saying that  but i don t see that it would do me any good .  what s the difference  anyway .     a matter of historical truth .   said lamont   oh  bull .  the historical truth is that hallam never let go .  he drove everyone into investigating  whether they wanted to or not .  without him  that tungsten would eventually have exploded with i don t know how many casualties .  there might never have been another sample  and we might never have had the pump .  hallam deserves the credit for it  even if he doesn t deserve the credit  and if that doesn t make sense  i can t help it  because history doesn t make sense .    lament wasn t satisfied with that  but he had to make it do  for mcfarland would simply say no more .   historical truth .   one piece of historical truth that seemed beyond question was that it was the radioactivity that pulled  hallam s tungsten   this is what it was called as a matter of historical custom  into the big time .  it didn t matter whether it was or was not tungsten  whether it had or had not been tampered with  even whether it was or was not an impossible isotope .  everything was swallowed up in the amazement of something  anything  which showed a constantly increasing intensity of radioactivity under circumstances that ruled out the existence of any type of radioactive breakdown  in any number of steps  then known .   after a while  kantrowitsch muttered   we d better spread it out .  if we keep it in sizable lumps it will vaporize or explode or both and contaminate half the city .    so it was powdered and scattered  and mixed with ordinary tungsten at first and then  when the tungsten grew radioactive in its turn  it was mixed with graphite  which had a lower cross section to the radiation .   less than two months after hallam had noticed the change in the bottle s contents  kantrowitsch  in a communication to the editor of nuclear reviews  with hallam s name appended as co author  announced the existence of plutonium     .  tracy s original determination was thus vindicated but his name was not mentioned  either then or later .  with that hallam s tungsten began to take on an epic scale and denison began to note the changes that ended by making him a non person .   the existence of plutonium     was bad enough .  to have been stable at the start and to display a curiously increasing radioactivity was much worse .   a seminar to handle the problem was organized .  kantrowitsch was in the chair  which was an interesting historical note  for it was the last time in the history of the electron pump that a major meeting was held in connection with it that was chaired by anyone but hallam .  as a matter of fact  kantrowitsch died five months later and the only personality with sufficient prestige to keep hallam in the shade was removed .   the meeting was extraordinarily fruitless until hallam announced his great insight  but in the version as reconstructed by lamont  the real turning point came during the luncheon break .  at that time  mcfarland  who is not credited with any remarks in the official records  although he was listed as an attendee  said  you know  what we need is a little bit of fantasy here .  suppose      he was speaking to diderick van klemens  and van klemens reported it sketchily in a kind of personal shorthand in his own notes .  long before lamont had succeeded in tracking that down  van klemens was dead  and though his notes convinced lamont himself  he had to admit they would not make a convincing story without further corroboration .  what s more  there was no way of proving that hallam had overheard the remark .  lamont would have been willing to bet a fortune that hallam was within earshot  but that willingness was not satisfactory proof either .   and then  suppose lamont could prove it .  it might hurt hallam s egregious pride  but it couldn t really shake his position .  it would be argued that to mcfarland  the remark was only fantasy .  it was hallam who accepted it as something more .  it was hallam who was willing to stand up in front of the group and say it officially and risk the derision that might be his .  mcfarland would surely never have dreamed of placing himself on official record with his  little bit of fantasy .    lamont might have counter argued that mcfarland was a well known nuclear physicist with a reputation to lose  while hallam was a young radiochemist who could say anything he pleased in nuclear physics and  as an outsider  get away with it .   in any case  this is what hallam said  according to the official transcript    gentlemen  we are getting nowhere .  i am therefore going to make a suggestion  not because it necessarily makes sense  but because it represents less nonsense than anything else i ve heard .   .   .   .  we are faced with a substance  plutonium      that cannot exist at all  let alone as an even momentarily stable substance  if the natural laws of the universe have any validity at all .  it follows  then  that since it does indubitably exist and did exist as a stable substance to begin with  it must have existed  at least to begin with  in a place or at a time or under circumstances where the natural laws of the universe were other than they are .  to put it bluntly  the substance we are studying did not originate in our universe at all  but in another   an alternate universe   a parallel universe .  call it what you want .    once here   and i don t pretend to know how it got across   it was stable still and i suggest that this was because it carried the laws of its own universe with it .  the fact that it slowly became radioactive and .  then ever more radioactive may mean that the laws of our own universe slowly soaked into its substance  if you know what i mean .    i point out that at the same time that the plutonium     appeared  a sample of tungsten  made up of several stable isotopes  including tungsten      disappeared .  it may have slipped over into the parallel universe .  after all  it is logical to suppose that it is simpler for an exchange of mass to take place than for a one way transfer to do so .  in the parallel universe  tungsten     may be as anomalous as plutonium     is here .  it may begin as a stable substance and slowly become increasingly radioactive .  it may serve as an energy source there just as plutonium     would here .    the audience must have been listening with considerable astonishment for there is no record of interruption  at least until the sentence last recorded above  at which time hallam seemed to have paused to catch his breath and perhaps to wonder at his own temerity .   someone from the audience  presumably antoine jerome lapin  though the record is not clear  asked if professor hallam were suggesting that an intelligent agent in the para universe had deliberately made the exchange in order to obtain an energy source .  the expression  para universe   inspired apparently as an abbreviation of  parallel universe   thus entered the language .  this question contained the first recorded use of the expression .   there was a pause and then hallam  more daring than ever  said   and this was the nub of the great insight     yes  i think so  and i think that the energy source cannot be made practical unless universe and para universe work together  each at one half of a pump  pushing energy from them to us and from us to them  taking advantage of the difference in the natural laws of the two universes .    hallam had adopted the word  para universe  and made it his own at this point .  furthermore  he became the first to use the word  pump   since invariably capitalized  in connection with the matter .   there is a tendency in the official account to give the impression that hallam s suggestion caught fire at once  but it did not .  those who were willing to discuss it at all would commit themselves no farther than to say it was an amusing speculation .  kantrowitsch  in particular  did not say a word .  this was crucial to hallam s career .   hallam could scarcely carry through the theoretical and practical implications of his own suggestion all by himself  a team was required and it was built up .  but none of the team  until it was too late  would associate himself openly with the suggestion .  by the time success was unmistakable  the public had grown to think of it as hallam s and hallam s alone .  it was hallam  to all the world  and hallam alone  who had first discovered the substance  who had conceived and transmitted the great insight  and it was therefore hallam who was the father of the electron pump .   thus  in various laboratories  pellets of tungsten metal were laid out temptingly .  in one out of ten the transfer was made and new supplies of plutonium     were produced .  other elements were offered as bait and refused .   .   .   .  but wherever the plutonium     appeared and whoever it was that brought the supply to the central research organization working on the problem  to the public it was an additional quantity of  hallam s tungsten .    it was hallam again who presented some aspects of the theory to the public most successfully .  to his own surprise  as he later said  he found himself to be a facile writer  and he enjoyed popularizing .  besides success has its own inertia  and the public would accept information on the project from no one but hallam .   in a since famous article in the north american sunday tele times weekly  he wrote   we cannot say in how many different ways the laws of the para universe differ from our own  but we can guess with some assurance that the strong nuclear interaction  which is the strongest known force in our universe  is even stronger in the para universe  perhaps a hundred times stronger .  this means that protons are more easily held together against their own electrostatic attraction and that a nucleus requires fewer neutrons to produce stability .    plutonium      stable in their universe  contains far too many protons  or too few neutrons  to be stable in ours with its less effective nuclear interaction .  the plutonium      once in our universe  begins to radiate positrons  releasing energy as it does so  and with each positron emitted  a proton within a nucleus is converted to a neutron .  eventually  twenty protons per nucleus have been converted to neutrons and plutonium     has become tungsten      which is stable by the laws of our own universe .  in the process  twenty positrons per nucleus have been eliminated .  these meet  combine with  and annihilate twenty electrons  releasing further energy  so that for every plutonium     nucleus sent to us  our universe ends up with twenty fewer electrons .    meanwhile  the tungsten     that enters the para universe is unstable there for the opposite reason .  by the laws of the para universe it has too many neutrons  or too few protons .  the tungsten     nuclei begin to emit electrons  releasing energy steadily while doing so  and with each emitted electron a neutron changes to a proton until  in the end  it is plutonium     again .  with each tungsten     nucleus sent into the para universe  twenty more electrons are added to it .    the plutonium tungsten can make its cycle endlessly back and forth between universe and para universe  yielding energy first in one and then in another  with the net effect being a transfer of twenty electrons from our universe to their per each nucleus cycled .  both sides can gain energy from what is  in effect  an inter universe electron pump .    the conversion of this notion into reality and the actual establishment of the electron pump as an effective energy source proceeded with amazing speed  and every stage of its success enhanced hallam s prestige .              lament had no reason to doubt the basis of that prestige and it was with a certain hero worshipfulness  the memory of which embarrassed him later and which he strove   with some success   to eliminate from his mind  that he first applied for a chance to interview hallam at some length in connection with the history he was planning .   hallam seemed amenable .  in thirty years  his position in public esteem had become so lofty one might wonder why his nose did not bleed .  physically  he had aged impressively  if not gracefully .  there was a ponderousness to his body that gave him the appearance of circumstantial weightiness and if his face were gross in its features he seemed able to give them the air of a kind of intellectual repose .  he still reddened quickly and the easily bruised nature of his self esteem was a byword .   hallam had undergone some quick briefing before lamont s entrance .  he said   you are dr .  peter lamont and you ve done good work  i m told  on para theory .  i recall your paper .  on para fusion  wasn t it .     yes  sir .     well  refresh my memory .  tell me about it .  informally  of course  as though you were talking to a layman .  after all   and he chuckled here   in a way  i am a layman .  i m just a radiochemist  you know  and no great theoretician  unless you want to count a few concepts now and then .    lament accepted this  at the time  as a straightforward statement  and  indeed  the speech may not have been as obscenely condescending as he later insisted on remembering it to have been .  it was typical  though  as lament later found out  or at least maintained  of hallam s method of grasping the essentials of the work done by others .  he could talk briskly about the subject thereafter without being overparticular  or particular at all  in assigning credit .   but the younger lament of the time was rather flattered  and he began at once with that voluble eagerness one experiences in explaining one s own discoveries .   i can t say i did much  dr .  hallam .  deducing the laws of nature of the para universe   the para laws   is a tricky business .  we have so little to go on .  i started from what little we know and assumed no new departures that we had no evidence for .  with a stronger nuclear interaction  it seems obvious that the fusion of small nuclei would take place more readily .     para fusion   said hallam .    yes  sir .  the trick was simply to work out what the details might be .  the mathematics involved was somewhat subtle but once a few transformations were made  the difficulties tended to melt away .  it turns out  for instance  that lithium hydride can be made to undergo catastrophic fusion at temperatures four orders of magnitude lower there than here .  it takes fission bomb temperatures to explode lithium hydride here  but a mere dynamite charge  so to speak  would turn the trick in the para universe .  just possibly lithium hydride in the para universe could be ignited with a match  but that s not very likely .  we ve offered them lithium hydride  you know  since fusion power might be natural for them  but they won t touch it    yes  i know that .     it would clearly be too risky for them  like using nitroglycerine in ton lots in rocket engines   only worse .     very good .  and you are also writing a history of the pump .     an informal one  sir .  when the manuscript is ready i will ask you to read it  if i may  so that i might have the benefit of your intimate knowledge of events .  in fact  i would like to take advantage of some of that knowledge right now if you have a little time .     i can make some .  what is it you want to know .   hal lam was smiling .  it was the last time he ever smiled in lament s presence .    the development of an effective and practical pump  professor hallam  took place with extraordinary speed   began lamont  once the pump project       the inter universe electron pump project   corrected hallam  still smiling .    yes  of course   said lamont  clearing his throat .   i was merely using the popular name .  once the project started  the engineering details were developed with great rapidity and with little waste motion .     that is true   said hallam  with a touch of complacence .   people have tried to tell me that the credit was mine for vigorous and imaginative direction  but i wouldn t care to have you overstress that in your book .  the fact is that we had an enormous fund of talent in the project  and i wouldn t want the brilliance of individual members to be dimmed by any exaggeration of my role .    lamont shook his head with a little annoyance .  he found the remark irrelevant .  he said   i don t mean that at all .  i mean the intelligence at the other end   the para men  to use the popular phrase .  they started it .  we discovered them after the first transfer of plutonium for tungsten  but they discovered us first in order to make the transfer  working on pure theory without the benefit of the hint they  .  gave us .  and there s the iron foil they sent across      hallam s smile had now disappeared  and permanently .  he was frowning and he said loudly   the symbols were never understood .  nothing about them       the geometric figures were understood  sir .  i ve looked into it and it s quite clear that they were directing the geometry of the pump .  it seems to me that      hallam s chair shoved back with an angry scrape .  he said   let s not have any of that  young man .  we did the work  not they .     yes   but isn t it true that they       that they what .    lamont became aware now of the storm of emotion he had raised  but he couldn t understand its cause .  uncertainly  he said   that they are more intelligent than we    that they did the real work .  is there any doubt of that  sir .    hallam  red faced  had heaved himself to his feet  there is every doubt   he shouted .   .  will not have mysticism here .  there is too much of that .  see here  young man   he advanced on the still seated and thoroughly astonished lamont and shook a thick finger at him   if your history is going to take the attitude that we were puppets in the hands of the para men  it will not be published from this institution  or at all  if i have my way .  i will not have mankind and its intelligence downgraded and i won t have para men cast in the role of gods .    lamont could only leave  a puzzled man  utterly upset at having created harsh feeling where he had wanted only to have good will .   and then he found that his historical sources were suddenly drying up .  those who had been loquacious enough a week earlier now remembered nothing and had no time for further interviews .   lamont was irritated at first and then a slow anger began to build within him .  he looked at what he had from a new viewpoint  and now he began to squeeze and insist where earlier he had merely asked .  when he met hallam at department functions  hallam frowned and looked through him and lamont began to look scornful in his turn .   the net result was that lamont found his prime career as para theoretician beginning to abort and turned more firmly than ever toward his secondary career as science historian .          continued        that damned fool   muttered lament  reminiscently .   you had to be there  mike  to see him go into panic at any suggestion that it was the other side that was the moving force .  i look back on it and i wonder   how was it possible to meet him  however casually  and not know he would react that way .  just be grateful you never had to work with him .     i am   said bronowski  indifferently   though there are times you re no angel .     don t complain .  with your sort of work you have no problems .     also no interest .  who cares about my sort of work except myself and five others in the world .  maybe six others    if you remember .    lamont remembered .   oh  well   he said .              bronowski s placid exterior never fooled anyone who grew to know him even moderately well .  he was sharp and he worried a problem till he had the solution or till he had it in such tatters that he knew no solution was possible .   consider the etruscan inscriptions on which he had built his reputation .  the language had been a living one till the first century a . d .   but the cultural imperialism of the romans had left nothing behind and it had vanished almost completely .  what inscriptions survived the carnage of roman hostility and   worse   indifference were written in greek letters so that they could be pronounced  but nothing more .  etruscan seemed to have no relationship to any of the surrounding languages  it seemed very archaic  it seemed not even to be indo european .   bronowski therefore passed on to another language that seemed to have no relationship to any of the surrounding languages  that seemed very archaic  that seemed not even to be indo european   but which was very much alive and which was spoken in a region not so very far from where once the etruscans had lived .   what of the basque language .  bronowski wondered .  and he used basque as his guide .  others had tried this before him and given up .  bronowski did not .   it was hard work  for basque  an extraordinarily difficult language in itself  was only the loosest of helps .  bronowski found more and more reason  as he went on  to suspect some cultural connection between the inhabitants of early northern italy and early northern spain .  he could even make out a strong case for a broad swatch of pre celts filling western europe with a language of which etruscan and basque were dimly related survivors .  in two thousand years  however  basque had evolved and had become more than a little contaminated with spanish .  to try  first  to reason out its structure in roman times and then relate it to etruscan was an intellectual feat of surpassing difficulty and bronowski utterly astonished the world s philologists when he triumphed .   the etruscan translations themselves were marvels of dullness and had no significance whatever  routine funerary inscriptions for the most part .  the fact of the translation  however  was stunning and  as it turned out  it proved of the greatest importance to lamont .      not at first .  to be perfectly truthful about it  the translations had been a fact for nearly five years before lamont had as much as heard that there were such people  once  as the etruscans .  but then bronowski came to the university to give one of the annual fellowship lectures and lament  who usually shirked the duty of attending which fell on the faculty members  did not shirk this one .   it was not because he recognized its importance or felt any interest in it whatever .  it was because he was dating a graduate student in the department of romance languages and it was either that or a music festival he particularly wanted to avoid hearing .  the social connection was a feeble one  scarcely satisfactory from lament s point of view and only temporary  but it did get him to the talk .   he rather enjoyed it  as it happened .  the dim etruscan civilization entered his consciousness for the first time as a matter of distant interest  and the problem of solving an undeciphered language struck him as fascinating .  when young  he had enjoyed solving cryptograms  but had put them away with other childish things in favor of the much grander cryptograms posed by nature  so that he ended in para theory .   yet bronowski s talk took him back to the youthful joys of making slow sense of what seemed a random collection of symbols  and combined it with sufficient difficulty to add great honor to the task .  bronowski was a cryptogram mist on the grandest scale  and it was the description of the steady encroachment of reason upon the unknown that lament enjoyed .   all would yet have gone for nothing   the triple coincidence of bronowski s appearance at campus  lament s youthful cryptogrammic enthusiasm  the social pressure of an attractive young lady   were it not for the fact that it was the next day that lamont saw hallam and placed himself firmly and  as he eventually found  permanently  in the doghouse .   within an hour of the conclusion of that interview  lamont determined to see bronowski .  the issue at hand was the very one that had seemed so obvious to himself and that had so offended hallam .  because it brought down censure on him  lamont felt bound to strike back   and in connection with the point of censure specifically .  the para men were more intelligent than man .  lamont had believed it before in a casual sort of way as something more obvious than vital .  now it had become vital .  it must be proved and the fact of it forced down the throat of hal lam  sideways  if possible  and with all the sharp corners exposed .   already lamont found himself so far removed from his so recent hero worship that he relished the prospect .   bronowski was still on campus and lamont tracked him down and insisted on seeing him .   bronowski was blandly courteous  when finally cornered .   lamont acknowledged the courtesies brusquely  introduced himself with clear impatience  and said   dr .  bronowski  i m delighted to have caught you before you left i hope that i will persuade you to stay here even longer .    bronowski said   that may not be hard .  i have been offered a position on the university faculty .     and you will accept the position .     i am considering it .  i think i may .     you must .  you will  when you hear what i have to say .  dr .  bronowski  what is there for you to do now that you ve solved the etruscan inscriptions .     that is not my only task  young man .    he was five years older than lamont .    i m an archaeologist  and there is more to etruscan culture than its inscriptions and more to pre classical italic culture than the etruscans .     but surely nothing as exciting for you  and as challenging  as the etruscan inscriptions .     i grant you that .     so you would welcome something even more exciting  even more challenging  and something a trillion times as significant as those inscriptions .     what have you in mind  dr .    lamont .     we have inscriptions that are not part of a dead culture  or part of anything on earth  or part of anything in the universe .  we have something called para symbols .     i ve heard of them .  for that matter  i ve seen them .     surely  then  you have the urge to tackle the problem  dr .  bronowski .  you have had the desire to work out what they say .     no desire at all  dr .  lament  because there s no problem .    lament stared at him suspiciously   you mean you can read them .    bronowski shook his head .   you mistake me .  i mean i can t possibly read them  nor can anyone else .  there s no base .  in the case of earthly languages  however dead  there is always the chance of finding a living language  or a dead language already deciphered  that bears some relationship to it  however faint .  failing that  there is at least the fact that any earthly language was written by human beings with human ways of thought .  that makes a starting point  however feeble .  none of this is the case with the para symbols  so that they constitute a problem that clearly has no solution .  an insolubility is not a problem .    lamont had kept himself from interrupting only with difficulty  and now he burst out   you are wrong  dr .  bronowski .  i don t want to seem to be teaching you your profession but you don t know some of the facts that my own profession has uncovered .  we are dealing with para men  concerning whom we know almost nothing .  we don t know what they are like  how they think  what kind of world they live on  almost nothing  however basic and fundamental .  so far  you are right .     but it s only almost nothing that you know  is that it .   bronowski did not seem impressed .  he took out a package of dried figs from his pocket opened them and began to eat .  he offered it to lamont  who shook his head .   lamont said   right .  we do know one thing of crucial importance .  they are more intelligent than we are .  item one  they can make the exchange across the inter universe gap  while we can play only a passive role .    he interrupted himself here to ask   do you know anything about the inter universe electron pump .     a little   said bronowski .   enough to follow you  doctor  if you don t get technical .    lamont hastened on .   item two  they sent us instructions as to how to set up our part of the pump .  we couldn t understand it but we could make out the diagrams just sufficiently well to give us the necessary hints .  item three  they can somehow sense us .  at least they can become aware of our leaving tungsten for them to pick up  for instance .  they know where it is and can act upon it we can do nothing comparable .  there are other points but this is enough to show the para men to be clearly more intelligent than we are .    bronowski said   i imagine  though  that you are in the minority here .  surely your colleagues don t accept this .     they don t .  but what makes you come to that conclusion .     because you re clearly wrong  it seems to me .     my facts are correct and since they are  how can i be wrong .     you are merely proving the technology of the para men is more advanced than ours .  what has that to do with intelligence .  see here    bronowski rose to take off his jacket and then sat down in a half reclining position  the soft rotundity of his body seeming to relax and crease in great comfort as though physical ease helped him think     about two and a half centuries ago  the american naval commander matthew perry led a flotilla into tokyo harbor .  the japanese  till then isolated  found themselves faced with a technology considerably beyond their own and decided it was unwise to risk resistance .  an entire warlike nation of millions was helpless in the face of a few ships from across the sea .  did that prove that americans were more intelligent than the japanese were  or merely that western culture had taken a different turning .  clearly the latter  for within half a century  the japanese had successfully imitated western technology and within another half a century were a major industrial power despite the fact that they were disastrously beaten in one of the wars of the time .    lamont listened gravely  and said   we thought that  too  dr .  bronowski  though i didn t know about the japanese   i wish i had the time to read history .  yet the analogy is .  wrong .  it s more than technical superiority  it s a matter of difference in degree of intelligence .     how can you tell  aside from guessing .     because of the mere fact that they sent us directions .  they were eager for us to set up our part of the pump  they had to have us do it .  they could not physically cross over  even their thin foils of iron on which their messages were incised  the substance most nearly stable in either world  slowly grew too radioactive to keep in one piece  though  of course  not before we had made permanent copies on our own materials .   he paused for breath  feeling himself to be too excited  too eager .  he mustn t oversell his case .   bronowski regarded him curiously .   all right  they sent us messages .  what are you trying to deduce from that .     that they expected us to understand .  could they be such fools as to send us rather intricate messages  in some cases quite lengthy  if they knew we would not understand .   .  .  .  if it hadn t been for their diagrams  we would have ended nowhere .  now if they had expected us to understand  it could only be because they felt that any creatures like ourselves with a technology roughly as advanced as their own  and they must have been able to estimate that somehow   another point in favor of my belief  must also be roughly as intelligent as themselves and would experience little difficulty in working out something from the symbols .     that might also be just their na  vet     said bronowski  unimpressed .    you mean they think there is only one language  spoken and written  and that another intelligence in another universe speaks and writes as they do .  come on .    bronowski said   even if i were to grant your point  what do you want me to do .  i ve looked at the para symbols  i suppose every archaeologist and philologist on earth has .  i don t see what i can do  neither  i m sure  does anyone else .  in over twenty years  no progress has been made .    lament said  intensely   what s true is that in twenty years  there has been no desire for progress .  the pump authority does not want to solve the symbols .     why shouldn t they want to .     because of the annoying possibility that communication with the para men will show them to be distinctly more intelligent .  because that would show human beings to be the puppet partners in connection with the pump to the hurt of their ego .  and  specifically    and lament strove to keep venom out of his voice   because hallam would lose the credit for being the father of the electron pump .     suppose they did want to make progress .  what could be done .  the will is not the deed  you know .     they could get the para men to cooperate .  they could send messages to the para universe .  this has never been done  but it could be .  a message on metal foil might be placed under a pellet of tungsten .     oh .  are they still looking for new samples of tungsten  even with pumps in operation .     no  but they ll notice the tungsten and they ll assume we re trying to use it to attract their attention .  we might even place the message on tungsten foil itself .  if they take the message and make any sense of it at all  even the slightest  they ll send back one of their own  incorporating their findings .  they might set up an equivalence table  of their words and ours  or they might use a mixture of their words and ours .  it will be a kind of alternate push  first on their side  then on ours  then on theirs  and so on .     with their side   said bronowski   doing most of the work .     yes .    bronowski shook his head .   no fun in that  is there .  it doesn t appeal to me .    lament looked at him with flaring anger .   why not .  don t you think there ll be enough credit in it for you .  not enough fame .  what are you  a connoisseur of fame .  what kind of fame did you get out of the etruscan inscriptions  damn it .  you beat out five others in the world .  maybe six .  with them you re a household word and a success and they hate you .  what else .  you go about lecturing on the subject before audiences amounting to a few dozen and they forget your name the day after .  is that what you re really after .     don t be dramatic .     all right .  i won t be .  i ll get someone else .  it may take longer but  as you say  the para men will do most of the work anyway .  if necessary  i ll do it myself .     have you been assigned this project .     no  i haven t .  what of it .  or is that another reason you don t want to get involved .  disciplinary problems .  there is no law against attempting translation and i can always place tungsten on my desk .  i will not choose to report any messages i get in place of the tungsten and to that extent i will be breaking the research code .  once the translation is made  who will complain .  would you work with me if i guaranteed your safety and kept your part in it secret .  you would lose your fame but you may value your security more .  oh  well   lament shrugged   if i do it myself  there s the advantage of not having to worry about someone else s security .    he rose to go .  both men were angry and bore themselves with that stiff legged courtesy one assumes when addressing someone who is hostile  but still mannerly .   i presume   said lament   you will at least treat this conversation as confidential .    bronowski was on his feet  too .   of that you may be assured   he said coldly  and the two shook hands briefly .   lamont did not expect to hear from bronowski again .  he then began the process of talking himself into believing it would be better to handle the translation effort on his own .    two days later  however  bronowski was at lament s laboratory .  he said  rather brusquely   i m leaving the city now  but i ll be back in september .  i m taking the position here and  if you re still interested  i ll see what i can do about the translation problem you mentioned .    lamont had barely time for a surprised expression of thanks when bronowski stalked off  apparently angrier at having given in  than at having resisted .   they became friends in time  and  in time  lamont learned what had brought bronowski around .  the day after their discussion  bronowski had had lunch at the faculty club with a group of the higher officials of the university  including  of course  the president .  bronowski had announced that he would accept the position and sending a formal letter to that effect in due time and all had expressed gratification .   the president had said   it will be quite a feather in our cap to have the renowned translator of the itascan inscriptions at the university .  we are honored .    the malapropism had gone uncorrected  of course  and bronowski s smile  though strained  did not actually waver .  afterward  the head of the department of ancient history explained the president to be more of a minnesotan than a classical scholar and since lake itasca was the point of origin of the mighty mississippi  the slip of the tongue was a natural one .   but  in combination with lament s sneer at the extent of his fame  bronowski found the expression rankling .   when lamont finally heard the story  he was amused .   don t go on   he said .   i ve been down that road  too .  you said to yourself   by god  i ll do something even that knot head will have to get straight .      a little like that   said bronowski .              a year s work  however  had netted them very little .  messages had finally come across  messages had come back .  nothing .    just guess .   lamont had said feverishly to bronowski .   any wild guess at all .  try it out on them .     it s exactly what i m doing  pete .  what are you so jumpy about .  i spent twelve years on the etruscan inscriptions .  do you expect this job to take less time .     good god  mike .  we can t take twelve years .     why not .  look  pete  it hasn t escaped me that there s been a change in your attitude .  you ve been impossible this last month or so .  i thought we had it clear at the start that this work can t go quickly  and that we ve got to be patient .  i thought you understood that i had my regular duties at the university  too .  look  i ve been asking you this several times  now .  let me ask again .  why are you in such a hurry now .     because i m in a hurry   said lament abruptly .   because i want to get on with it .     congratulations   said bronowski  dryly   so do l listen  you re not expecting an early death  are you .  your doctor hasn t told you you re hiding a fatal cancer .     no  no   groaned lamont .    well  then .     never mind   said lamont  and he walked away hurriedly .   when he had first tried to get bronowski to join forces with him  lament s grievance had concerned only hallam s mean minded obstinacy concerning the suggestion that the para men were the more intelligent .  it was in that respect and that respect only that lamont was striving for a breakthrough .  he intended nothing beyond that   at first .   but in the course of the following months  he had been subjected to endless exasperation .  his requests for equipment  for technical assistance  for computer time were delayed  his request for travel funds snubbed  his views at interdepartmental meetings invariably overlooked .   the breaking point came when henry garrison  junior to himself in point of service and definitely so in point of ability  received an advisory appointment  rich in prestige  that  by all rights  should have gone to lamont .  it was then that lament s resentment built up to the point where merely proving himself right was no longer sufficient .  he yearned to smash hallam  destroy him utterly .   the feeling was reinforced every day  almost every hour  by the unmistakable attitude of everyone else at the pump station .  lamont s abrasive personality didn t collect sympathy  but some existed nevertheless .   garrison himself was embarrassed .  he was a quiet spoken  amiable young man who clearly wanted no trouble and who now stood in the doorway of lamont s lab with an expression that had more than a small component of apprehension in it .   he said   hey  pete  can i have a few words with you .     as many as you like   said lament  frowning and avoiding a direct eye to eye glance .   garrison came in and sat down .   pete   he said   i can t turn down the appointment but i want you to know i didn t push for it .  it came as a surprise .     who s asking you to turn it down .  i don t give a damn .     pete .  it s hallam .  if i turned it down  it would go to someone else  not you .  what have you done to the old man .    lamont rounded on the other .   what do you think of hallam .  what kind of man is he  in your opinion .    garrison was caught by surprise .  he pursed his lips and rubbed his nose .   well     he said  and let the sound fade off .    great man .  brilliant scientist .  inspiring leader .     well       let me tell you .  the man s a phony .  he s a fraud .  he s got this reputation and this position of his and he s sitting on it in a panic .  he knows that i see through him and that s what he has against me .    garrison gave out a small  uneasy laugh   you haven t gone up to him and said       no  i haven t said anything directly to him   said lamont  morosely .   some day i will .  but he can tell .  he knows i m one person he isn t fooling even if i don t say anything .     but  pete  where s the point in letting him blow it .  i don t say i think he s the world s greatest  either  but where s the sense in broadcasting it .  butter him up a little .  he s got your career in his hands .     has he .  i ve got his reputation in mine .  i m going to show him up .  i m going to strip him .     how .     my business .   muttered lamont  who at the moment had not the slightest idea as to how .    but that s ridiculous   said garrison .   you can t win .  hell just destroy you .  even if he isn t an einstein or an oppenheimer really  he s more than either to the world in general .  he is the father of the electron pump to earth s two billion population and nothing you can possibly do will affect them as long as the electron pump is the key to human paradise .  while that s true  hallam can t be touched and you re crazy if you think he can .  what the hell  pete  tell him he s great and eat crow .  don t be another denison .     i tell you what  henry   said lament  in sudden fury .   why not mind your own business .    garrison rose suddenly and left without a word .  lamont had made another enemy  or  at least  lost another friend .  the price  however  was right  he finally decided  for one remark of garrison had set the ball rolling in another direction .   garrison had said  in essence    .  .  .  as long as the electron pump is the key to human paradise  .   .   .  hallam can t be touched .    with that clanging in his mind  lamont for the first time turned his attention away from hallam and placed it on the electron pump .   was the electron pump the key to human paradise .  or was there  by heaven  a catch .   everything in history had had a catch .  what was the catch to the electron pump .   lamont knew enough of the history of para theory to know that the matter of  a catch  had not gone unexplored .  when it was first announced that the basic over all change in the electron pump was the pumping of electrons from the universe to the para universe  there had not been wanting those who said immediately   but what will happen when all the electrons have been pumped .    this was easily answered .  at the largest reasonable rate of pumping  the electron supply would last for at least a trillion trillion years   and the entire universe  together  presumably  with the para universe  wouldn t last a tiny fraction of that time .   the next objection was more sophisticated .  there was no possibility of pumping all the electrons across .  as the electrons were pumped  the para universe would gain a net negative charge  and the universe a net positive charge .  with each year  as this difference in charge grew  it would become more difficult to pump further electrons against the force of the opposed charge difference .  it was  of course neutral atoms that were actually pumped but the distortion of the orbital electrons in the process created an effective charge which increased immensely with the radioactive changes that followed .   if the charge concentration remained at the points of pumping  the effect on the orbit distorted atoms being pumped would stop the entire process almost at once  but of course  there was diffusion to take into account .  the charge concentration diffused outward over the earth  and the effect on the pumping process had been calculated with that in mind .   the increased positive charge of the earth generally forced the positively charged solar wind to avoid the planet at a greater distance  and the magnetosphere was enlarged .  thanks to the work of mcfarland  the real originator of the great insight according to lament  it could be shown that a definite equilibrium point was reached as the solar wind swept away more and more of the accumulating positive particles that were repelled from earth s surface and driven higher into the exosphere .  with each increase in pumping intensity  with each additional pumping station constructed  the net positive charge on earth increased slightly  and the magnetosphere expanded by a few miles .  the change  however  was minor  and the positive charge was  in the end  swept away by the solar wind and spread through the outer reaches of the solar system .   even so   even allowing for the most rapid possible diffusion of the charge   the time would come when the local charge difference between universe and para universe at the points of pumping would grow large enough to end the process  and that would be a small fraction of the time it would take really to use up all the electrons  roughly  a trillion trillionth of the time .   but that still meant that pumping would remain possible for a trillion years .  only a single trillion years  but that was enough  it would suffice .  a trillion years was far longer than man would last  or the solar system either .  and if man somehow did last that long  or some creature that was man s successor and supplanter  then no doubt something would be devised to correct the situation .  a great deal could be done in a trillion years .   lamont had to agree to that .   but then he thought of something else  another line of thought that he well remembered hallam himself had dealt with in one of the articles he had written for popular consumption .  with some distaste  he dug out the article .  it was important to see what hallam had said before he carried the matter further .   the article said  in part   because of the ever present gravitational force  we have come to associate the phrase  downhill  with the kind of inevitable change we can use to produce energy of the sort we can change into useful work .  it is the water running downhill that  in past centuries  turned wheels which in turn powered machinery such as pumps and generators .  but what happens when all the water has run downhill .    there can then be no further work possible till the water has been returned uphill   and that takes work .  in fact  it takes more work to force the water uphill than we can collect by then allowing it to flow downhill .  we work at an energy loss .  fortunately  the sun does the work for us .  it evaporates the oceans so that water vapor climbs high in the atmosphere  forms clouds  and eventually falls again as rain or snow .  this soaks the ground at all levels  fills the springs and streams  and keeps the water forever running downhill .    but not quite forever .  the sun can raise the water vapor  but only because  in a nuclear sense  it is running downhill  too .  it is running downhill at a rate immensely greater than any earthly river can manage  and when all of it has run downhill there wilt be nothing we know of to pull it uphill again    all sources of energy in our universe run down .  we can   t help that .  everything is downhill in just one direction  and we can force a temporary uphill  backward  only by taking advantage of some greater downhill in the vicinity .  if we want useful energy forever  we need a road that is downhill both ways .  that is a paradox in our universe  it stands to reason that whatever is downhill one way is uphill going back .    but need we confine ourselves to our universe alone .  think of the para universe .  it has roads  too  that are downhill in one direction and uphill in the other .  those roads  however  don t fit in with our roads .  it is possible to take a road from the para universe to our universe that is downhill  but which  when we follow it back from the universe to the para universe  is downhill again   because the universes have different laws of behavior .    the electron pump takes advantage of a road that is downhill both ways .  the electron pump      lament looked back at the title of the piece again .  it was  the road that is downhill both ways .    he began thinking .  the concept was  of course  a familiar one to him  as was its thermodynamic consequences .  but why not examine the assumptions .  that had to be the weak point in any theory .  what if the assumptions  assumed to be right by definition  were wrong .  what would be the consequences if one started with other assumptions .  contradictory ones .   he started blindly but within a month he had that feeling that every scientist recognizes   the endless click click as unexpected pieces fall into place  as annoying anomalies become anomalous no more    it was the feel of truth .   it was from that moment on that he began to put additional pressure on bronowski .   and one day he said   i m going to see hallam again .    bronowski s eyebrows lifted .   what for .     to have him turn me down .     yes  that s about your speed  pete .  you re unhappy if your troubles die down a bit .     you don t understand .  it s important to have him refuse to listen to me .  i can t have it said afterward that i by passed him  that he was ignorant of it .     of what .  of the translation of the para symbols .  there isn t any yet .  don t jump the gun  pete .     no  no  not that   and he would say no more .  hallam did not make it easy for lament  it was some weeks before he could find time to see the younger man .  nor did lament intend to make it easy for hallam .  he stalked in with every invisible bristle on edge and sharply pointed .  hallam waited for him frozen faced  with sullen eyes .   hallam said abruptly   what s this crisis you re talking about .     something s turned up  sir   said lament  tonelessly   inspired by one of your articles .     oh .   then  quickly   which one .       the road that is downhill both ways   the one you programmed for teenage life  sir .     and what about it .     i believe the electron pump is not downhill both ways  if i may use your metaphor  which is not  as it happens  a completely accurate way of describing the second law of thermodynamics .    hallam frowned .   what have you got in mind .     i can explain it best  sir  by setting up the field equations for the two universes  sir  and demonstrating an interaction that till now has not been considered   unfortunately so  in my opinion .    with that  lament moved directly to the thixo board and quickly fingered the equations  talking rapidly as he did so .   lamont knew that hallam would be humiliated and irritated by such a procedure since he would not follow the mathematics .  lamont counted on that .   hallam growled   see here  young man  i have no time now to engage in a full discussion of any aspect of para theory .  you send me a complete report and  for now  if you have some brief statement as to what you re getting at  you may make it .    lamont walked away from the thixo board  with an unmistakable expression of contempt on his face .  he said   .   all right .  the second law of thermodynamics describes a process that inevitably chops off extremes .  water doesn t run downhill  what really happens is that extremes of gravitational potential are equalized .  water will just as easily bubble uphill if trapped underground .  you can get work out of the juxtaposition of two different temperature levels  but the end result is that the temperature is equalized at an intermediate level  the hot body cools down and the cold body warms up .  both cooling and warming are equal aspects of the second law and  under  the proper circumstances  equally spontaneous .    .    don t teach me elementary thermodynamics  young man .  what is it you want .  i have very little time .    lamont said  with no change of expression  no sense of being hurried .   work is obtained out of the electron pump by an equalization of extremes .  in this case  the extremes are the physical laws of the two universes  the conditions that make those laws possible  whatever those conditions may be  are being bled from one universe into the other and the end result of the entire process will be two universes in which the laws of nature will be identical    and intermediate as compared with the situation now .  since this will produce uncertain but undoubtedly large changes in this universe  it would seem that serious consideration must be given to stopping the pumps and  shutting down the whole operation permanently .    it was at this point that lamont expected hallam to explode  cutting off any chance of further explanation .  hallam did not fail that expectation .  he sprang out of his chair  which fell over .  he kicked the chair away and took the two steps that separated him from lamont .   warily  lamont pushed his own chair hastily backward and stood up .    you idiot   shouted hallam  almost stammering in his anger .   don t you suppose everyone at the station understands about the equalization of natural law .  are you wasting my time telling me something i knew when you were learning to read .  get out of here  and any time you want to offer me your resignation  consider it accepted .    lament left  having obtained exactly what he wanted  and yet he felt himself to be furious over hallam s treatment of him .          concluded        anyway   said lamont   it clears the ground .  i ve tried to tell him .  he wouldn t listen .  so i take the next step .     and what is that .   said bronowski .    i m going to see senator burt .     you mean the head of the committee on technology and the environment .     the same .  you ve heard of him  then .     who hasn t .  but where s the point  pete .  what have you got that would interest him .  it s not the translation .  pete  i m asking you once again .  what have you got on your mind .     i can t explain .  you don t know para theory .     does senator burt .     more than you  i think .    bronowski pointed his finger .   pete  let s not kid around .  maybe i know things you don t .  we can t work together if we work against each other .  either i m a member of this little two man corporation or i m not .  you tell me what s on your mind  and i ll tell you something in exchange .  otherwise  let s stop this altogether .    lamont shrugged .   all right .  if you want it  i ll give it to you .  now that i ve got it past hallam  maybe it s just as well .  the point is that the electron pump is transferring natural law .  in the para universe  the strong interaction is a hundred times stronger than it is here  which means that nuclear fission is much more likely here than there  and nuclear fusion is much more likely there than here .  if the electron pump keeps on long enough  there will be a final equilibrium in which the strong nuclear interaction will be equally strong in both universes  and be at a figure about ten times what it is here now and one tenth what it is there now .     didn t anyone know this .     oh  sure  everyone knew it .  it was obvious almost from the start .  even hallam can see it .  that s what got the bastard so excited .  i started telling him this in detail as though i didn t think he had ever heard it before and he blew up .     but what s the point then .  is there danger in the interaction becoming intermediate .     of course .  what do you think .     i don t think anything .  when will it become intermediate .     at the present rate      years or so .     how long is that .     long enough for a trillion trillion universes like this one to be born  live  grow old  and die  one after the other .     oh blazes  pete .  what odds does it make then .     because to reach that figure   said lamont  slowly and carefully   which is the official one  certain assumptions were made which i think were wrong .  and if certain other assumptions are made  which i think are right  we re in trouble now    what kind of trouble .     suppose the earth turned into a whiff of gas in a period of about five minutes .  would you consider that trouble .     because of the pumping .     because of the pumping .     and how about the world of the para men .  would they be in danger  too .     i m sure of it .  a different danger  but danger .    bronowski stood up and began pacing .  he wore his brown hair thick and long in what had once been called a buster brown .  now he was clutching at it he said   if the para men are more intelligent than we are  would they be running the pump .  surely they would know it was dangerous  before we did .     i ve thought of that   said lamont  what i guess is that they ve started pumping for the first time and they  like us  got the process started for the apparent good it would bring and worried about consequences later .     but you say you know the consequences now .  would they be slower than you were .     it depends on if and when they look for those consequences .  the pump is too attractive to try to spoil  i wouldn t have looked myself if i hadn t    but what s on your mind  mike .    bronowski stopped his pacing  looked full at lamont  and said   i think we ve got something .    lamont looked at him wildly  then leaped forward to seize the other s sleeve .   with the para symbols .  tell me  mike .     it was while you were with hallam .  while you were actually with hallam .  i haven t known exactly what to do about it  because i wasn t sure what was going on .  and now       and now .     i m still not sure .  one of their foils came through  with four symbols  .   .   .     oh .      .  .  .  in the latin alphabet and it can be pronounced .     what .     here it is .    bronowski produced the foil with the air of a conjurer .  incised on it  quite different from the delicate and intricate spirals and differential glistenings of the para symbols  were four broad  childlike letters  f e e r .    what do you suppose that means .   asked lament  blankly .    so far all i ve been able to think of is that it s f e a r misspelled .     is that why you were cross examining me .  you thought someone on the other side was experiencing fear .     and i thought it might have some connection with your own obviously increasing excitement over the last month .  frankly  pete  i didn t like being kept in the dark     okay .  now let s not jump to conclusions .  you re the one with experience with fragmentary messages .  wouldn t you say that the para men were beginning to experience fear concerning the electron pump .     not necessarily at all   said bronowski .   i don t know how much they can sense of this universe .  if they can sense the tungsten we lay out for them  if they can sense our presence  perhaps they are sensing our state of mind .  perhaps they are trying to reassure us  telling us there is no reason to fear .     then why don t they say n o f e e r .     because they don t know our language that well yet    hmm .  then i can t take it to burt .     i wouldn t .  it s ambiguous .  in fact  i wouldn t go to burt till we get something more from the other side .  who knows what they re trying to say .     no  i can t wait  mike .  i know i m right  and we have no time .     all right  but if you see burt you ll be burning your bridges .  your colleagues will never forgive you .  have you thought of talking to the physicists here .  you can t put pressure on hallam on your own  but a whole group of you      lamont shook his head vigorously   not at all .  the men at this station survive by virtue of their jellyfish quality .  there isn t one who would stand against him .  trying to rally the others to put pressure on hallam would be like asking strands of cooked spaghetti to come to attention .    bronowski s soft face looked unwontedly grim .   you may be right .     i know i m right   said lamont  just as grimly .              it had taken time to pin the senator down  time that lamont had resented losing  the more so since nothing further in latin letters had come from the para men .  no message of any kind  though bronowski had sent across half a dozen  each with a carefully selected combinations of para symbols and each incorporating both f e e r and f e a r .   lamont wasn t sure of the significance of the half dozen variations but bronowski had seemed hopeful .   yet nothing had happened and now lamont was at last in to see burt .   the senator was thin faced  sharp eyed  and elderly .  he had been the head of the committee on technology and the environment for a generation .  he took his job seriously and had proved that a dozen times .   he fiddled  now  with the old fashioned necktie that he affected  and that had become his trademark  and said   i can only give you half an hour  son .   he looked at his wristwatch .   lamont was not worried .  he expected to interest senator burt enough to make him forget about time limits .  nor did he attempt to begin at the beginning  his intentions here were quite different from those in connection with hallam .   he said   i won t bother with the mathematics  senator  but i will assume you realize that through pumping  the natural laws of the two universes are being mixed .     stirred together   said the senator  calmly   with equilibrium coming in about     years .  is that the figure .   his eyebrows in repose arched up and then down  giving his lined face a permanent air of surprise .    it is   said lamont   but it is arrived at by assuming that the alien laws seeping into our universe and theirs spread outward from the point of entry at the speed of light .  that is just an assumption and i believe it to be wrong .     why .     the only measured rate of mixing is within the plutonium     sent into this universe .  that rate of mixing is extremely slow at first  presumably because matter is dense  and increases with time .  if the plutonium is mixed with less dense matter  the rate of mixing increases more rapidly .  from a few measurements of this sort it has been calculated that the permeation rate would increase to the speed of light in a vacuum .  it would take some time for the alien laws to work their way into the atmosphere  far less time to work their way to the top of the atmosphere and then off through space in every direction at         kilometers per second  thinning into harmlessness in no time .    lamont paused a moment to consider how best to go on  and the senator picked it up at once .   however     he urged  with the manner of a man not willing to waste time .    it s a convenient assumption that seems to make sense and seems to make no trouble  but what if it is not matter that offers resistance to the permeation of the alien laws  but the basic fabric of the universe itself .     what is the basic fabric .     i can t put it in words .  there is a mathematical expression which i think represents it  but i can t put it into words .  the basic fabric of the universe is that which dictates the laws of nature .  it is the basic fabric of our universe that makes it necessary for energy to be conserved .  it is the basic fabric of the para universe  with a weave  so to speak  somewhat different from ours  that makes their nuclear interaction a hundred times stronger than ours .     and so .     if it is the basic fabric that is being penetrated  sir  then the presence of matter  dense or not  can have only a secondary influence .  the rate of penetration is greater in a vacuum than in dense mass  but not very much greater .  the rate of penetration in outer space may be great in earthly terms but it is only a small fraction of the speed of light .     which means .     that the alien fabric is not dissipating as quickly as we think  but is piling up  so to speak  within the solar system to a much greater concentration than we have been assuming .     i see   said the senator  nodding his head .   and how long then will it be before the space within the solar system is brought to equilibrium .  less than      years  i imagine .     far less  sir .  less than     years  i think .  perhaps fifty billion years  give or take a couple of billion .     not much in comparison  but enough  eh .  no immediate cause for alarm  eh .     but i m afraid that is immediate cause for alarm  sir .  damage will be done long before equilibrium is reached .  because of the pumping  the strong nuclear interaction is growing steadily stronger in our universe at every moment .     enough stronger to measure .     perhaps not  sir .     not even after twenty years of pumping .     perhaps not  sir .     then why worry .     because  sir  upon the strength of the strong nuclear interaction rests the rate at which hydrogen fuses to helium in the core of the sun .  if the interaction strengthens even unnoticeably  the rate of hydrogen fusion in the sun will increase markedly .  the sun maintains the balance between radiation and gravitation with great delicacy and to upset that balance in favor of radiation  as we are now doing       yes .        will cause an enormous explosion .  under our laws of nature  it is impossible for a star as small as the sun to become a supernova .  under the altered laws  it may not be .  i doubt that we would have warning .  the sun would build up to a vast explosion and in eight minutes after that you and i will be dead and the earth will quickly vaporize into an expanding puff of vapor .     and nothing can be done .     if it is too late to avoid upsetting the equilibrium  nothing .  if it is not yet too late  then we must stop pumping .    the senator cleared his throat .   before i agreed to see you  young man  i inquired as to your background since you were not personally known to me .  among those i queried was dr .  hallam .  you know him  i suppose .     yes  sir .   a corner of lament s mouth twitched but his voice held even .   i know him well .     he tells me   said the senator  glancing at a paper on his desk   that you are a troublemaking idiot of doubtful sanity and he demands that i refuse to see you .    lament said in a voice he strove to keep calm .   are those his words  sir .     his exact words .     then why have you agreed to see me  sir .     ordinarily  if i received something like this from hal lam  i wouldn t have seen you .  my time is valuable and heaven knows i see more troublemaking idiots of doubtful sanity than bears thinking of  even among those who come to me with the highest recommendations .  in this one case  though  i didn t like hallam s  demand .   you don t make demands of a senator and hallam had better learn that .     then you will help me  sir .     help you do what .     why   arrange to have the pumping halted .     that .  not at all .  quite impossible .     why not .   demanded lament .   you are the head of the committee on technology and the environment and it is precisely your task to stop the pumping  or any technological procedure that threatens irreversible harm to the environment .  there can be no greater  no more irreversible harm than threatened by pumping .     certainly .  certainly .  if you are right .  but it seems that what your story amounts to is that your assumptions are different from the accepted ones .  who s to say which set of assumptions is right .     sir  the structure i have built explains several things that are left doubtful in the accepted view .     well  then  your colleagues ought to accept your modification and in that case you would scarcely have to come to me  i imagine .     sir  my colleagues will not believe .  their self interest stands in the way .     as your self interest stands in the way of your believing you might be wrong .   .   .   .  young man  my powers  on paper  are enormous  but i can only succeed when the public is willing to let me .  let me give you a lesson in practical politics .    he looked at his wristwatch  leaned back and smiled .  his offer was not characteristic of him  but an editorial in the terrestrial post that morning had referred to him as  a consummate politician  the most skilled in the international congress  and the glow that that had roused within him still lingered .    it is a mistake   he said   to suppose that the public wants the environment protected or their lives saved and that they will be grateful to any idealist who will fight for such ends .  what the public wants is their own individual comfort .  we know that well enough from our experience in the environmental crisis of the twentieth century .  once it was well known that cigarettes increased the incidence of lung cancer  the obvious remedy was to stop smoking  but the desired remedy was a cigarette that did not encourage cancer .  when it became clear that the internal combustion engine was polluting the atmosphere dangerously  the obvious remedy was to abandon such engines  and the desired remedy was to develop non polluting engines .    now then  young man  don t ask me to stop the pumping .  the economy and comfort of the entire planet depend on it .  tell me  instead  how to keep the pumping from exploding the sun .    lamont said   there is no way  senator .  we are dealing with something here that is so basic  we can t play with it we must stop it .     ah  and you can suggest only that we go back to matters as they were before pumping .     we must    in that case  you will need hard and fast proof that you are right .     the best proof   said lament  stiffly   is to have the sun explode .  i suppose you don t want me to go that far .     not necessary  perhaps .  why can t you get hallam to back you up .     because he is a small man who finds himself the father of the electron pump .  how can he admit his child will destroy the earth .     i see what you mean  but he is still the father of the electron pump to the whole world  and only his word would carry sufficient weight in this respect .    lament shook his head .   he would never give in .  he would rather see the sun explode .    the senator said   then force his hand .  you have a theory but a theory by itself is meaningless .  surely there must be some way of checking it .  the rate of radioactive breakdown of  say  uranium depends on the interactions within the nucleus .  has that rate been changing in a fashion predicted by your theory but not the standard one .    again  lament shook his head .   ordinary radioactivity depends on the weak nuclear interaction  and unfortunately  experiments of that sort will yield only borderline evidence .  by the time it showed sufficiently to be unmistakable  it would be too late .     what else  then .     there are pion interactions of a specific sort that might yield unmistakable data now .  better still there are quark quark combinations that have produced puzzling results recently that i am sure i can explain       well  there you are .     yes  but in order to obtain that data .  i must make use of a large proton synchrotron on the moon  sir  and no time on that will be available for years   i ve checked   unless someone pulls the strings .     meaning me .     meaning you  senator .     not as long as dr .  hallam says this about you  son .   and senator hurt s gnarled finger tapped the piece of paper in front of him .   i can t get out on that limb .     but the existence of the world       prove it .     override hallam and i   ll prove it .     prove it and i ll override hallam .    lamont drew a deep breath   senator .  suppose there s just a trifling chance i m right .  isn t even that trifling chance worth fighting for .  it means everything  all mankind  the entire planet       you want me to fight the good fight .  i d like to .  there s a certain drama in going down in a good cause .  any  decent politician is masochistic enough to dream now and then of going down in flames while the angels sing .  but   dr .  lamont  to do that one has to have a fighting chance .  one has to have something to fight for that may    just may    win out .  if i back you  i ll accomplish nothing with your word alone against the infinite desirability of pumping  shall i demand every man give up the personal comfort and affluence he has learned to get used to  thanks to the pump  just because one man cries  doom  while all the other scientists stand against him  and the revered hallam calls him an idiot .  no  sir  i will not go down in flames for nothing .    lamont said   then just help me find my proof .  you needn t appear in the open if you fear       i m not afraid   said burt  abruptly .   i m being practical .  dr .  lamont  your half hour is rather more than gone .    lamont stared for a moment in frustration but burt s expression was a clearly intransigent one now .  lamont left .  senator burt did not see his next visitor immediately .  minutes passed while he stared uneasily at the closed door and fiddled with his tie .  could the man have been right .  could he have had the smallest chance of being right .   he had to admit it would be a pleasure to trip hallam and push his face into the mud and sit on him till he choked   but it would not happen .  hallam was untouchable .  he had had only one set to with hallam nearly ten years ago .  he had been right  dead right  and hallam had been egregiously wrong  and events had since proved it to be so .  and yet  at the time  burt had been humiliated and he had almost lost reelection as a result .   burt shook his head in admonition to himself .  he might risk reelection in a good cause  but he could not risk humiliation again .  he signaled for the next visitor and his face was calm and bland as he rose to greet him .              if by this time  lamont had still felt he had something to lose  professionally  he might have hesitated .  joshua chen was universally unpopular and anyone who dealt with him was in bad odor at once with almost every corner of the establishment .  chen was a one man revolutionary whose single voice could somehow always be heard because he brought to his causes an intensity that was utterly overpowering  and because he had built an organization that was more tightly knit than any ordinary political team in the world  as more than one politician was ready to swear  .   he had been one of the important factors accounting for the speed with which the pump had taken over the planet s energy needs .  the pump s virtues were clear and obvious  as clear as non pollution and as obvious as for free  yet there might have been a longer rear guard fight by those who wanted nuclear energy  not because it was better but because it had been the friend of their childhood .   yet when chen beat his drums  the world listened just a little harder .  now he sat there  his broad cheekbones and round face bearing evidence of the approximately three quarter admixture of chinese ancestry .   he said   let me get this straight .  you re speaking only for yourself .     yes   said lamont tightly .   hallam doesn t back me .  in fact  hallam says i m mad .  do you have to have hallam s approval before you can move .     i need no one s approval   said chen with predictable arrogance  then he lapsed back into thoughtful consideration .  .   you say the para men are farther advanced in technology than we are .    lamont had gone that far in the direction of compromise .  he had avoided saying they were more intelligent .   farther advanced in technology  was less offensive  but just as true .    that is clear   said lamont   if only because they can send material across the gap between the universes and we can t .     then why did they start the pump if it is dangerous .  why are they continuing it .    lamont was learning to compromise in more than one direction .  he might have said that chen was not the first to ask this  but it would have sounded condescending  perhaps impatient  and he chose not to do so .   lamont said   they were anxious to get started with something that was so apparently desirable as a source of energy  just as we were .  i have reason to think they re as disturbed about it now as i am .     that s still your word .  you have no definite evidence about their state of mind .     none that i can present at this moment .     then it s not enough .     can we afford to risk       it s not enough  professor .  there s no evidence .  i haven t built my reputation by shooting down  targets at random .  my missiles have sped true to the mark every time because i knew what i was doing .     but when i get the evidence       then i ll back you .  if the evidence satisfies me  i assure you neither hallam nor the congress will be able to resist the tide .  so get the evidence and come see me again .     but by then it will be too late    chen shrugged .   perhaps .  much more likely  you will find that you were wrong and no evidence is to be had .     i   m not wrong .   lamont took a deep breath  and said in a confidential tone   mr .  chen .  there are very likely trillions upon trillions of inhabited planets in the universe  and among them there may be billions with intelligent life and highly developed technologies .  the same is probably true of the para universe .  it must be that in the history of the two universes there have been many pairs of worlds that came into contact and began pumping .  there may be dozens or even hundreds of pumps scattered across junction points of the two universes .     pure speculation .  but if so .     then it may be that in dozens or hundreds of cases  the mixture of natural law advanced locally to an extent sufficient to explode a planet s sun .  the effect might have spread outward .  the energy of a supernova added to the changing natural law may have set off explosions among neighboring stars  which in turn set off others .  in time perhaps an entire core of a galaxy or of a galactic arm will explode .     but that is only imagination  of course .     is it .  there are hundreds of quasars in the universe  tiny bodies the size of several solar systems but shining with the light of a hundred full size ordinary galaxies .     you re telling me that the quasars are what are left of pumping planets .     i m suggesting that .  in the century and a half since they were discovered  astronomers have still failed to account for their sources of energy .  nothing in this universe will account for it  nothing .  doesn t it follow then       what about the para universe .  is it full of quasars  too .     i wouldn t think so .  conditions are different there .  para theory makes it seem quite definite that fusion takes place much more easily over there  so the stars must be considerably smaller than ours on the average .  it would take a much smaller supply of easily fusing hydrogen to produce the energy our sun does .  a supply as large as that of our sun would explode spontaneously .  if our laws permeate the para universe  hydrogen becomes a little more difficult to fuse  the para stars begin to cool down .     well  that s not so bad   said chen .   they can use pumping to supply themselves with the necessary energy .  by your speculations  they re in fine shape .     not really   said lament .  until now  he hadn t thought the para situation through .   once our end explodes  the pumping stops .  they can t keep it up without us  and that means they ll face a cooling star without pump energy .  they might be worse off than we  we d go out in a painless flash while their agony would be long drawn out .     you have a good imagination  professor   said chen   but i m not buying it .  i don t see any chance of giving up pumping on nothing more than your imagination .  do you know what the pump means to mankind .  it s not just the free  clean  and copious energy .  look beyond that .  what it means is that mankind no longer has to work for a living .  it means that for the first time in history  mankind can turn its collective brains to the more important problem of developing its true potential .    for instance  not all the medical advances of two and a half centuries have succeeded in advancing man s full life span much past a hundred years .  we ve been told by gerontologists over and over that there is nothing  in theory  to stand in the way of human immortality  but so far not enough attention has been concentrated on this .    lament said angrily   immortality .  you re talking pipe dreams .     perhaps you re a judge of pipe dreams  professor   said chen   but i intend to see  that research into immortality begins .  it won t begin it pumping ends .  then we are back to expensive energy  scarce energy  dirty energy .  earth s two billions will have to go back to work for a living and the pipe dream of immortality will remain a pipe dream .     it will anyway .  no one is going to be immortal .  no one is even going to live out a normal lifetime .     ah  but that is your theory  only .    lament weighed the possibilities and decided to gamble .   mr .  chen  a while ago i said i was not willing to explain my knowledge of the state of mind of the para men .  well  let me try .  we have been receiving messages .     yes  but can you interpret them .     we received an english word .    chen frowned slightly .  he suddenly put his hands in his pockets  stretched his short legs before him  and leaned back in his chair .   and what was the english word .     fear .   lament did not feel it necessary to mention the misspelling .    fear   repeated chen   and what do you think it means .     isn t it clear that they re afraid of the pumping phenomenon .     not at all .  if they were afraid  they would stop it .  i think they re afraid  all right  but they re afraid that our side will stop it .  you ve gotten across your intention to them and if we stop it  as you want us to do  they ve got to stop also .  you said yourself they can t continue without us  it s a two ended proposition .  i don t blame them for being afraid .    lament sat silent .    i see   said chen   that you haven t thought of that .  well  then  we ll push for immortality .  i think that will be the more popular cause .     oh  popular causes   said lamont slowly .   i didn t understand what you found important .  how old are you  mr .  chen .    for a moment  chen bunked rapidly  then he turned away .  he left the room  walking rapidly  with his hands clenched .   lamont looked up his biography later .  chen was sixty and his father had died at sixty two .  but it didn t matter .               you don t look as though you had any luck at all   said bronowski .   lamont was sitting in his laboratory  staring at the toes of his shoes and noting idly that they seemed unusually scuffed .  he shook his head .   no .     even the great chen failed you .     he would do nothing .  he wants evidence  too .  they all want evidence  but anything you offer them is rejected .  what they really want is their damned pump  or their reputation  or their place in history .  chen wants immortality .     what do you want  pete .   asked bronowski  softly .    mankind s safety   said lamont .  he looked at the other s quizzical eyes .   you don t believe me .     oh  i believe you .  but what do you really want .     well  then  by god   and lamont brought his hand down flat on the desk before him in a loud slap .   i want to bright  and that i have  for aim right .     you are sure .     i am sure .  and there s nothing i am worried about  because i intend to win .  you know when i left chen  i came near to despising myself .     you .     yes  i .  why not .  i kept thinking  at every turn hallam stops me .  as long as hallam refutes me everyone has an excuse not to believe me .  while hallam stands like a rock against me  i must fail .  why  then  didn t i work through him  why didn t i butter him up  indeed  why didn t i maneuver him into supporting me instead of needling him into fighting me .     do you think you could have .     no  never .  but in my despair  i thought   well  allsorts of things .  that i might go to the moon  perhaps .  of course  when i first turned him against me there was as yet no question of earth s doom  but i took care to make it worse when that question arose .  but  as you imply  nothing could have turned him against the pump .     but you don t seem to despise yourself now .     no .  because my conversation with chen brought a dividend .  it showed me i was wasting time .     so it would seem .     yes  but needlessly .  it is not here on earth that the solution lies .  i told chen that our sun might blow up but that the para sun would not  yet that would not save the para men  for when our sun blew up and our end of the pump halted  so would theirs .  they cannot continue without us  do you see .     yes  of course i see .     they why don t we think in the reverse .  we can t continue without them .  in which case  who cares whether we stop the pump or not .  let s get the para men to stop .     ah  but will they .     they said f e e r .  and it means they re afraid .  chen said they feared us  they feared we would stop the pump  but i don t believe that for a moment .  they   re afraid .  i sat silent when chen made his suggestion .  he thought he had me .  he was quite wrong .  i was only thinking at that moment that we had to get the para men to stop .  and we ve got to .  mike  i abandon everything  except you .  you re the hope of the world .  get through to them somehow .    bronowski laughed  and there was almost a childlike glee in it .   pete   he said   you re a genius .     aha .  you ve noticed .     no  i mean it .  you guess what i want to say before i can say it .  i ve been sending message after message  using their symbols in a way that i guessed might signify the pump and using our word as well .  and i did my best to gather what information i ve scrabbled together over many months to use their symbols in a way signifying disapproval  and using an english word again .  i had no idea whether i was getting through or was a mile off base and from the fact that i never got an answer  i had little hope .     you didn t tell me that s what you were trying to do .     well  this part of the problem is my baby .  you take your sweet time explaining para theory to me .     so what happened .       so yesterday  i sent off exactly two words  our language .  i scrawled  p u m p b a d .     and .     and this morning i picked up a return message at last and it was simple enough  and straightforward  too .  it went y e s p u m p b a d b a d b a d .  here look at it .    lament s hand trembled as it held the foil .   there s no mistaking that  is there .  that s confirmation  isn t it .     it seems so to me .  who will you take this to .     to no one   said lament decisively .   i argue no more .  they will tell me i faked the message and there s no point in sitting still for that .  let the para men stop the pump and it will stop on our side too and nothing we can do unilaterally will start it up again .  the entire station will then be on fire to prove that i was right and the pump is dangerous .     how do you figure that .     because that would be the only way they could keep themselves from being torn apart by a mob demanding the pump and infuriated at not getting it .   .  .  .  don t you think so .     well  maybe .  but one thing bothers me .     what s that .     if the para men are so convinced that the pump is dangerous  why haven t they stopped it already .  i took occasion to check awhile ago and the pump is working swimmingly .    lament frowned .   perhaps they don t want a unilateral stoppage .  they consider us their partners and they want a mutual agreement to stop .  don t you suppose that might be so .     it might .  but it might also be that communication is less than perfect  that they don t quite understand the significance of the words b a d .  from what i said to them via their symbols  which i might well have twisted utterly  they may think that b a d means what we consider g o o d .     oh  no .     well  that s your hope  but there s no pay off on hopes .     mike  just keep on sending messages .  use as many of the words they use as possible and keep ringing the changes .  you re the expert and it s in your hands .  eventually  they ll know enough words to say something clear and unmistakable and then we ll explain that we re willing to have the pump stopped .     we lack the authority to make any such statement .     yes  but they won t know  and in the end we ll be mankind s heroes .     even if they execute us first .     even so .   .  .  .  it s in your hands  mike  and i m sure it won t take much longer .                and yet it did .  two weeks passed without another message and the strain grew worse .   bronowski showed it .  the momentary lightness of heart had dissipated  and he entered lament s laboratory in glum silence .   they stared at each other and finally bronowski said   it s all over the place that you ve received your show cause .    lament had clearly not shaved that morning .  his laboratory had a forlorn look about it  a not quite definable  packing up look .  he shrugged .   so what .  it doesn t bother me .  what does bother me is that physical reviews rejected my paper .     you said you were expecting that .     yes  but i thought they might give me reasons .  they might point out what they thought were fallacies  errors  unwarranted assumptions .  something i could argue about .     and they didn t .     not a word .  their referees did not consider the paper suitable for publication .  quote  unquote .  they just won t touch it .   .  .  .  it s really disheartening  the universal stupidity .  i think that i wouldn t grieve at mankind s suicide through sheer evilness of heart  or through mere recklessness .  there s something so damned undignified at going to destruction through sheer thickheaded stupidity .  what s the use of being men if that s how you have to die .     stupidity   muttered bronowski .    what else do you call it .  and they want me to show cause why i ought not to be fired for the great crime of being right .     everyone seems to know that you consulted chen .     yes .   lamont put his fingers to the bridge of his nose and wearily rubbed his eyes .   i apparently got him annoyed enough to go to hallam with tales  and now the accusation is that i have been trying to sabotage the pump project by unwarranted and unsupported fright tactics in an unprofessional manner and that this makes me unsuitable for employment on the station .     they can prove that easily  pete .     i suppose they can .  it doesn t matter .     what are you going to do .     nothing   said lamont indignantly .   let them do their worst .  i ll rely on red tape .  every step of this thing will take weeks  months  and meanwhile you keep working .  we ll hear from the para men yet .    bronowski looked miserable .   pete  suppose we don t .  maybe it s time you think about this again .    lamont looked up sharply .   what are you talking about .     tell them you re wrong .  do penance .  beat your breast .  give up .     never .  by god  mike  we re playing a game in which the stakes are all the world and every living creature on it .     yes  but what s that to you .  you re not married .  you have no children .  i know your father is dead .  you never mention your mother or any siblings  i doubt if there is any human being on earth to whom you are emotionally attached as an individual .  so go your way and the hell with it all .     and you .     ill do the same .  i m divorced and i have no children .  i have a young lady with whom i m close and that relationship will continue while it can .  live .  enjoy .     and tomorrow .     will take care of itself .  death when it comes will be quick .     i can t live with that philosophy .   .   .   .  mike . mike .  what is all this .  are you trying to tell me that we re not going to get through .  are you giving up on the para men .    bronowski looked away .  he said   pete  i did get an answer .  last night .  i thought i d wait for today and think about it  but why think .   .  .  .  here it is .    lament s eyes were staring questions .  he took the foil and looked at it .  there was no punctuation   pump not stop not stop we not stop pump we not hear danger not hear not hear you stop please stop you stop so we stop please you stop danger danger danger stop stop you stop pump   by god   muttered bronowski   they sound desperate .    lamont was still staring .  he said nothing .   bronowski said   i gather that somewhere on the other side is someone like you   a para lamont .  and he can t get his para hallams to stop  either .  and while we re begging them to save us  he s begging us to save them .    lamont said   but if we show this       they ll say you re lying  that it s a hoax you ve concocted to save your psychotically conceived nightmare .     they can say that of me  maybe  but they can t say it of you .  you ll back me  mike .  you ll testify that you received this and how .    bronowski reddened .   what good would that do .  they   ll say that somewhere in the para universe there is a nut like yourself and that two crackpots got together .  they ll say that the message proves that the constituted authorities in the para universe are convinced there s no danger .     mike  fight this through with me .     there s no use  pete .  you said yourself  stupidity .  those para man may be more advanced than ourselves  even more intelligent  as you insist  but it s plain to see that they re just as stupid as we are and that ends it schiller pointed that out and i believe him .     who .     schiller .  a german dramatist of three centuries ago .  in a play about joan of arc  he said   against stupidity  the gods themselves contend in vain  i m no god and i ll contend no longer .  let it go  pete  and go your way .  maybe the world will last our time and  if not  there s nothing that can be done anyway .  i m sorry  pete .  you fought the good fight  but you lost  and i m through .    he was gone and lamont was alone .  he sat in his chair  fingers aimlessly drumming  drumming .  somewhere in the sun  protons were clinging together with just a trifling additional avidity and with each moment that avidity grew and at some moment the delicate balance would break down  .   .   .    and no one on earth will live to know i was right   cried out lamont  and blinked and blinked to keep back the tears .               .   .   .  the gods themselves  .   .   .        a      dua did not have much trouble leaving the others .  she always expected trouble  but somehow it never came .  never real trouble .   but then why should it .  odeen objected in his lofty way .   stay put   he would say .   you know you annoy tritt .   he never spoke of his own annoyance  rationals didn t grow annoyed over trifles .  still  he hovered over tritt almost as persistently as tritt hovered over the children .   but then odeen always let her have her way if she were persistent enough  and would even intercede with tritt .  sometimes he even admitted he was proud of her ability  of her independence .   .  .  .  he wasn t a bad left ling  she thought with absent minded affection .   tritt was harder to handle and he had a sour way of looking at her when she was   well  when she was as she wished to be .  but then right lings were like that .  he was a right ling to her  but a parental to the children and the latter took precedence always .   .   .   .  which was good because she could always count on one child or the other taking him away just as things grew uncomfortable .   still  dua didn t mind tritt very much .  except for melting  she tended to ignore him .  odeen was another thing .  he had been exciting at first  just his presence had made her outlines shimmer and fade .  and the fact that he was a rational made him all the more exciting somehow .  she didn t understand her reaction to that  it was part of her queerness .  she had grown used to her queerness   almost .   dua sighed .   when she was a child  when she still thought of herself as an individual  a single being  and not as part of a triad  she was much more aware of that queerness .  she was much more made aware of it by the others .  as little a thing as the surface at evening     she had loved the surface at evening .  the other emotionals had called it cold and gloomy and had quivered and coalesced when she described it for them .  they were ready enough to emerge in the warmth of midday and stretch and feed  but that was exactly what made the midday dull .  she didn t like to be around the twittering lot of them .   she had to eat  of course  but she liked it much better in the evening when there was very little food  but everything was dim  deep red  and she was alone .  of course  she described it as colder and more wistful than it was when she talked to the others in order to watch them grow hard edged as they imagined the chill   or as hard edged as young emotionals could .  after a while  they would whisper and laugh at her   and leave her alone .   the small sun was at the horizon now  with the secret ruddiness that she alone was there to see .  she spread herself out laterally and thickened dorso ventrally  absorbing the traces of thin warmth .  she munched at it idly  savoring the slightly sour  substanceless taste of the long wave lengths .   she had never met another emotional who would admit to liking it .  but she could never explain that she associated it with freedom  freedom from the others  when she could be alone .    even now the loneliness  the chill  and the deep  deep red  brought back those old days before the triad  and even more  quite sharply  her own parental  who would come lumbering after her  forever fearful that she would hurt herself .   he had been carefully devoted to her  as parentals always were  to their little mids more than to the other two  as always .  it had annoyed her and she would dream of the day when he would leave her .  parentals always did eventually  and how she had missed him  when one day  he finally did .   he had come to tell her  just as carefully as he could  despite the difficulty parentals had in putting their feelings into words .  she had run from him that day  not in malice  not because she suspected what he had to tell her  but only out of joy .  she had managed to find a special place at midday and had gorged herself in unexpected isolation and had been filled with a queer  itching sensation that demanded motion and activity .  she had slithered over the rocks and had let her edges overlap theirs .  it was something she knew to be a grossly improper action for anyone but a baby and yet it was something at once exciting and soothing .   and her parental caught her at last and had stood before her  silent for a long time  making his eyes small and dense as though to stop every bit of light reflected from her  to see as much as he could of her  and for as long as possible .   at first  she just stared back with the confused thought that he had seen her rub through the rocks and was ashamed of her .  but she caught no shame aura and finally she said  very subdued   what is it  daddy .     why  dua  it s the time .  i ve been expecting it .  surely you have .     what time .   now that it was here  dua stubbornly would not let herself know .  if she refused to know  there would be nothing to know .   she never quite got out of that habit .  odeen said all emotionals were like that  in the lofty voice he used sometimes when he was particularly overcome with the importance of being a rational .    her parental had said   i must pass on .  i will not be with you any more .   then he just stood and looked at her  and she couldn t say anything .   he said   you will tell the others .     why .   dua turned away rebelliously  her outlines vague and growing vaguer  trying to dissipate .  she wanted to dissipate altogether and of course she couldn t .  after a while  it hurt and cramped and she hardened again .  her parental didn t even bother to scold her and tell her that it would be shameful if anyone saw her stretched out so .   she said     they won t care   and immediately felt sorrowful that her parental would be hurt at that .  he still called them  little left  and  little right   but little left was all involved with his studies and little right kept talking about forming a triad .  dua was the only one of the three who still felt    well  she was the youngest .  emotionals always were and with them it was different .   her parental only said   you will tell them anyway .   and they stood looking at each other .   she didn t want to tell them .  they weren t close any more .  it had been different when they were all little .  they could hardly tell themselves apart in those days  left brother from right brother from mid sister .  they were all wispy and would tangle with each other and roll through each other and hide in the walls .   no one ever minded that when they were little  none of the grown ups .  but then the brothers grew thick and sober and drew away .  and when she complained to her parental  he would only say gently   you are too old to thin  dua .    she tried not to listen  but left brother kept drawing away and would say   don t snuggle  i have no time for you .   and right brother began to stay quite hard all the time and became glum and silent .  she didn t understand it quite then and daddy had not been able to make it clear .  he would say every once in a while as though it were a lesson he had once learned    lefts are rationals  dua .  rights are parentals .  they grow up their own way .    she didn t like their way .  they were no longer children and she still was  so she flocked with the other emotionals .  they all had the same complaints about their brothers .  they all talked of coming triads .  they all spread in the sun and fed .  they all grew more and more the same and every day the same things were said .   and she grew to detest them and went off by herself whenever she could  so that they left and called her  left em .    it had been a long time now since she had heard that call  but she never thought of that phrase without remembering perfectly the thin ragged voices that kept it up after her with a kind of half wit persistence because they knew it hurt .    but her parental retained his interest in her even when it must have seemed to him that everyone else laughed at her .  he tried  in his clumsy way  to shield her from the others .  he followed her to the surface sometimes  even  though he hated it himself  in order to make sure she was safe .   she came upon him once  talking to a hard one .  it was hard for a parental to talk to a hard one  even though she was quite young  she knew that much .  hard ones talked only to rationals .   she was quite frightened and she wisped away but not before she had heard her parental say   i take good care of her  hard sir .    could the hard one have inquired about her .  about her queerness  perhaps .  but her parental had not been apologetic .  even to the hard one  he had spoken of his concern for her .  dua felt an obscure pride .   but now he was leaving and suddenly all the independence that dua had been looking forward to lost its fine shape and hardened into the pointed crag of loneliness .  she said   but why must you pass on .     must  little mid dear .    he must .  she knew that .  everyone  sooner or later  must .  the day would come when she would have to sigh and say   i must .     but what makes you know when you have to pass one .  if you can choose your time  why don t you choose a different time and stay longer .    he said   your left father has decided .  the triad must do as he says .     why must you do what he says .   she hardly ever saw her left father or her mid mother .  they didn t count any more .  only her right father  her parental  her daddy  who stood there squat and flat surfaced .  he wasn t all smooth curved like a rational or shuddery uneven like an emotional  and she could always tell what he was going to say .  almost always .   she was sure he would say   i can t explain to a little emotional .    he said it .   dua said in a burst of woe   i ll miss you .  i know you think i pay you no attention  and that i don t like you for always telling me not to do things .  but i would rather not like you for telling me not to do things  than not have you around to tell me not to do things .    and daddy just stood there .  there was no way he could handle an outburst like that except to come closer and pinch out a hand .  it cost him a visible effort  but he held it out trembling and its outlines were ever so slightly soft .   dua said   oh  daddy   and let her own hand flow about it so that his looked misty and shimmery through her substance  but she was careful not to touch it for that would have embarrassed him so .   then he withdrew it and left her hand enclosing nothing and he said   remember the hard ones  dua .  they will help you .  i   i will go now .    he went and she never saw him again .   now she sat there  remembering in the sunset  and rebelliously aware that pretty soon tritt would grow petulant over her absence and nag odeen .   and then odeen might lecture her on her duties .   she didn t care .        b      odeen was moderately aware that dua was off on the surface .  without really thinking about it  he could judge her direction and even something of her distance .  if he had stopped to think of it  he might have felt displeasure  for this inter awareness sense had been steadily deadening for a long time now and  without really being certain why  he had a sense of gathering fulfillment about it .  it was the way things were supposed to be  the sign of the continuing development of the body with age .   tritt s inter awareness sense did not decrease  but it shifted more and more toward the children .  that was clearly the line of useful development  but then the role of the parental was a simple one  in a manner of speaking  however important .  the rational was far more complex and odeen took a bleak satisfaction in that thought .   of course  it was dua who was the real puzzle .  she was so unlike all the other emotionals .  that puzzled and frustrated tritt and reduced him to even more pronounced inarticulacy .  it puzzled and frustrated odeen at times  too  but he was also aware of dua s infinite capacity to induce satisfaction with life and it did not seem likely that one was independent of the other .  the occasional exasperation she produced was a small price to pay for the intense happiness .   and maybe dua s odd way of life was part of what ought to be  too .  the hard ones seemed interested in her and ordinarily they paid attention only to rationals .  he felt pride in that  so much the better for the triad that even the emotional was worth attention .   things were as they were supposed to be .  that was bedrock  and it was what he wanted most to feel  right down to the end .  someday he would even know when it was time to pass on and then he would want to .  the hard ones assured him of that  as they assured all rationals  but they also told him that it was his own inner consciousness that would mark the time unmistakably  and not any advice from outside .    when you tell yourself   losten had told him   in the clear  careful way in which a hard one always talked to a soft one  as though the hard one were laboring to make himself understood   that you know why you must pass on  then you will pass on  and your triad will pass on with you .    and odeen had said   i cannot say i wish to pass on now  hard sir .  there is so much to learn .     of course  left dear .  you feel this because you are not yet ready .    odeen thought  how could i ever feel ready when i would never feel there wasn t much to learn .   but he didn t say so .  he was quite certain the time would come and he would then understand .   he looked down at himself  almost forgetting and thrusting out an eye to do so   there were always some childish impulses in even the most adult of the most rational .  he didn t have to  of course .  he would sense quite well with his eye solidly in place  and he found himself satisfactorily solid  nice  sharp outline  smooth and curved into gracefully conjoined ovoids .   his body lacked the strangely attractive shimmer of dua  and the comforting stockiness of tritt .  he loved them both  but he would not change his own body for either .  and  of course  his own mind .  he would never say so  of course  for he would not want to hurt their feelings  but he never ceased being thankful that he did not have tritt s limited understanding or  even more  dua s erratic one .  he supposed they didn t mind for they knew nothing else .   he grew distantly aware of dua again  and deliberately dulled the sense .  at the moment  he felt no need for her .  it was not that he wanted her less  but merely that he had increasing drives elsewhere .  it was part of the growing maturity of a rational to find more and more satisfaction in the exercise of a mind that could only be practiced alone  and with the hard ones .   he grew constantly more accustomed to the hard ones  constantly more attached to them .  he felt that was right and proper  too  for he was a rational and in a way the hard ones were super rationals .   he had once said that to losten  the friendliest of the hard ones and  it seemed to odeen in some vague way the youngest .  losten had radiated amusement but had said nothing .  and that meant he had not denied it  however .    odeen s earliest memories were filled with hard ones .  his parental more and more concentrated his attention on the last child  the baby emotional .  that was only natural .  tritt would do it  too  when the last child came  if it ever did .   odeen had picked up that last qualification from tritt  who used it constantly as a reproach to dua .    but so much the better .  with his parental busy so much of the time  odeen could begin his education that much the earlier .  he was losing his baby ways and he had learned a great deal even before he met tritt .   that meeting  though  was surely something he would never forget .  it might as well have been yesterday as more than half a lifetime ago .  he had seen parentals of his own generation  of course  young ones who  long before they incubated the children that made true parentals of them  showed few signs of the stolidity to come .  as a child he had played with his own right brother and was scarcely aware of any intellectual difference between them  though  looking back on those days  he recognized that it was there  even then  .   he knew also  vaguely  the role of a parental in a triad .  even as a child  he had whispered tales of melting .   when tritt first appeared  when odeen saw him first  everything changed .  for the first time in his life  odeen felt an inner warmth and began to think that there was something he wanted that was utterly divorced from thought .  even now  he could remember the sense of embarrassment that had accompanied this .   tritt was not embarrassed  of course .  parentals were never embarrassed about the activities of the triad  and emotionals were almost never embarrassed .  only rationals had that problem .    too much thinking   a hard one had said when odeen had discussed the problem with him and that left odeen dissatisfied .  in what way could thinking be  too much  .   tritt was young when they first met  of course .  he was still so childish as to be uncertain in his blockishness so that his reaction to the meeting was embarrassingly clear .  he grew almost translucent along his edges .   odeen said  hesitantly   i haven t seen you before  have i  right fellow .    tritt said   i have never been here .  i have been brought here .    they both knew exactly what had happened to them .  the meeting had been arranged because someone  some parental  odeen had thought at the time  but later he knew it was some hard one  thought they would suit each other  and the thought was correct .   there was no intellectual rapport between the two  of course .  how could there be when odeen wanted to learn with an intensity that superseded anything but the existence of the triad itself  and tritt lacked the very concept of learning .  what tritt had to know  he knew beyond either learning or unlearning .   odeen  out of the excitement of finding out about the world and its sun  about the history and mechanism of life  about all the abouts in the universe  sometimes  in those early days together  found  himself spilling over to tritt .   tritt listened placidly  clearly understanding nothing  but content to be listening  while odeen  transmitting nothing  was as clearly content to be lecturing .   it was tritt who made the first move  driven by his special needs .  odeen was chattering about what he had learned that day after the brief midday meal .   their thicker substance absorbed food so rapidly  they were satisfied with a simple walk in the sun  while emotionals basked for hours at a time  curling and thinning as though deliberately to lengthen the task .    odeen  who always ignored the emotionals  was quite happy to be talking .  tritt  who stared wordlessly at them  day after day  was now visibly restless .   abruptly  he came close to odeen  formed an appendage so hastily as to clash most disagreeably on the other s form sense .  he placed in upon a portion of odeen s upper ovoid where a slight shimmer was allowing a welcome draft of warm air as dessert .  tritt s appendage thinned with a visible effort and sank into the superfices of odeen s skin before the latter darted away  horribly embarrassed .   odeen had done such things as a  baby  of course  but never since his adolescence .   don t do that  tritt   he said sharply .   tritt s appendage remained out  groping a little .   i want to .    odeen held himself as compactly as he could  striving to harden the surface to bar entry .   don   t want to .     why not .   said tritt  urgently .    there s nothing wrong .   odeen said the first thing that came into his mind .   it hurt .    it didn t really .  not physically .  but the hard ones always avoided the touch of the soft ones .  a careless interpenetration hurt them  but they were constructed differently from soft ones  completely differently .    tritt was not fooled by that .  his instinct could not possibly mislead him in this respect .  he said   it didn t hurt .     well  it isn t right this way .  we need an emotional .    and tritt could only say  stubbornly   i want to  anyway .    it was bound to continue happening  and odeen was bound to give in .  he always did  it was something that was sure to happen even to the most self conscious rational .  as the old saying had it  everyone either admitted doing it or lied about it .   tritt was at him at each meeting after that  if not with an appendage  then rim to rim .  and finally odeen  seduced by the pleasure of it  began to help and tried to shine .  he was better at that than tritt was .  poor tritt  infinitely more eager  huffed and strained  and could achieve only the barest shimmer here and there  patchily and raggedly .   odeen  however  could run translucent all over his surface  and fought down his embarrassment in order to let himself flow against tritt .  there was skin deep penetration and odeen could feel the pulsing of tritt s hard surface under the skin .  there was enjoyment  riddled with guilt .   tritt  as often as not  was tired and vaguely angry when it was all over .   odeen said   now  tritt  i ve told you we need an emotional to do this properly .  you can t be angry at something that just is   and tritt said   let s get an emotional .    let s get an emotional .  tritt s simple drives never led him to anything but direct action .  odeen was not sure he could explain the complexities of life to the other .   it s not that easy  right ling   he began gently .   tritt said abruptly .   the hard ones can do it you re friendly with them .  ask them .    odeen was horrified .   i can   t ask .  the time   he continued  unconsciously falling into his lecturing voice   is not yet come  or i would certainly know it .  until such time     tritt was not listening .  he said   i   ll ask .     no     said odeen  horrified .   you stay out of it i tell you it s not time .  i have an education to worry about .  it s very easy to be a parental and not to have to know anything but      he was sorry the instant he had said it and it was a lie anyway .  he just didn t want to do anything at all that might offend the hard ones and impede his useful relationship with them .  tritt  however  showed no signs of minding and it occurred to odeen that the other saw no point or merit in knowing anything he did not already know and would not consider the statement of the fact an insult .   the problem of the emotional kept coming up  though .  occasionally  they tried interpenetration .  in fact  the impulse grew stronger with time .  it was never truly satisfying though it had its pleasure and each time tritt would demand an emotional .  each time  odeen threw himself deeper into his studies  almost as a defense against the problem .   yet at times  he was almost tempted to speak to losten about it .   losten was the hard one he knew best  the one who took the greatest personal interest in him .  there was a deadly sameness about the hard ones  because they did not change  they never changed  their form was fixed .  where there eyes were they always were  and always in the same place for all of them .  their skin was not exactly hard  but it was always opaque  never shimmered  never vague  never penetrable by another skin of its own type .   they were not larger in size  particularly  than the soft ones  but they were heavier .  their substance was much denser and they had to be careful about the yielding tissues of the soft ones .   once when he had been little  really little and his body had flowed almost as freely as his sister s  he had been approached by a hard one .  he had never known which one it was  but he learned in later life that they were all of them curious about baby rationals .  odeen had reached up for the hard one  out of nothing but curiosity .  the hard one had sprung backward and later odeen s parental had scolded him for offering to touch a hard one .   the scolding had been harsh enough for odeen never to forget .  when he was older he learned that the close packed atoms of the .  hard one s tissues felt pain on the forcible penetration of others .  odeen wondered if the soft one felt pain  too .  another young rational once told him that he had stumbled against a hard one and the hard one had doubled up but that he himself had felt nothing    but odeen wasn t sure this was not just a melodramatic boast .   there were other things he could not do .  he liked rubbing against the walls of the cavern .  there was a pleasant  warm feeling when he allowed himself to penetrate rock .  babies always did it  but it got harder to do as he grew older .  still  he could do it skin deep and he liked it  but his parental found him doing it and scolded him .  he objected that his sister did it all the time  he had seen her .    that s different   said the parental .   she s an emotional .    at another time  when odeen was absorbing a recording   he was older then   he had idly formed a couple of projections and made the tips so thin  he could pass one through the other .  he began to do it regularly when he listened .  there was a pleasant tickling sensation that made it easier to listen and made him nicely sleepy afterward .   and his parental caught him at that  too  and what he had said still made odeen uncomfortable in remembering it  no one really told him about melting in those days .  they fed him knowledge and educated him about everything except what the triad was all about .  tritt had never been told  either  but he was a parental so he knew without being told .  of course  when dua came at last  all was clear  even though she seemed to know less about it even than odeen .   but she didn t come to them because of anything odeen did .  it was tritt who broached the matter  tritt  who ordinarily feared the hard ones and avoided them mutely  tritt  who lacked odeen s self assurance  in all but this respect  tritt  who on this one subject was driven  tritt    tritt   tritt     odeen signed .  tritt was invading his thoughts  because tritt was coming .  he could feel him  harsh  demanding  always demanding .  odeen had so little time to himself these days  just when he felt that he needed to think more than ever  to straighten out all the thoughts      yes  tritt   he said .        c      tritt was conscious of his blockiness .  he didn t think it ugly .  he didn t think about it at all .  if he did  he would consider it beautiful .  his body was designed for a purpose and designed well .   he said   odeen  where is dua .     outside somewhere   mumbled odeen  almost as though he didn t care .  it annoyed tritt to have the triad made so little of .  dua was so difficult and odeen didn t care .    why do you let her go .     how can i stop her  tritt .  and what harm does it do .     you know the harm .  we have two babies .  we need a third .  it is so hard to make a little mid these days .  dua must be well fed for it to be made .  now she is wandering about at sunset again .  how can she feed properly at sunset .     she s just not a great feeder .     and we just don t have a little mid .  odeen   tritt s voice was caressing   how can i love you properly without dua .     now  then   mumbled odeen  and tritt felt himself once more puzzled by the other s clear embarrassment at the simplest statement of fact   tritt said   remember  i was the one who first got dua .   did odeen remember that .  did odeen ever think of the triad and what it meant .  sometimes tritt felt so frustrated he could   he could    actually  he didn t know what to do  but he knew he felt frustrated .  as in those old days when he wanted an emotional and odeen would do nothing .   tritt knew he didn t have the trick of talking in big  elaborate sentences .  but if parentals didn t talk  they thought .  they thought about important things .  odeen always talked about atoms and energy .  who cared about atoms and energy .  tritt thought about the triad and the babies .   odeen had once told him that the numbers of soft ones were gradually growing fewer .  didn t he care .  didn t the hard ones care .  did anyone care but the parentals .   only two forms of life on all the world  the soft ones and the hard ones .  and food shining down on them .   odeen had once told him the sun was cooling off .  there was less food  he said  so there were less people .  tritt didn t believe it .  the sun felt no cooler than it had when he was a baby .  it was just that people weren t worrying about the triads any more .  too many absorbed rationals  too many silly emotionals .   what the soft ones must do was concentrate on the important things of life .  tritt did .  he tended to the business of the triad .  the baby left came  then the baby right .  they were growing and flourishing .  they had to have a baby mid  though .  that was the hardest to get started and without a baby mid there would be no new triad .   what made dua as she was .  she had always been difficult  but she was growing worse .   tritt felt an obscure anger against odeen .  odeen always talked with all those hard words .  and dua listened .  odeen would talk to dua endlessly till they were almost two rationals .  that was bad for the triad .   odeen should know better .   it was always tritt who had to care .  it was always tritt who had to do what had to be done .  odeen was the friend of the hard ones and yet he said nothing .  they needed an emotional and yet odeen would say nothing .  odeen talked to them of energy and not of the needs of the triad .   it had been tritt who had turned the  . scale .  tritt remembered that proudly .  he had seen odeen talking to a hard one and he had approached .  without a shake in his voice  he had interrupted and said   we need an emotional .    the hard one turned to look at him .  tritt had never been so close to a hard one .  he was all of a piece .  every part of him had to turn when one part did .  he had some projections that could move by themselves  but they never changed in shape .  they never flowed and were irregular and unlovely .  they didn t like to be touched .   the hard one said   is this so  odeen .   he did not talk to tritt .   odeen flattened .  he flattened close to the ground  more flattened than tritt had ever seen .  he said   my right ling is over zealous .  my right ling is   is     he stuttered and puffed and could not speak .   tritt could speak .  he said   we cannot melt without one .    tritt knew that odeen was embarrassed into speech lessness but he didn t care .  it was time .    well  left dear   said the hard one to odeen   do you feel the same way about it .   hard ones spoke as the soft ones did  but more harshly and with fewer overtones .  they were hard to listen to .  tritt found them hard  anyway  though odeen seemed used to it   yes   said odeen  finally .   the hard one turned at last to tritt .   remind me  young right .  how long have you and odeen been together .     long enough   said tritt   to deserve an emotional .   he kept his shape firmly at angles .  he did not allow himself to be frightened .  this was too important .  he said   and my name is tritt .    the hard one seemed amused .   yes  the choice was good .  you and odeen go well together  but it makes the choice of an emotional difficult .  we have almost made up our minds .  or at least i have long since made up my mind  but the others must be convinced .  be patient  tritt .     i am tired of patience .     i know  but be patient  anyway .   he was amused again .   when he was quite gone  odeen uplifted himself and thinned out angrily .  he said   how could you do that  tritt .  do you know who he was .     he was a hard one .     he was losten .  he is my special teacher .  i don t want him angry with me .     why should he be angry .  i was polite .     well  never mind .   odeen was settling into normal shape .  that meant he wasn t angry any more .   that relieved tritt though he tried not to show it .    it s very embarrassing to have my dumb right come up and speak out to my hard one .     why didn t you do it  then .     there s such a thing as the right time .         but never s the right time to you .    but then they rubbed surfaces and stopped arguing and it wasn t long after that that dua came .   it was losten that brought her .  tritt didn t know that  he didn t look at the hard one .  only at dua .  but odeen told him afterward that it was losten that brought her .    you see .   said tritt .   it was i who talked to him .  that is why he brought her .     no   said odeen .   it was time .  he would have brought her even if neither of us had talked to him .    tritt didn t believe him .  he was quite sure that it was entirely because of himself that dua was with them .   surely  there was never anyone like dua in the world .  tritt had seen many emotionals .  they were all attractive .  he would have accepted any one of them for proper melting .  once he saw dua  he realized that none of the others would have suited .  only dua .  only dua .   and dua knew exactly what to do .  exactly .  no one had ever shown her how  she told them afterward .  no one had ever talked to her about it .  even other emotionals hadn t  for she avoided them .   yet when all three were together  each knew what to do .   dua thinned .  she thinned more than tritt had ever seen a person thin .  she thinned more than tritt would ever have thought possible .  she became a kind of colored smoke that filled the room and dazzled him .  he moved without knowing he was moving .  he immersed himself in the air that was dua .   there was no sensation of penetration  none at all .  tritt felt no resistance  no friction .  there was just a floating inward and a rapid palpitation .  he felt himself beginning to thin in sympathy  and without the tremendous effort that had always accompanied it .  with dua filling him  he could thin without effort into a thick smoke of his own .  thinning became like flowing  one enormous smooth flow .   dimly  he could see odeen approaching from the other side  from dua s left .  and he  too  was thinning .   then  like all the shocks of contact in all the world  he reached odeen .  but it wasn t a shock at all .  tritt felt without feeling  knew without knowing .  he slid into odeen and odeen slid into him .  he couldn t tell whether he was surrounding odeen or being surrounded by him or both or neither .   it was only   pleasure .   the senses dimmed with the intensity of that pleasure and at the point where he thought he could stand no more  the senses failed altogether .   eventually  they separated and stared at each other .  they had melted for days .  of course  melting always took time .  the better it was the longer it took  though when it was over all that time seemed as though it had been an instant and they did not remember it .  in later life  it rarely took longer than that first time .   odeen said   that was wonderful .    tritt only gazed at dua  who had made it possible .   she was coalescing  swirling  moving tremulously .  she seemed most affected of the three .    we ll do it again   she said  hurriedly   but later  later .  let me go now .    she had run off .  they did not stop her .  they were too overcome to stop her .  but that was always the way afterward .  she was always gone after a melting .  no matter how successful it was  she would go .  there seemed something in her that needed to be alone .   it bothered tritt .  in point after point  she was different from other emotionals .  she shouldn t be .   odeen felt differently .  he would say on many occasions   why don t you leave her alone  tritt .  she s not like the others and that means she s better than the others .  melting wouldn t be as good if she were like the others .  do you want the benefits without paying the price .    tritt did not understand that clearly .  he knew only that she ought to do what ought to be done .  he said   i want her to do what is right .     i know  tritt  i know .  but leave her alone  anyway .    odeen often scolded dua himself for her queer ways but was always unwilling to let tritt do so .   you lack tact  tritt   he would say .  tritt didn t know what tact was exactly .   and now    it had been so long since the first melting and still the baby emotional was not born .  how much longer .  it was already much too long .  and dua  if anything  stayed by herself more and more as time went on .   tritt said .   she doesn t eat enough .     when it s time     began odeen .    you always talk about it s being time or it s not being time .  you never found it time to get dua in the first place .  now you never find it time to have a baby emotional .  dua should      but odeen turned away .  he said   she s out there  tritt .  if you want to go out and get her  as though you were her parental instead of her right ling  do so .  but i say  leave her alone .    tritt backed away .  he had a great deal to say  but he didn t know how to say it .      a      dua was aware of the left right agitation concerning her in a dim and faraway manner and her rebelliousness grew .   if one or the other  or both  came to get her  it would end in a melting and she raged against the thought .  it was all tritt knew  except for the children  all tritt wanted  except for the third and last child  and it was all involved with the children and the still missing child .  and when tritt wanted a melting  he got it .   tritt dominated the triad when he grew stubborn .  he would hold on to some simple idea and never let go and in the end odeen and dua would have to give in .  yet now she wouldn t give in  she wouldn   t      she didn t feel disloyal at the thought  either .  she never expected to feel for either odeen or tritt the sheer intensity of longing they felt for each other .  she could melt alone  they could melt only through her mediation  so why didn t that make her the more regarded  .  she felt intense pleasure at the three way melting  of course she did  it would be stupid to deny it  but it was a pleasure akin to that which she felt when she passed through a rock wall  as she sometimes secretly did .  to tritt and odeen  the pleasure was like nothing else they had ever experienced or could ever experience .   no  wait .  odeen had the pleasure of learning  of what he called intellectual development .  dua felt some of that at times  enough to know what it might mean  and though it was different from melting  it might serve as a substitute  at least to the point where odeen could do without melting sometimes .   but not so  tritt .  for him there was only melting and the children .  only .  and when his small mind bent entirely upon that  odeen would give in  and then dua would have to .   once she had rebelled .   but what happens when we melt .  it s hours  days sometimes  before we come out of it .  what happens all that time .    tritt had looked outraged at that .   it s always that way .  it   s got to be .     i don t like anything that   s got to be .  i want to know why .    odeen had looked embarrassed .  he spent half his life being embarrassed .  he said   now  dua  it does have to be .  on account of   children   he seemed to pulse  as he said the word .    well  don t pulse   said dua  sharply .   we re grown now and we ve melted i don t know how many times and we all know it s so we can have children .  you might as well say so .  why does it take so long  that s all .     because it s a complicated process   said odeen  still pulsing .   because it takes energy .  dua  it takes a long time to get a child started and even when we take a long time  it doesn t always get started .  and it s getting worse .   .  .  not just with us   he added hastily .    worse .   said tritt anxiously  but odeen would say no more .   they had a child eventually  a baby rational  a left let  that flitted and thinned so that all three were in raptures and even odeen would hold it and let it change shape in his hands for as long as tritt would allow him to .  for it was tritt  of course  who had actually incubated it through the long pre forming  tritt who had separated from it when it assumed independent existence  and tritt who cared for it at all times .   after that  tritt was often not with them and dua was oddly pleased .  tritt s obsession annoyed her  but odeen s    oddly   pleased her .  she became increasingly aware of his   importance .  there was something to being a rational that made it possible to answer questions  and somehow dua had questions for him constantly .  he was readier to answer when tritt was not present .    why does it take so long  odeen .  i don t like to melt and then not know what s happening for days at a time .     we re perfectly safe  dua   said odeen  earnestly .   come  nothing has ever happened to us  has it .  you ve never heard of anything ever happening to any other triad  have you .  besides  you shouldn t ask questions .     because i m an emotional .  because other emotionals don t ask questions .    i can t stand other emotionals  if you want to know  and i do want to ask questions .    she was perfectly aware that odeen was looking at her as though he had never seen anyone as attractive and that if tritt had been present  melting would have taken place at once .  she even let herself thin out  not much  but perceptibly  in deliberate coquettishness .   odeen said   but you might not understand the implications  dua .  it takes a great deal of energy to initiate a new spark of life .     you ve often mentioned energy .  what is it .  exactly .     why  what we eat .     well  then  why don t you say food .     because food and energy aren t quite the same thing .  our food comes from the sun and that s a kind of energy  but there are other kinds of energy that are not food .  when we eat  we ve got to spread out and absorb the light .  it s hardest for emotionals because they re much more transparent  that is  the light tends to pass through instead of being absorbed      it was wonderful to have it explained  dua thought .  what she was told  she really knew  but she didn t know the proper words   the long science words that odeen knew .  and it made sharper and more meaningful everything that happened .   occasionally now  in adult life  when she no longer feared that childish teasing  when she shared in the prestige of being part of the odeen triad  she tried to swarm with other emotionals and to withstand the chatter and the crowding .  after all  she did occasionally feel like a more substantial meal than she usually got and it did make for better melting .  there was a joy   sometimes she almost caught the pleasure the others got out of it   in slithering and maneuvering for exposure to sunlight  in the luxurious contraction and condensation to absorb the warmth through greater thickness with greater efficiency .   yet for dua a little of that went quite a way and the others never seemed to have enough .  there was a kind of gluttonous wiggle about them that dua could not duplicate and that  at length  she could not endure .   that was why rationals and parentals were so rarely on the surface .  their thickness made it possible for them to eat quickly and leave .  emotionals writhed in the sun for hours  for though they ate more slowly  they actually needed more energy than the others   at least for melting .   the emotional supplied the energy  odeen had explained  pulsing so that his signals were barely understood   the rational the seed  the parental the incubator .   once dua understood that  a certain amusement began to blend with her disapproval when she watched the other emotionals virtually slurp up the ruddy sunlight .  since they never asked questions  she was sure they didn t know why they did it and couldn t understand that there was an obscene side to their quivering condensations  or to the way in which they went tittering down below eventually   on their way to a good melt  of course  with lots of energy to spare .   she could also stand tritt s annoyance when she would come down without that swirling opacity that meant a good gorging .  yet why should they complain .  the thinness she retained meant a defter melting .  not as sloppy and glutinous as the other triads managed  perhaps  but it was the ethereality that counted  she felt sure .  and the little left and little right came eventually  didn t they .   of course  it was the baby emotional  the little mid  that was the crux .  that took more energy than the other two and dua never had enough .   even odeen was beginning to mention it .   you re not getting enough sunlight  dua .     yes i am   said dua  hastily .    genia s triad   said odeen   has just initiated an emotional .    dua didn t like genia .  she never had .  she was empty headed even by emotional standards .  dua said  loftily   i suppose she s boasting about it .  she has no delicacy .  i suppose she s saying   i shouldn t mention it  my dear  but you ll never guess what my left ling and right ling have gone and went and done       she imitated genia s tremulous signaling with deadly accuracy and odeen was amused .   but then he said   genia may be a dunder  but she has initiated an emotional  and tritt is upset about it .  we ve been at it for much longer than they have      dua turned away .   i get all the sun i can stand .  i do it till i m too full to move .  i don t know what you want of me .    odeen said   don t be angry .  i promised tritt i would talk to you .  he thinks you listen to me       oh  tritt just thinks it s odd that you explain science to me .  he doesn t understand    do you want a mid ling like the others .     no   said odeen  seriously .   you re not like the others  and i m glad of it .  and if you re interested in rational talk  then let me explain something .  the sun doesn t supply the food it used to in ancient times .  the light energy is less  and it takes longer exposures .  the birth rate has been dropping for ages and the world s population is only a fraction of what it once was .     i can t help it   said dua  rebelliously .    the hard ones may be able to .  their numbers have been decreasing  too       do they pass on .   dua was suddenly interested .  she always thought they were immortal somehow  that they weren t born  that they didn t die .  who had ever seen a baby hard one  for instance .  they didn t have babies .  they didn t melt .  they didn t eat .   odeen said  thoughtfully   i imagine they pass on .  they never talk about themselves to me .  i m not even sure how they eat  but of course they must .  and be born .  there s a new one  for instance  i haven t seen him yet    but never mind that .  the point is that they ve been developing an artificial food       i know   said dua .   i ve tasted it .     you have .  i didn t know that .     a bunch of the emotionals talked about it they said a hard one was asking for volunteers to taste it and the sillies were all afraid .  they said it would probably turn them permanently hard and they would never be able to melt again .     that s foolish   said odeen  vehemently .    i know .  so i volunteered .  that shut them up .  they are so hard to endure  odeen .     how was it .     horrible   said dua  vehemently .   harsh and bitter .  of course i didn t tell the other emotionals that .    odeen said   i tasted it .  it wasn   t that bad .     rationals and parentals don t care what food tastes like .    but odeen said   it s still only experimental .  they re working hard on improvements  the hard ones are .  especially estwald   that s the one i mentioned before  the new one i haven t seen   he s working on it .  losten speaks of him now and then as though he s something special  a very great scientist .     how is it you ve never seen him .     i m just a soft one .  you don t suppose they show me and tell me everything  do you .  someday i ll see him  i suppose .  he s developed a new energy source which may save us all yet       i don t want artificial food   said dua  and she had left odeen abruptly .   that had been not so long ago  and odeen had not mentioned this estwald again  but she knew he would  and she brooded about it up here in the sunset .   she had seen that artificial food that once  a glowing sphere of light  like a tiny sun  in a special cavern set up by the hard ones .  she could taste its bitterness yet .   would they improve it .  would they make it taste better .  even delicious .  and would she have to eat it then and fill herself with it till the full sensation gave her an almost uncontrollable desire to melt .   she feared that self generating desire .  it was different when the desire came through the hectic combined stimulation of left ling and right ling .  it was the self generation that meant she would be ripe to bring about the initiation of a little mid .  and   and she didn t want to .   it was a long time before she would admit the truth to herself .  she didn t  want to initiate an emotional .  it was after the three children were all born that the time would inevitably come to pass on  and she didn t want to .  she remembered the day her parental had left her forever  and it was never going to be like that for her .  of that she was fiercely determined  the other emotionals didn t care because they were too empty to think about it  but she was different .  she was queer dua  the left em  that was what they had called her  and she would be different .  as long as she didn t have that third child  she would not pass on  she would continue to live   so she wasn t going to have that third child .  never .  never .   but how was she going to stave it off .  and how would she keep odeen from finding out .  what if odeen found out .        b      odeen waited for tritt to do something .  he was reasonably sure that tritt would not actually go up to the surface after dua .  it would mean leaving the children and that was always hard for tritt to do .  tritt waited  without speaking for a while  and when he left  it was in the direction of the children s alcove .   odeen was almost glad when tritt left .  not quite  of course  for tritt had been angry and withdrawn so that interpersonal contact had weakened and the barrier of displeasure had arisen .  odeen could not help but be melancholy at that .  it was like the slowing of the life pulse .  he sometimes wondered if tritt felt it  too .  .  .  .  no  that was unfair .  tritt had the special relationship with the children .   and as for dua  who could tell what dua felt .  who could tell what any emotional felt .  they were so different they made left and right seem alike in everything but mind .  but even allowing for the erratic way of emotionals  who could tell what dua   especially dua   felt .   that was why odeen managed to be almost glad when tritt left  for dua was the question .  the delay in initiating the third child was indeed becoming too long and dua was growing less amenable to persuasion  not more .  there was a growing restlessness in odeen himself  that he could not quite identify  and it was something he would have to discuss with losten .   he made his way down to the hard caverns  hastening his movements into a continuous flow that was not nearly as undignified as the oddly exciting mixture of wavering and rushing that marked the emotional curve along  or as amusing as the stolid weight shift of the parental      he had the keen thought image of tritt clumping in pursuit of the baby rational  who  of course  was almost as slippery  at his age  as an emotional  and of dua having to block the baby and bring him back  and of tritt cluckingly undecided whether to shake the small life object or enfold him with his substance .  from the start  tritt could thin himself more effectively for the babies than for odeen and when odeen rallied him about that  tritt answered gravely  for of course he had no humor about such things   ah  but the children need it more .     odeen was selfishly pleased with his own flow and thought it graceful and impressive .  he had mentioned that once to losten  to whom as his hard teacher  he confessed everything  and losten had said   but don t you think an emotional or a parental feels the same about his own flow pattern .  if each of you think differently and act differently  ought you not to be pleased differently .  a triad doesn t preclude individuality  you know .    odeen wasn t sure he understood about individuality .  did that mean being alone .  a hard one was alone  of course .  there were no triads among them .  how did they stand it .   odeen had still been quite young when the matter had come up .  his relationship with the hard ones had only been beginning  and it suddenly struck him that he wasn t sure that there were no triads among them .  that fact was common legend among the soft ones  but how correct was the legend .  odeen thought about that and decided one must ask and not accept matters on faith .   odeen had said   are you a left or a right  sir .    in later times  odeen pulsed at the memory of that question .  how incredibly naive to have asked it  and it was very little comfort that every rational asked the question of a hard one in some fashion  sooner or later   usually sooner .    losten answered quite calmly   neither  little left .  there are no lefts or rights among the hard ones     or mid      emotionals .     or mid lings .   and the hard one changed the shape of his permanent sensory region in a fashion that odeen eventually associated with amusement or pleasure .   no .  no mid lings either .  just hard ones of one kind .    odeen had to ask .  it came out involuntarily  quite against his desire .   but how do you stand it .     it is different with us  little left .  we are used to it .    could odeen be used to such a thing .  there was the parental triad that had filled his life so far and the sure knowledge that he would at some not too distant time form a triad of his own .  what was life without that .  he thought about it hard now and then .  he though about everything hard  as it came up .  sometimes he managed to catch a glimpse of what it might mean .  that hard ones had only themselves  neither left brother  nor right brother  nor mid sister  nor melting  nor children  nor parentals .  they had only the mind  only the inquiry into the universe .   perhaps that was enough for them .  as odeen grew older  he caught bits of understanding as to the joys of inquiry .  they were almost enough   almost enough   and then he would think of tritt and of dua and decide that even all the universe beside was not quite enough .   unless    it was odd  but every once in a while it seemed that there might come a time  a situation  a condition  when    then he would lose the momentary glimpse  or  rather  glimpse of a glimpse  and miss it all .  yet in time it would return and lately he thought it grew stronger and would remain almost long enough to be caught .   but none of that was what should involve him now .  he had to see about dua .  he made his way along the well known route  along which he had first been taken by his parental  as tritt would soon take their own young rational  their own baby left .    and  of course  he was instantly lost in memory again .   it had been frightening  then .  there had been other young rationals  all pulsing and shimmering and changing shape  despite the parental signals on every side to stay firm and smooth and not disgrace the triad .  one small left  a playmate of odeen  had  in fact  flattened thin  baby fashion  and would not unflatten  despite all the efforts of his horribly embarrassed parental .   he had since become a perfectly normal student .   .   .  .  though no odeen  as odeen himself could not help realizing with considerable complacency .    they met a number of hard ones on that first day of school .  they stopped at each  in order that the young rational vibration pattern might be recorded in several specialized ways and for a decision to be reached as to whether to accept them for instruction then  or to wait another interval  and if then  for what kind of instruction .   odeen  in a desperate effort  had drawn himself smooth as a hard one approached  and held himself unwavering .   the hard one said  and the first sound of the odd tones of his voice almost undid odeen s determination to be grown up    this is quite a firm held rational .  how do you represent yourself  left .    it was the first time odeen had ever been called  left  instead of in the form of some diminutive  and he felt firmer than ever as he managed to say   odeen  hard sir  using the polite address his parental had carefully taught him .   dimly  odeen remembered being taken through the hard caverns  with their equipment  their machinery  their libraries  their meaningless  crowding sights and sounds .  more than  the actual sense perceptions  he remembered his inner feeling of despair .  what would they do with him .  his parental had told him that he would learn  but he didn t know what was really meant by  learn  and when he asked his parental  it turned out that the older one didn t know either .   it took him a while to find out and the experience was pleasurable  so pleasurable  and yet net without its worrisome aspects .   the hard one who had first called him  left  was his first teacher .  the hard one taught him to interpret the wave recordings so that after a while what seemed an incomprehensible code became words  words just as clear as those he could form with his own vibrations .   but then that first one didn t appear any more and an   other hard one took over .  it was a time before odeen noticed .  it was difficult in those early days to tell one hard one from another  to differentiate among their voices .  but then he grew certain .  little by little  he grew certain and he trembled at the change .  he didn t understand its significance .   he gathered courage and finally asked   where is my teacher  hard sir .     gamaldan .   .  .  .  he will no longer be with you  left .   odeen was speechless for a moment .  then he said   but hard ones don t pass on     he did not quite finish the phrase .  it choked off .   the new hard one was passive  said nothing  volunteered nothing .   it was always to be like that  odeen found out .  they never talked about themselves .  on every other subject they discoursed freely .  concerning themselves   nothing .   from dozens of pieces of evidence  odeen could not help but decide that hard ones passed on  that they were not immortal  something so many soft ones took for granted  .  yet no hard one ever said as much .  odeen and the other student rationals sometimes discussed it  hesitantly  uneasily .  each brought in some small item that pointed inexorably to mortality of the hard ones and wondered and did not like to conclude the obvious  so they let it go .   the hard ones did not seem to mind that hints of mortality existed .  they did nothing to mask it .  but they never mentioned it  either .  and if the question was asked directly  sometimes it was  inevitably  they never answered  neither denying nor affirming .   and if they passed on  they had to be born  also  yet they said nothing of that and odeen never saw a young hard one .   odeen believed the hard ones got their energy from rocks instead of from the sun   at least that they incorporated a powdered black rock into their bodies .  some of the other students thought so  too .  others  rather vehemently  refused to accept that .  nor could they come to a conclusion for no one ever saw them feeding in any way and the hard ones never spoke of that either .   in the end  odeen took their reticence for granted   as part of themselves .  perhaps  he thought  it was their individuality  the fact that they formed no triads .  it built a shell about them .   and then  too  odeen learned things of such grave import that questions concerning the private life of the hard ones turned to trivia in any case .  he learned  for instance  that the whole world was shriveling   dwindling     it was losten  the new teacher  who told him that .   odeen had asked about the unoccupied caverns that stretched so endlessly into the bowels of the world and losten had seemed pleased .   are you afraid to ask about that  odeen .     he was odeen now  not some general reference to his left hood .  it was always a source of pride to hear a hard one address him by personal name .  many did so .  odeen was a prodigy of understanding and the use of his name seemed a recognition of the fact .  more than once losten had expressed satisfaction at having him as a pupil .    odeen was indeed afraid and  after some hesitation  said so .  it was always easier to confess shortcomings to the hard ones than to fellow rationals  much easier than to confess   them to tritt  unthinkable to confess them to tritt .   .   .   .  those were the days before dua .    then why do you ask .    odeen hesitated again .  then he said slowly .   i m afraid of the unoccupied caverns because when i was young i was told they had all sorts of monstrous things in them .  but i know nothing of that directly  i only know what i have been told by other young ones who couldn t have known directly either  i want to find out the truth about them and the wanting has grown until there is more of curiosity in me than fear .    losten looked pleased .   good .  the curiosity is useful  the fear useless .  your inner development is excellent  odeen  and remember it is only your inner development that counts in the important things .  our help to you is marginal .  since you want to know  it is easy to tell you that the unoccupied caverns are truly unoccupied .  they are empty .  there is nothing in them but the unimportant things left behind in times past .     left behind by whom  hard sir .   odeen felt uneasily compelled to use the honorific whenever he was too obviously in the presence of knowledge he lacked that the other had .    by those who occupied them in times past .  there was a time thousands of cycles ago when there were many thousands of hard ones and millions of soft ones .  there are fewer of us now than there were in the past  odeen .  nowadays there are not quite three hundred hard ones and fewer than ten thousand soft ones .     why .   said odeen  shocked .   .  only three  hundred hard ones left .  this was surely an open admission that hard ones passed on  but this was not the time to think of that .     because energy is diminishing .  the sun is cooling .  it  . becomes harder in every cycle to give birth and to live .     well  then  did not that mean the hard ones gave birth  too .  and did it mean that the hard ones depended on the sun for food  too  and not on rocks .  odeen filed the thought away and dismissed it for now .     will this continue .   odeen asked .    the sun must dwindle to an end  odeen  and someday give no food .     does that mean that all of us  the hard ones and the soft ones  too  will pass on .     what else can it mean .     we can t all pass on .  if we need energy and the sun is coming to an end  we must find other sources .  other stars .     but   odeen  all the stars are coming to an end .  the universe is coming to an end .     if the stars come to an end  is there no food elsewhere .  no other source of energy .     no  all the energy sources in all the universe are coming to an end .    odeen considered that rebelliously  then said   then other universes .  we can t give up just because the universe does .   he was palpitating as he said it .  he had expanded with quite unforgivable discourtesy until he had swelled translucently into a size distinctly larger than the hard one .   but losten merely expressed extreme pleasure .  he said   wonderful  my left dear .  the others must hear of this .    odeen had collapsed to normal size in mingled embarrassment and pleasure at hearing himself addressed as  left dear   a phrase he had never heard anyone use to him   except tritt  of course .   it had not been very long after that that liston himself had brought them dua .  odeen had wondered  idly  if there had been any connection  but after a while wonder burned itself out .  tritt had repeated so often that it was his own approach to losten that had brought them dua  that odeen gave up thinking about it .  it was too confusing .   but now he was coming to losten again .  a long time had passed since those earlier days when he first learned that the universe was coming to an end and that  as it turned out  the hard ones were resolutely laboring to live on anyway .  he himself had become adept in many fields and losten confessed that in physics there was little he could any longer teach odeen that a soft one could profitably learn .  and there were other young rationals to take in hand  so he did not see losten as frequently as he once did .   odeen found losten with two half grown rationals in the radiation chamber .  losten saw him at once through the glass and came out  closing the door carefully behind him .    my left dear   he said  holding out his limbs in a gesture of friendship  so that odeen  as so often in the past  experienced a perverse desire to touch  but controlled it  .   how are you .     i did not mean to interrupt  losten sir .     interrupt .  those two will get along perfectly well by themselves for a time .  they are probably glad to see me go  for i am sure i weary them with over much talk .     nonsense   said odeen .   you always fascinated me and i m sure you fascinate them .     well  well .  it is good of you to say so .  i see you frequently in the library  and i hear from others that you do well in your advanced courses  and that makes me miss my best student .  how is tritt .  is he as parentally stubborn in his ways as ever .     more stubborn every day .  he gives strength to the triad .     and dua .     dua .  i have come    she is very unusual  you know .    losten nodded   yes  i know that .   his expression was one that odeen had grown to associate with melancholy .   odeen waited a moment  then decided to tackle the matter directly .  he said   losten sir  was she brought to us  to tritt and myself  just because she was unusual .    losten said   would you be surprised .  you are very unusual yourself  odeen  and you have told me on a number of occasions that tritt is .     yes   said odeen  with conviction .   he is .     then oughtn t your triad include an unusual emotional .     there are many ways of being unusual   said odeen  thoughtfully .   in some ways  dua s odd ways displease tritt and worry me .  may i consult you .     always .     she is not fond of   of melting .    losten listened gravely  to all appearances unembarrassed .   odeen went on .   she is fond of melting when we melt  that is  but it is not always easy to persuade her to do so .    losten said   how does tritt feel about melting .  i mean  aside from the immediate pleasure of the act .  what does it mean to him besides pleasure .     the children  of course   said odeen .   i like them and dua likes them  too  but tritt is the parental .  do you understand that .    it suddenly seemed to odeen that losten couldn t possibly understand all the subtleties of the triad .     i try to understand   said losten .   it seems to me  then  that tritt gets more out of melting than melting alone .  and how about yourself .  what do you get out of it besides the pleasure .    odeen considered .   i think you know that a kind of mental stimulation .     yes  i know that  but i want to make sure you know .  i want to make sure you haven t forgotten .  you have told me often that when you come out of a period of melting  with its odd loss of time   during which i admit i sometimes didn t see you for rather long periods   that suddenly you found yourself understanding many things that had seemed obscure before .     it was as though my mind remained active in the interval   said odeen .   it was as though there was time which  even though i was unaware of its passing and unconscious of my existence  was necessary to me  during which i could think more deeply and intensely  without the distraction of the less intellectual side of life .     yes   agreed losten   and you d come back with a quantum jump in understanding .  it is a common thing among you rationals  though i must admit no one improved in such great jumps as you did .  i honestly think no rational in history did so .     really .   said odeen  trying not to seem unduly elated .    on the other hand  i may be wrong    and losten seemed slightly amused at the other s sudden loss of shimmer    but never mind that .  the point is that you  like tritt  get something out of the melt beside the melt itself .     yes .  most certainly .     and what does dua get out of the melt besides the melt .    there was a long pause .   i don t know   said odeen .    have you never asked her .     never .     but then   said losten   if all she gets out of a melt is the melt  and if you and tritt get out of it the melt plus something else  why should she be as eager for it as you two are .     other emotionals don t seem to require     began odeen  defensively .    other emotionals aren t like dua .  you ve told me that often enough and  i think  with satisfaction .    odeen felt ashamed .   i had thought it might be something else .     what might that be .     it s hard to explain .  we know each other in the triad  we sense each other  in some ways  all three of us are part of a single individual .  a misty individual that comes and goes .  mostly it s unconscious .  if we think about it with too great a concentration  we lose it  so we can never get real detail .  we     odeen stopped rather hopelessly .   it s hard to explain the triad to someone       nevertheless  i am trying to understand .  you think you have caught a portion of dua s inner mind  something she has tried to keep secret  is that it .     i m not sure .  it is the vaguest impression  sensed with a corner of my mind just now and then .     well .     i sometimes think dua doesn t want to have a baby emotional .    losten looked at him gravely .   you only have two children so far  i think .  a little left and a little right .     yes  only two .  the emotional is difficult to initiate  you know .     i know .     and dua will not trouble to absorb the necessary energy .  or even try to .  she has any number of reasons but i can t believe any of them .  it seems to me that for some reason she just doesn t want an emotional .  for myself   if dua really didn t want one for a while   well  i would let her have her way .  but tritt is a parental  and he wants one  he must have one  and somehow i can t disappoint tritt  not even for dua .     if dua had some rational cause for not wanting to initiate an emotional  would that make a difference with you .     with me  certainly  but not with tritt .  he doesn t understand such things .     but would you labor to keep him patient .     yes  i would  for as long as i could .    losten said   has it occurred to you that hardly any soft ones    here he hesitated as though searching for a word and then he used the customary soft one phrase     ever pass on before the children are born   all three  with the baby emotional last .     yes  i know .   odeen wondered how losten could possibly think him ignorant of so elementary a bit of knowledge .    then the birth of a baby emotional is equivalent to the coming of time to pass on .     usually  not till the emotional is old enough       but the time for passing on will be coming .  might it not be that dua does not want to pass on .     how can that be  losten .  when the time comes to pass on  it is as when the time comes to melt .  how can you not want to .    hard ones didn t melt  perhaps they didn t understand .     suppose dua simply wants never to pass on .  what would you then say .     why  that we must pass on eventually .  if dua merely wants to delay the last baby  i might humor her and even persuade tritt to  perhaps .  if she wants never to have it    that simply cannot be allowed .     why so .    odeen paused to think it out .   i can t say  losten sir  but i know we must pass on .  i know it more and feel it more with each cycle  and sometimes i almost think i understand why .     you are a philosopher  i sometimes think  odeen   said losten dryly .   let s consider .  by the time the third baby comes and grows  tritt will have had all his children and can look forward to passing on after a fulfilled life .  you yourself will have had the satisfaction of much learning and you  too  can pass on after a fulfilled life .  but dua .     i don   t know  said odeen  wretchedly .   other emotionals cling together all lifelong and seem to get some pleasure out of chattering with each other .  dua  however  will not do that .     well  she is unusual .  is there nothing she likes .     she likes to listen to me talk about my work   mumbled odeen .   losten said   well  don t be ashamed of that  odeen .  every rational talks about his work to his right and his mid .  you all pretend you don t  but you all do .    odeen said   but dua listens  losten sir .     i m quite sure she does .  not like other emotionals .  and does it ever seem to you that she understands rather better after a melt .     yes  i have noticed that at times .  i didn t particularly pay any attention  though       because you are sure emotionals can t really understand these things .  but there seems to be considerable of the rational in dua .     odeen looked up at losten with sudden consternation .  once dua had told him of her childhood unhappiness  only once  of the shrill calls of the other emotionals  of the filthy name they had called her   left em .  had losten heard of that  somehow .   .   .   .  but he was only looking calmly at odeen .    odeen said   i have sometimes thought that  too .   then he burst out   i am proud of her for that     nothing wrong with that   said losten .   why not tell her so .  and if she likes to pamper the rationalness in herself  why not let her .  teach her what you know more intensively .  answer her questions .  will it disgrace your triad to do that .     i don t care if it does .  .  .  .  and why should it  anyway .  tritt will think it a waste of time  but i ll handle him .     explain to him that if dua gets more out of life and a truer sense of fulfillment  she might not have the fear of passing on that she now has and might be more ready to have a baby emotional .    it was as though an enormous feeling of impending disaster had been lifted from odeen .  he said  hurriedly   you re right .  i feel you re right .  losten sir  you understand so much .  with you leading the hard ones  how can we fail to continue succeeding in the other universe project .     with me .   losten was amused .   you forget it is estwald who is guiding us now .  he is the real hero of the project .  it would be nowhere without him .     oh  yes   said odeen  momentarily discomfited .  he had never yet seen estwald .  in fact  he had not yet met a soft one who had actually met him though some reported having seen him in the distance now and then .  estwald was a new hard one  new  at least  in the sense that when odeen had been young  he had never heard him mentioned .  didn t that mean that estwald was a young hard one  had been a child hard one when odeen had been a child soft one .   but never mind that .  right now  odeen wanted to get back home .  he couldn t touch losten in gratitude  but he could thank him again and then hasten away joyfully .   there was a selfish component to his joy .  it was not just the distant prospect of the baby emotional and the thought of tritt s pleasure .  it was not even the thought of dua s fulfillment .  what counted with him at this very moment was the immediate gleeful prospect ahead .  he was going to be able to teach .  no other rational could feel the pleasure of so doing  he was sure  for no other rational could possibly have an emotional like dua as part of the triad .   it would be wonderful  if only tritt could be made to understand the necessity .  he would have to talk to tritt  somehow persuade him to be patient .        c      tritt had never felt less patient .  he did not pretend to understand why dua acted the way she did .  he did not want to try .  .  he  did not care .  he never knew why emotionals did what they did .  and dua didn t even act like the other emotionals .   she never thought about the important thing .  she would look at the sun .  but then she would thin out so that the light and food would just pass through her .  then she would say it was beautiful .  that was not the important thing .  the important thing was to eat .  what was beautiful about eating .  what was beautiful .   she always wanted to melt differently .  once she said   let s talk first .  we never talk about it .  we never think about it .    odeen would always say   let her have her way about it  tritt .  it makes it better .    odeen was always patient .  he always thought things would be better when they waited .  or else he would want to think it out .   tritt wasn t sure he knew what odeen meant by  think it out .   it seemed to him it just meant that odeen did nothing .   like getting dua in the first place .  odeen would still be thinking it out .  tritt went right up and asked .  that was the way to be .   now odeen wouldn t do anything about dua .  what about the baby emotional  which was what mattered .  well  tritt would do something about it  if odeen didn t .   in fact  he was doing something .  he was edging down the long corridor even as all this was going through his mind .  he was hardly aware he had come this far .  was this  thinking it out  .  well  he would not let himself be frightened .  he would not back away .   stolidly  he looked about him .  this was the way to the hard caverns .  he knew he would be going that way with his little left before very long .  he had been shown the way by odeen once .   he did not know what he would do when he got there this time .  still  he felt no fright at all .  he wanted a baby emotional .  it was his right to have a baby emotional .  nothing was more important than that .  the hard ones would see he got one .  hadn t they brought them dua when he had asked .   but who would he ask .  could it be any hard one .  dimly  he had made up his mind not any hard one .  there was the name of one he would ask for .  then he would talk to him about it .   he remembered the name .  he even remembered when he had first heard the name .  it was the time when the little left had grown old enough to begin changing shape voluntarily .   what a great day .   come  odeen  quickly .  annis is all oval and hard .  all by himself  too .  dua  look .   and they had rushed in .  annis was the only child then .  they had had to wait so long for the second .  so they rushed in and he was just plastered in the corner .  he was curling at himself and flowing over his resting place like wet clay .  odeen had left because he was busy .  but said   oh  he ll do it again  tritt  they had watched for hours and he didn t .    tritt was hurt that odeen hadn t waited .  he would have scolded but odeen looked so weary .  there were definite wrinkles in his ovoid .  and he made no effort to smooth them out .   tritt said anxiously   is anything wrong  odeen .     a hard day and i m not sure i m going to get differential equations before the next melting .    tritt didn t remember the exact hard words .  it was something like that odeen always used hard words .      do you want to melt now .     oh  no .  i just saw dua heading topside and you know how she is if we try to interrupt that .  there s no rush  really .  there s a new hard one  too .     a new hard one .   said tritt  with distinct lack of interest .  odeen found sharp interest in associating with hard ones  but tritt wished the interest didn t exist odeen was more intent on what he called his education than any other rational in the area .  that was unfair .  odeen was too wrapped up in that .  dua was too wrapped up in roaming the surface alone .  no one was properly interested in the triad but tritt .    he s called estwald   said odeen .    estwald .   tritt did feel a twinge of interest .  perhaps it was because he was anxiously sensing odeen s feelings .    i ve never seen him  but they ail talk about him .   odeen s eyes had flattened out as they usually did when he turned introspective .   he s responsible for that new thing they ve got .     what new thing .     the positron pu    you wouldn t understand  tritt it s a new thing they have .  it s going to revolutionize the whole world .     what s revolutionize .     make everything different .    tritt was at once alarmed .   they mustn t make everything different .     they ll make everything better .  different isn t always worse .  anyway  estwald is responsible .  he s very bright .  i get the feeling .     then why don t you like him .     i didn t say i didn t like him .     you feel as though you don t like him .     oh  nothing of the sort  tritt .  it s just that somehow    somehow     odeen laughed .   i m jealous .  hard ones are so intelligent that a soft one is nothing in comparison  but i got used to that  because losten was always telling me how bright i was   for a soft one  i suppose .  but now this estwald comes along  and even losten seems lost in admiration  and i   m really nothing .    tritt bellied out his foreplane to have it just make contact with odeen  who looked up and smiled .   but that s just stupidity on my part .  who cares how smart a hard one is .  not one of them has a tritt .    after that they both went looking for dua after all .  for a wonder  she had finished wandering about and was just heading down again .  it was a very good melting though the time lapse was only a day or so .  tritt worried about meltings then .  with annis so small  even a short absence was risky  though there were always other parentals who could take over .   after that  odeen mentioned estwald now and then .  he always called him  the new one  even after considerable time had passed .  he still had never seen him .     think i avoid him   he said one time  when dua was with them   because he knows so much about the new device .  i don t want to find out too soon .  it s too much fun to learn .     the positron pump .   dua had asked      that was another funny thing about dua .  tritt thought .  it annoyed him .  she could say the hard words almost as well as odeen could .  an emotional shouldn t be like that .   so tritt made up his mind to ask estwald because odeen had said he was smart .  besides  odeen had never seen him .  estwald couldn t say   i ve talked to odeen about it  tritt  and you mustn t worry .    everyone thought that if you talked to the rational  you were talking to the triad .  nobody paid attention to the parentals .  but they would have to this time .   he was in the hard caverns and everything seemed different .  there was nothing there that looked like anything tritt could understand .  it was all wrong and frightening .  still  he was too anxious to see estwald to let himself really be frightened .  he said to himself   i want my little mid .   that made him feel firm enough to walk forward .   he saw a hard one finally .  there was just this one  doing something  bending over something  doing something .  odeen once told him that hard ones were always working at their   whatever it was .  tritt didn t remember and didn t care .   he moved smoothly up and stopped .   hard sir   he said .   the hard one looked up at him and the air vibrated about him  the odeen said it did when two hard ones talked to each other sometimes .  then the hard one seemed really to see tritt and said   why  it s a right .  what is your business here .  do you have your little left with you .  is today the start of a semester .    tritt ignored it all .  he said   where can i find estwald  sir .  .     find whom .     estwald .    the hard one was silent for a long moment .  then he said   what is your business with estwald  right .    tritt felt stubborn .   it is important i speak to him .  are you estwald  hard sir .     no  i am not .  .  .  .  what is your name  right .     tritt  hard sir .     i see .  you re the right of odeen s triad  aren t you .     yes .    the hard one s voice seemed to soften .   i m afraid you can t see estwald at the moment .  he s not here .  if anyone else can help you .    tritt didn t know what to say .  he simply stood there .   the hard one said   you go home now .  talk to odeen .  he ll help you .  yes .  go home  right .    the hard one turned away .  he seemed very concerned in matters other than tritt  and tritt still stood there  uncertain .  then he moved into another section quietly  flowing noiselessly .  the hard one did not look up .   tritt was not certain at first why he had moved in that particular direction .  at first  he felt only that it was good to do so .  then it was clear .  there was a thin warmth of food about him and he was nibbling at it .   he had not been conscious of hunger  yet now he was eating and enjoying .   the sun was nowhere .  instinctively  he looked up  but of course he was in a cavern .  yet the food was better than he had ever found it to be on the surface .  he looked about  wondering .  he wondered  most of all  that he should be wondering .   he had sometimes been impatient with odeen because odeen wondered about so many things that didn t matter .  now he himself   tritt .    was wondering .  but what he was wondering about did matter .  suddenly  he saw that it did matter .  with an almost blinding flash he realized that he wouldn t wonder unless something inside him told it did matter .   he acted quickly  marveling at his own bravery .  after a while  he retraced his steps .  he moved past the hard one again  the one to whom he had earlier spoken .  he said   i am going home  hard sir .    the hard one merely said something incoherent .  he was still doing something  bending over something  doing silly things and not seeing the important thing .   if hard ones were so great and powerful and smart  tritt thought  how could they be so stupid .        a      dua found herself drifting toward the hard caverns .  partly it was because it was something to do now that the sun had set  something to keep her from returning home for an additional period of time  something to delay having to listen to the importunities of tritt and the half embarrassed  half resigned suggestions of odeen .  partly  too  it was the attraction they held for her in themselves .   she had felt that for a long time  ever since she was little in fact  and had given up trying to pretend it wasn t so .  emotionals weren t supposed to feel such attractions .  sometimes little emotionals did   dua was old enough and experienced enough to know that   but this quickly faded or they were quickly discouraged if it didn t fade quickly enough .   when she herself had been a child  though  she had continued stubbornly curious about the world  and the sun  and the caverns  and   anything at all    till her parental would say   you re a queer one  dua  dear .  you re a funny little midling .  what will become of you .    she hadn t the vaguest notion at first of what was so queer and so funny about wanting to know .  she found  quickly enough  that her parental could not answer her questions .  she once tried her left father  but he showed none of her parental   s soft puzzlement .  he snapped   why do you ask  dua .   and his look seemed harshly inquiring .   she ran away  frightened  and did not ask him again .   but then one day another emotional of her own age had shrieked  left em  at her after she had said   she no longer remembered   it had been something that had seemed natural to her at the time .  dua had been abashed without knowing why and had asked her considerably older left brother  what a left em was .  he had withdrawn  embarrassed   clearly embarrassed   mumbling   i don t know   when it was obvious he did .   after some thought  she went to her parental and said   am i a left em  daddy .    and he had said   who called you that  dua .  you must not repeat such words .    she flowed herself about his near corner  thought about it awhile  and said   is it bad .    he said   you ll grow out of it   and let himself bulge a bit to make her swing outward and vibrate in the game she had always loved .  she somehow didn t love it now  for it was quite clear that he hadn t answered her  really .  she moved away thoughtfully .  he had said   you ll grow out of it   so she was in it now  but in what .   even then  she had had few real mends among the other emotionals .  they liked to whisper and giggle together  but she preferred flowing over the crumbled rocks and enjoying the sensation of their roughness .  there were  however  some raids who were more friendly than others and whom she found less provoking .  there was doral  who was as silly as the rest  really  but who would sometimes chatter amusingly .   doral had grown up to join a triad with dua s right brother and a young left from another cavern complex  a left whom dua did not particularly like .  doral had then gone on to initiate a baby left  a baby right  in rapid succession  and a baby mid not too long after that .  she had also grown so dense that the triad looked as though it had two parentals and dua wondered if they could still melt .   .   .   .  just the same tritt was always telling her  pointedly  what a good triad doral helped make up .    she and doral had sat alone one day and dua had whispered   doral  do you know what a left em is .    and doral had tittered and compressed herself  as though to avoid being seen  and had said   it s an emotional that acts like a rational  you know  like a left .  get it .  left emotional   left em .  get it .    of course dua  got  the phrase .  it was obvious once explained .  she would have seen it for herself at once if she had been able to bring herself to imagine such a state of affairs .   dua said   how do you know .     the older girls told me .   doral s substance swirled and dua found the motion unpleasant .   it s dirty   doral said .    why .   asked dua .    because it   s dirty .  emotionals shouldn t act like rationals .    dua had never thought about the possibility  but now she did .  she said     why shouldn t they .     because .  you want to know something else that s dirty .    dua couldn t help being intrigued .   what .    doral didn t say anything  but a portion of herself expanded suddenly and brushed against the unsuspecting dua before the latter could concavize .  dua didn t like it she shrank away and said   don t do that .     you know what else is dirty .  you can go into a rock .     no  you can t   said dua .  it had been a silly thing to say for dua had often moved through the outer surface of the rock and liked it .  but now in the context of doral   s snickering  she felt revolted and denied  the whole thing  even to herself .    yes  you can .  it s called rock rubbing .  emotionals can do it easy .  lefts and rights can only do it as babies .  when they grow up  they do it with each other .     i don t believe you .  you re making it up .     they do  i tell you .  do you know dimit .     no .     sure you do .  she s the girl with the thick corner from cavern c .     is she the one who flows funny .     yes .  on account of the thick corner .  that s the one .  she got into a rock all the way once   except for the thick corner .  she let her left brother watch her do it and he told their parental and what she got for that .  she never did it  dua left then  quite upset .  she didn t talk to doral again for a long time  and never really grew friendly again  and yet her curiosity had been aroused .   her curiosity .  why not say her left emmishness .   one day when she was quite sure her parental wasn t in the vicinity  she let herself melt into a rock  slowly  just a little .  it had been the first time she had tried it since she was quite young  and she didn t think she had ever dared go so deep .  there was a warmness about the sensation  but when she emerged she felt as though everyone could tell  as though the rock had left a stain on her .   she tried it again now and then  more boldly  and let herself enjoy it more .  she never sank in really deeply  of course .   eventually  she was caught by her parental  who clucked away in displeasure  and she was more careful after that .  she was older now and knew for certain fact that despite doral s snickering  it wasn t in the least uncommon .  practically every emotional did it now and then and some quite openly admitted it .   it happened less frequently as they grew older and dua didn t think that any emotional she knew ever did it after joining a triad and beginning the proper meltings .  it was one of her secrets  she never told anybody  that she had kept it up  and that once or twice she had tried it even after triad formation .   those few times she had thought  what if tritt found out .   .  .  .  somehow that seemed to present formidable consequences and rather spoiled the fun .    confusedly  she found excuses for this   to herself   in her ordeal with the others .  the cry of  left em  began to follow her everywhere in a kind of public humiliation .  there was one period in her life when she had been driven into an almost hermit like isolation to escape .  if she had begun with a liking for aloneness  that had confirmed it .  and being alone  she found consolation in the rocks .  rock rubbing  whether it was dirty or not  was a solitary act  and they were forcing her to be solitary .   at least  so she told herself .   she had tried to strike back once .  she had cried out   you re a bunch of right ems  a bunch of dirty right ems   at the taunting raids .   they had only laughed and dua had run away in confusion and frustration .  they were .  almost every emotional  when she was getting on to the age of triad formation  became interested in babies  fluttering about them in parental imitation which dua had found repulsive .  she herself had never felt such interest .  babies were only babies  they were for right brothers to worry about .   the name calling died as dua grew older .  it helped that she retained a girlishly rarefied structure and could flow with a smoky curl no other could duplicate .  and when  increasingly  lefts and rights showed interest in her  the other emotionals found it difficult to sneer .   and yet   and yet   now that no one ever dared speak disrespectfully to dua  for it was well known through all the caverns that odeen was the most prominent rational of the generation and dua was his mid ling   she herself knew that she was a left em past all redemption .   she didn t think it dirty   not really   but occasionally she caught herself wishing she were a rational and then she was abashed .  she wondered if other emotionals did    ever   or just once in a while   and if that was why   partly   she didn t want a baby emotional   because she wasn t a real emotional herself   and didn t fill her triad role properly     odeen hadn t minded her being a left em .  he never called her that   but he liked her interest in his life   he liked her questions and he would explain and he liked the way she could understand .  he even defended her when tritt grew jealous   well  not jealous  really   but filled with a feeling that it was all unfit in his stubborn and limited outlook on the world .   odeen had taken her to the hard caverns occasionally  eager to posture before dua  and openly pleased at the fact that dua was impressed .  and she was impressed  not so much with the clear fact of his knowledge and intelligence  but with the fact that he did not resent sharing it .   she remembered her left father s harsh response that one time she had questioned him .   she never loved odeen so much as when he let her share his life   and yet even that was part of her left emmishness .   perhaps  this had occurred to her over and over   by being left emmish  she moved closer to odeen and farther from tritt  and this was another reason tritt s importunities repelled her .  odeen had never hinted at anything like that  but perhaps tritt felt it vaguely and was unable to grasp it completely but did so well enough to be unhappy over it without being able to explain why .   the first time she was in a hard cavern she had heard two hard ones talking together .  she didn t know they were talking of course .  there was air vibration  very rapid  very changing  that made an unpleasant buzz deep inside her .  she had to rarefy and let it through .   odeen had said   they re talking .   then  hastily  anticipating the objection .     their kind of talk .  they understand each other .    dua had managed to grasp the concept .  it was all the more delightful to understand quickly because that pleased odeen so .   he once said   none of the other rationals i ve ever met have anything but an empty head for an emotional .  i m lucky .   she had said   but the other rationals seem to like empty heads .  why are you different from them  odeen .   odeen did not deny that the other rationals liked empty heads .  he just said   i ve never figured it out and i don t think it s important that i do .  i m pleased with you and i m pleased that i m pleased .     she said   can you understand hard one talk .     not really   said odeen .   i can t sense the changes fast enough .  sometimes i can get a feel for what they re saying  even without understanding  especially after we ve melted .  just sometimes  though .  getting feels like that is really an emotional trick  except even if an emotional does it  she can never make real sense out of what she s feeling .  you might  though .    dua demurred .   i d be afraid to .  they might not like it .     oh  go on .  i m curious .  see if you can tell what they re talking about .     shall i .  really .     go ahead .  if they catch you and are annoyed  i   ll say i made you do it .     promise .     i promise .    feeling rather fluttery  dua let herself reach out to the hard ones  and adopted the total passivity that allowed the influx of feelings .   she said   excitement .  they re excited .  someone new .    odeen said   maybe that s estwald .    it was the first time dua had heard the name .  she said   that s funny .     what s funny .     i have the feeling of a big sun .  a really big sun .    odeen looked thoughtful .   they might be talking about that .     but how can that be .    it was just at that time that the hard ones spied them .  they approached in a friendly manner and greeted them in soft one fashion of speech .  dua was horribly embarrassed and wondered if they knew she had been sensing them .  if they did  though  they said nothing .    odeen told her afterward that it was quite rare to come upon hard ones talking among themselves in their own fashion .  they always deferred to the soft ones and seemed always to suspend their own work when soft ones were there .   they like us so much   said odeen .   they are very kind .     once in awhile he would take her down to the hard caverns   usually when tritt was entirely wrapped up in the children .  nor did odeen go out of his way to tell tritt that he had taken dua down .  it was sure to evoke some response to the effect that odeen s coddling simply encouraged dua s reluctance to sun herself and just made the melting that much more ineffective .   .  .  .  it was hard to talk to tritt for more than five minutes without melting coming into the conversation .   she had even come down alone once or twice .  it had always frightened her a little to do so  though the hard ones she met were always friendly  always  very kind   as odeen said .  but they did not seem to take her seriously .  they were pleased  but somehow amused   she could feel that definitely   when she asked questions .  and when they answered it was in a simple way that carried no information .   just a machine  dua   they would say .   odeen might be able to tell you .    she wondered if she had met estwald .  she never quite dared ask the names of the hard ones she met  except losten  to whom odeen had introduced her  and of whom she heard a great deal  .  sometimes it seemed to her that this hard one or that might be he .  odeen talked about him with great awe and with some resentment .   she gathered that he was too engaged in work of the deepest importance to be in the caverns accessible to the soft ones .   she pieced together what odeen told her and  little by little  discovered that the world needed food badly .  odeen hardly ever called it  food .   he said  energy  instead  and said it was the hard one word for it .   the sun was fading and dying but estwald had discovered how to find energy far away  far beyond the sun  far beyond the seven stars that shone in the dark  night sky .   odeen said the seven stars were seven suns that were very distant  and that there were many other stars that were even more distant and were too dim to be seen .  tritt had heard him say that and had asked of what use it was for stars to exist if they couldn t be seen and he didn t believe a word of it .  odeen had said   now  tritt   in a patient way .  dua had been about to say something very like that which tritt had said  but changed her mind after that .    it looked  now  as  though there would be plenty of energy forever  plenty of food   at least as soon as estwald and the other hard ones learned to make the new energy taste right .   it had only been a few days ago when she had said to odeen   do you remember  long ago  when you took me to the hard caverns and i sensed the hard ones and said i caught the feeling of a big sun .    odeen looked puzzled for a moment .   i m not sure .  but go ahead  dua .  what about it .     i ve been thinking .  is the big sun the source of the new energy .    odeen had said  happily   that s good  dua .  it s not quite right  but that s such good intuition for an emotional .    and now dua had been moving slowly  rather moodily  during all this time of reveries .  without particularly noting the passage of either time or space she found herself in the hard caverns and was just beginning to wonder if she had really delayed all she safely could and whether she might not turn home now and face the inevitable annoyance of tritt when   almost as though the thought of tritt had brought it about   she sensed tritt  the sensation was so strong that there was only one confused moment in which she had thought that somehow she was picking up his feelings far away in the home cavern .  no .  he was here  down in the hard caverns with her .   but what could he be doing here .  was he pursuing her .  was he going to quarrel with her here .  was he foolishly going to appeal to the hard ones .  dua didn t think she could endure that     and then the feeling of cold horror left her and was replaced by astonishment .  tritt was not thinking of her at all .  he had to be unaware of her presence .  all she could sense about him was an overwhelming feeling of some sort of determination  mixed with fear and apprehension at something he would do .   dua might have penetrated farther and found out something  at least  about what it was he had done  and why  but nothing was further from her thoughts .  since tritt didn t know she was in the vicinity  she wanted to make sure of only one thing   that he continued not to know .   she did  then  almost in pure reflex  something that a moment before she would have sworn she would never dream of doing under any circumstances .   perhaps it was  she later thought  because of her idle reminiscences of that little girl talk with doral  or her memories of her own experiments with rock rubbing .   there was a complicated adult word for it but she found that word infinitely more embarrassing than the one all the children had used .    in any case  without quite knowing what she was doing or  for a short while afterward  what she had done  she simply flowed hastily into the nearest wall .   into it .  every bit of her .   the horror of what she had done was mitigated by the perfect manner in which it accomplished its purpose .  tritt passed by within almost touching distance and remained completely unaware that at one point he might have reached out and touched his mid ling .   by that time  dua had no room to wonder what tritt might be doing in the hard caverns if he had not come in pursuit of her .   she forgot tritt completely .   what filled her instead was pure astonishment at her position .  even in childhood she had never melted completely into rock or met anyone who admitted she had  though there were invariably tales of someone else who had  .  certainly no adult emotional ever had or could .  dua .  was unusually rarefied even for an emotional  odeen was fond of telling her that  and her avoidance of food accentuated this  as tritt often said  .   what she had just done indicated the extent of her rarefaction more than any amount of right ling scolding and for a moment she was ashamed and sorry for tritt .   and then she was swept by a deeper shame .  what if she were caught .  she  an adult     if a hard one passed and lingered    she could not possibly bring herself to emerge if anyone were watching but how long could she stay within and what if they discovered her in the rock .   and even as she thought that  she sensed the hard ones and then   somehow   realized they were far away .   she paused  strove to calm herself the rock  permeating and surrounding her  lent a land of grayness to her perception but didn t dim it .  instead  she sensed more sharply .  she could still sense tritt in his steady motion downward as sharply as though he were by her side  and she could sense the hardones though they were a cavern complex away .  she saw the hard ones  every single one of them  each in his place  and could sense their vibratory speech to the fullest detail  and even catch bits of what they were saying .   she was sensing as she never had before and never dreamed she could .   so  though she could now leave the rock  secure in the knowledge she was both alone and unobserved  she did not  partly out of amazement  partly out of the curious exultation she felt at understanding and her desire to experience it further .   her sensitivity was such that she even knew why he was sensitive .  odeen had frequently remarked how well he understood something after a period of melting  even though he had not understood it at all before .  there was something about the melted state that increased sensitivity incredibly  more was absorbed  more was used .  it was because of the greater atomic density during melting  odeen had said .   even though dua was  not sure what  greater atomic density  meant  it came with melting and wasn t this present situation rather like melting .  hadn t dua melted with rock .   when the triad melted  all the sensitivity went to odeen s benefit .  the rational absorbed it  gained understanding  and retained that understanding after separation .  but now dua was the only consciousness in the melt .  it was herself and the rock .  there was  greater atomic density   surely .   with only herself to benefit .    was this why rock rubbing was considered a perversion .  was this why emotionals were warned off .  or was it just dua because she was so rarefied .  or because she was a left em .    and then dua stopped all speculation and just sensed   in fascination .  she was  only mechanically aware of tritt returning  moving past her  passing in the direction back from which he had come .  she was only mechanically aware   scarcely feeling the vaguest surprise   that odeen  too  was coming up from the hard caverns .  it was the hard ones she was sensing  only they  trying to make more out of her perceptions  trying to make the most out of them .   it was a long time before she detached and flowed out of the rock .  and when that time came  she was not concerned overmuch as to whether she would be observed .  she was confident enough of her sensing ability to know she wouldn t be .   and she returned home deep in thought .        b      odeen had returned home to find tritt waiting for him  but dua still hadn t returned .  tritt did not seem disturbed at that .  or at least he seemed disturbed  but not at that .  his emotions were strong enough so that odeen could sense them clearly  but he let them go without proving .  it was dua s absence that made odeen restless  to the extent that he found himself annoyed at tritt s presence simply because tritt was not dua .   in this he surprised himself .  he could not deny to himself that it was tritt who  of the two  was the dearer to him .  ideally  all members of the triad were one  and any member should treat the other two exactly on a par   both with each other and with him  her  self .  yet odeen had never met a triad in which this was so  least of all among those who loudly proclaimed their triad to be ideal in this respect one of the three was always a little left out  and generally knew it  too .   it was rarely the emotional  though .  they supported each other cross triad to an extent that rationals and parentals never did .  the rational had his teacher  the proverb went  and the parental his children   but the emotional had all the other emotionals .   emotionals compared notes and if one claimed neglect  or could be made to claim it  she was sent back with a thin patter of instructions to stand firm  to demand .  and because melting depended so much on the emotional and her attitude  she was usually pampered by both left and right .   but dua was so non emotional  an emotional .  she didn t seem to care that odeen and tritt were so close  and she had no close friendships among the emotionals to make her care .  of course that was it  she was so non emotional an emotional .   odeen loved having her so interested in his work  loved having her so concerned and so amazingly ready of comprehension  but that was an intellectual love  lie deeper feeling went to steady  stupid tritt  who knew his place so well and who could offer so little other than exactly what counted   the security of assured routine .   but now odeen felt petulant .  he said   have you heard from dua  tritt .    and tritt did not answer directly .  he said   i am busy .  i will see you later .  i have been doing things .     where are the children .  have you been gone  too .  there is a been gone feel to you .    a note of annoyance made itself plain in tritt   s voice .     the children are well trained .  they know enough to place themselves in community care .  really  odeen  they are not babies .   but he did not deny the  been gone  aura that he faintly exuded .    i m sorry .  i m just anxious to see dua .     you should feel so more often   tritt said .   you always tell me to leave her alone .  you look for her .   and he went on into the deeper recesses of the home cavern .   odeen looked after his right ling with some surprise .  at almost any other occasion he would have followed in an attempt to probe the unusual uneasiness that was making itself quite evident through the ingrained stolidity of a parental .  what had tritt done .      but he was waiting for dua  and growing more anxious by the moment  and he let tritt go .   anxiety keened odeen s sensitivity .  there was almost a perverse pride among rationals in their relative poverty of perception .  such perception wasn t a thing of the mind  it was most characteristic of emotionals .  odeen was a rational of rationals  proud of reasoning rather than feeling  yet now he flung out the imperfect net of his emotional perception as far as he could  and wished  for just a moment  that he were an emotional so that he could send it out farther and better .   yet it eventually served his purpose .  he could detect dua s approach  finally  at an unusual distance   for him    and he hastened out to meet her .  and because he made her out at such a distance  he was more aware of her rarefaction than he ordinarily was .  she was a delicate mist  no more .      tritt was right  odeen thought with sudden  sharp concern .  dua must be made to eat and to melt .  her interest in life must be increased .   he was so intent on the necessity of this that when she flung herself flowingly toward him and virtually engulfed him  in utter disregard of the fact that they were not in private and might be observed  and said   odeen  i must know   i must know so much     he accepted it as the completion of his own thought and did not even consider it strange .   carefully  he slipped away  trying to adopt a more seemly union without making it seem he was repulsing her .   come   he said   i ve been waiting for you .  tell me what you want to know .  i will explain all i can .    they were moving quickly homeward now  with odeen adapting himself eagerly to the characteristic waver of the emotional flow .   dua said   tell me about the other universe .  why are they different .  how are they different .  tell me all about  it   it did not occur to dua she was asking too much .  it did occur to odeen .  he felt rich with an astonishing quantity of knowledge and was on the point of asking  how do you come to know enough about the other universe to grow so curious about it .   he repressed the question .  dua was coming from the direction of the hard caverns .  perhaps losten had been talking to her  suspecting that despite everything odeen would be too proud of his status to help his mid ling .   not so  thought odeen gravely .  and he would not ask .  he would just explain .   tritt bustled about them when they returned home .   if you two are going to talk  go into dua s chamber .  i will be busy out here .  i must see to it that the children are cleaned and exercised .  no time for melting now .  no melting .    neither odeen nor dua had any thought of melting  but there was no thought in either mind of disobeying the command .  the parental s home was his castle .  the rational had his hard caverns below and the emotional her meeting places above .  the parental had only his home .   odeen therefore said   yes  tritt well be out of your way .    and dua extended a briefly loving part of herself and said   it s good to see you  right dear .    odeen wondered if her gesture was part relief over the fact that there would be no pressure to melt .  tritt did tend to overdo that a bit  even more than parentals generally .    in her chamber  dua stared at her private feeding place .  ordinarily  she ignored it .   it had been odeen s idea  he knew that such things did exist and  as he explained to tritt  if dua did not like to swarm with the other emotionals  it was perfectly possible to lead solar energy down into the cavern so that dua might feed there .   tritt had been horrified .  it wasn t done .  the others  would laugh .  the triad would be disgraced .  why didn t dua behave as she should .    yes  tritt   odeen had said   but she doesn t behave as she should  so why not accommodate her .  is it so terrible .  she will eat privately  gain substance  make us happier  become happier herself  and maybe learn to swarm in the end .    tritt allowed it  and even dua allowed it   after some argument   but insisted that it be a simple design .  so there was nothing but the two rods that served as electrodes  powered by solar energy  and with room for dua in between .   dua rarely used it  but this time she stared at it and said   tritt has decorated it  .  .  .  unless you did  odeen .     i .  of course not   a pattern of colored clay designs was at the base of each electrode .   i suppose it s his way of saying he wishes i would use it   dua said   and aim hungry .  besides  if i m eating  tritt wouldn t dream of interrupting us  would he .     no  said odeen  gravely .   tritt would stop the world it he thought its motion might disturb you while you were eating .    dua said   well   aim hungry .    odeen caught a trace of guilt in her .  guilt over tritt .  over being hungry .  why should dua feel guilty about being hungry .  or had she done something that had consumed energy and was she feeling     he wrenched his mind away from that impatiently .  there were times when a rational could be too rational  and chase down the tracks of every thought to the detriment of what was important .  right now  it was important to talk to dua .   she seated herself between the electrodes and when she compressed herself to do so  her small size was only too painfully evident .  odeen was hungry himself  he could tell because the electrodes seemed brighter than they ordinarily did  and he could taste the food even at that distance and the savor was delicious .  when one was hungry  one always tasted food more keenly than otherwise and at a greater distance .   .   .  but he would eat later .   dua said   don t just sit silently  left dear .  tell me .  i want to know .   she had adopted  unconsciously .   the ovoid character of a rational  as though to make it clearer that she wanted to be accepted as one .   odeen said   i can t explain it all .  all the science i mean  because you haven t had the background  i will try to make it simple and you just listen .  later  you tell me what you didn t understand and i ll try to explain further .  you understand  first  that everything is made up of tiny particles called atoms and that these are made up of still tinier subatomic particles .     yes  yes   said dua .   that s why we can melt .     exactly .  because actually we are mostly empty space .  all the particles are far apart and your particles and mine and tritt s can all melt together because each set fits into the empty spaces around the other set .  the reason matter doesn t fly apart altogether is that the tiny particles do manage to cling together across the space that separates them .  there are attractive forces holding them together  the strongest being one we call the nuclear force .  it holds the chief subatomic particles very tightly together in bunches that are spread widely apart and that are held together by weaker forces .  do you understand that .     only a little bit   said dua .    well never mind  we can go back later .  .  .   .  matter can exist in different states .  it can be especially spread out  as in emotionals  as in you  dua  it can be a little less spread out  as in rationals and in parentals .  or still less so  as in rock .  it can be very compressed or thick  as in the hard ones .  that s why they re hard .  they are filled with particles .     you mean there s no empty space in them .     no  that s not quite what i mean   said odeen  puzzled as to how to make matter clearer .   they still have a great deal of empty space  but not as much as we do .  particles need a certain amount of empty space and if all they have is that much  then other particles can t squeeze in .  if particles are forced in  there is pain .  that s why the hard ones don t like to be touched   . y us .  we soft ones have more space between the particles than are actually needed  so other particles can fit in .    dua didn t look at all certain about that .  odeen hastened onward .   in the other universe  the rules are different .  the nuclear force isn t as strong as in ours .  that means the particles need more room .     why .    odeen shook his head   because   because   the particles spread out their wave forms more .  i can t explain better than that .  with a weaker nuclear force  the particles need more room and two pieces of matter can t melt together as easily as they can in our universe .     can we see the other universe .     oh  no .  that isn t possible .  we can deduce its nature from its basic laws .  the hard ones can do a great many things  though .  we can send material across  and get material from them .  we can study their material  you see .  and we can set up the positron pump .  you know about that  don t you .     well  you ve told me we get energy out of it .  i didn t know there was a different universe involved .   .   .   .  what is  the other universe like .  do they have stars and worlds the way we do .     that s an excellent question  dua .   odeen was enjoying his role as teacher more intensely than usual now that he had official encouragement to speak .   earlier he always had the feeling that there was a kind of sneaking perversion in trying to explain things to an emotional .    he said   we can t see the other universe  but we can calculate what it must be like from its laws .  you see  what makes the stars  shine is the gradual combination of simple particle combinations into more complicated ones .  we call it nuclear fusion .     do they have that in the other universe .     yes  but because the nuclear force is weaker  fusion is much slower .  this means that the stars must be much  much bigger in the other universe otherwise not enough fusion would take place to make them shine .  stars of the other universe that were no bigger than our sun would be cold and dead .  on the other hand  if stars in our universe were bigger than they are  the amount of fusion would be so great it would blow them up .  that means that in our universe there must be thousands of times as many small stars as there are larger stars in theirs       we only have seven     began dua .  then she said   i forgot .    odeen smiled indulgently .  it was so easy to forget the uncounted stars that could not be seen except by special instruments .   that s all right .  you don t mind my boring you with all this .     you re not boring me   said dua .   love it .  it even makes food taste so good .   and she wavered between the electrodes with a kind of luxurious tremor .   odeen  who had never before heard dua say anything complimentary about food  was greatly heartened .  he said   of course  our universe doesn t last as long as theirs .  fusion goes so fast that all the particles are combined after a million lifetimes .     but there are so many other stars .     ah  but you see they re all going at once .  the whole universe is dying down .  in the other universe  with so many fewer and larger stars  the fusion goes so slowly that the stars last thousands and millions of times as long as ours .  it s hard to compare because it may be that time goes at different rates in the two universes .   he added  with some reluctance   i don t understand that part myself .  that s part of the estwald theory and i haven t got to that very much so far .     did estwald work out all of this .     a great deal of it .    dua said   it s wonderful that we re getting the food from the other universe then .  i mean  it doesn t matter if our sun dies out  then .  we can get all the food we want from the other universe .     that s right .      but does nothing bad happen .  i have the   the feeling that something bad happens .     well   said odeen .   we transfer matter back and forth to make the positron pump and that means the universes mix together a little .  our nuclear force gets a tiny bit weaker  so fusion in our sun slows up a little and the sun cools down a little faster .  .  .  .  but just a little  and we don t need it any more anyway .     that s not the something bad feeling i have .  if the nuclear force gets a tiny bit weaker  then the atoms take up more room   is that right .    and then what happens to melting .     that gets a tiny bit harder but it would take many millions of lifetimes before it would get noticeably harder to melt .  even if someday melting became impossible and soft ones died out  that would happen long  long after we would all have died out for lack of food if we weren t using the other universe .     that s still not the something bad   feeling     dua s words were beginning to slur .  she wriggled between her electrodes and to odeen s gratified eyes she seemed noticeably larger and compacter .  it was as though his words  as well as the food  were nourishing her .   losten was right .  education made her more nearly satisfied with life  odeen could sense a kind of sensual joy in dua that he had scarcely ever felt before .   she said   it is so kind of you to explain  odeen .  you are a good left ling .     do you want me to go on .   asked odeen  flattered and more pleased than he could easily say .   is there anything else you want to ask .     a great deal  odeen  but   but not now .  not now  odeen .  oh  odeen  do you know what i want to do .    odeen guessed at once  but was too cautious to say it openly .  dua s moments of erotic advance were too few to treat with anything but care .  he hoped desperately that tritt had not involved himself with the children to the point where they could not take advantage of this .   but tritt was in the chamber already .  had he been outside the door  waiting .  he did not care .  there was no time to think .   dua had flowed out from between the electrodes and odeen s senses were filled with her beauty .  she was between them  now  and through her tritt shimmered  with his outlines flaming in incredible color .   it had never been like this .  never .   odeen held himself back desperately  letting his own substance flow through dua and into tritt an atom at a time  holding away from the overpowering penetrance of dua with every bit of strength  not giving himself up to the ecstasy  but letting it be wrenched from him  hanging on to his consciousness to the last possible moment  and then blanking out in one final transport so intense as to feel like an explosion echoing and reverberating endlessly within him .   never in the lifetime of the triad had the period of melt unconsciousness lasted so long .        c      tritt was pleased .  the melting had been so satisfactory .  all previous occasions seemed skimpy and hollow in comparison .  he was utterly delighted with what had happened .  yet he kept quiet .  he felt it better not to speak .   odeen and dua were happy  too .  tritt could tell .  even the children seemed to be glowing .   but tritt was happiest of all   naturally .   he listened to odeen and dua talk .  he understood none of it  but that didn t matter .  he didn t mind that they seemed so pleased with each other .  he had his own pleasure and was content to listen .   dua said  on one occasion .   and do they really try to communicate with us .     tritt never got it quite clear who  they  might be .  he gathered that  communicate  was a fancy word for  talk .   so why didn t they say  talk  .  sometimes he wondered if he should interrupt .  but if he asked questions  odeen would only say   now  tritt   and dua would swirl impatiently .     oh  yes   said odeen .   the hard ones are quite sure of that .  they have markings on the material that is sent us sometimes and they say that it is perfectly possible to communicate by such markings .  long ago  in fact  they used markings in reverse  when it was necessary to explain to the other beings how to set up their part of the positron pump .     i wonder what the other beings look like .  what do they look like  do you suppose .     from the laws we can work out the nature of the stars .  because that is simple .  but how can we work out the nature of the beings .  we can never know .     couldn t they communicate what they look like .     if we understood what they communicated  perhaps we could make out something .  but we don t understand .   dua seemed aggrieved .   don t the hard ones understand .     i don t know .  if they do  they haven t told me so .  losten once told me it didn t matter what they were like  as long as the positron pump worked and was enlarged .     maybe he just didn t want you bothering him .   odeen said  huffily .   i don t bother him .     oh  you know what i mean .  he just didn t want to get into those details .    by that time tritt could no longer listen .  they went on arguing for quite awhile over whether the hard ones should let dua look at the markings or not dua said that she could sense what they said  perhaps .   it made tritt a little angry .  after all  dua was only a soft one and not even a rational .  he began to wonder if odeen was right to tell her all he did .  it gave dua funny ideas     dua could see it made odeen angry  too .  first he laughed .  then he said that an emotional couldn t handle such complicated things .  then he refused to talk at all .  dua had to be very pleasant to him for a while till he came around .   on one occasion it was dua who was angry   absolutely furious .   it began quietly .  in fact  it was on one of the occasions when the two children were with them .  odeen was letting them play with him .  he didn t even mind when little right torun pulled at him .  in fact  he let himself go in most undignified fashion .  he didn t seem to mind that he was all out of shape .  it was a sure sign he was pleased .  tritt remained in a corner  resting  and was so satisfied with what was happening .   dua laughed at odeen s misshapenness .  she let her own substance touch odeen s knobbishness flirtatiously .  she knew very well  tritt knew  that the leftish surface was sensitive when out of ovoid .   dua said   i ve been thinking  odeen  .  .  .  if the other universe gets its laws into ours just a bit through the positron pump  doesn t our universe get its laws into theirs the same little bit .    odeen howled at dua s touch and tried to avoid her without upsetting the little ones .  he gasped   i can t answer unless you stop  you mid ling wretch .    she stopped  and he said   that s a very good thought  dua .  you re an amazing creature .  it s true  of course .  the mixture goes both ways .  .  .  .  tritt take out the little ones  will you .    but they scurried off by themselves .  they were not such little ones .  they were quite grown .  annis would soon be starting his education and torun was quite parentally blockish already .   tritt stayed and thought dua looked very beautiful when odeen talked to her in this way .   dua said   if the other laws slow down our sun and cool them down  don t our laws speed up their suns and heat them up .     exactly right  dua .  a rational couldn t do better .     how hot do their suns get .     oh  not much  just slightly hotter  very slightly  dua said   but that s where i keep getting the something bad feeling .     oh  well  the trouble is that their suns are so huge .  h our little suns get a little cooler  it doesn t matter .  even if they turned off altogether  it wouldn t matter as long as we have the positron pump .  with great  huge stars  though  getting even a little hotter is troublesome .  there is so much material in one of those stars that turning up the nuclear fusion even a little way will make it explode .     explode .  but then what happens to the people .     what people .     the people in the other universe .    for a moment  odeen looked blank  then he said   i don t know .     well  what would happen if our own sun exploded .     it couldn t explode .     tritt wondered what all the excitement was about how could a sun explode .  dua seemed angrier and odeen looked confused .    dua said   but if it did .  would it get very hot .     i suppose so .     wouldn t it kill us all .    odeen hesitated and then said in clear annoyance   what difference does it make  dua .  our sun isn t exploding  and don t ask silly questions .     you told me to ask questions  odeen  and it does make a difference  because the positron pump works both ways .  we need their end as much as ours .    odeen stared at her .   i never told you that    i feel it .    odeen said   you feel a great many things .  dua      but dua was shouting now .  she was quite beside herself .  tritt had never seen her like that she said   don t change the subject  odeen .  and don t withdraw and try to make me out a complete fool   just another emotional .  you said i was almost like a rational and i m enough like one to see that the positron pump won t work without the other beings .  if the people in the other universe are destroyed  the positron pump will stop and our sun will be colder than ever and well all starve .  don t you think that s important .    odeen was shouting too  now .   that shows what you know .  we need their help because the energy supply is in low concentration and we have to switch matter .  if the sun in the other universe explodes  there ll be an enormous flood of energy  a huge flood that will last for a million lifetimes .  there will be so much energy  we could tap it directly without any matter shift either way  so we don   t need them  and it doesn   t matter what happens      they were almost touching now .  tritt was horrified .  he had better say something  make them get apart  talk to them .  he couldn t think of anything to say .  then it turned out he didn t have to .   there was a hard one just outside the cavern .  no  three of them .  they had been trying to talk and hadn t made themselves heard .   tritt shrieked   odeen .  dua .    then he remained quiet  trembling .  he had a frightened notion of what the hard ones had come to talk about .  he decided to leave .   but a hard one put out one of his permanent  opaque appendages and said   don t go .    it sounded harsh  unfriendly .  tritt was more frightened than ever .        a      dua was filled with anger  so filled she could scarcely sense the hard ones .  she seemed stifled under the components of the anger  each one filling her to the brim  separately .  there was a sense of wrongness that odeen should try to lie to her .  a sense of wrongness that a whole world of people should die .  a sense of wrongness that it was so easy for her to learn and that she had never been allowed to .   since that first time in the rock  she had gone twice more to the hard caverns .  twice more  unnoticed  she had buried herself in rock  and each time she sensed and knew  and each time when odeen would explain matters to her  she knew in advance what it was he would explain .   why couldn t they teach her  then  as they had taught odeen .  why only the rationals .  did she possess the capacity to learn only because she was a left em  a perverted mid ling .  then let them teach her  perversion and all it was wrong to leave her ignorant .   finally  the words of the hard one were breaking through to her .  losten was there  but it was not he speaking .  it was a strange hard one  in front  who spoke .  she did not know him  but she knew few of them .   the hard one said   which of you have been in the lower caverns recently  the hard caverns .    dua was defiant .  they found out about her rock rubbing and she didn t care .  let them tell everybody .  she would do so herself .  she said   i have .  many times .     alone .   said the hard one calmly .    alone .  many times   snapped dua .  it was only three times  but she didn t care .   odeen muttered   i have  of course  been to the lower caverns on occasion .    the hard one seemed to ignore that .  he turned to tritt instead and said sharply .   and you  right .    tritt quavered   yes  hard sir .     alone .     yes  hard sir .     how often .     once .    dua was annoyed .  poor tritt was in such a panic over nothing .  it was she herself who had done it and she was ready for a confrontation .   leave him alone   she said .   i m the one you want .    the hard one turned slowly toward her .   for what .   he said .    for whatever it is .   and faced with it directly  she couldn   t bring herself to describe what she had done after all .  not in front of odeen    well  we ll get to you .  first  the right .   .   .   .  your name is tritt  isn t it .  why did you go to the lower caverns alone .     to speak to hard one estwald  hard sir .    at which again dua interrupted  eagerly   are you estwald .    the hard one said briefly   no .    odeen looked annoyed  as though it embarrassed him that dua didn t recognize the hard one .  dua didn t care .   the hard one said to tritt   what did you take from the lower caverns .    tritt was silent .   the hard one said  without emotion   we know you took something .  we want to know if you know what it was .  it could be very dangerous .    tritt was still silent  and losten interposed  saying more kindly   please tell us  tritt .  we know now it was you and we don t want to have to be harsh .    tritt mumbled .   i took a food ball .     ah .   it was the first hard one speaking .   what did you do with it .    and tritt burst out .   it was for dua .  she wouldn t eat it was for dua .    dua jumped and coalesced in astonishment .   the hard one turned on her at once .   you did not know about it .     no .     nor you .      to odeen .   odeen  so motionless as to seem frozen  said   no  hard sir .    for a moment the air was full of unpleasant vibration as the hard ones spoke to each other  ignoring the triad .   whether her sessions at rock rubbing had made her more sensitive  or whether it was her recent storm of emotions  dua couldn t tell  and wouldn t have dreamed of trying to analyze  she simply knew she was catching whiffs     not of words   but of understanding     they had detected the loss some time ago .  they had been searching quietly .  they had turned to the soft ones as possible culprits with reluctance .  they had investigated and then turned to odeen s triad with even greater reluctance .   why .  dua missed that .   they did not see how odeen could have had the foolishness to take it  or dua the inclination .  they did not think of tritt at all .   then the hard one who had so far not said a word to the soft ones recalled seeing tritt in the hard caverns .   of course  thought dua .  it was the day she had first entered the rock .  she had sensed him then .  she had forgotten .    it had seemed unlikely in the extreme  but finally  with all else impossible and with the time lapse having grown intolerably dangerous  they came .  they would have liked to consult estwald  but by the time the possibility of tritt arose  he was unavailable .   all this dua sensed in a gasp and now she turned toward tritt  with a feeling of mingled wonder and outrage .   losten was anxiously vibrating that no harm had been done  that dua looked well  that it was a useful experiment actually .  the hard one to whom tritt had spoken was agreeing  the other still exuded concern .   dua was not paying attention to them only .  she was looking at tritt .   the first hard one said   where is the food ball now  tritt .    tritt showed them .   it was hidden effectively and the connections were clumsy but serviceable .   the hard one said     did you do this yourself  tritt .     yes  hard sir .     how did you know how .     i looked at how it was done in the hard caverns .  i did it exactly the way i saw it done there .     didn t you know you might have harmed your mid mate .     i didn   t .  i wouldn   t .  i     tritt seemed unable to speak for a moment .  then he said   it was not to hurt her .  it was to feed her .  i let it pour into her feeder and i decorated her feeder .  i wanted her to try it and she did .  she ate .  for the first time in a long while she ate well .  we melted .   he paused  then said in a huge  tumultuous cry .   she had enough energy at last to initiate a baby emotional .  she took odeen s seed and passed it to me .  i have it growing inside me .  a baby emotional is growing inside me .    dua could not speak .  she stumbled back and then rushed for the door in so pell mell a fashion that the hard ones could not get out of the way in time .  she struck the appendage of the one in front  passing deep into it  and then pulled free with a harsh sound .   the hard one s appendage fell limp and his expression seemed contorted with pain .  odeen tried to dodge around him to follow dua  but the hard one said  with apparent difficulty .   let her go for now .  there is enough harm done .  we will take care .         b      odeen found himself living through a nightmare .  dua was gone .  the hard ones were gone .  only tritt was still there  silent  how could it have happened  odeen thought in tortured fashion .  how could tritt have found his way alone to the hard caverns .  how could he have taken a storage battery charged at the positron pump and designed to yield radiation in much more concentrated form than sunlight and dared     odeen would not have had the courage to chance it .  how could tritt  stumbling  ignorant tritt .  or was he unusual  too .  odeen  the clever rational  dua  the curious emotional  and tritt  the daring parental .   he said   how could you do it  tritt .    tritt retorted hotly .   what did i do .  i fed her .  i fed her better than she had ever been fed before .  now we have a baby emotional initiated at last .  haven t we waited long enough .  we would have waited forever  if we had waited for dua .     but don t you understand  tritt .  you might have hurt her .  it wasn t ordinary sunlight .  it was an experimental radiational source that could have been too concentrated to be safe .     i don t understand what you re saying  odeen .  how could it do harm .  i tasted the kind of food the hard ones made before .  it tasted bad .  you ve tasted it  too .  it tasted just awful and it never hurt us .  it tasted so bad  dua wouldn t touch it .  then i came on the food ball .  it tasted good .  i ate some and it was delicious .  how can anything delicious hurt .  you see  dua ate it .  she liked it .  and it started the baby emotional .  how can i have done wrong .    odeen despaired of explaining .  he said   dua is going to be very angry .     she ll get over it    i wonder .  tritt  she s not like ordinary emotionals .  that s what makes her so hard to live with  but so wonderful when we can live with her .  she may never want to melt with us again .    tritt s outline was sturdily plane surfaced .  then he said   well  what of it .     what of it .  you ask .  do you want to give up melting .     no  but if she won t she won t .  i have my third baby and i don t care any more .  i know all about the soft ones in the old days .  they used to have two triad births sometimes .  but i don t care .  one is plenty .     but  tritt  babies aren t all there is to melting .     what else .  i heard you say once you learned faster after you melted .  then learn slower .  i don t care .  i have my third baby .    odeen turned away  trembling  and flowed jerkily out of the chamber .  what was the use of scolding tritt .  tritt wouldn t understand .  he wasn t sure he understood himself .   once the third baby was born  and grown a little  surely there would come a time to pass on .  it would be he  odeen  who would have to give the signal  who would have to say when  and it would have to be done without fear .  anything else would be disgrace  or worse  and yet he could not face it without melting  even now that all three children would have been formed .   melting  somehow  would eliminate the fear .  .  .  .  maybe it was because melting was like passing on .  there was a period of time when you were not conscious  yet it did not hurt .  it was like not existing and yet it was desirable .  with enough melting  he could gain the courage to pass on without fear and without     oh  sun and all the stars  it wasn t  passing on .   why use that phrase so solemnly .  he knew the other word that was never used except by children who wanted to shock their elders somehow .  it was dying .  he had to get ready to die without fear  and to have dua and tritt die with him .   and he didn t know how .  .  .  .  not without melting .  .  .        c      tritt remained alone in the room  frightened  frightened  but sturdily resolved to remain unmoved .  he had his third baby .  he could feel it within .   that was what counted .   that was all that counted .   yet why  then  deep inside  did he have a stubborn faint feeling that it wasn   t all that counted .        a      dua was ashamed almost beyond endurance .  it took a long time for her to battle down that shame  battle it down enough to give herself room to think .  she had hastened    hastened   moving blindly out and away from the horror of the home cavern  scarcely caring that she did not know where she was going or even where she was   it was night  when no decent soft one would be on the surface  not even the most frivolous emotional .  and it would be a considerable time before the sun rose .  dua was glad .  the sun was food and at the moment  she hated food and what had been done to her .   it was cold  too  but dua was only distantly aware of it why should she care about cold  she thought  when she had been fattened in order that she might do her duty    fattened  mind and body .  after that  cold and starvation were almost her friends .   she saw through tritt .  poor thing  he was so easy to see through  his actions were pure instinct and he was to be praised that he had followed them so bravely .  he had come back so daringly from the hard caverns with the food ball  and she   she herself had sensed him and would have known what was happening if tritt hadn t been so paralyzed at what he was doing that he had dared not think of it  and if she had not been so paralyzed at what she was doing and at the new depth of sensation it brought her that she would not take care to sense what most she needed to  .   tritt brought it back undetected and had arranged the pitiful booby trap  decorating her feeder to entice her .  and she had come back  flushed with awareness of her rock probing thinness  filled with the shame of it and with pity for tritt .  with all that shame and pity  she ate  and helped initiate birth .   since then she had eaten but sparingly as was her custom and never at the feeder  but then there had been no impulse to .  tritt had not driven her .  he had looked contented  of course  so there was nothing to reactivate the shame .  and tritt left the food ball in place .  he didn t dare risk taking it back  he had what he wanted  it was best and easiest to leave it there and think of it no more .      till he was caught .   but clever odeen must have seen through tritt s plan  must have spied the new connections to the electrodes  must have understood tritt s purpose .  undoubtedly  he said nothing to tritt  that would have embarrassed and frightened the poor right ling and odeen always watched over tritt with loving care .   of course  odeen didn t have to say anything .  he needed only to fill in the gaps in tritt s clumsy plan and make it work .   dua was under no illusions now .  she would have detected the taste of the food ball  noticed its extraordinary tang  caught the way in which it began to fill her while giving her no sensations of fullness   had it not been that odeen had occupied her with talk .   it had been a conspiracy between the two of them  whether tritt was consciously part of it or not .  how could she have believed that odeen was suddenly a careful  painstaking teacher .  how could she have failed to see the ulterior motive .  their concern for her was their concern for the completion of the new triad  and that in itself was an indication of how little they thought of her .   well     she paused long enough to feel her own weariness and she worked herself into a crevice in the rock that would shield her from the thin  cold wind .  two of the seven stars were in her field of vision and she watched them absently  occupying her outer senses in trivia so that she might concentrate the more in internal thought .   she was disillusioned .    betrayed   she muttered to herself .   betrayed .   could they see no further than themselves .  that tritt would be willing to see all destroyed if he were but secure in his babies was to be taken for granted .  but he was a creature of instinct .  what of odeen .   odeen reasoned  and did that mean that for the purpose of exercising his reason  he would sacrifice all else .  was everything produced by reason its own excuse for being    at any cost .  because estwald had devised the positron pump  did it have to be used in order that the whole world  hard and soft alike  be placed at its mercy  and at the mercy of the people of the other universe .  what if the other people stopped and if the world was left without a positron pump and with a dangerously cooled sun .   no  they wouldn t stop  those other people  for they had been persuaded to start and they would be persuaded to keep going until they were destroyed   and then they would be needed no longer by the rationals  hard or soft    just as she  dua  would have to pass on  be destroyed  now that she was needed no longer .   she and the other people  both being betrayed .  almost without being aware of it  she was cushioning deeper and deeper into the rock .  she buried herself  out of sight of the stars  out of touch with the wind  unaware of the world .  she was pure thought .   it was estwald whom she hated .  he was the personification of all that was selfish and hard .  he had devised the positron pump and would destroy a whole world of perhaps tens of thousands without conscience .  he was so withdrawn that he never made his appearance and so powerful that even the other hard ones seemed afraid of him .  well  then  she would fight him .  she would stop him .  the people of the other universe had helped set up the positron pump through communications of some sort .  odeen had mentioned those .  where would such communications be kept .  what would they be like .  how could they be used for further communication .   it was remarkable how clearly she could think .  remarkable .  there was fierce enjoyment in this  that she would use reason to overcome the cruel reasoners .   they wouldn t be able to stop her  for she could go where no hard one could go  where no rational or parental could   and where no other emotional would .   she might be caught eventually  but at the moment she didn t care .  she was going to fight to have her way   at any price   at any price   though to do it meant she would have to go through rock  live in rock  skirt the hard caverns  steal food from their stored energy batteries when she had to  flock with the other emotionals and feed on sunlight when she could .   but in the end she would teach them all a lesson and after that they could do as they wished .  she would even be ready to pass on then   but only then          b      odeen was present when the new baby emotional was born  perfect in every way  but he had not been able to feel enthusiasm over it .  even tritt  who cared for it perfectly  as a parental must  seemed subdued in his ecstasies .   a long time had passed and it was as though dua had vanished .  she had not passed on .  a soft one could not pass on except when the whole triad did  but she was not with them  either .  it was as though she had passed on  without passing on .   odeen had seen her once  only once  not very long after her wild fight on the news that she had initiated the new baby .   he had passed a cluster of emotionals  sunning themselves  when he was moving over the surface on some foolish notion that he might find her .  they had tittered at the rare sight of a rational moving in the vicinity of an emotional cluster and had thinned in mass provocation  with no thought among the foolish lot of them but to advertise the fact that they were emotionals .   odeen felt only contempt for them and there was no answering stir along his own smooth curves at all .  he thought of dua instead and of how different she was from all of them .  dua never thinned for any reason other than her own inner needs .  she had never tried to attract anyone and was the more attractive for that .  if she could have brought herself to join the flock of empty heads she would be easily recognized  he felt sure  by the fact that she alone would not thin  but would probably thicken  precisely because the others thinned .   and as he thought that  odeen scanned the sunning emotionals and noted that one indeed had not .   he stopped and then hastened toward her  oblivious to the emotionals in his way  oblivious to their wild screeching as they flicked smokily out of his path and chattered desperately in their attempts to avoid coalescing one with the other   at least not in the open  and with a rational watching .   it was dua .  she did not try to leave .  she kept her ground and said nothing .    dua   he said  humbly   aren t you coming home .     i have no home  odeen   she said .  not angrily  not in hate   and all the more dreadfully for that reason .     how can you blame tritt for what he did  dua .  you know the poor fellow can t reason .     but you can  odeen .  and you occupied my mind while he arranged to feed my body  didn t you .  your reason told you that i was much more likely to be trapped by you than by him .     dua  no .     no  what .  didn t you make a big show of teaching me  of educating me .     i did  but it wasn t a show  it was real .  and it was not because of what tritt had done .  i didn   t know what tritt had done .     i can t believe that  she flowed away without haste .  he followed after .  they were alone now  the sun shining redly down upon them .   she turned to him .   let me ask you one question  odeen .  why did you want to teach me .    odeen said   because i wanted to .  because i enjoy teaching and because i would rather teach than do anything else   but learn .     and melt  of course .   .   .   .  never mind   she added to ward him off .   don t explain that you are talking of reason and not of instinct if you really mean what you say about enjoying teaching  if i can really ever believe what you say  then perhaps you can understand something i m going to tell you .    i ve been learning a great deal since i left you  odeen .  never mind how .  i have .  there s no emotional left in me at all  except physiologically .  inside  where it counts  i m all rational  except that i hope i have more feeling for others than rationals have .  and one thing i ve learned is what we really are  odeen  you and i and tritt and all the other triads on this planet  what we really are and always were .     what is that .   asked odeen .  he was prepared to listen for as long as might be necessary  and as quietly  if only she would come back with him when she had said her say .  he would perform any penance  do anything that might be required .  only she must come back   and something dim and dark inside him knew that she had to come back voluntarily .    what we are .  why  nothing  really  odeen   she said lightly  almost laughing   isn t that strange .  the hard ones are the only living species on the face of the world .  haven t they taught you that .  there is only one species because you and i  the soft ones  are not really alive .  we re machines  odeen .  we must be because only the hard ones are alive .  haven t they taught you that  odeen .     but  dua  that s nonsense   said odeen  nonplused .   dua s voice grew harsher .   machines  odeen .  made by the hard ones .  destroyed by the hard ones .  they are alive  the hard ones .  only they .  they don t talk about it much .  they don t have to .  they all know it .  but i ve learned to think  odeen  and i ve worked it out from the small clues i ve had .  they live tremendously long lives  but die eventually .  they no longer give birth  the sun yields too little energy for that .  and since they die very infrequently  but don t give birth at all  their numbers are very slowly declining .  and there are no young ones to provide new blood and new thoughts  so the old  long lived hard ones get terribly bored .  so what do you suppose they do  odeen .     what .   there was a kind of fascination about this .  a repulsive fascination .    they manufacture mechanical children  whom they can teach .  you said it yourself  odeen .  you would rather teach than do anything else but learn   and melt  of course .  the rationals are made in the mental image of the hard ones  and the hard ones don t melt  and learning is terribly complex for them since they already know so much .  what is left for them but the fun of teaching .  rationals were created for no purpose but to be taught .  emotionals and parentals were created because they were necessary for the self perpetuating machinery that made new rationals .  and new rationals were needed constantly because the old ones were used up  were taught all they could be taught .  and when old rationals had absorbed what they could  they were destroyed and were taught  in advance  to call the destruction process  passing on  to spare their feelings .  and of course  emotionals and parentals passed on with them .  as long as they had helped form a new triad there was no further use for them .     but that s all wrong  dua   odeen managed to say .  he had no arguments to pose against her nightmare scheme  but he knew with a certainty past argument that she was wrong .   or did a little pang of doubt deep inside suggest that the certainty might have been implanted in him  to begin with .    no  surely no  for then would not dua be certain with an implanted certainty  too  that this was wrong .    or was she an imperfect emotional without the proper implantations and without    oh  what was he thinking .  he was as crazy as she was .    dua said   you look upset  odeen .  are you sure i m all wrong .  of course  now they have the positron pump and they now have all the energy they need  or will have .  soon they will be giving birth again .  maybe they are doing so already .  and they won t need any soft one machines at all  and we will all be destroyed  i beg pardon  we will all pass on .     no  dua   said odeen  strenuously  as much to himself as to her .   i don t know how you got those notions  but the hard ones aren t like that .  we are not destroyed .     don t lie to yourself  odeen .  they   re like that .  they are prepared to destroy a whole world of other beings for their benefit  a whole universe if they have to .  would they stop at destroying a few soft ones for their comfort .       but they made one mistake .  somehow the machinery went wrong and a rational mind got into an emotional body .  i m a left em  do you know that .  they called me that when i was a child  and they were right .  i can reason like a rational and i can feel like an emotional .  and i will fight the hard ones with that combination .    odeen felt wild .  dua must surely be mad  yet he dared not say so .  he had to cajole her somehow and bring her back .  he said with strenuous sincerity   dua  we re not destroyed when we pass on .     no .  what does happen then .     i   i don t know .  i think we enter another world  a better and happier world  and become like   like   well  much better than we are .    dua laughed .   where did you hear that .  did the hard ones tell you that .     no  dua .  i   m sure that this must be so out of my own thoughts .  i ve been thinking a great deal about it since you left   dua said   then think less and you ll be less foolish .  poor odeen .  good by .   she flowed away once more  thinly .  there was an air of weariness about her .   odeen called out   but wait  dua .  surely you want to see your new baby mid .    she did not answer .   he cried out .   when will you come home .    she did not answer .   and he followed no more  but looked after her in deepest misery as she dwindled .   he did not tell tritt he had seen dua .  what was the use .  nor did he see her again .  he began haunting the favored sunning sites of the emotionals in the region  doing so even though occasional parentals emerged to watch him in stupid suspicion  tritt was a mental giant compared to most parentals  .   the lack of her hurt more with each passing day .  and with each passing day  he realized that there was a gathering fright inside himself over her absence .  he didn t know why .   he came back to home cavern one day to find losten waiting for him .  losten was standing there  grave and polite while tritt was showing him the new baby and striving to keep the handful of mist from touching the hard one .   losten said   it is indeed a beauty  tritt .  derala is its name .     derola   corrected tritt .   i don t know when odeen will be back .  he wanders about a lot       here i am  losten   said odeen  hastily .   tritt  take the baby away  there s a good fellow .    tritt did so  and losten turned to odeen with quite obvious relief  saying   you must be very happy to have completed the triad .    odeen tried to answer with some polite inconsequence  but could maintain only a miserable silence .  he had recently been developing a kind of comradeship  a vague sense of equality with the hard ones  that enabled them to talk together on a level .  somehow dua s madness had spoiled it .  odeen knew she was wrong and yet he approached losten once more as stiffly as in the long gone days when he thought of himself as a far inferior creature to them  as a   machine .   losten said   have you seen dua .   this was a real question  and not politeness .  odeen could tell easily .    only once  h      he almost said  hard sir  as though he were a child again  or a parental .    only once  losten .  she won t come home .     she must come home   said losten  softly .    i don t know how to arrange that .    losten regarded him somberly .   do you know what she is doing .    odeen dared not look at the other .  had he discovered dua s wild theories .  what would be done about that .   he made a negative sign without speaking .   losten said   she is a most unusual emotional  odeen .  you know that  don t you .     yes   sighed odeen .    so are you in your way  and tritt in his .  i doubt that any parental in the world would have had either the courage or the initiative to steal an energy battery or the perverse ingenuity to put it to use as he did .  the three of you make up the most unusual triad of which we have any record .     thank you .     but there are uncomfortable aspects to the triad  too  things we didn t count on .  we wanted you to teach dua as the mildest and best possible way in which to cajole her into performing her function voluntarily .  we did not count on tritt s quixotic action at just that moment .  nor  to tell you the truth  did we count on her wild reaction to the fact that the world in the other universe must be destroyed .     i ought to have been careful how i answered her questions   said odeen miserably .    it wouldn t have helped .  she was finding out for herself .  we didn t count on that either .  odeen  i am sorry  but i must tell you this   dua has become a deadly danger  she is trying to stop the positron pump .     .  but how can she .  she can t reach it  and even if she could  she lacks the knowledge to do anything about it .     oh  but she can reach it .   losten hesitated  then said   she remains infused in the rock of the world where she is safe from us .    it took awhile for odeen to grasp the clear meaning of the words .  he said   no grown emotional would    dua would never   n   she would .  she does .  don t waste time arguing the point .   .   .   .  she can penetrate anywhere in the caverns .  nothing is hidden from her .  she has studied those communications we have received from the other universe .  we don t know that of certain knowledge  but there is no other way of explaining what is happening .     oh  oh  oh .   odeen rocked back and forth  his surface opaque with shame and grief .   does estwald know of all this .    losten said  grimly   not yet  though he must know someday .     but what will she do with those communications .     she is using them to work out a method for sending some of her own in the other direction .     but she cannot know how to translate or transmit .     she is learning both .  she knows more about those communications than estwald himself .  she is a frightening phenomenon  an emotional who can reason and who is out of control .    odeen shivered .  out of control .  how machine like a reference .   he said   it can t be that bad .     it can .  she has communicated already and i fear she is advising the other creatures to stop their half of the positron pump .  if they do that before their sun explodes  we will be helpless at this end .     but then       she must be stopped  odeen .     b   but  how .  are you going to blast     his voice failed .  dimly  he knew that the hard one had devices for digging caverns out of the world s rock  devices scarcely used since the world s population had begun declining ages ago .  would they locate dua in the rock and blast it and her .    no   said losten  forcefully .   we cannot harm dua .     estwald might       estwald cannot harm her  either .     then what s to be done .     it s you  odeen .  only you .  we re helpless  so we must depend on you .     nome .  but what can i do .     think about it   said losten  urgently .     think about it .     think about what .     i can t say more than that   said losten  in apparent agony .   think .  there is so little time .    he turned and left  moving rapidly for a hard one  moving as though he did not trust himself to stay and perhaps say too much .   and odeen could  only look after him  dismayed  confused   lost .        c      there was a great deal for tritt to do .  babies required much care  but even two young lefts and two young rights together did not make up the sum of a single baby mid    particularly not a mid as perfect as derola .  she had to be exercised and soothed  protected from percolating into whatever she touched  cajoled into condensing and resting .   it was a long time before he saw odeen again and  actually  he didn t care .  derola took up all his time .  but then he came across odeen in the corner of his own alcove  iridescent with thought .   tritt remembered  suddenly .  he said   was losten angry about dua .    odeen came to himself with a start .   losten .    yes  he was angry .  dua is doing great harm .     she should come home  shouldn t she .    odeen was staring at tritt .   tritt   he said   we re going to have  to persuade dua to come home .  we must find her first .  you can do it .  with a new baby  your parental sensitivity is very high .  you can use it to find dua .     no   said tritt  shocked .   it s used for derola .  it would be wrong to use it for dua .  besides  if she wants to stay away so long when a baby mid is longing for her    and she was once a baby mid herself   maybe we might just learn to do without her .     but  tritt  don t you ever want to melt again .     well  the triad is now complete .     that s not all there is to melting .   tritt said   but where do we have to go to find her .  little derola needs me .  she s a tiny baby .  i don t want to leave her .     the hard ones will arrange to have derola taken care of .  you and i will go to the hard caverns and find dua .    tritt thought about that .  he didn t care about dua .  he didn t even care about odeen  somehow .  there was only derola .  he said   someday .  someday  when derola is older .  not till then .     tritt   said odeen  urgently   we must find dua .  otherwise   otherwise the babies will be taken away from us .     by whom .   said tritt .    by the hard ones .    tritt was silent .  there was nothing he could say .  he had never heard of such a thing .  he could not conceive of such a thing .   odeen said   tritt  we must pass on .  i know why  now .  i ve been thinking about it ever since losten    but never mind that .  dua and you must pass on  too .  now that i know why  you will feel you must and i hope   i think    dua will feel she must  too .  and we must pass on soon  for dua is destroying the world .    tritt was backing away .   don t look at me like that  odeen .  .  .  .  you re making me .  .  .  .  you re making me .     i m not making you  tritt   said odeen  sadly .   it s just that i know now and so you must .   .   .   .  but we must find dua .     no  no .   tritt was in agony  trying to resist .  there was something terribly new about odeen  and existence was approaching an end inexorably .  there would be no tritt and no baby mid .  where every other parental had his baby mid for a long time  tritt would have lost his almost at once .   it wasn t fair .  oh  it wasn t fair .   tritt panted .   it s dua s fault .  let her pass on first .   odeen said  with deadening calm   there s no other  way but for all of us      and tritt knew that was so   that was so   that was  so          a      dua felt thin and cold  wispy .  her attempts to rest in the open and absorb sunlight had ended after odeen had found her that time .  her feeding at the hard ones  batteries was erratic .  she dared not remain too long outside the safety of rock  so she ate in quick gulps  and she never got enough .   she was conscious of hunger  continuously  all the more so since it seemed to tire her to remain in the rock .  it was as though she were being punished for all that long time in which she haunted the sunset and ate so skimpily .   if it were not for the work she was doing  she could not bear the weariness and hunger .  sometimes she hoped that the hard ones would destroy her   but only after she was finished .   the hard ones were helpless as long as she was in the rock .  sometimes she sensed them outside the rock in the open .  they were afraid .  sometimes she thought the fear was for her  but that couldn t be .  how could they be afraid for her  afraid that she would pass on out of sheer lack of food  out of sheer exhaustion .  it must be that they  were afraid of her  afraid of a machine that did not work as they had designed it to work  appalled at so great a prodigy  struck helpless with the terror of it  carefully  she avoided them .  she always knew where they were  so they could not catch her nor stop her .   they could not watch all places always .  she thought she could even blank what little perception they had .  she swirled out of the rock and studied the recorded duplicates of the communications they had received from the other universe .  they did not know that was what she was after .  if they hid them  she would find them in whatever new place .  if they destroyed them  it didn t matter .  dua could remember them .   she did not understand them  at first  but with her stay in the rocks  her senses grew steadily sharper  and she seemed to understand without understanding .  without knowing what the symbols meant  they inspired feelings within her .   she picked out markings and placed them where they would be sent to the other universe .  the markings were f e e r .  what that could possibly mean she had no idea  but its shape inspired her with a feeling of fear and she did her best to impress that feeling of fear upon the markings .  perhaps the other creatures  studying the markings  would also feel fear .       when the answers came  dua could sense excitement in them .  she did not always get the answers that were sent sometimes the hard ones found them first .  surely  they must know what she was doing .  still  they couldn t read the messages  couldn t even sense the emotions that went along with them .   so she didn t care .  she would not be stopped  till she was done   whatever the hard ones found out .   she waited for a message that would carry the feeling she wanted .  it came  p u m p b a d .   it carried the fear and hatred she wanted .  she sent it back in extended form   more fear   more hatred    now the other people would understand .  now they would stop the pump .  the hard ones would have to find some other way  some other source of energy  they must not obtain it through the death of all those thousands of other universe creatures .   she was resting too much  declining into a kind of stupor  within the rock .  desperately she craved food and waited so that she could crawl out .  even more desperately than she wanted the food in the storage battery  she wanted the storage battery to be dead .  she wanted to suck the last bit of food out of it and know that no more would come and that her task was done .   she emerged at last and remained recklessly long  sucking in the contents of one of the batteries .  she wanted to withdraw its last  empty it  see that no more was entering    but it was an endless source   endless   endless .   she stirred and drew away from the battery in disgust the positron pumps were still going then .  had her messages not persuaded the other universe creatures to stop the pumps .  had they not received them .  had they not sensed their meaning .   she had to try again .  she had to make it plain beyond plain .  she would include every combination of signals that to her seemed to carry the feeling of danger  every combination that would get across the plea to stop .   desperately she began to fuse the symbols into metal  drawing without reserve on the energy she had just sucked out of the battery  drawing on it till it was all gone and she was more weary than ever  pump not stop not stop we not stop pump we not hear danger not hear not hear you stop please stop you stop so we stop please you stop danger danger danger danger stop stop you stop pump .   it was all she could .  there was nothing left in her but a racking pain .  she placed the message where it could be transferred and she did not wait for the hard ones to send the message unwittingly .  through an agonizing haze  she manipulated the controls as she had seen them do  finding the energy for it somehow .   the message disappeared and so did the cavern in a purple shimmer of vertigo .  she was   passing on   out of sheer   exhaustion .   odeen   tri        b      odeen came .  he had been flowing faster than ever he had flowed before .  he had been following tritt s sharp new baby sense perception  but now he was close enough for his own blunter senses to detect her nearness .  he could on his own account feel the flickering and fading consciousness of dua  and he raced forward while tritt did his best to clump along  gasping and calling   faster   faster      odeen found her in a state of collapse  scarcely alive  smaller than he had ever seen an adult emotional .    tritt   he said   bring the battery here .  no   no    don t try to carry her .  she s too thin to carry .  hurry .  if she sinks into the floor      the hard ones began to gather .  they were late  of course  with their inability to sense other life forms at a distance .  if it had depended only on them  it would have been too late to save her .  she would not have passed on  she would truly have been destroyed   and   and more than she knew would have been destroyed with her .   now  as she was slowly gathering life out of the energy supply  the hard ones stood silently near them .   odeen rose  a new odeen who knew what was happening exactly .  imperiously  he ordered them away with an angry gesture   and they left .  silently .  without objection .   dua stirred .   tritt said   is she all right  odeen .     quiet  tritt   said odeen .   dua .     odeen .   she stirred  spoke in a whisper .   i thought i had passed on .     not yet  dua .  not yet .  but first you must eat and rest .     is tritt here  too .     here i am  dua   said tritt .    don t try to bring me back   said dua .   it s over  i   ve done what i wanted to do .  the positron pump will   will stop soon  i m sure .  the hard ones will continue to need soft ones and they will take care of you two  or at least the children .    odeen didn t say anything .  he kept tritt from saying anything  either .  he let the radiation pour slowly into dua  very slowly .  he stopped at times to let her rest a bit  then he started again .   she began to mutter   enough .  enough .   her substance was writhing more strongly .   still he fed her .   finally  he spoke .  he said   dua  you were wrong .  we are not machines .  i know exactly what we are  .  i would have come to you sooner  if i had found out earlier  but i didn t know till losten begged me to think .  and i did  very hard  and even so it is almost premature .    dua moaned and odeen stopped for a while .   he said   listen  dua .  there is a single species of life .  the hard ones are the only living things in the world .  you gathered that  and so far you were right .  but that doesn t mean the soft ones aren t alive  it merely means we are part of the same single species .  the soft ones are the immature forms of the hard ones .  we are first children as soft ones  then adults as soft ones  then hard ones .  do you understand .    tritt said  in soft confusion   what .  what .    odeen said   not now  tritt .  not now .  you ll understand  too  but this is for dua .   he kept watching dua  who was gaining opalescence .   he said   listen  dua  whenever we melt  whenever the triad melts  we become a hard one .  the hard one is three in one  which is why he is hard .  during the time of unconsciousness in melting we are a hard one .  but it is only temporary  and we can never remember the period afterward .  we can never stay a hard one long  we must come back .  but all through our life we keep developing  with certain key stages marking it off .  each baby born marks a key stage .  with the birth of the third  the emotional  there comes the possibility of the final stage  where the rational s mind by itself  without the other two  can remember those flashes of hard one existence .  then  and only then  he can guide a perfect melt that will form the hard one forever  so that the triad can live a new and unified life of learning and intellect .  i told you that passing on was like being born again .  i was groping then for something i did not quite understand  but now i know .    dua was looking at him  trying to smile .  she said   how can you pretend to believe that  odeen .  if that were so  wouldn t the hard ones have told you long ago  told all of us .     they couldn t  dua .  there was a time  long ages ago  when melting was just a putting together of the atoms of bodies .  but evolution slowly developed minds .  listen to me  dua  melting is a putting together of the minds  too  and that s much harder  much more delicate .  to put it together properly and permanently  just so  the rational must reach a certain pitch in development .  that pitch is reached when he finds out  for himself  what it s all about  when his mind is finally keen enough to remember what has happened in all those temporary unions during melting .  if the rational were told  that development would be aborted and the time of the perfect melt could not be determined .  the hard one would form imperfectly .  when losten pleaded with me to think  he was taking a great chance .  even that may have been    i hope not      for it s especially true in our case  dua .  for many generations  the hard ones have been combining triads with great care to form particularly advanced hard ones and our triad was the best they d ever obtained .  especially you  dua .  especially you .  losten was once the triad whose baby mid you were .  part of him was your parental .  he knew you .  he brought you to tritt and me .    dua sat up .  her voice was almost normal .   odeen .  are you making all this up to soothe me .    tritt broke in .   no  dua .  i feel it  too .  i feel it  too .  i don t know what exactly  but i feel it .     he does  dua   said odeen .   you will  too .  aren t you beginning to recall being a hard one during our melt .  don t you want to melt now .  one last time .  one last time .    he lifted her .  there was a feverishness about her  and though she struggled a bit  she was thinning .    if what you say is true  odeen   she gasped .   if we are to be a hard one  then it seems to me you are saying we ll be an important one .  is that so .     the most important .  the best who was ever formed .  i mean that  .   .   .  tritt  over there .  it s not good by  tritt .  we ll be together  as we always wanted to be .  dua  too .  you  too  dua .    dua said   then we can make estwald understand the pump can t continue .  we ll force      the melting was beginning .  one by one  the hard ones were entering again at the crucial moment .  odeen saw them imperfectly  for he was beginning to melt into dua .   it was not like the other times  no sharp ecstasy  just a smooth  cool  utterly peaceful movement .  he could feel himself become partly dua  and all the world seemed pouring into his her sharpening senses .  the positron pumps were still going   he she could tell   why were they still going .   he was tritt  too  and a keen sharp sense of bitter loss filled his her his mind .  oh  my babies     and he cried out  one last cry under the consciousness of odeen  except that somehow it was the cry of dua .   no  we can t stop estwald .  we are estwald .  we       the cry that was dua s and yet not dua s stopped and there was no longer any dua  nor would there ever be dua again .  nor odeen .  nor tritt .        abc      estwald stepped forth and said sadly to the waiting hard ones  by way of vibrating air waves   i am permanently with you now  and there is much to do                  .   .   .  contend in vain .              selene lindstrom smiled brightly and walked with the light springy touch that was startling when first seen by the tourists  but was soon recognized as having a grace of its own .    it s time for lunch   she said  cheerfully .   all home grown  ladies and gentlemen .  you may not be used to the taste  but it s all nourishing .  .   .   .  right here  sir .  you won t mind sitting with the ladies  i know .   .   .   .  one moment .  there will be seats for all .  .  .  .  sorry  there will be a choice on the beverage  but not on the main course .  that will be veal .   .  .   no  no .  artificial flavor and texture  but it s really quite good .    then she sat down herself  with a slight sigh and an even slighter wavering of her pleasant expression .   one of the group sat down across from her    do you mind .   he asked .   she looked at him  quickly  penetrating .  she had the faculty of making quick judgments  of course  and he did not seem troublesome .  she said   not at all .  but aren t you with someone in this group .    he shook his head .   no .  i m alone .  even if that were not the case  earthies are no great thrill to me .    she looked at him again .  he was fiftyish and there was  a weary look about him which only his bright  inquisitive eyes seemed to belie .  he had the unmistakable look of the earthman  laden down with gravity .  she said     earthie  is a moon expression  and not a very nice one .     i m from earth   he said   so i can use it without offense  i hope .  unless you object .    selene shrugged as though to say  please yourself .   she had the faintly oriental look about the eyes so many of the moon girls had  but her hair was the color of honey and her nose was prominent .  she was undeniably attractive without being in any way classically beautiful .   the earthman was staring at the nameplate she wore on the blouse covering the upper slope of her high  not too large left breast .  she decided it was really the name plate he was looking at  not the breast  though the blouse was semi transparent when it caught the light at a particular angle and there was no garment beneath it .   he said   are there many selenes here .     oh  yes .  hundreds  i think .  also cynthias  dianas  and artemises .  selene is a little tiresome .  half the selenes i know are called  silly  and the other half  lena .       which are you .     neither .  i am selene  all three syllables .  sell uh nee   she said  coming down heavily on the first syllable   to those who use my first name at all .    there was a small smile on the earthman s face that sat there as though he weren t quite used to it .  he said   and what if anyone asks you if you sell any  selene .     they never ask me that again .   she said  firmly .    but do they ask you .     there are fools always .    a waitress had reached their table and had placed the dishes before them with quick  smooth motions .   the earthman was visibly impressed .  he said to the waitress   you make them seem to float down .    the waitress smiled and moved on .   selene said   don t you try to do the same .  she s used to the gravity and can handle it .     and if i try  i ll drop everything .  is that it .     you ll make a gorgeous mess   she said    well  i won t try .     there s a good chance someone will before long  and the plate will flow down to the floor and they ll grab for it and miss  and ten to one knock themselves out of their chair .  i d warn them  but it never helps and they re just all the more embarrassed .  everyone else will laugh   the tourists  that is  because the rest of us have seen it too often to find it funny and because it s just a cleanup job .    the earthman was lifting his fork carefully .   i see what you mean .  even the simplest motions seem queer .     actually  you get used to it quickly enough .  at least to little things like eating .  walking is harder .  i never saw an earthman run efficiently out here .  not really efficiently .    for a while they ate in silence .  then he said   what does the l .  stand for .   he was looking at her nameplate again .  it said   selene lindstrom l .     it just means luna   she said  rather indifferently   to distinguish me from the immigrants .  i was born here .     really .     that s nothing to be surprised about .  we ve had a working society here for over half a century .  don t you think babies are born here .  we have people here who were born here and are grandparents .     how old are you .     thirty two   she said .   he looked startled  then mumbled   of course .    selene raised her eyebrows .   you mean you understand .  most earthmen have to have it explained .    the earthman said   i know enough to know that most of the visible signs of aging are the result of the inexorable victory of gravity over tissue   the sagging of cheek and the drooping of breast .  with the moon s gravity one sixth that of earth  it isn t really hard to understand that people will stay young looking .    selene said   only young looking .  it doesn t mean we have immortality here .  the life span is about that of earth  but most of us are more comfortable in old age .     that s not to be dismissed .   .  .  .  of course  there are penalties  i suppose .   he had just taken his first sip of his coffee .   you have to drink this     he paused for a word and must have discarded it  for he used none .    we could import food and beverages from earth   she said  amused   but only enough to feed a fraction of us a fraction of the time .  there d be no point to that when we can use the space for more vital items .  besides  we re used to this crud .   .  .  .  or were you going to use a still stronger word .     not for the coffee   he said .   i was going to save that for the food .  but crud will do .   .   .   .  tell me   miss lindstrom .  i didn t see any mention on the tour itinerary of the proton synchrotron .     the proton synchrotron .   she was finishing her coffee and her eyes were beginning to slide round the room  as though estimating the moment for getting them all to their feet again .   that s terrestrial property and it s not open to tourists .     you mean that it s off limits to lunarites .     oh  no .  nothing of the sort .  most of its staff are lunarites .  it s just that it s the terrestrial government that sets the rules .  no tourists .     i d love to see it   he said .   she said   i m sure you would .   .   .   .  you ve brought me luck  not one item of food  not one blessed man or woman has hit the floor .    she got to her feet and said   ladies and gentlemen  we ll be leaving in about ten minutes .  please leave the plates where they are .  there are rest rooms for those who wish to use them and then we will visit the food processing plants where meals such as you have just eaten are made possible .               selene s quarters were small  of course  and compact  but they were intricate .  the windows were panoramic  star scenes that changed slowly and very randomly  never having any relationship to any real constellation .  each of the three windows could be made to undergo telescopic magnification  when selene so desired .   barren neville hated that part of it .  he would tend to turn it off rather savagely and say   how can you stand it .  you re the only one i know who has the bad taste to do such a thing .  it s not as though these nebulae and star clusters exist  even .    and selene would shrug  coolly  and say   what s existence .  how do you know the ones out there exist .  besides it gives me a sensation of freedom and motion .  may i have that in my own quarters if i choose .    then neville would mumble something and make a halfhearted attempt to restore the controls to where he had found them and selene would say   let it go .    the furniture was in smooth curves  and the walls were abstractly decorated in low key  unobtrusive colors .  nowhere was there any representation of anything that might be considered a living thing .    living things are earth   selene would say   not the moon .    now  when she entered  she found  as so often  neville there  barron neville  resting on the flimsy couch with one sandal on .  the other lay beside him where it had dropped  and there was a line of red marks on his abdomen  just over his umbilicus  where he had been meditatively scratching .   she said   get us some coffee  won t you  barron .   and slipped out of her own clothes in a long  graceful wiggle accompanied by a sigh of relief  letting them drop to the ground and then kicking them into the corner with one toe .    what a relief to get out of them   she said .   it s the worst part of the job  having to dress like an earthie .    neville was in the kitchen corner .  he paid no attention  he had heard it before .  he said   what s wrong with your water supply .  it s way down .     is it .   she asked .   well  i ve been overusing  i suppose .  just be patient .     any trouble  today .    selene shrugged .   no .  very run of the mill .  just the usual bit about watching them teetering along and pretending they don t hate the food  and knowing they re wondering if they ll be asked to take off their clothes  i shouldn t be surprised .  .  .  .  disgusting possibility .     are you taking up prudery .   he brought the two small cups of coffee to the table .    in this case prudery is required .  they re wrinkled  sagging  paunchy  and full of germs .  i don t care what the quarantine regulations are like  they re full of germs .   .   .   .  what s new on your side .    barron shook his head .  he was heavily built for a lunarite  and there was an almost sullen narrowing of his eyes that had become a built in feature .  except for that his features were even  and remarkably handsome  selene thought .   he said   nothing startling .  we re still waiting out the change in commissioner .  we ll have to see what this gottstein is like .     can he make difficulties .     none more than are being made .  after all  what can they do .  they can t infiltrate .  you can t disguise an earthie as a lunarite .   but he looked uneasy just the same .   selene sipped at her coffee and looked at him shrewdly .   some lunarites might be earthies inside .     yes  and i d like to know which .  sometimes i don t think i can trust    oh  well .  i m wasting incredible amounts of time with my synchrotron project and getting nowhere .  i m having no luck with priorities .     they probably don t trust you  and i don t blame them .  if only you didn t slink around so conspiratorially .     i do no such thing .  it would give me great pleasure to walk out of the synchrotron room and never return  but then they would become suspicious .   .  .  .  if you ve been raising hell with your water supply  selene  i suppose we can t have a second cup .     no  we can t .  but if it conies to that  you ve been helping me waste water .  you ve had two showers here in the last week .     i ll give you a water credit .  i didn t know you were counting .     i m not counting   my water level is .    she finished her own cup of coffee and stared at its emptiness thoughtfully .  she said   they always make faces over it .  the tourists do .  and i can never figure out why  either .  it tastes fine to me .  did you ever taste earth coffee  barron .     no   he said  briefly .    i did .  once .  some tourist had smuggled in packets  of what he called instant coffee .  he offered me some in exchange for you know what .  seemed to think it was an even trade .     and you had some .     i was curious .  it was bitter and metallic .  i hated it .  then i told him that miscegenation was against lunarite custom and he turned rather bitter and metallic himself .     you never told me this .  he didn t try anything  did he .     it s not particularly your business  is it .  and  no  he didn t try anything .  if he had tried  at the wrong gravity for him  i d have bounced him from here to corridor   .    then she went on .   oh  yes .  i picked up another earthie today .  insisted on sitting with me .     and what did he offer you in exchange for the screwing you so delicately call you know what .     just sat there .     and stared at your breasts .     they re there to be stared at  but actually he didn t he stared at my nameplate .   .   .   .  besides  what s it to you what he fantasied .  fantasies are free and i don t have to fulfill them .  what do you think i   m fantasying .  bed with an earthman .  with all the action you would expect of someone trying to handle a gravitational field he isn t used to .  i wouldn t say it hasn t been done  but not by me  and not that i ve ever heard any good of it .  is that settled .  can i get back to the earthie .  who s nearly fifty .  and who obviously wasn t terrifically handsome even when he was twenty .   .  .   .  interesting appearance  though  i ll grant him that .     all right .  i can do without a thumbnail sketch .  what about him .     he asked about the proton synchrotron .    neville rose to his feet  swaying a little as was almost inevitable after quick movement at low gravity .     what did he ask about the synchrotron .     nothing .  why are you so excited .  you asked me to tell you anything that was out of the way with any tourist at any time and this seemed out of the way .  no one ever asked me about the synchrotron before .     all right  he paused a little  then in a normal voice  said   why was he interested in the synchrotron .    selene said   i haven t the faintest idea .  he just asked if he could see it .  it could be that he s a tourist with an interest in science .  for all i know  it was just a ploy to get me interested in him .     and i suppose you are .  what s his name .     i don t know .  i didn t ask him .     why not .     because i   m not interested in him .  which way do you want it to be .  besides  his asking shows he s a tourist .  if he were a physicist  he wouldn t have to ask .  he s be there .     my dear selene   said neville .   let me spell it out .  under the present circumstances  anyone who asks to see the proton synchrotron is a peculiar fellow we want to know about .  and why should he ask you .   he walked hastily to the other end of the room and back as though wearing off a little energy .  then he said   you re the expert at that nonsense .  do you find him of interest .     sexually .     you know what i mean .  don   t play games  selene .    selene said with clear reluctance .   he s interesting  even disturbing .  but i don t know why .  he said nothing .  he did nothing .     interesting and disturbing  is he .  then you will see him again .     and do what .     how do i know .  that s your bit .  find out his name .  find out anything else you can .  you ve got some brains  so use them on a little practical nosiness for a change .     oh  well   she said   orders from on high .  all right .               there was no way of telling the commissioner s quarters  by size alone  from those of any lunarite .  there was no space on the moon  not even for terrestrial officials  no luxurious waste  even as a symbol of the home planet .  nor  for that matter  was there any way of changing the overwhelming fact about the moon   that it was underground at low gravity   even for the greatest earthman who ever lived .    man is still the creature of his environment   sighed luiz montez .   i ve been two years on the moon and there have been times when i have been tempted to stay on but    i m getting on in years .  i ve just passed my fortieth and if i intend ever to go back to earth  it had better be now .  any older and i won t be able to readjust to full gravity .    konrad gottstein was only thirty four and looked  if anything  younger .  he had a wide  round  large featured face  the kind of face one didn t see among the lunarites  the kind of face that was something they would draw as part of an earthie caricature .  he was not heavily built   it did not pay to send heavily built earthmen to the moon    and his head seemed too large for his body .   he said  and he spoke planetary standard with a perceptibly different accent from that of montez    you sound apologetic     i am .  i am   said montez .  where gottstein s face was intrinsically good natured in appearance  the long thin lines of montez  face were almost comically tragic .   i am apologetic in both senses .  i am embarrassed to be leaving the moon  since it is an attractive world filled with excitement .  and i am embarrassed about the embarrassment  ashamed that i should be reluctant to take up earth s  burden   gravity and all .     yes  i imagine taking back the other five sixths will be hard   said gottstein .   i ve been on the moon only a few days and already i feel that one sixth g is perfectly fine .     you won t feel that when the constipation starts and you start living on mineral oil   said montez with a sigh   but that will pass .   .   .   .  and don t think you can imitate the light gazelle just because you feel light .  there s an art to it .     so i understand .     so you think you understand  gottstein .  you haven t seen the kangaroo walk  have you .     on television .     that doesn t really give you the feel of it .  you have to try it .  it s the proper mode for crossing level lunar surface at high speed .  the feet move together backward and launch you on what would be a simple broad jump on earth .  while you re in mid air  they come forward  begin moving back just before they hit the ground again  keep you launched  and so on .  the motion seems slow by earth standards with only a low gravity whipping you on  but each leap is in excess of twenty feet and the amount of muscular effort required to keep you in the air   if there were air   is minimal .  the sensation is like flying       have you tried it .  can you do it .     i ve tried it  but no earthman can really do it .  i ve kept it up for as many as five leaps in a row  enough to get the sensation  just enough to want to do more  but then there is the inevitable miscalculation  a loss of synchronization  and you tumble and slide for a quarter of a mile .  the lunarites are polite and never laugh at you .  of course  it s easy for them .  they start as children and pick it up at once without trouble .     it s their world   said gottstein  chuckling .   think how they d be on earth .     they wouldn t be on earth .  they can t .  i suppose that s an advantage on our side .  we can be either on moon or on earth  they can live only on the moon .  we tend to forget that because we confuse the lunarites with immies .     with what .     that s what they call the earth immigrants  those who live on the moon more or less permanently but were born and raised on the earth .  the immigrants can  of course  return to the earth  but the real lunarites have neither the bones nor the muscles to withstand the earth s gravity .  there were some tragedies in that respect in the moon s early history .     oh .     oh  yes .  people who returned with their moon born children .  we tend to forget .  we ve had our own crisis and a few dying children don t seem important in the light of the huge casualties of the late twentieth and all that followed .  here on the moon  though  every dead lunarite who succumbed to the gravity of earth is remembered .  .  .  .  it helps them feel a world apart  i think .    gottstein said   i thought i had been thoroughly briefed on earth  but it seems i will still have a lot to learn .     impossible to learn everything about the moon from a post on earth  so i have left you a full report as my predecessor did for me .  you ll find the moon fascinating and  in some ways  excruciating .  i doubt that you ve eaten lunar rations on earth and if you re going by description only  you will not be prepared for the reality .   .   .   .  but you ll have to learn to like it .  it s bad policy to ship earth items here .  we ve got to eat and drink the local products .     you ve been doing it for two years .  i guess i ll survive     i   ve not been doing it steadily .  there are periodic furloughs to earth .  those are obligatory  whether you want them or not .  they ve told you that  i m sure .     yes   said gottstein .    despite any exercises you do here  you will have to subject yourself to full gravity now and then just to remind your bones and muscles what it s like .  and when you re on earth  you   ll eat .  and occasionally  some food is smuggled gottstein said   my luggage was carefully inspected  of course  but it turned out there was a can of corned beef in my coat pocket .  i had overlooked it .  so did they .    montez smiled slowly and said  hesitantly   i suspect you are now going to offer to share it .     no   said gottstein  judiciously  wrinkling his large button nose .   i was going to say with all the tragic nobility i could muster   here  montez  have it all .  thy need is greater than mine .    he stumbled a bit in trying to say this  since he rarely used second person singular in planetary standard .   montez smiled more broadly  and then let it vanish .  he shook his head .   no .  in a week  i ll have all the earth food i can eat .  you won t .  your mouthfuls will be few in the next few years and you will spend too much time regretting your present generosity .  you keep it all .   .  .  .  i insist .  i would but be earning your hatred ex post facto .    he seemed serious  his hand on the other s shoulder  his eyes looking straight into gottstein s .   besides   he said   there is something i want to talk to you about that i ve been putting off because i don t know how to approach it and this food would be an excuse for further sidetracking .    gottstein put away the earth can at once .  there was no way in which his face could match the other s seriousness  but his voice was grave and steady   is there something you could not put into your dispatches  montez .     there was something nitride to put in  gottstein  but between my not knowing how to phrase it and earth s reluctance to grasp my meaning  we ended up not communicating .  you may do better .  i hope you do .  one of the reasons i have not asked to have my tour of duty extended is that i can no longer take the responsibility of my failure to communicate .     you make it sound serious .     i wish i could make it sound serious .  frankly  it sounds silly .  there are only some ten thousand people in the lunar colony .  rather less than half are native lunarites .  they re hampered by an insufficiency of resources  an insufficiency of space  a harsh world  and yet   and yet       and yet .   said gottstein  encouragingly .    there is something going on here   i don t know exactly what   which may be dangerous .     how can it be dangerous .  what can they do .  make war against the earth .   gottstein s face trembled on the brink of a smile crease .    no  no .  it s more subtle than that .   montez passed his hand over his face  rubbing his eyes petulantly .   let me be frank with you .  earth has lost its nerve .     what does that mean .     well  what would you call it .  just about the time the lunar colony was being established  earth went through the great crisis .  i don t have to tell you about that .      no  you don t   said gottstein  with distaste .    the population is two billion now from its six billion peak .     earth is much better for that  isn t it .     oh  undoubtedly  though i wish there had been a better way of achieving the drop .   .   .   .  but it s left behind a permanent distrust of technology  a vast inertia  a lack of desire to risk change because of the possible side effects .  great and possibly dangerous efforts have been abandoned because the danger was feared more than greatness was desired .     i take it you refer to the program on genetic engineering .     that s the most spectacular case of course  but not the only one   said montez  bitterly .    frankly  i can t get excited over the abandonment of genetic engineering .  it was a tissue of failures .     we lost our chance at intuitionism .     there has never been any evidence that intuitionism is desirable  and considerable indications of its undesirability .   .   .   .  besides what about the lunar colony itself .  this certainly is no indication of stagnation on earth .     it is   said montez  vigorously .   the lunar colony is a hangover  a last remnant of the period before the crisis  something that was carried through as a last sad forward  thrust of mankind before the great retreat .     that s too dramatic  montez     i don t think so .  the earth has retreated .  mankind has retreated  everywhere but on the moon .  the lunar colony is man s frontier not just physically  but psychologically  too .  here is a world that doesn t have a web of life to disrupt  that doesn t have a complex environment in delicate balance to upset .  everything on the moon that is of any use to man is man made .  the moon is a world constructed by man from the start and out of basics .  there is no past .     well .     on earth  we are unmanned by our longing for a pastoral past that never really existed  and that  if it had existed  could never exist again .  in some respects  much of the ecology was disrupted in the crisis and we are making do with the remnants so that we are frightened  always frightened .   .   .   .  on the moon  there is no past to long for or dream about .  there is no direction but forward .    montez seemed to be catching fire with his own words .  he said   gottstein  i have watched it for two years  you will watch it for at least that much longer .  there is a fire here on the moon  a restless burning .  they expand in every direction .  they expand physically .  every month  new corridors are bored  new living quarters established  a new population potential made room for .  they expand as far as resources are concerned .  they find new construction materials  new water sources  new lodes of specialized minerals .  they expand their sun power battery banks  enlarge their electronics factories .   .  .  .  i suppose you know that these ten thousand people here on the moon are now the major source for earth s supply of mini electronic devices and fine biochemicals .     i know they re an important source .     earth lies to itself for comfort s sake .  the moon is the major source .  at the present rate  it may become the sole source in the near future .   .   .   .  it s growing intellectually  too .  gottstein  i imagine there isn t a bright science oriented youngster on earth who doesn t vaguely   or perhaps not so vaguely   dream of going  to the moon one day .  with earth in retreat from technology  the moon is where the action is .     you re referring to the proton synchrotron  i suppose .     that s one example .  when was the last new synchrotron built on earth .  but it s just the biggest and most dramatic item  not the only or even the most important .  if you want to know the most important scientific device on the moon        something so secret i haven t been told .     no  something so obvious that no one seems to notice .  it s the ten thousand brains here .  the ten thousand best human brains there are .  the only close knit group of ten thousand human brains that are  in principle and by emotion  science oriented .    gottstein moved restlessly and tried to shift his chair s position .  it was bolted to the floor and wouldn t move  but in the attempt to do so  gottstein found himself skittering out of the chair .  montez reached out an arm to steady him .   gottstein flushed .   sorry .     you   ll get used to the gravity .    gottstein said   but aren t you making it out a lot worse than it is .  earth isn t a know nothing planet altogether .  we did develop the electron pump .  that s a purely terrestrial accomplishment .  no lunarite had anything to do with it .    montez shook his head and muttered a few words in his native spanish .  they didn t sound like placid words .  he said   have you ever met frederick hallam .    gottstein smiled .   yes  as a matter of fact i have .  the father of the electron pump .  i believe he has the phrase tattooed on his chest .     the mere fact that you smile and make that remark proves my point  really .  ask yourself  could a man like hallam really have fathered the electron pump .  for the unthinking multitude  the story will do  but the fact is   and you must know it if you stop to think about it    there is no father to the electron pump .  the para people    e people in the para universe  whoever they are and whatever that is  invented it .  hallam was their accidental instrument .  all of earth is their accidental instrument .     we were clever enough to take advantage of their initiative .     yes  as cows are clever enough to eat the hay we provide for them .  the pump is no sign that man is forward looking .  quite the reverse .     if the pump is a backward step  then i say good for backwardness .  i wouldn t want to do without it .     who would .  but the point is it fits earth s present mood perfectly .  infinite energy at virtually zero cost  except for maintenance  and with zero pollution besides .  but there are no electron pumps on the moon .    gottstein said   i imagine there s no need for them .  the solar batteries supply what the lunarites require .  infinite energy at virtually zero cost  except for maintenance  and with zero pollution besides .  .  .  .  isn t that the litany .     yes  indeed  but the solar batteries are entirely man made .  that s the point i m making .  an electron pump was projected for the moon  installation was attempted .     and .     and it didn t work .  the para people didn t accept the tungsten .  nothing happened .     i didn t know that .  why not .    montez lifted his shoulders and eyebrows expressively .   how is one to know .  we might assume  for instance  that the para people live on a world without a satellite  that they have no conception of separate worlds in close proximity  each populated  that  having found one  they did not seek another .  who knows .    the point is  that the para people didn t bite and we ourselves  without them  could do nothing .     we ourselves   repeated gottstein  thoughtfully .   by that  you mean the earthmen .     yes .     and the lunarites .     they were not involved .     were they interested .     i don t know .  that s where my uncertainty   and fear   chiefly rests .  the lunarites   the native lunarites  particularly   do not feel like earthmen .  i don t know what their plans are or what they intend .  i can t find out .    gottstein looked thoughtful .   but what can they do .  do you have any reason to suppose they intend to do us harm  or that they can do earth harm even if they intend it .     i can t answer that question .  they are an attractive and intelligent people .  it seems to me they lack real hatred or real rage or even real fear .  but perhaps that is what only seems to me .  what bothers me most is that i don t know .     the scientific equipment on the moon is run by earth  i believe .     that is correct .  the proton synchrotron is .  the radio telescope on the trans terrestrial side is .  the three hundred inch optical telescope is .   .  .  .  the large equipment  that is  all of which has been in existence for fifty years .     and what s been done since .     very little by earthmen .     what about the lunarites .     i m not sure .  their scientists work in the large installations  but i once tried to check time cards .  there are gaps .     gaps .     they spend considerable time away from the large installations .  it is as though they had laboratories of their own .     well  if they produce mini electronic devices and fine bio chemicals  isn t that to be expected .     yes  but    gottstein  i don t know .  i fear my ignorance .    there was a moderately long pause .  gottstein said   montez  i take it you are telling me all this so that i will be careful  so that i will try to find out what the lunarites are doing .     i suppose that s about it   said montez  unhappily .    but you don t even know that they re doing anything at all .     i feel that they are .    gottstein said   it   s odd  then .  i should be trying to talk you out of all this fearful mysticism of yours   but it s odd       what is .     the same vessel that brought me to the moon brought someone else to the moon .  i mean  a large party came  but one face in particular triggered something .  i didn t talk to him   had no occasion to   and i dismissed the matter .  but now our talk is pushing a button  and he suddenly comes back to mind       yes .     i was on a committee once that dealt with electron pump matters .  a question of safety .   he smiled briefly .   earth s lost nerve  you might say .  we worry about safety everywhere   and a good thing  damn it  lost nerve or not .  the details escape me but in connection with that hearing  i saw that face that now i saw on the vessel .  i m convinced of it .     does that have significance  do you think .     i m not sure .  i associate that face with something disturbing .  if i keep on thinking  it may come back to me .  in any case  i had better get a list of the passengers and see if any name means something to me .  too bad  montez  but i think you re getting me started .     not bad at all   said montez .   i m glad of it .  as for this man  it may be he is only a tourist of no consequence and will be gone in two weeks  but i am glad to have you thinking about the matter      gottstein did not seem to be listening .   he is a physicist  or a scientist of some sort   he muttered .   i m certain of it and i associate him with danger                  hello   said selene  cheerfully .   the earthman turned around .  recognition took almost no time at all .   selene .  am i right .  selene .     right .  correctly pronounced .  are you enjoying yourself .    the earthman said gravely   very much .  it makes me realize how unique our century is .  it was not so long ago i was on earth  feeling tired of my world  tired of myself .  then i thought  well  if i were living a hundred years ago  the only way i could leave the world would be to die  but now   i can go to the moon .   he smiled without real gaiety .   selene said   are you happier now that you are on the moon .     a little .   he looked about .   don t you have a crowd of tourists to take care of .     not today   she said  cheerfully .   it s my day off .  who knows  i may take two or three .  it s a dull job .     what a shame  then  that you bump into a tourist on your day off .     i didn t bump into you .  i came looking for you .  and a hard job that was  too .  you shouldn t wander off by yourself .    the earthman looked at her with interest .   why should you look for me .  are you fond of earthmen .     no   she said  with easy frankness .   i m sick of them .  i dislike them on principle and being constantly associated with them in my job makes it worse .     yet you come looking for me and there isn t a way on earth   on the moon  i mean   that i can convince myself i am young and handsome .     even if you were  it wouldn t help .  earthmen don t interest me  as everyone but barren knows .     then why do you come looking for me .     because there are other ways of being interested and because barton is interested .     and who is barron .  your boyfriend .    selene laughed .   barron neville .  he s a lot more than a boy and a lot more than a friend .  we have sex when we feel like it .     well  that s what i meant .  do you have children .     one boy .  he s ten .  he spends most of his time in the boys  compound .  to spare you the next question  he s not barron s .  i may have a child by barron if we re still together when i m assigned another child   if i   m assigned another child .  .  .  .  i am pretty sure i will be .     you re quite frank .     about things i don t consider secret .  of course .   .   .   .  now what would you like to do .    they had been walking along a corridor of milk white rock  into the glazed surface of which were inset dusky bits of  moon gems  that lay about for the taking in most sections of the lunar surface .  she wore sandals which scarcely seemed to touch the ground  he wore thick soled boots which leadenly helped weigh him down to keep his steps from becoming torture .   the corridor was one way .  occasionally  a small electric cart would overtake them and move nearly silently past .   the earthman said   now what would i like to do .  that is a broad beamed invitation .  would you like to set boundary conditions so that my answers will not innocently offend you .     are you a physicist .    the earthman hesitated .   why do you ask .     just to hear what you would say .  i know you re a physicist .     how .     no one says  set boundary conditions  unless they are .   especially if the first thing they want to see on the moon is the proton synchrotron .     is that why you ve come looking for me .  because i seem to be a physicist .     that s why barron sent me looking for you .  because he   s a physicist .  i came because i thought you were rather unusual for an earthman .     in what way .     nothing terribly complimentary   if it s compliments you re fishing for .  it s just that you seem not to like earth men .     how can you tell that .     i watched you look at the others in the party .  besides  i can always tell somehow .  it s the earthies who don t like earthies who tend to stay on the moon .  which brings me back to the question .  .  .  .  what would you like to do .  and i ll set the boundary conditions .  i mean as far as sightseeing is concerned .    the earthman looked at her sharply .   that s peculiar  selene .  you have a day off .  your job is sufficiently uninteresting or distasteful so that you are glad to have the day off and would be willing to make it two or three .  yet your way of spending it is to volunteer to resume your job for me particularly .  .  .  .  just because of a little interest .     barron s interest .  he s busy now and there s no harm in entertaining you until he s ready .   .   .   .  besides  it s different .  can t you see it s different .  on my job i m riding herd on a couple of dozen earthies    don t you mind my using the term .     i use it myself .     because you re an earthman .  some earth people consider it a term of derision and resent it when a lunarite uses it .     you mean when a lunie uses it .    selene flushed .  she said   yes .  that s about it .     well  then  let s neither of us cry out at words .  go ahead  you were telling me about your job .     on my job  there are these earthies whom i have to keep from killing themselves and whom i have to take here and there and give little speeches to and make sure they eat and drink and walk by the book .  they see their little pet sights and do their little pet things  and i have to be terribly polite and motherly .     awful   said the earthman .    but you and i can do as we please  i hope  and you are willing to take your chances and i don t have to watch what i say .     i told you that you re perfectly welcome to call me earthie .     all right  then .  i ll have a busman s holiday .  what would you like to do .     that s an easy one to answer .  i want to see the proton synchrotron .     not that maybe barren can arrange it after you see him .     well  if i can t see the synchrotron  i don t know what else there is to see .  i know the radio telescope is on the other side and i don t suppose there s any novelty in it  anyway .   .  .  .  you tell me .  what doesn t the average tourist get to see .     a number of things .  there are the algae rooms   not the antiseptic processing plants  which you ve seen   but the farms themselves .  however   . the smell is pretty strong there and i don t suppose an earthie   earthman   would find it particularly appetizing .  earth   men have trouble with the food as it is .     does that surprise you .  have you ever tasted earth food .     not really .  i probably wouldn t like it  though .  it all depends on what you re used to .     i suppose so   said the earthman  sighing .   if you ate a real steak  you d probably gag at the fat and fiber .     we could go to the outskirts where the new corridors are being driven into bedrock  but you ll have to wear special protective garments .  there are the factories       you make the choice  selene .     i will  if you will tell me something honestly .     i can t promise without hearing the question .     i said that earthies that didn t like earthies tended to stay on the moon .  you didn t correct me .  do you intend to stay on the moon .    the earthman stared at the toes of his clumsy boots .  he said   selene  i had trouble getting a visa to the moon .  they said i might be too old for the trip and that if i stayed any length of time i might find it impossible to return to earth .  so i told them i planned to stay on the moon permanently .     you weren t lying .    i wasn t sure at the time .  but i think i ll stay here now .     i should have thought that they would have been less willing than ever to let you go under those conditions .     why .     generally  the earth authorities don t like to send physicists to the moon on a permanent basis .    the earthman s lips twitched .   in that respect  i had no trouble .     well  then  if you re going to be one of us  i think you ought to visit the gymnasium .  earthies often want to but we don t encourage them as a general rule   though it s not forbidden outright immigrants are a different thing .     why .     well  for one thing  we exercise in the nude or near nude .  why not .   she sounded aggrieved  as though weary of repeating a defensive position .   the temperature is controlled  the environment is clean .  it s just that where people from earth are expected to be  nudity becomes unsettling .  some earthies are shocked  some are titillated  and some are both .  well  we re not going to dress in the gymnasium for their sake  and we re not going to cope with them  either  so we keep them out    but immigrants .     they have to get used to it .  in the end  they ll be discarding clothes  too .  and they ll need the gymnasium even more than the native lunarites do .     i ll be honest with you  selene .  if i encounter female nudity  i ll find it titillating  too .  i m not quite so old that i won t    well  titillate  then   she said  indifferently   but to yourself .  agreed .     do we have to get undressed too .   he looked at her with amused interest .    as spectators .  no .  we could  but we don t have to .  you would feel uncomfortable if you did this early in the game and you wouldn t be a particularly inspiring sight to the rest of us       you are frank .     do you think it would be .  be honest and as for myself  i have no wish to put you under a special strain in your private titillation .  so we might both just as well stay clothed .     will there be any objection .  i mean to my being there as an earthie of uninspirational appearance .     not if i m with you .     very well  then  selene .  is it far away .     we are there .  just through here .     ah  then  you were planning to come here all the time .     i thought it might be interesting .     why .    selene smiled suddenly .   i just thought .    the earthman shook his head .   i m beginning to think you never just think .  let me guess .  if i m to stay on the moon  i will need to exercise now and then in order to keep muscles  bones  and all my organs  perhaps  in condition .     quite true .  so do all of us  immigrants from earth in particular .  the day will come when the gymnasium will be a daily grind for you .    they stepped through a door and the earthman stared in astonishment .   this is the first place i ve seen that looks like earth .     in what way .     why it s big .  i didn t imagine you would have such big rooms on the moon .  desks  office machinery  women at the desks       bare breasted women   said selene  gravely .    that part isn t earthlike  i admit .     we ve got a hold chute  too  and an elevator for earthies .  there are many levels .   .   .   .  but wait .    she approached a woman at one of the nearer desks  talking in a rapid  low voice while the earthman stared at everything with amiable curiosity .   selene returned .   no trouble .  and it turns out we re going to have a melee .  a rather good one  i know the teams .     this place is very impressive .  really .     if you still mean its size  it s not nearly big enough .  we have three gymnasiums .  this is the largest .     i m somehow pleased that in the spartan surroundings of the moon  you can afford to waste so much room on frivolity .     frivolity .   selene sounded offended .   why do you think this is frivolity .     melees .  some sort of game .     you might call it a game .  on earth you can do such things for sports  ten men doing  ten thousand watching .  it s not so on the moon  what s frivolous for you is necessary for us   .  .  .  this way  we ll take the elevator  which means a little waiting perhaps .     didn t mean to get you angry .     i m not really angry but you must be reasonable .  you earthmen have been adapted to earth gravity for all the three hundred million years since life crawled onto dry land .  even if you don t exercise  you get by .  we ve had no time at all to adapt to moon gravity .     you look different enough .     if you re born and reared under moon gravity  your bones and muscles are  naturally  slimmer and less massive than an earthie s would be  but that s superficial .  there isn t a bodily function we possess  however subtle    digestion  rates of hormonal secretions   that isn t maladjusted to gravity and that doesn t require a deliberate regimen of exercise .  if we can arrange exercise in the form of fun and games that does not make it frivolity .   .   .   .  here s the elevator .    the earthman hung back in momentary alarm  but selene  said  with residual impatience  as though still seething over the necessity of defense .   i suppose you re going to tell me it looks like a wickerwork basket .  every earthman who uses it says so .  with moon gravity  it doesn t have to be any more substantial .    the elevator moved downward slowly .  they were the only ones on board .   the earthman said   i suspect this isn t much used .    selene smiled again .   you re right .  the hold chute is much more popular  and much more fun .     what is it .     exactly what the name implies .   .   .   .  here we are .  we only had to drop two levels .   .   .   .  it s just a vertical tube you can drop through  with handholds .  we don t encourage earthies to use it .     too risky .     not in itself .  you can climb down as though it were a ladder .  however  there are always youngsters swinging down at considerable speed and earthies don t know how to keep out of the way .  collisions are always discomforting .  but you ll get to use it in time .  .  .  .  in fact  what you ll see now is a kind of large hold chute designed for recklessness .      she led him to a circular railing around which a number of individuals were leaning and talking .  all were more or less in the nude .  sandals were common and usually a hip purse was slung over one shoulder .  some wore briefs .  one was scooping a greenish mash out of a container and was eating it .   the earthman wrinkled his nose slightly as he passed that one .  he said   the dental problem must be severe on the moon .     it isn t good   selene agreed .   if we ever get the chance  we ll select for an edentate jaw .     toothlessness .     maybe not entirely .  we might keep the incisors and canines for cosmetic reasons and for occasionally useful tasks .  they re easily cleaned  too .  but why should we want useless molars .  it s just a hangover from an earthie past .     are you making any progress in that direction .     no   she said  stiffly .   genetic engineering is illegal .  earth insists .    she was leaning over the railing .   they call this the moon s playground   she said .   the earthman looked down .  it was a large cylindrical opening with pink smooth walls to which metal bars were attached in what seemed a random configuration .  here and there  a bar stretched across a portion of the cylinder  sometimes across its entire width .  it was perhaps four or five hundred feet deep and about fifty feet across .   no one seemed to be paying particular attention either to the playground or to the earthman .  some had looked at him indifferently as he passed  seeming to weigh his clothed state  his facial appearance  and then had turned away .  some made a casual hand gesture to selene s direction before turning away  but all turned away .  the no interest signal  however subdued  could not have been more blatant .   the earthman turned to the cylindrical opening .  there were slim figures at the bottom  foreshortened because they were seen from above .  some wore wisps of clothing in red  some in blue .  two teams  he decided .  clearly the wisps served protective functions  since all wore gloves and sandals  protective bands about knees and elbows .  some wore brief bands about the hips  some about the chests .    oh   he muttered .   men and women .    selene said   right .  the sexes compete equally but the idea is to prevent the uncontrolled swinging of parts that might hamper the guided fall .  there s a sexual difference there which also involves vulnerability to pain .  it s not modesty .    the earthman said   i think i ve read of this .     you may have   said selene  indifferently .   not much seems to get out .  not that we have any objection  but the terrestrial government prefers to keep news of the moon to a minimum .     why  selene .     you re an earthman .  you tell me .  .  .  .  our theory hereon the moon is that we embarrass the earth .  or at least  the earth government .    on either side of the cylinder now  two individuals were rising rapidly and the patter of light drumbeats was heard in the background .  at first  the climbers seemed to be going up a ladder  rung by rung  but their speed increased and by the time they were halfway up  they were striking each hold as they passed  making an ostentatious slapping noise .    couldn t do that on earth as gracefully   said the earthman  admiringly .   or at all   he amended .    it s not just low gravity   said selene .   try it  if you think so .  this takes endless hours of practice .    the climbers reached the railing and swung up to a headstand .  they performed a simultaneous somersault and began to fall .    they can move quickly when they want to   said the earthman .    umm   said selene  through the patter of applause .   i suspect that when earthmen   i mean the real earthmen  the ones who have never even visited the moon   think of moving around the moon  they think of the surface and of spacesuits .  that s often slow  of course .  the mass  with the spacesuit added  is huge  which means high inertia and a small gravity to overcome it .     quite right   said the earthman .   i ve seen the classic motion pictures of the early astronauts that all school children see and the movements are like those underwater  the picture gets imprinted  even when we know better .     you d be surprised how fast we can move on the surface these days  spacesuit and all   said selene .   and here  underground  without spacesuits  we can move as quickly as on earth .  the slower whip of gravity is made up for by the proper use of muscles .     but you can move slowly  too .   the earthman was watching the acrobats .  they had gone up with speed and were going down with deliberate slowness .  they were floating  slapping the handholds to delay the drop rather than  as before  to accelerate the rise .  they reached the ground and two others replaced them .  and then two more .   and then two more .  from each team alternately  pairs competed in virtuosity .   each pair went up in unison  each pair rose and fell in a more complicated pattern .  one pair kicked off simultaneously to cross the tube in a low parabola  convex upward  each reaching the handhold the other had abandoned  and somehow skimming past each other in mid air without touching .  that evoked louder applause .   the earthman said   i suspect i lack the experience to appreciate the finer points of skill .  are these all native lunarites .     they have to be   said selene .   the gymnasium is open to all lunar citizens and some immigrants are fairly good  considering .  for this kind of virtuosity  however  you must depend on babies that are conceived and born here .  they have the proper physical adaptation  at least more than native earthmen have  and they get the proper childhood training .  most of these performers are under eighteen .     i imagine it s dangerous  even at moon gravity levels .     broken bones aren t very uncommon .  i don t think there s been an actual death  but there s been at least one case of broken spine and paralysis .  that was a terrible accident  i was actually watching    oh  wait now  we re going to have the ad libs now .     the what .     till now  we ve had set pieces .  the climbs were according to a fixed pattern .    the percussion beat seemed softer as one climber rose and suddenly launched into mid air .  he caught a transverse bar one handed  circling it once vertically  and let  go   the earthman watched closely .  he said   amazing .  he gets around those bars exactly like a gibbon .     a what .   asked selene .    a gibbon .  a kind of ape  in fact  the only ape still existing in the wild .  they     he looked at selene s expression and said   i don t mean it as an insult  selene  they are graceful creatures .    selene said  frowning   i ve seen pictures of apes .     you probably haven t seen gibbons  in motion .   .  .  .  i dare say that earthies might call lunarites  gibbons  and mean it insultingly  about on the level of what you mean by  earthie .   but i don t mean it so .    he leaned both elbows on the railing and watched the movements .  it was like dancing in the air .  he said   how do you treat earth immigrants here on the moon  selene .  j mean immigrants who mean to stay here life long .  since they lack true lunarite abilities       that makes no difference .  immies are citizens .  there s no discrimination  no legal discrimination .     what does that mean .  no legal discrimination .     well  you said it yourself .  there are some things they can t do .  there are differences .  their medical problems are different and they ve usually had a worse medical history .  if they come in middle age  they look   old .    the earthman looked away  embarrassed .   can they intermarry .  i mean  immigrants and lunarites .     certainly .  that is  they can interbreed .     yes  that s what i meant .     of course .  no reason why an immigrant can t have some worthwhile genes .  heavens  my father was an immie  though i m second generation lunarite on my mother s side .     i suppose your father must have come when he was quite   oh  good lord      he froze at the railing  then drew a shuddering sigh .   i thought he was going to miss that bar .     not a chance   said selene .   that s marco fore .  he likes to do that  reach out at the last moment .  actually  it s bad form to do that and a real champion doesn t .  still    my father was twenty two when he arrived .     i suppose that s the way .  still young enough to be adaptable  no emotional complications back on earth .  from the standpoint of the earthie male  i imagine it must be rather nice to have a sexual attachment with a       sexual attachment .   selene s amusement seemed to cover a very real sense of shock .   you don t suppose my father had sex with my mother .  if my mother heard you say that  she d set you right in a hurry .     but       artificial insemination was what it was for goodness sake .  sex with an earthman .    the earthman looked solemn .   i thought you said there was no discrimination .     that s not discrimination .  that s a matter of physical fact .  an earthman can t handle the gravity field properly .  however practiced he might be  under the stress of passion  he might revert .  i wouldn t risk it .  the clumsy fool might snap his arm or leg   or worse  mine .  gene mixtures are one thing  sex is quite another .     i m sorry .   .   .   .  isn t artificial insemination against the law .    she was watching the gymnastics with absorption .   that s marco fore again .  when he isn t trying to be uselessly spectacular  he really is good  and his sister is almost as good .  when they work together it s really a poem of motion .  look at them now .  they ll come together and circle the same bar as though they have a single body stretched across .  he s a little too flamboyant at times  but you can t fault his muscular control .   .   .   .  yes  artificial insemination is against earth s law  but it s allowed where medical reasons are involved  and  of course  that s often the case  or said to be .    au the acrobats had now climbed to the top and were in a great circle just below the railing  all the reds on one side  the blues on the other .  all arms on the side of the interior were raised and the applause was loud .  quite a crowd had now gathered at the rail .    you ought to have some seating arrangement   said the earthman .    not at all .  this isn t a show .  this is exercise .  we don t encourage any more spectators than can stand comfortably about the railing .  we re supposed to be down there  not up here .     you mean you can do that sort of thing  selene .     after a fashion  of course .  any lunarite can .  i m not as good as they are .  i haven t joined any teams    there s going to be the melee now  the free for all .  this is the really dangerous part .  all ten are going to be in the air and each side is going to try to send members of the other side into a fall .     a real fall .     as real as possible .     are there injuries occasionally .     occasionally .  in theory  this sort of thing is frowned upon .  that is considered frivolous  and we don t have so large a population that we can afford to incapacitate anyone without real cause .  still  the melee is popular and we can t raise the votes to outlaw it .     which side do you vote on  selene .    selene blushed .   oh  never mind .  you watch this .    the percussion rhythm had suddenly grown thunderous and each of the individuals in the huge well darted outward like an arrow .  there was wild confusion in mid air  but when they parted again  each ended firmly on a bar grip .  there was the tension of waiting .  one launched  another followed  and the air was filled with flashing bodies again .  over and over it happened .   selene said   the scoring is intricate .  there is a point for every launch  a point for every touch  two points for every miss inflicted  ten points for a grounding  various penalties for various kinds of fouling .     who keeps the score .     there are umpires watching who make the preliminary decisions and there are television tapes in case of appeals .  very often even the tapes can t decide .    there was a sudden excited cry when a girl in blue moved past a boy in red and slapped his flank resoundingly .  the boy who received the blow had writhed away  but not successfully  and grabbing at a wall bar with improper balance struck that wall ungracefully with his knee .    where were his eyes .   demanded selene indignantly .   he didn t see her coming .    the action grew hotter and the earthman tired of trying to make sense of the knotted flights .  occasionally  a leaper touched a bar and did not retain his hold .  those were the times when every spectator leaned over the railing as though ready to launch himself into space in sympathy .  atone time  marco fore was struck in the wrist and someone cried  foul .    fore missed his handhold and fell .  to the earthman s eyes  the fall  under moon gravity  was slow  and fore s lithe body twisted and turned  reaching for bar after bar  without quite making it .  the others waited  as though all maneuvering was suspended during a fall .   fore was moving quite rapidly now  though twice he had slowed himself without quite being able to maintain a handhold .   he was nearly to the ground when a sudden spidery lunge caught a transverse bar with the right leg and he hung suspended and swinging  head downward  about ten feet above the ground .  arms outspread  he paused while the applause rang out and then he had twisted upright and jumped into a rapid climb .   the earthman said   was he fouled .     if jean wong actually grabbed marco s wrist instead of pushing it  it was a foul .  the umpire has ruled a fair block  however  and i don t think marco will appeal .  he fell a lot farther than he had to .  he likes these last minute saves and someday he ll miscalculate and hurt himself .  .  .  .  oh  oh .    the earthman looked up in sudden inquiry  but selene s eyes weren t upon him .  she said   that s someone from the commissioner s office and he must be looking for you .     why       i don t see why he should come here to find anyone else .  you re the unusual one .     but there s no reason     began the earthman .   yet the messenger  who had the build of an earthman himself or an earth immigrant  and who seemed uneasy to be the center of the stares of a couple of dozen slight  nude figures who seemed to tinge their scorn with indifference  came directly toward him .    sir   he began .   commissioner gottstein requests that you accompany me                 barren neville s quarters were somehow harsher than selene s .  his books were on bold display  his computer outlet was unmasked in one comer  and his large desk was in disarray .  his windows were blank .   selene entered  folded her arms  and said   if you live like a slob  barren  how do you expect to have your thoughts neat .     i ll manage   said barron  grumpily .   how is it you haven t brought the earthman with you .     the commissioner got to him first .  the new commissioner .     gottstera .     that s right .  why weren t you ready sooner .     because it took time to find out .  i won t work blind .    selene said   well  then  we ll just have to wait .    neville bit at a thumbnail and then inspected the result severely .   i don t know whether i ought to like the situation or not .  .  .  .  what did you think of him .     i liked him   said selene  definitely .   he was rather pleasant  considering he was an earthie .  he let me guide him .  he was interested .  he made no judgments .  he didn t patronize .   .   .   .  and i didn t go out of my way to avoid insulting him  either     did he ask any further about the synchrotron .     no  but then he didn t have to .     why not .     i told him you wanted to see him  and i said you were a physicist .  so i imagine he ll ask you whatever he wants to ask you when he sees you .     didn t he think it strange that he should be talking to a female tourist guide who just happens to know a physicist .     why strange .  i said you were my sex partner .  there s no accounting for sex attraction and a physicist may well condescend to a lowly tourist guide .     shut up  selene .     oh    look  barren  it seems to me that if he were spinning some sort of fancy web  if he approached me because he planned to get to you through me  he would have shown some trace of anxiety .  the more complicated and silly any plot  the more rickety it is and the more anxious the plotter .  i deliberately acted casual .  i talked about everything but the synchrotron .  i took him to a gymnastics show .     and .     and he was interested .  relaxed and interested .  whatever he has on his mind  it isn t involuted .     you re sure of that .  yet the commissioner got to him before i did .  you consider that good .     why should i consider it bad .  an open invitation to a meeting of some sort delivered in front of a couple of dozen lunarites isn t particularly involuted  either .    neville leaned back with his hands clasped at the nape of his neck .   selene  please don t insist on making judgments  when i don t ask you to .  it s irritating .  the man is not a physicist in the first place .  did he tell you he was .    selene paused to think .   i called him a physicist .  he didn t deny it but i don t recall that he actually said he was .  and yet   and yet  i   m sure he is .     it s a lie of omission  selene .  he may be a physicist in his own mind  but the fact is that he isn t trained as a physicist and he doesn t work as one .  he has had scientific training  i   ll grant him that  but he has no scientific job of any kind .  he couldn t get one .  there isn t a lab on earth that would give him working room .  he happens to be on fred hallam s crud list and he s been top man there for a long time .     are you sure .     believe me  i checked .  didn t you just criticize me for taking so long .   .   .   .  and it sounds so good that it s too good .     why too good .  i don t see what you re getting at .     doesn t it seem to you we ought to trust him .  after all  he s got a grievance against earth .     you can certainly argue that way  if your facts are right .     oh  my facts are right  at least in the sense that they re what turns up  if you dig for them .  but maybe we   re supposed to argue that way .     barren  that s disgusting .  how can you weave these conspiracy theories into everything .  ben didn t sound       ben .   said neville  sardonically .    ben .   repeated selene  firmly .   ben didn t sound like a man with a grievance or like a man trying to make me think he sounded like a man with a grievance .     no  but he managed to make you think he was someone to be liked .  you did say you liked him  didn t you .  with emphasis .  maybe that s exactly what he was trying to do .     i m not that easy to fool and you know it .     well  i   ll just have to wait till i see him .     the hell with you  barron .  i ve associated with thousands of earthies of all kinds .  it s my job .  and you have no reason whatsoever to speak sarcastically about my judgment .  you know you have every reason to trust it .     all right .  well see .  don t get angry .  it s just that we ll have to wait now .  .   .  .  and as long as we do   he rose lithely to his feet   guess what i m thinking .     i don t have to .   selene rose as smoothly  and with an almost invisible motion of her feet slid sideways  well away from him .   but think it by yourself .  i m not in the mood .     are you annoyed because i ve impugned your judgment .     i m annoyed because    oh  hell  why don t you keep your room in better condition .   and she left .               i would like   said gottstein   to offer you some earth side luxury  doctor  but  as a matter of principle  i have been allowed to bring none .  the good people of the moon resent the artificial barriers imposed by special treatment for men from earth .  it seems better to soothe their sensibilities by assuming the lunarite pose as far as possible though i m afraid my gait will give me away .  their confounded gravity is impossible .    the earthman said  i find this so also .  i congratulate you on your new post   n   not yet quite mine  sir .     still  my congratulations .  yet i can t help wondering why you have asked to see me .     we were shipmates .  we arrived not so long ago on the same vessel .    the earthman waited politely .   gottstein said   and my acquaintance with you is a longer one than that .  we met   briefly   some years ago .    the earthman said quietly   i m afraid i don t recall       i m not surprised at that .  there is no reason for you to remember .  i was  for a time  on the staff of senator burt  who headed   still heads  in fact   the committee on technology and the environment .  it was at a time when he was rattier anxious to get the goods on hallam   frederick hallam .    the earthman seemed  quite suddenly  to sit a little straighter .   did you know hallam .     you re the second person to ask me that since my coming to the moon .  yes  i did .  not intimately .  i ve known others who ve met him .  oddly enough  their opinion usually coincided with mine .  for a person who is apparently idolized by the planet  hallam inspired little personal liking on the part of those who knew him .     little .  none at all  i think   said the earthman .   gottstein ignored the interruption .   it was my job  at the time   or at least  my assignment from the senator   to investigate the electron pump and see if its establishment and growth were accompanied by undue waste and personal profit taking .  it was a legitimate concern for what was essentially a watch dog committee  but the senator was  between us  hoping to find something of damage to hallam .  he was anxious to decrease the strangle hold that man was gaining on the scientific establishment .  there  he failed .     that much would be obvious .  hallam is stronger than ever right now .     there was no graft to speak of  certainly none that could be traced to hallam .  the man is rigidly honest    in that sense  i am sure .  power has its own market value not necessarily measured in credit bills .     but what interested me at the time  though it was something i could not then follow up  was that i did come across someone whose complaint was not against hallam s power  but against the electron pump itself .  i was present at the interview  but i did not conduct it you were the complainant  were you not .    the earthman said  cautiously   i remember the incident to which you refer  but i still don t remember you .     i wondered then how anyone could possibly object to the electron pump on scientific grounds .  you impressed me sufficiently so that when i saw you on the ship  something stirred  and then  eventually  it came back .  i have not referred to the passenger list but let me check my memory .  aren t you dr .  benjamin andrew denison .    the earthman sighed .   benjamin allan denison .  yes .  but why does this come up now .  the truth is  commissioner  i don t want to drag up matters of the past .  i m here on the moon and rather anxious to start again  from the start  if necessary .  damn it  i considered changing my name .     that wouldn t have helped .  it was your face i recognized .  i have no objection to your new life  dr .  denison .  i would not in any way interfere .  but i would like to pry a little for reasons that do not directly involve you .  i don t remember  quite  your objection to the electron pump .  could you tell me .    denison s head bent .  the silence lengthened itself and the commissioner appointee did not interrupt he even stifled a small clearing of the throat .   denison said   truly  it was nothing .  it was a guess i made  a fear about the alteration in the intensity of the strong nuclear field .  nothing .     nothing .   gottstein did clear his throat now .   please don t mind if i strive to understand this .  i told you that you interested me at the time .  i was unable to follow it up then and i doubt that i could dig the information out of the records now .  the whole thing is classified   the senator did very poorly at the time and he isn t interested in publicity over it .  still  some details come back .  you were once a colleague of hallam s  you were not a physicist .     that s right .  i was a radiochemist .  so was he .     stop me if i remember incorrectly  but your early record was a very good one  right .     there were objective criteria in my favor .  i had no illusions about myself .  i was a brilliant worker .     amazing how it comes back .  hallam  on the other hand  was not .     not particularly .     and yet afterward things did not go well with you .  in fact  when we interviewed you   i think you volunteered to see us   you were working for a toy manufacturer       cosmetics   said denison  in a strangled voice .   male cosmetics .  that didn t help gain me a respectful hearing .     no  it wouldn t .  i m sorry .  you were a salesman .     sales manager .  i was still brilliant  i rose to vice president before breaking off and coming to the moon .     did hallam have something to do with that .  i mean with you leaving science .     commissioner   said denison .   please .  it really doesn t matter any longer .  i was there when hallam first discovered the tungsten conversion and when the chain of events began that led to the electron pump .  exactly what would have happened if i had not been there  i can t say .  hallam and i might both have been dead of radiation poisoning a month later or of a nuclear explosion six weeks later .  i don t know .  but i was there and  partly because of me  hallam is what he is now  and because of my part in it  i am what i am now .  the hell with the details .  does that satisfy you .  because it will have to .     i think it satisfies me .  you had a personal grudge against hallam  then .     i certainly had no affection for him  in those days .  i have no affection for him now  for that matter .     would you say  then  that your objection to the electron pump was inspired by your anxiety to destroy hallam .    denison said   i object to this cross examination .     please .  nothing of what i ask is intended to be used against you .  this is for my own benefit because i am concerned about the pump and about a number of things .     well  then  i suppose you might work out some emotional involvement .  because i disliked hallam i was ready to believe that his popularity and greatness had a false foundation .  i thought about the electron pump  hoping to find a flaw .     and you therefore found one .     no   said denison forcefully  bringing his fist down on the arm of the chair and moving perceptibly upward from his seat in reaction .   not  therefore .   i found a flaw but it was an honest one .  or so it seemed to me .  i certainly didn t invent a flaw merely to puncture hallam .     no question of inventing  doctor   said gottstein soothingly .   i don t dream of making such an implication .  yet we all know that in trying to determine something on the boundary line of the known  it is necessary to make assumptions .  the assumptions can be made over a gray area of uncertainty and one can shade them in one direction or another with perfect honesty  but in accord with   uh   the emotions of the moment .  you made your assumptions  perhaps  on the anti hallam edge of the possible .     this is a profitless discussion  sir .  at the time  i thought i had a valid point .  however  i am not a physicist .  i am   was   a radiochemist    hallam was a radiochemist  too  but he is now the most famous physicist in the world .     he s still a radiochemist a quarter century out of date .     not so  you .  you worked hard to become a physicist   denison smoldered .   you really investigated me .     i told you  you impressed me .  amazing how it comes back .  but now i ll pass on to something a little different do you know a physicist named peter lamont .    reluctantly    i ve met him .     would you say he was brilliant  too .     i don t know him well enough to say and i hate to overuse the word .     would you say he knew what he was talking about .     barring information to the contrary  i would say  yes .    carefully  the commissioner leaned back in his seat .  it had a spindly look about it and by earth standards it would not have supported his weight .  he said   would you care to say how you came to know lamont .  was it by reputation only .  did you meet .    denison said   we had some direct conversations .  he was planning to write a history of the electron pump  how it started  a full account of all the legendary crap that s grown up around it .  i was flattered that lamont came to me  that he seemed to have found out something about me .  damn it  commissioner  i was flattered that he knew i was alive .  but i couldn t really say much .  what would have been the use .  i would have gained nothing but some sneers and i am tired of it  tired of brooding  tired of self pity .     do you know anything about what lamont has been doing in the last few years .     what is it you re thinking of  commissioner .   asked denison  cautiously .    about a year ago  maybe a little more  lamont spoke to burt .  i am not on the senator s staff any longer  but we see each other occasionally .  he talked to me about it .  he was concerned .  he thought lamont might have made a valid point against the electron pump and yet could see no practical way of taking up the matter .  i  too  was concerned       concern everywhere   said denison  sardonically .    but now  i wonder .  if lamont talked to you and       stop .  stop right there  commissioner .  i think i see you sidling toward a point and i don t want you to move any further .  if you expect me to tell you that lamont stole my idea  that once again i am being treated badly  you are wrong .  let me tell you as forcefully as i can  i had no valid theory .  it was purely a guess .  it worried me  i presented it  i was not believed  i was discouraged .  since i had no way of demonstrating its value  i gave up .  i did not mention it in my discussion with lamont  we never went past the early days of the pump .  what he came up with later  however much it may have resembled my guess  was arrived at independently .  it seems to be much more solid and to be based on rigid mathematical analysis .  i lay claim to no priority  to none    you seem to know about lament s theory .     it made the rounds in recent months .  the fellow can t publish and no one takes him seriously  but it was passed along the grapevine .  it even reached me .     i see  doctor .  but i take it seriously .  to me the warning was second time round  you understand .  the report of the first warning   from you   had never reached the senator .  it had nothing to do with financial irregularities  which were what was then on his mind .  the actual head of   the investigating panel   not myself   considered it   you will forgive me   crackpot .  i did not .  when the matter came up again  i grew disturbed .  it was my intention to meet with lamont  but a number of physicists whom i consulted       including hallam .     no  i did not see hallam .  a number of those i consulted advised me that lament s work was utterly without foundation .  even so  i was considering seeing him when i was asked to take up this position  and here i am  and here you are .  so you see why i had to see you .  in your opinion is there merit in the theories advanced by yourself and by dr .  lament .     you mean is continued use of the electron pump going to blow up the sun  or maybe the entire arm of the galaxy .     yes  that s exactly what i mean .     how can i tell you .  all i have is my own guess  which is just a guess .  as for lament s theory  i have not studied it in detail  it has not been published .  if i saw it  the mathematics might be beyond me .   .   .   .  besides  what s the difference .  lamont won t convince anyone .  hallam has ruined him as earlier he ruined me  and the public generally would find it against their short term interest to believe him even if he went over hallam s head  so to speak .  they don t want to give up the pump  and it s a lot easier to refuse to accept lament s theory than to try to do something about it .     but you re still concerned about it  aren t you .     in the sense that i think we might indeed destroy ourselves and that i wouldn t like to see that happen  of course .     so you ve come to the moon  now  to do something that hallam  your old enemy  would prevent your doing on earth .    denison said  slowly   you  too  like to make guesses .     do i .   said gottstein  indifferently .   perhaps i am brilliant  too .  is my guess correct .     it may be .  i haven t given up hope of returning to science .  if anything i do were to lift the specter of doom from mankind  either by showing that it does not exist or that it does exist and must be removed  i would be pleased .     i see .  dr .  denison  to discuss another point at the moment  my predecessor  the retiring commissioner  mr .  montez  tells me that the growing edge of science is here on the moon .  he seems to think a disproportionate quantity of the brains and initiative of mankind is here .     he may be right   said denison .   i don t know .     he may be right   agreed gottstein  thoughtfully   if so  doesn t it strike you that this may be inconvenient for your purpose .  whatever you do  men may say and think it was accomplished through the lunar scientific structure .  you personally might gain little in the way of recognition  however valuable the results you present .   .   .   .  which  of course  would be unjust .     i am tired of the rat race of credit  commissioner gottstein .  i want some interest in life  more interest than i can find as vice president in charge of ultra sonic depilatories .  i ll find it in a return to science .  if i accomplish something in my own eyes  i will be satisfied .     let us say that that would be insufficient for me .  what credit you earn  you should receive  and it should be quite possible for me  as commissioner  to present the facts to the terrestrial community in such a way a  to preserve for you what is yours .  surely you are human enough to want what is your own .     you are kind .  and in return .     you are cynical .  but justly so .  in return i want your help .  the retiring commissioner  mr .  montez  is not certain as to the lines of scientific research being undertaken on the moon .  communications between the peoples of earth and moon are not perfect  and coordination of the efforts on both worlds is clearly for the benefit of all .  it is understandable that there s distrust  i suppose  but if you can do anything to break down that distrust  it will be as valuable to us as your scientific findings might be .     surely  commissioner  you can t feel that i m the ideal man to bear witness to the lunarites as to how fair meaning and well disposed the earth s scientific establishment is .     you mustn t confuse one vengeful scientist with the men of the earth as a whole  dr .  denison .  let s put it this way .  i would appreciate being kept aware of your scientific findings so that i could help you retain your fair share of credit  and in order to understand your findings properly   i am not a professional scientist myself  remember    it would be helpful if you were to explain them in the light of the present state of science on the moon .  is it agreed .    denison said   you ask a hard thing .  preliminary results  prematurely disclosed  whether through carelessness or over enthusiasm  can do tremendous harm to a reputation .  i would hate to talk about anything to anyone until i was sure of my ground .  my earlier experience with the committee on which you served would certainly encourage me to be cautious .     i quite understand   said gottstein  heartily .   i would leave it to you to decide when i might usefully be informed .   .   .   .  but i have kept you late and you probably want to sleep .    which was a dismissal .  denison left  and gottstein looked after him thoughtfully .              denison opened the door by hand .  there was a contact that would have opened it automatically  but in the blur of waking  he could not find it .   the dark haired man  with a face that was somehow scowling in repose  said   i m sorry .  .  .   .  am i early .    denison repeated the last word to give him time to absorb matters .   early .   .  .  .  no .  i .  .  .  i m late  i think .     i called .  we made an appointment      and now denison had it .   yes .  you re dr .  neville .     that s right .  may i come in .    he stepped in as he asked .  denison s room was small  and held a rumpled bed that took up most of the available space .  the ventilator was sighing softly .   neville said with meaningless courtesy   slept well  i hope .    denison looked down at his pajamas and passed his hand over his rumpled hair .   no   he said abruptly .   i had an abominable night .  may i be excused long enough to make myself more presentable .     of course .  would you like to have me prepare breakfast meanwhile .  you may be unacquainted with the equipment .     it would be a favor   said denison .   he emerged some twenty minutes later  washed and shaved  wearing trousers and an undershirt .  he said   i trust i didn t break the shower .  it went off and i couldn t turn it on again .     the water s rationed .  you only get so much .  this is the moon  doctor .  i ve taken the liberty of preparing scrambled eggs and hot soup for the two of us .     scrambled       we call it that .  earthmen wouldn t  i suppose .    denison said   oh .   he sat down with something less than enthusiasm and tasted the pasty yellow mixture that clearly was what the other meant by scrambled eggs .  he tried not to make a face at the first taste and then manfully swallowed it and dug in for a second forkful .    you ll get used to it with time   said neville   and it s highly nourishing .  i might warn you that the high protein content and the low gravity will cut your need for food .     just as well   said denison  clearing his throat .   neville said   selene tells me that you intend to stay on the moon .    denison said   that was my intention .   he rubbed his eyes .   i ve had a terrible night  though .  it tests my resolution .     how many times did you fall out of bed .     twice .   .  .  .  i take it that the situation is a common one .     for men of earth  an invariable one .  awake  you can make yourself walk with due regard for the moon s gravity .  asleep  you toss as you would on earth .  but at least falling is not painful at low gravity .     the second time  i slept on the floor awhile before waking .  didn t remember falling .  what the hell do you do about it .     you mustn t neglect your periodic checks on heartbeat  blood pressure  and so on  just to make sure the gravity change isn t introducing too much of a strain .    i   ve been amply warned of that   said denison with distaste .   la fact  i have fixed appointments for the next month .  and pills .     well   said neville  as if dismissing a triviality   within a week you ll probably have no trouble at all .   .  .  .  and you ll need proper clothing .  those trousers will never do and that flimsy upper garment serves no purpose .     i presume there s some place i can buy clothes .     of course .  if you can get her when she s off duty  selene will be glad to help  i m sure .  she assures me you re a decent sort  doctor .     i m delighted she thinks so .   denison  having swallowed a spoonful of the soup  looked at it as though he were wondering what to do with the rest .  grimly  he continued the task of downing it .    she judged you to be a physicist  but of course she s wrong .     i was trained as a radiochemist .     you haven t worked at that either for a long time  doctor .  we may be out of it up here  but we re not that far out of it .  you re one of hallam s victims .     are there so many you speak of them as a group .     why not .  the whole moon is one of hallam s victims .     the moon .     in a manner of speaking .     i don t understand .     we have no electron pump stations on the moon .  none have been established because there has been no cooperation from the para universe .  no samples of tungsten have been accepted .     surely  dr .  neville  you don t intend to imply that this is hallam s doing .     in a negative way  yes .  why must it be only the para universe which can initiate a pump station .  why not ourselves .     as far as i know  we lack the knowledge to take the initiative .     and we will continue to lack the knowledge if research into the matter is forbidden .     is it forbidden .   denison asked  with a faint note of surprise .    in effect .  if none of the work necessary to expand knowledge in that direction finds adequate priorities at the proton synchrotron or at any of the other large equipment    all controlled by earth and all under the influence of hallam   then the research is effectively forbidden .    denison rubbed his eyes .   i suspect i will have to sleep again before long .   .  .  .  i beg your pardon .  i did not mean to imply you were boring me .  but tell me  is the electron pump so important to the moon .  surely the solar batteries are effective and sufficient .     they tie us to the sun  doctor .  they tie us to the surface .     well    but why does hallam take this adverse interest in the matter  do you suppose  dr .  neville .     you know better than i  if you know him personally  as i do not .  he prefers not to make it clear to the public generally that the entire electron pump establishment is the product of the para men  with ourselves merely servants of the masters .  and if  on the moon  we advance to the point where we ourselves know what we are doing  then the birth of the true electron pump technology will date from our moment  not from his .    denison said   why do you tell me all this .     to avoid wasting my time .  ordinarily  we welcome physicists from earth .  we feel cut off here on the moon  victims of deliberate terrestrial policy against us  and a physicist visitor can be helpful  even if only to give us a feeling of lesser isolation .  a physicist immigrant is even more helpful and we like to explain the situation to him and encourage him to work with us .  i am sorry that you are not  after all  a physicist .    denison said  impatiently   but i never said i was .     and yet you asked to see the synchrotron .  why .     is that really what s bothering you .  my dear sir  let me try to explain .  my scientific career was ruined half a lifetime ago .  i  have decided to see some sort of rehabilitation  some sort of renewed meaning  to my life as far away from hallam as i could get   which means here on the moon .  i was trained as a radiochemist  but that has not permanently paralyzed me as far as any other field of endeavor is concerned .  para physics is the great field of today and i have done my best to self educate myself there  feeling that this will offer me my best hope for rehabilitation .    neville nodded .   i see   he said with clear dubiousness .    by the way  since you mentioned the electron pump    have you heard anything about the theories of peter lamont .    neville eyed the other narrowly .   no .  i don t think i know the man .     yes  he is not yet famous .  and probably never will be  chiefly for the same reason i ll never be .  he crossed hal lam   .   .   .  his name came up recently and i ve been giving him some thought it was one way of occupying the sleepless portion of last night .   and he yawned .   neville said  impatiently   yes  doctor .  what of this man .  what is his name .     peter lamont .  he has some interesting thoughts on para theory .  he believes that with continued use of the pump  the strong nuclear interaction will grow basically more intense in the space of the solar system and that the sun will slowly heat up and  at some crucial point  undergo a phase change that will produce an explosion .     nonsense .  do you know the amount of change produced  on a cosmic scale  of any use of the pump on a human scale .  even granted that you are only self educated in physics  you ought have no difficulty in seeing that the pump can t possibly make any appreciable change in general universal conditions during the lifetime of the solar system .     do you think so .     of course .  don t you .   said neville .    i m not sure .  lament s grinding a personal axe .  i ve met him briefly and he impressed me as an intense and very emotional fellow .  considering what hallam has done to him  he is probably driven by overwhelming anger .    neville frowned .  he said   are you sure he is on the outs with hallam .     i m an expert on the subject    it doesn t occur to you that the initiation of that kind of doubt   that the pump is dangerous   might be used as but another device to keep the moon from developing stations of its own .     at the cost of creating universal alarm and despondency .  of course not .  that would be cracking walnuts with nuclear explosions .  no  i m sure lament is sincere .  in fact  in my own bumbling way  i had similar notions once .     because you  too  are driven by hate for hallam .     i m not lamont .  i imagine i don t react the same way he does .  in fact  i had some dim hope i would be able to investigate the matter on the moon  without hallam s interference and without lament s emotionalism .     here on the moon .     here on the moon .  i thought perhaps i might get the use of the synchrotron .     and that was your interest in it .    denison nodded .   neville said   you really think you will get the use of the synchrotron .  do you know how far back the requisitions have piled up .     i thought perhaps i might get the cooperation of some of the lunar scientists .    neville laughed and shook his head .   we have almost as little chance as you .   .   .   .  however  i ll tell you what we can do .  we have established laboratories of our own .  we can give you space  we might even have some minor instrumentation for you .  how useful our facilities would be to you  i can t say  but you might be able to do something .     do you suppose i would have any means there of making observations useful to para theory .     it would depend partly on your ingenuity  i suppose .  do you expect to prove the theories of this man  lamont .     or disprove them .  perhaps .     you ll disprove them  if anything at all .  i have no fears about that .    denison said   it s quite clear  isn t it  that i m not a physicist by training .  why do you so readily offer me working space .     because you re from earth .  i told you that we value that  and perhaps your self education as a physicist will be of additional value .  selene vouches for you  something i attach more importance to than i should  perhaps .  and we are fellow sufferers at the hands of hallam .  if you wish to rehabilitate yourself  we will help you .     but pardon me if i am cynical .  what do you expect to get out of it .     your help .  there is a certain amount of misunderstanding between the scientists of the earth and the moon .  you are a man of earth who has come voluntarily to the moon and you could act as a bridge between us to the benefit of both .  you have already had contact with the new commissioner and it may be possible that  as you rehabilitate yourself  you will rehabilitate us as well .     you mean that if what i do weakens hallam s influence  that will benefit lunar science as well .     whatever you do is sure to be useful .   .   .   .  but perhaps i ought to leave you to catch up with your sleep .  call on me during the next couple of days and i will see about placing you in a laboratory .  and    he looked about     getting you somewhat more comfortable quarters as well .    they shook hands and neville left .              gottstein said   i suppose that  however annoying this position of yours may have been  you are getting ready to leave it today with a small pang .    montez shrugged eloquently .   a very large pang  when i think of the return to full gravity .  the difficulty of breathing   the aching feet   the perspiration .  i ll be a bath of perspiration constantly .     it will be my turn someday     take my advice .  never stay here longer than two months at a time .  i don t care what the doctors tell you or what kind of isometric exercises they put you through    get back to earth every sixty days and stay at least a week .  you ve got to keep the feel of it .     i ll bear that in mind .   .  .   .  oh  i ve been in touch with my friend .     which friend is that .     the man who was on the vessel with me when i came in .  i thought i remembered him and i did .  a man named denison  a radiochemist .  what i remembered of him was accurate enough .     ah .     i remembered a certain interesting irrationality of his  and tried to probe it .  he resisted in quite a shrewd fashion .  he sounded rational  so rational  in fact  that i grew suspicious .  there s a kind of attractive rationality developed by certain types of crackpots  a kind of defense mechanism .     oh  lord   said montez  clearly harassed .   i m not sure i follow you .  if you don t mind  i m going to sit down for a moment .  between trying to determine whether everything is properly packed and thinking about earth s gravity  i m out of breath .  .  .  .  what kind of irrationality .     he tried to tell us once that there was danger in the use of the electron pumps .  he thought it would blow up the universe .     indeed .  and will it .     i hope not .  at the time it was dismissed rather brusquely .  when scientists work on a subject at the limit of understanding  they grow edgy  you know .  i knew a psychiatrist once who called it the  who knows .   phenomenon .  if nothing you do will give you the knowledge you need  you end by saying   who knows what will happen .   and imagination tells you .     yes  but if physicists go around saying such things  even a few of them       but they don t .  not officially .  there s such a thing as scientific responsibility and the journals are careful not to print nonsense .   .  .  .  or what they consider nonsense .  actually  you know  the subject s come up again .  a physicist named lament spoke to senator hurt  to that self appointed environmental messiah  chen  and to a few others .  he also insists on the possibility of cosmic explosion .  no one believes him but the story spreads in a thin sort of way and gets better with the retelling .     and this man here on the moon believes it .    gottstein smiled broadly .   i suspect he does .  hell  in the middle of the night  when i have trouble sleeping   i keep falling out of bed  by the way   i believe it myself .  he probably hopes to test the theory experimentally  here .     well .     well  let him .  i hinted we would help him .    montez shook his head .   that s  risky .  i don t like the official encouragement of crackpot notions .     you know  it s just barely possible they may not be entirely crackpot  but that s not the point .  the point is that if we can get him established here on the moon  we may find out  through him  what s going on here .  he s anxious for rehabilitation and i hinted that rehabilitation would come through us if he cooperated .   .   .   .  i ll see to it that you are discreetly kept posted .  as between friends  you know .     thank you   said montez .   and good by .               neville chafed .   no .  i don t like him .     why not .  because he s an earthie .   selene brushed a bit of fluff from her right breast  then caught it and looked at it critically .   that s not from my blouse .  i tell you the air recirculation is abominable .     this denison is worthless .  he is not a para physicist .  he s a self educated man in the field  he says  and proves it by coming here with ready made damn fool notions .     like what .     he thinks that the electron pump is going to explode the universe .     did he say that .     i know he thinks that .   .   .   .  oh  i know the arguments .  i ve heard them often enough .  but it s not so  that s all .     maybe   said selene  raising her eyebrows   you just don t want it to be so .     don   t you start   said neville .   there was a short pause .  selene said   well  what will you do with him .     i ll give him a place to work .  he may be worthless as a scientist  but he ll have his uses just the same .  he ll be conspicuous enough  the commissioner has been talking to him already .     i know .     well  he has a romantic history as someone with a wrecked career trying to rehabilitate himself .     really .     really .  i m sure you ll love it .  if you ask him about it  he ll tell you .  and that s good .  if we have a romantic earthman working on the moon on a crackpot project  he ll make a perfect object to preoccupy the commissioner .  he ll be misdirection  window dressing .  and it may even be that through him  who knows  we might just possibly get a better idea of what goes on there on earth .   .  .   .  you d better continue to be friendly with him  selene .                selene laughed  and the sound was metallic in denison s earpiece .  her figure was lost in the spacesuit she wore .   she said   now come  ben  there s no reason to be afraid .  you re an old hand by now   you ve been here a month .     twenty eight days   mumbled denison .  he felt smothered in his own suit .    a month   insisted selene .   it was well past half earth when you came  it is well past half earth now .   she pointed to the brilliant curve of the earth in the southern sky .    well  but wait .  i m not as brave out here as i am underground .  what if i fall .     what if you do .  the gravity is weak by your standards  the slope is gentle  your suit is strong .  if you fall  just let yourself slide and roll .  it s almost as much fun that way  anyhow .    denison looked about doubtfully .  the moon lay beautiful in the cold light of the earth .  it was black and white  a mild and delicate white as compared with the sunlit views he had seen when he had taken a trip a week before to inspect the solar batteries that stretched from horizon to horizon along the floor of mare imbrium .  and the black was somehow softer  too  through lack of the blazing contrast of true day .  the stars were supernaturally bright and the earth   the earth   was infinitely inviting with its swirls of white on blue  and its peeping glimpse of tan .    well   he said   do you mind if i hang on to you .     of course not .  and we won t go all the way up .  it will be the beginner s slope for you .  just try to keep in time with me .  i   ll move slowly .    her steps were long  slow  and swinging  and he tried to keep in synchronization .  the up sloping ground beneath them was dusty and  with each step he kicked up a fine powder that settled quickly in the airlessness .  he matched her stride for stride  but with an effort   good   said selene  her arm locked in his  steadying him .   you re very good for an earthie   no  i ought to say immie       thank you .     that s not much better  i suppose .  immie for immigrant is as insulting as earthie for earthman .  shall i just say you re simply very good for a man your age .     no .  that   s much worse .   denison was gasping a little and he could feel his forehead moistening .   selene said   each time you reach the point where you re about to put your foot down  give a little push with your other foot .  that will lengthen your stride and make it all the easier .  no  no   watch me .    denison paused thankfully and watched selene  somehow slim and graceful despite the grotesquerie of the suit once she moved  take off into low  loping leaps .  she returned and knelt at his feet .    now you take a slow step  ben  and i ll hit your foot when i want it to shove .    they tried several times  and denison said   that s worse than running on earth .  i better rest .   .    all right .  it s just that your muscles aren t used to the proper coordination .  it s yourself you re fighting  you know  not gravity .   .   .   .  well  sit down and catch your breath .  i won t take you up much farther .    denison said   will i do any damage to the pack if i lie down on my back .     no  of course not  but it s not a good idea .  not on the bare ground .  it s only at     degrees absolute      degrees below zero  if you prefer  and the smaller the area of contact the better .  i d sit down .     all right .   gingerly  denison sat down with a grunt .  deliberately  he faced northward  away from the earth .   look at those stars .    selene sat facing him  at right angles  .  he could see her face now and then  dimly through the faceplate  when the earthlight caught it at the proper angle .   she said   don t you see the stars on earth .     not like this .  even when there are no clouds  the air on earth absorbs some of the light .  temperature differences in the atmosphere make them twinkle  and city lights  even distant city lights  wash them out    sounds disgusting .     do you like it out here  selene .  on the surface .     i m not crazy about it really  but i don t mind it too much  now and then .  it s part of my job to bring tourists out here  of course .     and now you have to do it for me .     can t i convince you it s not the same thing at all  ben .  we ve got a set route for the tourists .  it s very tame  very uninteresting .  you don t think we d take them out here to the slide  do you .  this is for lunarites   and immies .  mostly immies  actually .     it can t be very popular .  there s no one here but ourselves .     oh  well .  there are particular days for this sort of thing .  you should see this place on race days .  you wouldn t like it then  though .     i m not sure i like it now .  is gliding a sport for immies  particularly .     rather .  lunarites don t like the surface generally .     how about dr .  neville .     you mean  how he feels about the surface .     yes .     frankly  i don t think he s ever been up here .  he s a real city boy .  why do you ask .     well  when i asked permission to go along on the routine servicing of the solar batteries  he was perfectly willing to have me go  but he wouldn t go himself .  i rather asked him to  i think  so i could have someone answer my questions  if there were any  and his refusal was rather strong .     i hope there was someone else to answer your questions .     oh  yes .  he was an immie  too  come to think of it .  maybe that explains dr .  neville s attitude toward the electron pump .     what do you mean .     well     denison leaned back and kicked his legs up alternately  watching them rise and fall slowly with a certain lazy pleasure .   hey  that s not bad .  look  selene    what i mean is that neville is so intent on developing a pump station on the moon when the solar batteries are so adequate for the job .  we couldn t use solar batteries on the earth  where the sun is never as unfailing  as prolonged  as bright  as radiant in all wave lengths .  there s not a single planetary body in the solar system  no body of any size  that is more suitable for the use of the batteries than the moon is .  even mercury is too hot .    but the use does tie you to the surface  and if you don t like the surface      selene rose to her feet suddenly  and said   all right  ben  you ve rested enough .  up .  up .    he struggled to his feet and said   a pump station  however  would mean that no lunarite would ever have to come out on the surface  if he didn t want to .     uphill we go  ben .  well go to that ridge up ahead .  see it  where the earthlight cuts off in a horizontal line .    they made their way up the final stretch silently .  denison was aware of the smoother area to their side  a wide swathe of slope from which most of the dust had been brushed .    that s too smooth for a beginner to work up   selene said  answering his thoughts .   don t get too ambitious or you   ll want me to teach you the kangaroo hop next .    she made a kangaroo hop as she spoke  turned about face almost before landing  and said   right here .  sit down and i ll adjust      denison did  facing downhill .  he looked down the slope uncertainly .   can you really glide on it .     of course .  the gravity is weaker on the moon than on the earth  so you press against the ground much less strongly  and that means there is much less friction .  everything is more slippery on the moon than on the earth .  that s why the floors in our corridors and apartments seemed unfinished to you .  would you like to hear me give my little lecture on the subject .  the one i give the tourists .     no  selene .     besides  we re going to use gliders  of course .   she had a small cartridge in her hand .  clamps and a pair of thin tubes were attached to it .    what is that .   asked ben .    just a small liquid gas reservoir .  it will emit a jet of vapor just under your boots .  the thin gas layer between boots and ground will reduce friction to virtually zero .  you ll move as though you were in clear space .    denison said uneasily .   i disapprove .  surely  it s wasteful to use gas in this fashion on the moon .     oh  now .  what gas do you think we use in these gliders .  carbon dioxide .  oxygen .  this is waste gas to begin with .  it s argon .  it comes out of the moon s soil in ton lots  formed by the billions of years of breakdown of po tassium    .   .   .   .  that s part of my lecture  too  ben .   .   .   .  the argon has only a few specialized uses on the moon .  we could use it for gliding for a million years without exhausting the supply .   .  .  .  all right .  your gliders are on  now wait till i put mine on .     how do they work .     it s quite automatic .  you just start sliding and that will trip the contact and start the vapor .  you ve only got a few minutes supply  but that s all you ll need .    she stood up and helped him to his feet .   face downhill .   .  .  .  come on  ben  this is a gentle slope .  look at it .  it looks perfectly level .     no  it doesn t   said denison  sulkily .   it looks like a cliff to me .     nonsense .  now listen to me and remember what i told you .  keep your feet about six inches apart and one just a few inches ahead of the other .  it doesn t matter which one is ahead .  keep your knees bent .  don t lean into the wind because there isn t any .  don t try to look up or back  but you can look from side to side if you have to .  most of all  when you finally hit level  don t try to stop too soon  you ll be going faster than you think .  just let the glider expire and then friction will bring you to a slow halt .     i ll never remember all that .     yes  you will .  and i ll be right at your side to help .  and if you do fall and i don t catch you  don t try to do anything .  just relax and let yourself tumble or slide .  there are no boulders anywhere that you can collide with .    denison swallowed and looked ahead .  the southward slide was gleaming in earthlight .  minute unevenness caught more than their share of light  leaving tiny uphill patches in darkness so that there was a vague mottling of the surface .  the bulging half circle of earth rode the black sky almost directly ahead .    ready .   said selene .  her gauntleted hand was between his shoulders .    ready   said denison faintly .    then off you go   she said .  she pushed and denison felt himself begin to move .  he moved quite slowly at first .  he turned toward her  wobbling  and she said   don t worry .  i m right at your side .    he could feel the ground beneath his feet   and then he couldn t .  the glider had been activated .   for a moment he felt as though he were standing still .  there was no push of air against his body  no feel of anything sliding past his feet .  but when he turned toward selene again  he noticed that the lights and shadows to one side were moving backward at a slowly increasing speed .    keep your eyes on the earth   selene s voice said in his ear   till you build up speed .  the faster you go  the more stable you ll be .  keep your knees bent  .   .   .  you re doing very well  ben .     for an immie   gasped denison .   how does it feel .     like flying   he said .  the pattern of light and dark on either side was moving backward in a blur .  he looked briefly to one side  then the other  trying to convert the sensation of a backward flight of the surroundings into one of a forward flight of his own .  then  as soon as he succeeded  he found he had to look forward hastily at the earth to regain his sense of balance .   i suppose that s not a good comparison to use to you .  you have no experience of flying on the moon .     now i know  though .  flying must be like gliding   i know what that is .    she was keeping up with him easily .   denison was going fast enough now so that he got the sensation of motion even when he looked ahead .  the moonscape ahead was opening before him and flowing past on either side .  he said   how fast do you get to go in a glide .     a good moon race   said selene   has been clocked at speeds in excess of a hundred miles an hour   on steeper slopes than this one  of course .  you ll probably reach a top of thirty five .     it feels a lot faster than that somehow .     well  it isn t .  we re leveling off now  ben  and you haven t fallen .  now just hang on  the glider will die off and you ll feel friction .  don t do anything to help it .  just keep going .    selene had barely completed her remarks when denison felt the beginning of pressure under his boots .  there was at once an overwhelming sensation of speed and he clenched his fists hard to keep from throwing his arms up in an almost reflex gesture against the collision that wasn t going to happen .  he knew that if he threw up his arms  he would go over backward .   he narrowed his eyes  held his breath till he thought his lungs would explode  and then selene said   perfect  ben  perfect .  i ve never known an immie to go through his first slide without a fall  so if you do fall  there ll be nothing wrong .  no disgrace .     i don t intend to fall   whispered denison .  he caught a large  ragged breath  and opened his eyes wide .  the earth was as serene as ever  as uncaring .  he was moving more slowly now   more slowly   more slowly      am i standing still now  selene .   he asked .   i m not sure .     you re standing still .  now don t move .  you ve got to rest before we make the trip back to town .   .   .  .  damn it  i left it somewhere around here when we came up .    denison watched her with disbelief .  she had climbed up with him  had glided down with him .  yet he was half dead with weariness and tension  and she was in the air with long kangaroo leaps .  she seemed a hundred yards away when she said   here it is .   and her voice was as loud in his ears as when she was next to him .   she was back in a moment  with a folded  paunchy sheet of plastic under her arm .    remember   she said  cheerily   when you asked what it was on our way up and i said we d be using it before we came down .   she unfolded it and spread it on the dusty surface of the moon    a lunar lounge is its full name   she said   but we just call it a lounge .  we take the adjective for granted here on this world .   she inserted a cartridge and tripped a lever .   it began to fill .  somehow denison had expected a hissing noise  but of course there was no air to carry sound .    before you question our conservation policies again   said selene   this is argon also .    it blossomed into a mattress on six  stubby legs   it will hold you   she said .   it makes very little actual contact with the ground and the vacuum all around will conserve its heat .     don t tell me it s hot   said denison  amazed .    the argon is heated as it pours in  but only relatively .  it ends up at     degrees absolute  almost warm enough to melt ice  and quite warm enough to keep your insulated suit from losing heat faster than you can manufacture it .  go ahead .  lie down .    denison did so  with a sensation of enormous luxury .    great .   he said with a long sigh .    mamma selene thinks of everything   she said .   she came from behind him now  gliding around him  her feet placed heel to heel as though she were on skates  and then let them fly out from under her  as she came down gracefully on hip and elbow on the ground just beside him .   denison whistled .   how did you do that .     lots of practice .  and don t you try it .  you ll break your elbow .  i warn you though .  if i get too cold  i m going to have to crowd you on the lounge .     safe enough   he said   with both of us in suits .     ah  there speaks my brave lecher .   .   .   .  how do you feel .     all right  i guess .  what an experience .     what an experience .  you set a record for non falls .  do you mind if i tell the folks back in town about this .     no .  always like to be appreciated .   .   .   .  you re not going to expect me to do this again  are you .     right now .  of course not i wouldn t myself .  well just rest awhile  make sure your heart action is back to normal  and then we ll go back .  if you ll reach your legs in my direction  i ll take your gliders off .  next time  i ll show you how to handle the gliders yourself .     i m not sure that there will be a next time .     of course there ll be .  didn t you enjoy it .     a little .  in between terror .     you ll have less terror next time  and still less the time after  and eventually you ll just experience the enjoyment and i ll make a racer out of you .     no  you won t .  i m too old .     not on the moon .  you just look old .    denison could feel the ultimate quiet of the moon soaking into him as he lay there .  he was facing the earth this time .  its steady presence in the sky had  more than anything else  given him the sensation of stability during his recent glide and he felt grateful to it .   he said   do you often come out here  selene .  i mean  by yourself  or just one or two others .  you know  when it isn t fiesta time .     practically never .  unless there are people around  this is too much for me .  that i m doing it now  actually  surprises me .     uh huh   said denison  noncommittally .    you re not surprised .     should i be .  my feeling is that each person does what he does either because he wants to or he must and in either case that s his business  not mine .     thanks  ben .  i mean it  it s good to hear .  one of the nice things about you  ben  is that for an immie  you re willing to let us be ourselves .  we re underground people  we lunarites  cave people  corridor people .  and what s wrong with that .     nothing .     not to hear the earthies talk .  and i m a tourist guide and have to listen to them .  there isn t anything they say that i haven t heard a million times  but what i hear most of all    and she dropped into the clipped accents of the typical earthie speaking planetary standard      but  dear  however can all you people live in caves all the time .  doesn t it give you a terrible closed in feeling .  don t you ever want to see blue sky and trees and ocean and feel wind and smell flowers       oh  i could go on and on  ben .  then they say   but i suppose you don t know what blue sky and sea and trees are like so you don t miss them .   .  .  .  as if we don t receive earth television and as if we don t have full access to earth literature  both optical and auditory   and olfactory sometimes  too .    denison was amused .  he said   what s the official answer to remarks like that .     nothing much .  we just say   we re quite used to it  madam .   or  sir  if it s a man .  usually it s a woman .  the men are too interested in studying our blouses and wondering when we take them off  i suppose .  you know what i d like to tell the idiots .     please tell me .  as long as you have to keep the blouse on  it being inside the suit  at least get that off your chest    funny  funny word play .   .  .  .  i d like to tell them   look  madam  why the hell should we be interested in your damned world .  we don t want to be hanging on the outside of any planet and waiting to fall off or get blown off .  we don t want raw air puffing at us and dirty water falling on us .  we don t want your damned germs and your smelly grass and your dull blue sky and your dull white clouds .  we can see earth in our own sky when we want to  and we don t often want to .  the moon is our home and it s what we make it  exactly what we make it .  we own it and we build our own ecology  and we don t need you here being sorry for us going our own way .  go back to your own world and let your gravity pull your breasts down to your knees .   that s what i d say .    denison said   all right .  whenever you get too close to saying that to some earthie  you come say it to me and you ll feel better .     you know what .  every once in a while  some immie suggests that we build an earth park on the moon  some little spot with earth plants brought in as seeds or seedlings  maybe some animals .  a touch of home   that s the usual expression .     i take it you re against that     of course  i m against it .  a touch of whose home .  the moon is our home .  an immie who wants a touch of home had better get back to his home .  immies can be worse than earthies sometimes .     i   ll keep that in mind   said denison .    not you   so far   said selene .   there was silence for a moment and denison wondered if selene were going to suggest a return to the caverns .  on the one hand  it wouldn t be long before he would feel a fairly strenuous craving to visit a rest room .  on the other  he had never felt so relaxed .  he wondered how long the oxygen in his pack would hold out  then selene said   ben  do you mind if i ask you a question .     not at all .  if it s my private life that interests you  i am without secrets .  i m five foot nine  weigh twenty eight pounds on the moon  had one wife long ago  now divorced  one child  a daughter  grown up and married  attended university of       no  ben .  i m serious .  can i ask about your work .     of course you can  selene .  i don t know how much i can explain to you  though .     well    you know that barron and l   m   yes  i know   said denison  brusquely .    we talk together .  he tells me things sometimes .  he said you think the electron pump might make the universe explode .     our section of the universe .  it might convert a part of our galactic arm into a quasar .     really .  do you really think so .    denison said   when i came to the moon  i wasn t sure .  now i am .  i am personally convinced that this will happen .     when do you think it will happen .     that i can t say exactly .  maybe a few years from now .  maybe a few decades .    there was a short silence between them .  then selene said  in a subdued voice   barron doesn t think so .     i know he doesn t .  i m not trying to convert him .  you don t beat refusal to believe in a frontal attack .  that s lament s mistake .     who s lament .     i m sorry  selene .  i m talking to myself .     no  ben .  please tell me .  i m interested .  please .    denison turned to one side  facing her .   all right   he said .   i have no objection to telling you .  lamont  a physicist back on earth  tried in his way to alert the world to the dangers of the pump .  he failed .  earthmen want the pump  they want the free energy  they want it enough to refuse to believe they can t have it .     but why should they want it  if it means death .     all they have to do is refuse to believe it means death .  the easiest way to solve a problem is to deny it exists .  your friend  dr .  neville  does the same thing .  he dislikes the surface  so he forces himself to believe that solar batteries are no good   even though to any impartial observer they would seem the perfect energy source for the moon .  he wants the pump so he can stay underground  so he refuses to believe that there can be any danger from it .    selene said   i don t think barron would refuse to believe something for which valid evidence existed .  do you really have the evidence .     i think i do .  it s most amazing really  selene .  the whole thing depends on certain subtle factors of quark quark interactions .  do you know what that means .     you don t have to explain .  i ve talked so much to barron about all sorts of things that i might be able to follow .     well  i thought i would need the lunar protonsynchrotron for the purpose .  it s twenty five miles across  has superconducting magnets  and can dispose of energies of        bev and more .  it turns out  though  that you people have something you call a pionizer  which fits into a moderately sized room and does all the work of the synchrotron .  the moon is to be congratulated on a most amazing advance .     thank you   said selene  complacently .   i mean on behalf of the moon .     well  then  my pionizer results can show the rate of increase of intensity of strong nuclear interaction  and the increase is what lament says it is and not what the orthodox theory would have it be .     and have you shown it to barron .     no  i haven t .  and if i do  i expect neville to reject it .  he ll say the results are marginal .  he ll say i ve made an error .  he ll say that i haven t taken all factors into account .  he ll say i ve used inadequate controls .   .   .   .  what he ll really be saying is that he wants the electron pump and won t give it up .     you mean there s no way out .     of course there is  but not the direct way .  not lamont s way .     what s that .     lament s solution is to force abandonment of the pump  but you can t just move backward .  you can t push the chicken back into the egg  wine back into the grape  the boy back into the womb .  if you want the baby to let go of your watch  you don t just try to explain that he ought to do it   you offer him something he would rather have .     and what s that .      ah  that s where i m not so sure .  i do have an idea  a simple idea   perhaps too simple to work   based on the quite obvious fact that the number two is ridiculous and can t exist .    there was a silence that lasted for a minute or so and then selene  her voice as absorbed as his  said   let me guess your meaning .     i don t know that i have any   said denison .    let me guess  anyway .  it could make sense to suppose that our own universe is the only one that can exist or does exist  because it is the only one we live in and directly experience .  once  however  evidence arises that there is a second universe as well  the one we call the para universe  then it becomes absolutely ridiculous to suppose that there are two and only two universes .  if a second universe can exist  then an infinite number can .  between one and the infinite in cases such as these  there are no sensible numbers .  not only two  but any finite number  is ridiculous and can t exist .    denison said   that s exactly my reas     and silence fell again .   denison heaved himself into a sitting position and looked down on the suit encased girl .  he said   i think we had better go back to town .    she said   i was just guessing .    he said   no  you weren t .  whatever it was  it wasn   t just guessing .                barron neville stared at her  quite speechless for a while .  she looked calmly back at him .  her window panorama had been changed again .  one of  . them now showed the earth  a little more than half full .   finally  he said   why .    she said   it was an accident  really  i saw the point and i was too enthusiastic not to speak .  i should have told you days ago but i was afraid your reaction would be exactly what it is .     so he knows .  you fool .    she frowned .   what does he know .  only what he would have guessed sooner or later   that i m not really a tourist guide   that i m your intuitionist .  an intuitionist who knows no mathematics  for heaven s sake .  so what if he knows that .  what does it matter if i have intuition .  how many times have you told me that my intuition has no value till it is backed by mathematical rigor and experimental observation .  how many times have you told me that the most compelling intuition could be wrong .  well  then  what value will he place on mere intuitionism .    neville grew white  but selene couldn t tell whether that was out of anger or apprehension .  he said   you re different .  hasn t your intuition always proved right .  when you were sure of it .     ah  but he doesn t know that  does he .     he ll guess it .  he ll see gottstein .     what will he tell gottstein .  he still has no idea of what we re really after .     doesn t he .     no .   she had stood up  walked away .  now she turned to him and shouted     no .  it s cheap of you to imply that i would betray you and the rest .  if you don t accept my integrity then accept my common sense .  there s no point in telling them .  what s the use of it to them  or to us  if we re all going to be destroyed .     oh  please  selene .   neville waved his hand in disgust  not that .     no .  you listen .  he talked to me and described his work .  you hide me like a secret weapon .  you tell me that i m more valuable than any instrument or any ordinary scientist .  you play your games of conspiracy  insisting that everyone must continue to think me a tourist guide and nothing more so that my great talents will always be available to the lunarites .  to you .  and what do you accomplish .     we have you  haven t we .  how long do you suppose you would have remained free  if they       you keep saying things nice that but who s been imprisoned .  who s been stopped .  where is the  evidence of the great conspiracy you see all around you .  the earth men keep you and your team from their large instruments much more because you goad them into it than out of any malice on their part .  and that s done us good  rather than harm  since it s forced us to invent other instruments that are more subtle .     based on your theoretical insight  selene .    selene smiled .   i know .  ben was very complimentary about them .     you and your ben .   what the hell do you want with that miserable earthie .     he s an immigrant .  and what i want is information .  do you give me any .  you re so damned afraid     be caught  you don t dare let me be seen talking to any physicist  only you  and you re my    for that reason only  probably .     now  selene .   he tried to manage a soothing tone  but there was far too much impatience to it .    no  i don t care about that really .  you ve told me i have this one task and i ve tried to concentrate on it and sometimes i think i have it  mathematics or not .  i can visualize it  the kind of thing that must be done   and then it slips away .  but what s the use of it  when the pump will destroy us all anyway .   .   .   .  haven t i told you i distrusted the exchange of field intensities .    neville said   i ll ask you again .  are you ready to tell me that the pump will destroy us .  never mind might  never mind  could   never mind anything but  will .      selene shook her head angrily .   i can t .  it s so marginal .  i can t say it will .  but isn t a simple  might  sufficient in such a case .     oh  lord .     don t turn up your eyes .  don   t sneer .  you ve never tested the matter .  i told you how it might be tested .     you were never this worried about it till you started listening to this earthie of yours .     he s an immigrant .  aren t you going to test it .     no .  i told you your suggestions were impractical .  you re not an experimentalist  and what looks good in your mind doesn t necessarily work in the real world of instruments  of randomness  and of uncertainty .     the so called real world of your laboratory .   her face was flushed and angry and she held her clenched fists at chin level .   you waste so much time trying to get a vacuum good enough   there s a vacuum up there  up there on the surface where i m pointing  with temperatures that  at times  are halfway down toward absolute zero .  why don t you try experiments on the surface .     it would have been useless .     how do you know .  you just won t try .  ben denison tried .  he took the trouble to devise a system he could use on the surface and he set it up when he went to inspect the solar batteries .  he wanted you to come and you wouldn t .  do you remember .  it was a very simple thing  something even i could describe to you now that it s been described to me .  he ran it at day temperatures and again at night temperatures and that was enough to guide him to a new line of research with the pionizer .     how simple you make it sound .     how simple it is .  once he found out i was an intuitionist  he talked to me as you never did .  he explained his reasons for thinking that the strengthening of the strong nuclear interaction is indeed accumulating catastrophically in the neighborhood of earth .  it will only be a few years before the sun explodes and sends the strengthening  in ripples       no  no  no  no  shouted neville .   i   ve seen his results and i m not impressed .     you   ve seen them .     yes  of course .  do you suppose i let him work in our laboratories without making sure i know what he s doing .  i ve seen his results and they re worth nothing .  he deals with tiny deviations that are well within the experimental error .  if he wants to believe that those deviations have significance and if you want to believe them  go ahead .  but no amount of belief will make them have that significance if  in fact  they don t .     what do you want to believe  barron .     i want the truth .     but haven t you decided in advance what the truth must be by your own gospel .  you want the pump station of the moon  don t you  so that you need have nothing to do with the surface  and anything that might prevent that is not the truth   by definition .     i won t argue with you .  i want the pump station  and even more   i want the other .  one s no good without the other .  are you sure you haven t       i haven t .     will you .    selene whirled on him again  her feet tapping rapidly on the ground in such a way as to keep her bobbing in the air to the tune of an angry clatter .    i won t tell him anything   she said   but i must have more information .  you have no information for me  but he may have  or he may get it with the experiments you won t do .  i ve got to talk to him and find out what he is going to find out .  if you get between him and me  you ll never have what you want .  and you needn t fear his getting it before i do .  he s too used to earth thinking  he won t make that last step .  i will .     all right .  and don t forget the difference between earth and moon  either .  this is your world  you have no other .  this man  denison  this ben  this immigrant  having come from earth to the moon  can  if he chooses  return from moon to earth .  you can never go to the earth  never .  you are a lunarite forever .     a moon maiden   said selene  derisively .    no maiden   said neville .   though you may have to wait a long while before i confirm the matter once again .    she seemed unmoved at that .   he said   and about this big danger of explosion .  if the risk involved in changing the basic constants of a universe is so great  why haven t the para men  who are so far advanced beyond us in technology  stopped pumping .    and he left .   she faced the closed door with bunched jaw muscles .  then she said   because conditions are different for them and for us  you incredible jerk .   but she was speaking to herself  he was gone .   she kicked the lever that let down her bed  threw herself into it and seethed .  how much closer was she now to the real object for which barren and those others had now been aiming for years .   no closer .   energy .  everyone searched for energy .  the magic word .  the cornucopia .  the one key to universal plenty .   .  .  .  and yet energy wasn t all .   if one found energy  one could find the other  too .  if one found the key to energy  the key to the other would be obvious .  she knew the key to the other would be obvious if she could but grasp some subtle point that would appear obvious the moment it was grasped .   good heavens  she had been so infected by barren s chronic suspicion that even in her thoughts she was calling it  the other .     no earthman would get that subtle point because no earthman had reason to look for it .   ben denison would find it for her  then  without finding it for himself .   except that    if the universe was to be destroyed  what did anything matter .               denison tried to beat down his self consciousness .  time and again  he made a groping motion as though to hitch upward the pants he wasn t wearing .  he wore only sandals and the barest of briefs  which were uncomfortably tight and  of course  he carried the blanket  selene  who was similarly accoutered  laughed .   now  ben  there s nothing wrong with your bare body  barring a certain flabbiness .  it s perfectly in fashion here .  in fact  take off your briefs if they re binding you .     no .   muttered denison .  he shifted the blanket so that it draped over his abdomen and she snatched it from him .   she said   now give me that thing .  what kind of a lunarite will you make if you bring your earth puritanism here .  you know that prudery is only the other side of prurience .  the words are even on the same page in the dictionary .     i have to get used to it  selene .     you might start by looking at me once in awhile  without having your glance slide off me as though i were coated with oil .  you look at other women quite efficiently  i notice .     if i look at you       then you ll seem too interested and you ll be embarrassed .  but if you look hard  you ll get used to it  and you ll stop noticing .  look  i   ll stand still and you stare .  ill take off my briefs .    denison groaned   selene  there are people all around and you re making intolerable fun of me .  please keep walking and let me get used to the situation .     all right  but i hope you notice the people who pass us don t look at us .     they don t look at you .  they look at me all right .  they ve probably never seen so old looking and ill shaped a person .     they probably haven t   agreed selene  cheerfully   but they ll just have to get used to it .    denison walked on in misery  conscious of every gray hair on his chest and of every quiver of his paunch .  it was only when the passageway thinned out and the people passing them were fewer in number that he began to feel a certain relief .   he looked about him curiously now  not as aware of selene s conical breasts as he had been  nor of her smooth thighs .  the corridor seemed endless .    how far have we come .   he asked .    are you tired .   selene was contrite .   we could have taken a scooter .  i forget you re from earth .     i should hope you do .  isn t that the ideal for an immigrant .  i m not the least bit tired .  hardly the least bit tired at any rate .  what i am is a little cold .     purely your imagination  ben   said selene  firmly .   you just think you ought to feel cold because so much of you is bare .  put it out of your head .     easy to say   he sighed .   i m walking well  i hope .     very well .  i ll have you kangarooing yet .     and participating in glider races down the surface slopes .  remember  i m moderately advanced in years .  but really  how far have we come .     two miles  i should judge .     good lord .  how many miles of corridors are there altogether .     i m afraid i don t know .  the residential corridors make up comparatively little of the total .  there are the mining corridors  the geological ones  the industrial  the mycological .   .   .   .  i m sure there must be several hundred miles altogether .     do you have maps .     of course there are maps .  we can t work blind .     i mean you  personally .     well  no  not with me  but i don t need maps for this area  it s quite familiar to me .  i used to wander about here as a child .  these are old corridors .  most of the new corridors   and we average two or three miles of new corridors a year  i think   are in the north .  i couldn t work my way through them  without a map  for untold sums .  maybe not even with a map .     where are we heading .     i promised you an unusual sight   no  not me  so don t say it   and you ll have it .  it s the moon s most unusual mine and it s completely off the ordinary tourist trails .     don t tell me you ve got diamonds on the moon .     better than that .    the corridor walls were unfinished here   gray rock  dimly but adequately lit by patches of electroluminescence .  the temperature was comfortable and at a steady mildness  with ventilation so gently effective there was no sensation of wind .  it was hard to tell here that a couple of hundred feet above was a surface subjected to alternate frying and freezing as the sun came and went on its grand biweekly swing from horizon to horizon and then underneath and back .    is all this airtight .   asked denison  suddenly uncomfortably aware that he was not far below the bottom of an ocean of vacuum that extended upward through all infinity .    oh  yes .  those walls are impervious .  they re all booby trapped  too .  if the air pressure drops as much as ten per cent in any section of the corridors there is such a hooting and howling from sirens as you have never heard and such a flashing of arrows and blazing of signs directing you to safety as you have never seen .     how often does this happen .     not often .  i don t think anyone has been killed through air lack for at least five years .   then  with sudden defensiveness   you have natural catastrophes on earth .  a big quake or a tidal wave can kill thousands .     no argument  selene .   he threw up his hands .   i surrender .     all right   she said .   i didn t mean to get excited .  .  .  .  do you hear that .    she stopped  in an attitude of listening .   denison listened  too  and shook his head .  suddenly  he looked around .   it s so quiet .  where is everybody .  are you sure we re not lost .     this isn t a natural cavern with unknown passageways .  you have those on earth  haven t you .  i ve seen photographs .     yes  most of them are limestone caves  formed by water .  that certainly can t be the case of the moon  can it .     so we can t be lost   said selene  smiling .   if we re alone  put it down to superstition .     to what .   denison looked startled and his face creased in an expression of disbelief .    don t do that   she said .   you get all lined .  that s right .  smooth out .  you look much better than you did when you first arrived  you know .  that s low gravity and exercise .     and trying to keep up with nude young ladies who have an uncommon amount of off time and an uncommon lack of better things  to do than to go on busmen s holidays .     now you re treating me like a tourist guide again  and i m not nude .     at that  even nudity is less frightening than intuition ism .   .  .  .  but what s this about superstition .     not really superstition  i suppose  but most of the people of the city tend to stay away from this part of the corridor complex .     but why .     because of what i m going to show you .   they were walking again .   hear it now .    she stopped and denison listened anxiously .  he said   you mean that small tapping sound .  tap   tap    is that what you mean .    she ran ahead in slow  loping strides with the slow motion movement of the lunarite in unhurried flight .  he followed her  attempting to ape the gait .    here   here      denison s eye followed selene s eagerly pointing finger .   good lord   he said .   where s it coming from .    there was a drip of what was clearly water .  a slow dripping  with each drip striking a small ceramic trough that led into the rock wall .    from the rocks .  we do have water on the moon  you know .  most of it we can bake out of gypsum  enough for our purposes  since we conserve it pretty well .     i know .  i know .  i ve never yet been able to manage one complete shower .  how you people manage to stay clean i don t know .     i told you .  first  wet yourself .  then turn off the water and smear just a little detergent on you .  you rub it    oh  ben  i m not going through it yet again .  and there s nothing on the moon to get you all that dirty anyway .   .   .   .  but that s not what we re talking about .  in one or two places there are actually water deposits  usually as ice near the surface in a mountain shadow .  if we locate it  it drips out .  this one has been dripping since the corridor was first driven through  and that was eight years ago .     but why the superstition .     well  obviously  water is the great material resource on which the moon depends .  we drink it  wash with it  grow our food with it  make our oxygen with it  keep everything going with it .  free water can t help but get a lot of respect .  once this drip was discovered  plans to extend the tunnels in this direction were abandoned till it stopped .  the corridor walls were even left unfinished .     that sounds like superstition right there .     well   a kind of awe  maybe .  it wasn t expected to last for more than a few months  such drips never do .  well  after this one had passed its first anniversary  it began to seem eternal .  in fact  that s what it s called   the eternal .   you   ll even find it marked that way on the maps .  naturally people have come to attach importance to it  a feeling that if it stops it will mean some sort of bad fortune .    denison laughed .   selene said  warmly   no one really believes it  but everyone part believes it .  you see  it s not really eternal and it must stop some time .  as a matter of fact  the rate of drip is only about a third of what it was when it was first discovered  so that it is slowly drying .  i imagine people feel that if it happened to stop when they were actually here  they would share in the bad fortune .  at least  that s the rational way of explaining their reluctance to come here .     i take it that you don t believe this .     whether i believe it or not isn t the point .  you see i m quite certain that it won t stop sharply enough for anyone to be able to take the blame .  it will just drip slower and slower and slower and no one will ever be able to pinpoint the exact time when it stopped .  so why worry .     i agree with you .     i do  however   she said  making the transition smoothly   have other worries  and i d like to discuss them with you while we re alone .   she spread out the blanket and sat on it  cross legged .    which is why you really brought me here .   he dropped to hip and elbow  facing her .   she said   see  you can look at me easily now .  you re getting used to me .   .  .  .  and  really  there were surely times on earth when near nudity wasn t something to be exclaimed over .     times and places   agreed denison   but not since the passing of the crisis .  in my lifetime       well  on the moon  do as the lunarites do is a good enough guide for behavior .     are you going to tell me why you really brought me here .  or shall i suspect you of planning seduction .     i could carry through seduction quite comfortably at home  thank you .  this is different the surface would have been best  but getting ready to go out on the surface would have attracted a great deal of attention .  coming here didn t  and this place is the only spot in town where we can be reasonably safe from interruption .   she hesitated .    well .   said denison .    barren is angry .  very angry  in fact .     i m not surprised .  i warned you he would be if you told him that i knew you were an intuitionist .  why did you feel it so necessary to tell him .     because it is difficult to keep things for long from my    companion .  probably  though  he doesn t consider me that any longer .     i m sorry .     oh  it was turning sour anyway .  it s lasted long enough .  what bothers me more   much more   is that he violently refuses to accept your interpretation of the pionizer experiments you ran after the surface observations .     i told you the way it would be .     he said he had seen your results     he glanced at them and grunted .     it s rather disillusioning .  does everyone just believe what he wants to .     as long as possible .  sometimes longer .     what about you .     you mean  am i human .  certainly .  i don t believe i m really old .  i believe i m quite attractive .  i believe you seek out .  my company because you think i m charming   even when you insist on turning the conversation to physics .     no .  i mean it .     well  i suspect neville told you that the data i had gathered were not significant beyond the margin of error  which makes them doubtful  and that s true enough .   .   .   .  and yet i prefer to believe they have the meaning i expected them to have to begin with .     just because you want to believe that .     not just because .  look at it this way .  suppose there is no harm in the pump  but that i insist on thinking there is harm .  in that case  i will turn out to be a fool and my scientific reputation will be badly damaged .  but aim a fool in the eyes of the people who count  and i have no scientific reputation .     why is that  ben .  you ve hinted around the tale several times .  can t you tell me the whole story .     you d be surprised how little there is to tell .  at the age of twenty five i was still such a child that i had to amuse myself by insulting a fool for no reason other than that he was a fool .  since his folly was not his fault  i was the greater fool to do it .  my insult drove him to heights he couldn t possibly have scaled otherwise       you re talking of hallam .     yes  of course .  and as he rose  i fell .  and eventually  it dropped me to   the moon .     is that so bad .     no  i rather think it s good .  so let s say he did me a favor  long way round .   .   .   .  and let s get back to what i m talking about .  i   ve just explained that if i believe the pump to be harmful and am wrong  i lose nothing .  on the other hand  if i believe the pump to be harmless and am wrong  i will be helping to destroy the world .  to be sure  i ve lived most of my life already and i suppose i can argue myself into believing that i have no great cause to love humanity .  however  only a few people have hurt me  and if i hurt everyone in return that is unconscionable usury .    then  too  if you d rather have a less noble reason  selene  consider my daughter .  just before i left for the moon  she had  applied for permission to have a child .  she ll probably get it and before long i ll be   if you don   t mind my saying so   a grandfather .  somehow i d like to see my grandchild have a normal life expectancy .  so i prefer to believe the pump is dangerous and to act on that belief .    selene said  intensely   but here s  my point .  is the pump dangerous or is it not .  i mean  the truth  and not what anyone wants to believe .     i should ask you that .  you re the intuitionist what does your intuition say .     but that s what bothers me  ben .  i can t make it really certain either way .  i tend to feel the pump is harmful  but maybe that s because i want to believe that .     all right .  maybe you do .  why .    selene smiled ruefully and shrugged her shoulders .   it would be fun for barron to be wrong .  when he thinks he s certain  he s so vituperatively certain .     i know .  you want to see his face when he s forced to back down .  i m well aware of how intense such a desire can be .  for instance  if the pump were dangerous and i could prove it  i might conceivably be hailed as the savior of humanity  and yet i swear that i d be more interested in the look on hallam s face .  i m not proud of that feeling so i suspect that what i ll do is insist on an equal share of the credit with lamont  who deserves it after all  and confine my pleasure to watching lament s face when he watches hallam s face .  the pettishness will then be one place removed .   .  .   .  but i m beginning to speak nonsense .  .   .  .  selene .     yes  ben .     when did you find out you were an intuitionist .     i don t quite know .     you took physics in college  i imagine .     oh  yes .  some math  too  but i was never good at that come to think of it  i wasn t particularly good in physics  either .  i used to guess the answers when i was desperate  you know  guess what i was supposed to do to get the right answers .  very often  it worked and then i would be asked to explain why i had done what i did and i couldn t do that very well .  they suspected me of cheating but could never prove it    they didn t suspect intuitionism .     i don t think so .  but then  i didn t either .  until   well  one of my first sex mates was a physicist .  in fact  he was the father of my child  assuming he really supplied the sperm sample .  he had a physics problem and he told me about it when we were lying in bed afterward  just to have something to talk about  i suppose .  and i said   you know what it sounds like to me .   and told him .  he tried it just for the fun of it  he said  and it worked .  in fact  that was the first step to the pionizer  which you said was much better than the proton synchrotron .     you mean that was your idea .   denison put his finger under the dripping water and paused as he was about to put it in his mouth .   is this water safe .     it s perfectly sterile   said selene   and it goes into the general reservoir for treatment .  it s saturated with sulfates  carbonates  and a few other items  however .  you won t like the taste .    denison rubbed his finger on his briefs .     you invented the pionizer .     not invented .  i had the original concept .  it took lots of development  mostly by barren .    denison shook his head .   you know  selene  you re an amazing phenomenon .  you should be under observation by the molecular biologists .     should i .  that s not my idea of a thrill .     about half a century ago  there came the climax to the big trend toward genetic engineering       i know .  it flopped and was thrown out of court .  it s illegal now   that whole type of study   insofar as research can be made illegal .  i know people who ve done work on it just the same .     i dare say .  on intuitionism .     no .  i don t think so .     ah .  but that s my point .  at the height of the push for genetic engineering  there was this attempt to stimulate intuitionism .  almost all the great scientists had intuitive ability  of course  and there was the feeling that this was the single great key to creativity .  one could argue that superior capacity for intuition was the product of a particular gene combination and there were all sorts of speculations as to which gene combination that was .     i suspect that there are many possible types that would satisfy .     and i suspect that if you are consulting your intuition here  you are correct but there were also those who insisted that one gene  or one small related group of genes  was of particular importance to the combination so that you might speak of an intuition gene .   .   .    then the whole thing collapsed .     as i said .     but before it collapsed   denison went on   there had been attempts to alter genes to increase the intensity of intuitionism and there were those who insisted that some success had been achieved .  the altered genes entered the gene pool  i m positive  and if you happened to inherit    were any of your grandparents involved in the program .     not as far as i know   said selene   but i can t rule it out .  one of them might have been  for all i can say .   .  .  .  if you don t mind  i m not going to investigate the matter .  i don t want to know .     perhaps not .  the whole field grew fearfully unpopular with the general public and anyone who can be considered the product of genetic engineering would not exactly be greeted gladly .   .   .   .  intuitionism  they said  for instance  was inseparable from certain undesirable characteristics .     well  thank you .     they said .  to possess intuition is to inspire a certain envy and enmity in others .  even as gentle and saint like an intuitionist as michael faraday aroused the envy and hatred of humphry davy .  who s to say that it doesn t take a certain flaw in character t   be capable of arousing envy .  and in your case      selene said   surely  i don t rouse your envy and hatred .     i don t think so .  what about neville  though .    selene was silent .   denison said   by the time you got to neville  you were well known as an intuitionist  i suppose .     not well known  i would say .  some physicists suspected it  i m sure .  however  they don t like to give up credit here any more than on earth  and i suppose they convinced themselves  more or less  that whatever i had said to them was just a meaningless guess .  but barron knew  of course .     i see .   denison paused .   selene s lips twitched .   somehow i get the feeling that you want to say   oh that s why he bothers with you .      no  of course not  selene .  you re quite attractive enough to be desired for your own sake .     i think so  too  but every little bit helps and barron was bound to be interested in my intuitionism .  why shouldn t he be .  only he insisted i keep my job as tourist guide .  he said i was an important natural resource of the moon and he didn t want earth monopolizing me the way they monopolized the synchrotron .     an odd thought .  but perhaps it was that the fewer who knew of your intuitionism  the fewer would suspect your contribution to what would otherwise be put to his sole credit .     now you sound like barron himself .     do i .  and is it possible he gets rather annoyed with you when your intuitionism is working particularly well .    selene shrugged .   barron is a suspicious man .  we all have our faults .     is it wise to be alone with me  then .    selene said  sharply   now don t get hurt because i defend him .  he doesn t really suspect the possibility of sexual misbehavior between us .  you re from earth .  in fact  i might as well tell you he encourages our companionship .  he thinks i can learn from you .     and have you .   asked denison  coldly .    i have .  .  .  .  yet though that may be his chief reason for encouraging our friendship  it isn t mine .     what s yours .     as you well know   said selene   and as you want to hear me say  i enjoy your company .  otherwise  i could get what i want in considerably less time .     all right  selene .  friends .     friends .  absolutely .     what have you learned from me  then .  may i know .     that would take awhile to explain .  you know that the reason we can t set up a pump station anywhere we want to is that we can t locate the para universe  even though they can locate us .  that might be because they are much more intelligent or much more technologically advanced than we are       not necessarily me same thing   muttered denison .    i know .  that s why i put in the  or .   but it might also be that we are neither particularly stupid nor particularly backward .  it might be something as simple as the fact that they offer the harder target .  if the strong nuclear interaction is stronger in the para universe  they d be bound to have much smaller suns and  very likely  much smaller planets .  their individual world would be harder to locate than ours would be .    or then again   she went on   suppose it s the electromagnetic field they detect .  the electromagnetic field of a planet is much larger than the planet itself and is much easier to locate .  and that would mean that while they can detect the earth  they can t detect the moon  which has no electromagnetic field to speak of .  that s why  perhaps  we ve failed to set up a pump station on the moon .  and  if their small planets lack a significant electromagnetic field  we can t locate them .    denison said   it s an attractive thought    next  consider the inter universal exchange in properties that serves to weaken their strong nuclear interaction  cooling their suns  while strengthening ours  heating and exploding our suns .  what might that imply .  suppose they can collect energy one way without our help but only at ruinously low efficiencies .  under ordinary circumstances that would therefore be utterly impractical .  they would need us to help direct concentrated energy in their direction by supplying tungsten     to them and accepting plutonium     in return .  but suppose our galactic arm implodes into a quasar .  that would produce an energy concentration in the neighborhood of the solar system enormously greater than now exists and one that might persist for over a million years .    once that quasar forms  even a ruinously low efficiency becomes sufficient .  it wouldn t matter to them  therefore  whether we are destroyed or not .  in fact  we might argue that it would be safer for them if we did explode .  until we do  we might end the pump for any of a variety of reasons and they would be helpless to start it again .  after the explosion  they are home free  no one could interfere .   .   .   .  and that s why people who say   if the pump is dangerous  why don t those terribly clever para men stop it .   don t know what they re talking about    did neville give you that argument .     yes  he did .     but the para sun would keep cooling down  wouldn t it .     what does that matter .   said selene  impatiently .   with the pump  they wouldn t be dependent on their sun for anything .    denison took a deep breath .   you can t possibly know this  selene  but there was a rumor on earth that lament received a message from the para men to the effect that the pump was dangerous  but that they couldn t stop it .  no one took it seriously  of course  but suppose it s true .  suppose lamont did receive such a message .  might it be that some of the para men were humanitarian enough to wish not to destroy a world with cooperating intelligences upon it  and were prevented by the opposition of an oh so practical majority .    selene nodded .   i suppose that s possible .  .  .  .  all this i knew  or rather  intuited  before you came on the scene .  but then you said that nothing between one and the infinite made any sense .  remember .     of course .     all right .  the differences between our universe and the para universe he so obviously in the strong nuclear interaction that so far it s all that s been studied .  but there is more than one interaction  there are four .  in addition to the strong nuclear  there is the electromagnetic  the weak nuclear  and the gravitational  with intensity ratios of                   .  but if four  why not an infinite number  with all the others too weak to be detectable or to influence our universe in any way    denison said   if an interaction is too weak to be detectable or to exert influence in any way  then by any operational definition  it doesn t exist .     in this universe   said selene  with a snap .   who knows what does or does not exist in the para universe .  with an infinite number of possible interactions  each of which can vary infinitely in intensity compared to any one of them taken as standard  the number of different possible universes that can exist is infinite .     possibly the infinity of the continuum  aleph one  rather than aleph null .    selene frowned .   what does that mean .     it s not important .  go on .    selene said   instead  then  of trying to work with the one para universe that has impinged itself on us and which may not suit our needs at all  why don t we instead try to work out which universe  out of all the infinite possibilities  best suits us  and is most easily located .  let us design a universe  for after all whatever we design must exist  and search for it .    denison smiled .   selene  i ve thought of exactly the same thing .  and while there s no law that states i can t be completely wrong  it s very unlikely that anyone as brilliant as myself can be completely wrong when anyone as brilliant as yourself comes to exactly the same conclusion independently .  .  .  .  do you know what .     what .   asked selene .    i m beginning to like your damned moon food .  or getting used to it  anyway .  let s go back home and eat  and then we can start working out our plans .   .   .   .  and you know what else .     what .     as long as we ll be working together  how about one kiss   as experimentalist to intuitionist .    selene considered .  she said   we ve both of us kissed and been kissed a good many times  i suppose .  how about doing it as man to woman .     i think i can manage that .  but what do i do so as not to be clumsy about it .  what are the moon rules for kissing .     follow instinct   said selene  casually .   carefully  denison placed his arms behind his back and leaned toward selene .  then  after a while  he placed his arms behind her back .                and then i actually kissed him back   said selene  thoughtfully .    oh  did you .   said barren neville  harshly .   well  that s valor beyond the call of duty .     i don t know .  it wasn t that bad .  in fact    and she smiled   he was rather touching about it .  he was afraid he would be clumsy and began by putting his arms behind his back so that he wouldn t crush me  i suppose .     spare me the details .     why  what the hell do you care .   she fired up  suddenly .   you re mister platonic  aren t you .     do you want it differently .  now .     you needn t perform to order .     but you had better .  when do you expect to give us what we need .     as soon as i can   she said  tonelessly .    without his knowing .     he s interested only in energy .     and in saving the world   mocked neville .   and in being a hero .  and in showing everybody .  and in kissing you .     he admits to all that .  what do you admit to .     impatience   said neville  angrily .   lots of impatience .                 i am glad   said denison  deliberately   that the daytime is over .   he held out his right arm and stared at it  encased in its protective layers .   the lunar sun is one thing i can t get used to and don t want to get used to .  even this suit seems a natural thing to me in comparison .     what s wrong with the sun .   asked selene .    don t tell  me you like it  selene .     no  of course not .  i hate it .  but then i never see it you re an    you re used to the sun .     not the way it is here on the moon .  it shines out of a black sky here .  it dazzles the stars away  instead of muffling them .  it is hot  hard  and dangerous .  it is an enemy  and while it s in the sky  i can t help but feel that none of our attempts at reducing field intensity will succeed .     that s superstition  ben   said selene  with a distant edge of exasperation .   the sun has nothing to do with it .  we were in the crater shadow anyway and it was just like night .  stars and all .     not quite   said denison .   anytime we looked northward  selene  we could see that stretch of sunlight glittering  i hated to look northward  yet the direction dragged at my eyes .  every time i looked at it i could feel the hard ultraviolet springing at my view plate .     that s imagination .  in the first place there s no ultraviolet to speak of in reflected light  in the second  your suit protects you against radiation .     not against heat .  not very much .     but it s night now .     yes   said denison with satisfaction   and this i like .   he looked about with a continuing wonder .  earth was in the sky  of course  in its accustomed place  a fat crescent  now  bellying to the southwestward .  the constellation orion was above it  a hunter rising up out of the brilliant curved chair of earth .  the horizon glittered in the dim crescent earth light .    it s beautiful   he said .  then   selene  is the pionizer showing anything .    selene  who was looking at the skies  with no comment  stepped toward the maze of equipment that  over the past three alternations of day and night  had been assembled there in the shadow of the crater .    not yet   she said   but that s good news really .  the field intensity is holding at just over fifty .     not low enough   said denison .   selene said   it can be lowered further .  i m sure that all the parameters are suitable .     the magnetic field  too .     i m not sure about the magnetic field .     if we strengthen that  the whole thing becomes unstable .     it shouldn t .  i know it shouldn t .     selene  i trust your intuition against everything but the facts .  it does get unstable .  we ve tried it .     i know  ben .  but not quite with this geometry .  it s been holding to fifty two a phenomenally long time .  surely  if we begin to hold it there for hours instead of minutes  we ought to be able to strengthen the magnetic field tenfold for a period of minutes instead of seconds .   .   .   .  let s try .     not yet   said denison .   selene hesitated  then stepped back  turning away .  she said   you still don t miss earth  do you  ben .     no .  it s rather odd  but i don t .  i would have thought it inevitable that i miss blue sky  green earth  flowing water   all the clich   adjective noun combinations peculiar to earth .  i miss none of them .  i don t even dream about them .    selene said   this sort of thing does happen sometime .  at least  there are immies who say they experience no homesickness .  they re in the minority  of course  and no one has ever been able to decide what this minority has in common .  guesses run all the way from serious emotional deficiency  no capacity to feel anything  to serious emotional excess  a fear to admit homesickness lest it lead to breakdown .     in my case  i think it s plain enough .  life on earth was not very enjoyable for two decades and more  while here i work at last in a field i have made my own  and i have your help .   .   .   .  more than that  selene  i have your company .     you are kind   said selene  gravely   to place company and help in the relationship you do .  you don t seem to need much help .  do you pretend to seek it for the sake of my company .        denison laughed softly .  tin not sure which answer would flatter you more .     try the truth .     the truth is not so easy to determine when i value each so much .   he turned back to the pionizer .   the field intensity still holds  selene .    selene s faceplate glinted in the earthlight .  she said   barren says that non homesickness is natural and the sign of a healthy mind .  he says that though the human body was adapted to earth s surface and requires adjustment to the moon  the human brain was not and does not .  the human brain is so different  qualitatively  from all other brains that it can be considered a new phenomenon .  it has had no time to be really fixed to earth s surface and can  without adjustment  fit other environments .  he says that enclosure in the caverns of the moon may actually suit it best of all  for that is but a larger version of its enclosure in the cavern of the skull .     do you believe that .   asked denison  amused .    when barron talks  he can make things sound very plausible .     i think it can be made equally plausible to claim that the comfort to be found in the caverns of the moon is the result of the fulfillment of the return to the womb fantasy .  in fact   he added  thoughtfully   considering the controlled temperature and pressure  the nature and digestibility of the food  i could make a good case for considering the lunar colony   i beg your pardon  selene   the lunar city a deliberate reconstruction of the fetal environment .    selene said   i don t think barren would agree with you for a minute .     i m sure he wouldn t   said denison .  he looked at the earth crescent  watching the distant cloud banks on edge .  he fell into silence  absorbed in the view  and even though selene moved back to the pionizer  he remained in place .    he watched earth in its nest of stars and looked toward the serrated horizon where  every once in a while  it seemed to him he saw a puff of smoke where a small meteorite might be landing .   he had pointed out a similar phenomenon  with some concern  to selene during the previous lunar night .  she had been unconcerned .   she said   the earth does shift slightly in the sky because of the moon s libration and every once in a while a shaft of earth light tops a small rise and falls on a bit of soil beyond .  it comes into view like a tiny puff of rising dust .  it s common .  we pay no attention .    denison had said   but it could be a meteorite sometimes .  don t meteorites ever strike .     of course they do .  you re probably hit by several every time you re out your suit protects you .     i don t mean micro dust particles .  i mean sizable meteorites that would really kick up the dust .  meteorites that could kill you .     well  they fall  too  but they are few and the moon is large .  no one has been hit yet .    and as denison watched the sky and thought of that  he saw what  in the midst of his momentary preoccupation  he took to be a meteorite .  light streaking through the sky could  however  be a meteorite only on earth with its atmosphere and not on the airless moon .   the light in the sky was man made and denison had not yet sorted out his impressions when it became  quite clearly  a small rocket vessel sinking rapidly to a landing beside him .   a single suited figure emerged  while a pilot remained within  barely seen as a dark splotch against the highlights .   denison waited .  the etiquette of the spacesuit required the newcomer joining any group to announce himself first .    commissioner gottstein here   the new voice said   as you can probably tell from my wobble .     ben denison here   said denison .    yes .  i thought as much .     have you come here looking for me .     certainly .     in a space skipper .  you might       i might   said gottstein   have used outlet p    which is less than a thousand yards from here .  yes  indeed .  but i wasn t looking only for you .     well  i won t ask for the meaning of what you say .     there s no reason for me to be coy .  surely you have not expected me to be uninterested in the fact that you have been carrying on experiments on the lunar surface .     it s been no secret and anyone might be interested .     yet no one seems to know the details of the experiments .  except  of course  that in some way you are working on matters concerning the electron pump .     it s a reasonable assumption .     is it .  it seemed to me that experiments of such a nature  to have any value at all  would require a rather enormous setup .  this is not of my own knowledge  you understand .  i consulted those who would know .  and  it is quite obvious  you are not working on such a setup .  it occurred to me  therefore  that you might not be the proper focus of my interest .  while my attention was drawn to you  others might be undertaking more important tasks .     why should i be used as distraction .     i don t know .  if i knew  i would be less concerned .     so i have been under observation .    gottstein chuckled .   that  yes .  since you have arrived .  but while you have been working here on the surface  we have observed this entire region for miles in every direction .  oddly enough  it would seem that you  dr .  denison  and your companion  are the only ones on the lunar surface for any but the most routine of purposes .     why is that odd .     because it means that you really think you re doing something with your gimcrack contraption  whatever it is .  i can t believe that you are incompetent  so i think it would be worth listening to you if you tell me what you are doing .     i am experimenting in para physics  commissioner  precisely as rumor has it .  to which i can add that so far my experiments have been only partly successful .     your companion is  i imagine  selene lindstrom l .   a tourist guide .     yes .     an unusual choice as an assistant .     she is intelligent  eager  interested  and extremely attractive .     and willing to work with an earthman .     and quite willing to work with an immigrant who will be a lunar citizen as soon as he qualifies for that status .    selene was approaching now .  her voice rang in their ears .   good day  commissioner .  i would have liked not to overhear  and intrude on a private conversation  but  in a spacesuit  overhearing is inevitable anywhere within the horizon .    gottstein turned .   hello  miss lindstrom .  i did not expect to talk in secrecy .  are you interested in para physics .     oh  yes .     you are not disheartened by the failures of the experiment .     they are not entirely failures   she said .   they are less a failure than dr .  denison thinks at present .     what .   denison turned sharply on his heel  nearly overbalancing himself and sending out a spurt of dust .   all three were facing the pionizer now  and above it  just about five feet above it  light shone like a fat star .    selene said   i raised the intensity of the magnetic field  and the nuclear field remained stable in being   then eased further and further and       leaked .   denison said .   damn it .  i didn t see it happen .    selene said   i m sorry  ben .  first you were lost in your own thoughts  then the commissioner arrived  and i couldn t resist the chance of trying on my own .    gottstein said   but just what is it that i see there .    denison said   energy being spontaneously given off by matter leaking from another universe into ours .    and even as he said that the light blinked out and many yards away  a farther  dimmer star came into simultaneous being .   denison lunged toward the pionizer  but selene  all lunar grace  propelled herself across the surface more efficiently and was there first .  she killed the field structure and the distant star went out .   she said   the leak point isn t stable  you see .     not on a small scale   said denison   but considering that a shift of a light year is as theoretically possible as a shift of a hundred yards  one of a hundred yards only is miraculous stability .     not miraculous enough   said selene  flatly .   gottstein interrupted .   let me guess what you re talking about you mean that the matter can leak through here  or there  or anywhere in our universe   at random .     not quite at random  commissioner   said denison .   the probability of leakage drops with distance from the pionizer  and rather sharply i should say .  the sharpness depends on a variety of factors and i think we ve tightened the situation remarkably .  even so  a flip of a few hundred yards is quite probable and  as a matter of fact  you saw it happen .     and it might have shifted to somewhere within the city or within our own helmets  perhaps .    denison said  impatiently   no  no .  the leak  at least by the techniques we use  is heavily dependent on the density of matter already present in this universe .  the chances are virtually nil that the leak position would shift from a place of essential vacuum to one where an atmosphere even a hundredth as dense as that within the city or within our helmets would exist .  it would be impractical to expect to arrange the leak anywhere but into a vacuum in the first place  which is why we had to make the attempt up here on the surface .     then this is not like the electron pump .     not at all   said denison .   in the electron pump there is a two way transfer of matter  here a one way leak .  nor are the universes involved the same .    gottstein said   i wonder if you would have dinner with me this evening  dr .  denison .    denison hesitated .   myself only .    gottstein attempted a bow in the direction of selene but could accomplish only a grotesque parody of it in his spacesuit .   i would be charmed to have miss lindstrom s company on another occasion  but on this one i must speak with you alone  dr .  denison .     oh  go ahead   said selene  crisply  as denison still hesitated .   i have a heavy schedule tomorrow anyway and you ll need time to worry about the leak point instability .    denison said  uncertainly   well  then    selene  will you let me know when your next free day is .     i always do  don t i .  and we ll be in touch before then anyway .  .  .  .  why don t you two go on .  i ll take care of the equipment .                barren neville shifted from foot to foot in the fashion made necessary by the restricted quarters and by the moon s gravity .  in a larger room under a world s stronger pull  he would have walked hastily up and back .  here  he tilted from side to side  in a repetitive back and forth glide .    then you re positive it works .  right  selene .  you re positive .     i m positive   said selene .   i ve told you five times by actual count .    neville didn t seem to be listening .  he said in a low  rapid voice   it doesn t matter that gottstein was there  then .  he didn t try to stop the experiment .     no .  of course not .     there was no indication that he would try to exert authority       now  barron  what kind of authority could he exert .  will earth send a police force .  besides   oh  you know they can t stop us .    neville stopped moving  stood motionless for a while .   they don t know .  they still don t know .     of course they don t .  ben was looking at the stars and then gottstein came .  so i tried for the field leak  got it  and i had already gotten the other .  ben s setup       don t call it his setup .  it was your idea  wasn t it .    selene shook her head .   i made vague suggestions .  the details were ben s .       but you can reproduce it now .  for luna s sake  we don t have to go to the earthie for it  do we .     i think i can reproduce enough of it now so that our people can fill it in .     all right  then .  let s get started .     not yet .  oh  damn it  barron  not yet    why not yet .     we need the energy  too .     but we have that .     not quite .  the leak point is unstable  pretty badly unstable .     but that can be fixed up .  you said so .     i said i thought it could .     that s good enough for me .     just the same  it would be better to have ben work out the details and stabilize it .    there was a silence between them .  neville s  thin face slowly twisted into something approaching hostility .   you don t think i can do it .  is that it .    selene said   will you come out on the surface with me and work on it .    there was another silence .  neville said  unsteadily   i don t appreciate your sarcasm .  and i don t want to have to wait long .     i can t command the laws of nature .  but i think it won t be long .   .   .   .  now if you don t mind  i need my sleep .  i ve got my tourists tomorrow .    for a moment  neville seemed on the point of gesturing to his own bed alcove as though offering hospitality  but the gesture  if that was what it was  did not really come to birth and selene made no sign of understanding or even anticipating .  she nodded wearily  and left .                i had hoped  to be frank   said gottstein  smiling over what passed for dessert   a sticky  sweet concoction     that we would have seen each other more often .    denison said   it is kind of you to take such an interest in my work .  if the leak instability can be corrected  i think my achievement   and that of miss lindstrom   will have been a most significant one .     you speak carefully  like a scientist .   .  .  .  i won t insult you by offering the lunar equivalent of a liqueur  that is the one approximation to earth s cuisine i have simply made up my mind not to tolerate .  can you tell me  in lay language  what makes the achievement significant .     i can try   said denison  cautiously .   suppose we start with the para universe .  it has a more intense strong nuclear interaction than our universe has so that relatively small masses of protons in the para universe can undergo the fusion reaction capable of supporting a star .  masses equivalent to our stars would explode violently in the para universe which has many more  but much smaller  stars than ours does .    suppose  now  that we had a much less intense strong nuclear interaction than that which prevails in our universe .  in that case  huge masses of protons would have so little tendency to fuse that a very large mass of hydrogen would be needed to support a star .  such an anti para uni verse   one that was the opposite of the para universe  in other words   would consist of considerably fewer but of far larger stars than our universe does .  in fact  if the strong nuclear interaction were made sufficiently weak  a universe would exist which consisted of a single star containing all the mass in that universe .  it would be a very dense star  but relatively non reactive and giving off no more radiation than our single sun does  perhaps .    gottstein said   am i wrong  or isn t that the situation that prevailed in our own universe before the time of the big bang   one vast body containing all the universal mass .     yes   said denison   as a matter of fact  the anti para universe i am picturing consists of what some call a cosmic egg  or  cosmeg  for short .  a cosmeg universe is what we need if we are to probe for one way leakage .  the para universe we are now using with its tiny stars is virtually empty space .  you can probe and probe and touch nothing .     the para men reached us  however .     yes  possibly by following magnetic fields .  there is some reason to think that there are no planetary magnetic fields of significance in the para universe  which deprives us of the advantage they have .  on the other hand  if we probe the cosmeg universe  we cannot fail .  the cosmeg is  itself  the entire universe  and wherever we probe we strike matter .     but how do you probe for it .    denison hesitated .   that is the part i find difficult to explain .  pions are the mediating particles of the strong nuclear interaction .  the intensity of the interaction depends on the mass of the pions and that mass can  under certain specialized conditions  be altered .  the lunar physicists have developed an instrument they call the pionizer  which can be made to do just such a thing .  once the pion s mass is decreased  or increased for that matter  it is  effectively  part of another universe  it becomes a gateway  a crossing point .  if it is decreased sufficiently  it can be made part of a cosmeg universe and that s what we want .    gottstein said   and you can suck in matter from the    the   cosmeg universe .     that part is easy .  once the gateway forms  the influx is spontaneous .  the matter enters with its own laws and is stable when it arrives .  gradually the laws  . of our own universe soak in  the strong interaction grows stronger  and the matter fuses and begins to give off enormous energy .     but if it is super dense  why doesn t it just expand in a puff of smoke .     that  too  would yield energy  but that depends on the electromagnetic field and in this particular case the strong interaction takes precedence  because we control the electromagnetic field .  it would take quite a time to explain that .     well  then  the globe of light that i saw on the surface was cosmeg material fusing .     yes  commissioner .     and that energy can be harnessed for useful purposes .     certainly .  and in any quantity .  what you saw was the arrival in our universe of micromicrogram masses of cosmeg .  there s nothing  in theory  to prevent our bringing it over in ton lots .     well  then  this can be used to replace the electron pump .    denison shook his head .   no .  the use of cosmeg energy also alters the properties of the universes in question .  the strong interaction gradually grows more intense in the cosmeg universe and less intense in ours as the laws of nature cross over .  that means that the cosmeg slowly undergoes fusion at a greater rate and gradually warms up .  eventually       eventually   sad gottstein  crossing his arms across his chest and narrowing his eyes  thoughtfully   it explodes in a big bang .     that s my feeling .     do you suppose that s what happened to our own universe ten billion years ago .     perhaps .  cosmogonists have wondered why the original cosmic egg exploded at some one point in time and not at another .  one solution was to imagine an oscillating universe in which the cosmic egg was formed and then at once exploded .  the oscillating universe has been eliminated as a possibility and the conclusion is that the cosmic egg had to exist for some long period of time and then went through a crisis  of instability which arose for some unknown reason .     but which may have been the result of the tapping of its energy across the universes .     possibly  but not necessarily by some intelligence .  perhaps there are occasional spontaneous leaks .     and when the big bang takes place   said gottstein   can we still extract energy from the cosmeg universe .     i m not sure  but surely that is not an immediate worry .  the leakage of our strong interaction field into the cosmeg universe must very likely continue for millions of years before pushing it past the critical point .  and there must be other cosmeg universes  an infinite number  perhaps .    what about the change in our own universe .     the strong interaction weakens .  slowly  very slowly  our sun cools off .     can we use cosmeg energy to make up for that .     that would not be necessary  commissioner   said denison  earnestly .   while the strong interaction here in our universe weakens as a result of the cosmeg pump  it strengthens through the action of the ordinary electron pump .  if we adjust the energy productions of the two then  though the laws of nature change in the cosmeg universe and in the para universe  they do not change in ours .  we are a highway but not the terminus in either direction .    nor need we be disturbed on behalf of the terminuses  .  the para men on their side may have adjusted themselves to the cooling off of their sun which may be pretty cool to begin with .  as for the cosmeg universe  there is no reason to suspect life can exist there .  indeed  it is by inducing the conditions required for the big bang that we may be setting up a new land of universe that will eventually grow hospitable to life .    for a while  gottstein said nothing .  his plump face  in repose  seemed emotionless .  he nodded to himself as though following the line of his own thoughts .   finally  he said   you know  denison  i think this is what will set the world on its ear .  any difficulty in persuading the scientific leadership that the electron pump is destroying the world should now disappear .    denison said   the emotional reluctance to accept that no longer exists .  it will be possible to present the problem and the solution at the same time .     when would you be willing to prepare a paper to this effect if i guarantee speedy publication .     can you guarantee that .     in a government published pamphlet  if no other way .     i would prefer to try to neutralize the leak instability before reporting .     of course .     and i think it would be wise   said denison   to arrange to have dr .  peter lament as co author .  he can make the mathematics rigorous  something i cannot do .  besides  it was through his work that i took the course i have followed .  one more point  commissioner       yes .     i would suggest that the lunar physicists be involved .  one of their number  dr .  barren neville  might well be a third author .     but why .  aren t you introducing unnecessary complications now .     it was their pionizer that made everything possible .     there can be appropriate mention of that .   .   .   .  but did dr .  barren actually work on the project with you .     not directly .     then why involve him .    denison looked down and brushed his hand thoughtfully over the weave of his pants leg .  he said   it would be the diplomatic thing to do .  we would need to set up the cosmeg pump on the moon .     why not on earth .     in the first place  we need a vacuum .  this is a one way transfer and not a two way as in the case of the electron pump  and the conditions necessary to make it practical are different in the two cases .  the surface of the moon has its vacuum ready made in vast quantities  while to prepare one on earth would involve an enormous effort .     yet it could be done  couldn t it .     secondly   said denison   if we have two vast energy sources from opposite directions with our own universe between  there would be something like a short circuit if the two outlets were too close together .  separation by a quarter million miles of vacuum  with the electron pump operating only on earth and the cosmeg pump operating only on the moon  would be ideal   in fact  necessary .  and if we are to operate on the moon  it would be wise  even decent  to take the sensibilities of the lunar physicists into account .  we ought to give them a share .    gottstein smiled .   is this the advice of miss lindstrom .     i m sure it would be  but the suggestion is reasonable enough to have occurred to me independently .    gottstein rose  stretched  and then jumped in place two or three times in the eerily slow fashion imposed by lunar gravity .  he flexed his knees each time .  he sat down again and said   ever try that  dr .  denison .    denison shook his head .    it s supposed to help the circulation in the lower extremities .  i do it whenever i feel my legs may be going to sleep .  i ll be heading back for a short visit to earth before long and i m trying to keep from getting too used to lunar gravity .  .  .  .  shall we talk of miss lindstrom  dr .  denison .    denison said in a quite changed tone   what about her .     she is a tourist guide .     yes .  you said so earlier .     as i also said  she is an odd assistant for a physicist .     actually  i m an amateur physicist only  and i suppose she is an amateur assistant   gottstein was no longer smiling .   don t play games  doctor .  i have taken the trouble to find out what i can about her .  her record is quite revealing  or would have been if it had occurred to anyone to look at it before this .  i believe she is an intuitionist   denison said   many of us are .  i have no doubt you are an intuitionist yourself  after a fashion .  i certainly know that i am  after a fashion .     there is a difference  doctor .  you are an accomplished scientist and i  i hope  am an accomplished administrator .   .   .   .  yet while miss lindstrom is enough of an intuitionist to be useful to you in advanced theoretical physics  she is  in actual fact  a tourist guide .    denison hesitated .   she has little formal training  commissioner .  her intuitionism is at an unusually high level but it is under little conscious control .     is she the result of the one time genetic engineering program .      i don t know .  i wouldn t be surprised if that were so  however .     do you trust her .     in what way .  she has helped me .     do you know that she is the wife of dr .  barron neville .     there is an emotional connection  not a legal one  i believe .     none of the connections are what we would call legal here on the moon .  the same neville you want to invite as third author of the paper you are to write .     yes .     is that merely a coincidence .     no .  neville was interested in my arrival and i believe he asked selene to help me in my work .     did she tell you this .     she said he was interested in me .  that was natural enough  i suppose .     does it occur to you  dr .  denison  that she may be working in her own interests and in those of dr .  neville .     in what way would their interests differ from ours .  she has helped me without reservation .    gottstein shifted position and moved his shoulders as though he were going through muscle pulling exercises .  he said   dr .  neville must know that a woman so close to himself is an intuitionist .  wouldn t he use her .  why would she remain a tourist guide  if not to mask her abilities   for a purpose .     i understand dr .  neville frequently reasons in this fashion .  i find it difficult to suspect unnecessary conspiracies .     how do you know they are unnecessary .  .  .  .  when my space skipper was hovering over the moon s surface just before the ball of radiation formed over your equipment  i was looking down at you .  you were not at the pionizer .    denison thought back .   no  i wasn t i was looking at the stars  rather a tendency of mine on the surface .     what was miss lindstrom doing .     i didn t see .  she said she strengthened the magnetic field and the leak finally broke through .     is it customary for her to manipulate the equipment without you .     no .  but i can understand the impulse .     and would there have been some sort of an ejection .     i don t understand you .     i m not sure i understand myself .  there was a dim sparkle in the earthlight  as though something was flying through the air .  i don t know what .     i don t either   said denison .    you can t think of anything that might naturally have to do with the experiment that       no .     then what was miss lindstrom doing .     i still don t know .    for a moment  the silence was heavy between them .  then the commissioner said   as i see it then  you will try to correct the leak instability and will be thinking about the preparation of a paper .  i will get matters into motion at the other end and on my shortly forthcoming visit to earth will make arrangements to have the paper published and will alert the government .    it was a clear dismissal .  denison rose and the commissioner said easily   and think about dr .  neville and miss lindstrom .                it was a heavier star of radiation  a fatter one  a brighter one .  denison could feel its warmth on his faceplate  and backed away .  there was a distinct x ray component in the radiation and though this shielding should take care of that there was no point in placing it under a strain .    i guess we can t question it   he muttered .   the leak point is stable .     i m sure of it   said selene  flatly .    then let s turn it off and go back to the city .    they moved slowly and denison felt oddly dispirited .  there was no uncertainty any more  no excitement .  from this point on  there was no chance of failure .  the government was interested  more and more  it would be out of his own hands .   he said   i suppose i can begin the paper now .     i suppose so   said selene  carefully .    have you talked to barren again .     yes  i have     any difference in his attitude .     none at all .  he will not participate .  ben       yes .     i really don t think it s any use talking to him .  he will not cooperate in any project with the earth government    but you ve explained the situation .     completely .     and he still won t .     he s asked to see gottstein  and the commissioner agreed to an interview after he returns from his earth visit well have to wait till then .  maybe gottstein can have some effect on him  but i doubt it .    denison shrugged  a useless maneuver inside his space suit .   i don t understand him .     i do   said selene  softly .   denison did not respond directly .  he shoved the pionizer and its attendant apparatus into its rocky shelter and said   ready .     ready .    they slipped into the surface entrance at outlet p   in silence and denison climbed down the entry ladder .  selene dropped past him  braking in quick holds at individual rungs .  denison had learned to do that  but he was dispirited and climbed down in a kind of rebellious refusal to accept acclimation .   they removed their suits in the staging areas  placed them in their lockers .  denison said   would you join me for lunch  selene .    selene said uneasily   you seem upset .  is something wrong .     reaction  i think .  lunch .     yes  of course .    they ate in selene s quarters .  she insisted  saying   i want to talk to you and i can t do it properly in .  the cafeteria .    and when denison was chewing slowly at something that had a faint resemblance to peanut flavored veal  she said   ben  you haven t said a word  and you ve been like this for a week .     no  i haven t   said denison  frowning .    yes  you have .   she looked into his eyes with concern .   i m not sure how good my intuition is outside physics  but i suppose there s something you don t want to tell me .    denison shrugged .   they re making a fuss about all this back on earth .  gottstein has been pulling at strings as tough as cables in advance of his trip back .  dr .  lament is being lionized  and they want me to come back once the paper is written .     back to earth .     yes .  it seems i m a hero  too .     you should be .     complete rehabilitation   said denison  thoughtfully     is what they offer .  it s clear i can get a position in any suitable university or government agency on earth .     isn t that what you wanted .     it s what i imagine lament wants  and would enjoy  and will certainly get .  but i don t want it .    selene said   what do you want then .     i want to stay on the moon .     why .     because it s the cutting edge of humanity and i want to be part of that cutting edge .  i want to work at the establishment of cosmeg pumps and that will be only here on the moon .  i want to work on para theory with the kind of instruments you can dream up and handle  selene .   .  .  .  i want to be with you  selene .  but will you stay with me .     i am as interested in para theory as you are .   denison said   but won t neville pull you off the job now .     barren pull me off .   she said  tightly   are you trying to insult me  ben .     not at all .     well  then  do i misunderstand you .  are you suggesting that i m working with you because barron ordered me to .     didn t he .     yes  he did .  but that s not why i m here .  i choose to be here .  he may think he can order me about but he can only do so when his orders coincide with my will  as in your case they did .  i resent his thinking he can order me otherwise  and i resent your thinking it  too .     you two are sex partners .     we have been  yes  but what has that to do with it .  by that argument  i can order him about as easily as he me .     then you can work with me  selene .     certainly   she said  coldly .   if i choose to .     but do you choose to .     as of now  yes .    and denison smiled .   the chance that you might not choose to  or even might not be able to  is  i think  what has really been worrying me this past week .  i dreaded the end of the project if it meant the end of you .  i m sorry  selene  i don t mean to plague you with a sentimental attachment of an old earthie       well  there s nothing old earthie about your mind  ben .  there are other attachments than sexual .  i like being with you .    there was a pause and denison s smile faded  then returned  perhaps a thought more mechanically .   i m glad for my mind .    denison looked away  shook his head slightly  then turned back .  she watched him carefully  almost anxiously .   denison said   selene  there s more than energy involved in the cross universe leaks .  i suspect you ve been thinking about that .    the silence stretched out now  painfully  and finally selene said   oh  that      for a while the two stared at each other   denison embarrassed  selene almost furtive .               gottstein said   i haven t got my moon legs quite yet  but this isn t anything compared to what it cost me to get my earth legs .  denison  you had better not dream of returning .  you ll never make it .     i have no intention of returning  commissioner   said denison .    in a way  it s too bad .  you could be emperor by acclamation .  as for hallam      denison said  wistfully   i would have liked to see his face  but that s a small ambition .     lamont  of course  is receiving the lion s share .  he s on the spot .     i don t mind that .  he deserves a good deal .  .  .  .  do you think neville will really join us .     no question .  he s on his way at this moment .   .  .  .  listen   gottstein s voice dropped one conspiratorial note in pitch .   before he comes  would you like a bar of chocolate .     what .   .    a bar of chocolate .  with almonds .  one .  i have some .    denison s face  from initial confusion  suddenly lit with comprehension .     real chocolate .     yes .     certain     his face hardened .   no  commissioner .     no .     no .  if i taste real chocolate then  for the few minutes it s in my mouth  i m going to miss earth  i m going to miss everything about it .  i can t afford that .  i don t want it .   .  .  .  don t even show it to me .  don t let me smell it or see it .    the commissioner looked discomfited .   you re right .   he made an obvious attempt to change the subject .   the excitement on earth is overwhelming .  of course  we made a considerable effort to save hallam s face .  he ll continue to hold some position of importance  but he ll have little real say .     he s getting more consideration than he gave others   said denison  resignedly .    it s not for his sake .  you can t smash a personal image that has been built to a level of such importance  it would reflect on science itself .  the good name of science is more important than hallam either way .     i disapprove of that in principle   said denison  warmly .   science must take what blows it deserves .     a time and place for    there s dr .  neville .    gottstein composed his face .  denison shifted his  chair to face the entrance .   barron neville entered solemnly .  somehow there was less than ever of the lunar delicacy about his figure .  he greeted the two curtly  sat down  and crossed his legs .  he was clearly waiting for gottstein to speak first .   the commissioner said   i am glad to see you  dr .  neville  dr .  denison tells me that you refused to append your name to what i am sure will be a classic paper on the cosmeg pump .     no need to do so   said neville .   what happens on earth is of no interest to me .     you are aware of the cosmeg pump experiments .  of its implications .     all of them .  i know the situation as well as you two do .     then i will proceed without preliminaries .  i have returned from earth  dr .  neville  and it is quite settled as to what will be the course of future procedure .  large cosmeg pump stations will be set up on three different places on the lunar surface in such a way that one will always be in the night shadow .  half the time  two win be .  those in the night shadow will be constantly generating energy  most of which will simply radiate into space .  the purpose will be not so much to use the energy for practical purposes  as to counteract the changes in field intensities introduced by the electron pump .    denison interrupted .   for some years  we will have to overbalance the electron pump to restore our section of the universe to the point at which it was before the pump began operation .    neville nodded .   will luna city have the use of any of it .     if necessary .  we feel the solar batteries will probably supply what you need  but there is no objection to supplementation .     that is land of you   said neville  not bothering to mask the sarcasm .   and who will build and run the cosmeg pump stations .     lunar workers  we hope   said gottstein .    lunar workers  you know   said neville .   earth workers would be too clumsy to work effectively on the moon .     we recognize that   said gottstein   we trust the men of the moon will cooperate .     and who will decide how much energy to generate  how much to apply for any local purpose  how much to radiate away .  who decides policy .    gottstein said   the government would have to .  it s a matter of planetary decision .    neville said   you see  then  it will be moonmen who do the work  earthmen who run the show .    gottstein said  calmly   no .  all of us work who work best  all of us administer who can best weigh the total problem .     i hear the words   said neville   but it boils down anyway to us working and you deciding .   .   .   .  no  commissioner .  the answer is no .     you mean you won t build the cosmeg pump stations .     well build them  commissioner  but they ll be ours .  well decide how much energy to put out and what use to make of it .     that would scarcely be efficient .  you would have to deal constantly with the earth government since the cosmeg pump energy will have to balance the electron pump energy .     i dare say it will  more or less  but we have other things in mind .  you might as well know now .  energy is not the only conserved phenomenon that becomes limitless once universes are crossed .    denison interrupted .   there are a number of conservation laws .  we realize that .     i m glad you do   said neville  turning a hostile glare in his direction .   they include those of linear momentum and angular momentum .  as long as any object responds to the gravitational field in which it is immersed  and to that only  it is in free fall and can retain its mass .  in order to move in any other way than free fall  it must accelerate in a non gravitational way and for that to happen  part of itself must undergo an opposite change .     as in a rocketship   said denison   which must eject mass in one direction in order that the rest might accelerate in the opposite direction .     i m sure you understand  dr .  denison   said neville   but i explain for the commissioner s sake .  the loss of mass can be minimized if its velocity is increased enormously  since momentum is equal to mass multiplied by velocity .  nevertheless  however great the velocity  some mass must be thrown away .  if the mass which must be accelerated is enormous in the first place  then the mass which must be discarded is also enormous .  if the moon  for instance       the moon .   said gottstein  explosively .    yes  the moon   said neville  calmly .   if the moon were to be driven out of its orbit and sent out of the solar system  the conservation of momentum would make it a colossal undertaking  and probably a thoroughly impractical one .  if  however  momentum could be transferred to the cosmeg in another universe  the moon could accelerate at any convenient rate without loss of mass at all .  it would be like poling a barge upstream  to give you a picture i obtained from some earth book i once read .     but why .  i mean why should you want to move the moon .     i should think that would be obvious .  why do we need the suffocating presence of the earth .  we have the energy we need  we have a comfortable world through which we have room to expand for the next few centuries  at least why not go our own way .  in any case  we will .  i have come to tell you that you cannot stop us and to urge you to make no attempt to interfere .  we shall transfer momentum and we shall pull out .  we of the moon know precisely how to go about building cosmeg pump stations .  we will use what energy we need for ourselves and produce excess in order to neutralize the changes your own power stations are producing .    denison said  sardonically   it sounds kind of you to produce excess for our sake  but it isn t for our sake  of course .  if our electron pumps explode the sun  that will happen long before you can move out of even the inner solar system and you will vaporize wherever you are .     perhaps   said neville   but in any case we will produce an excess  so that won t happen .     but you can t do that   said gottstein  excitedly .   you can t move out .  if you get out too far  the cosmeg pump will no longer neutralize the electron pump  eh  denison .    denison shrugged .   once they are as far off as saturn  more or less  there may be trouble  if i may trust a mental calculation i have just made .  it will  however  be man years before they recede to such a distance and by that time  we will surely have constructed space stations in what was once the orbit of the moon and place cosmeg pumps on them .  actually  we don t need the moon .  it can leave   except that it won t .    neville smiled briefly .   what makes you think we won t .  we can t be stopped .  there is no way earthmen can impose their will on us .     you won t leave  because there s no sense to doing so .  why drag the entire moon away .  to build up respectable accelerations will take years where the moon mass is concerned .  you ll creep .  build starships instead  miles long ships that are cosmeg powered and have independent ecologies .  with a cosmeg momentum drive  you can then do wonders .  if it takes twenty years to build the ships  they will nevertheless accelerate at a rate that will enable them to overtake the moon s place within a year even if the moon starts accelerating today .  the ships will be able to change course in a tiny fraction of the time the moon will .     and the unbalanced cosmeg pumps .  what will that do to the universe .     the energy required by a ship  or even by a number  will be far less than that required by a planet and will be distributed throughout large sections of the universe .  it will be millions of years before any significant change takes place .  that is well worth the maneuverability you gain .  the moon will move so slowly it might as well be left in space .    neville said  scornfully   we re in no hurry to get anywhere   except away from earth .    denison said   there are advantages in having earth as a neighbor .  you have the influx of the immigrants .  you have cultural intercourse .  you have a planetary world of two billion people just over the horizon .  do you want to give all that up .     gladly .     is that true of the people of the moon generally .  or just of you .  there s something intense about you  neville .  you won t go out on the surface .  other lunarites do .  they don t like it particularly  but they do .  the interior of the moon isn t their womb  as it is in your case .  it isn t their prison  as it is yours .  there is a neurotic factor in you that is absent in most lunarities  or at least considerably weaker .  if you take the moon away from earth  you make it into a prison for all .  it will become a one world prison from which no man   and not you only   can emerge  not even to the extent of seeing another inhabited world in the sky .  perhaps that is what you want .     i want independence  a free world  a world untouched by the outside .     you can build ships  any number .  you can move outward at near light velocities without difficulty  once you transfer momentum to the cosmeg .  you can explore the entire universe in a single lifetime .  wouldn t you like to get on such a ship .     no   said neville  with clear distaste .    wouldn t you .  or is it couldn t .  is it that you must take the moon with you wherever you go why must all the others accept your need .     because that s the way it s going to be   said neville .   denison s voice remained level but his cheeks reddened .   who gave you the right to say that .  there are many citizens of luna city who may not feel as you do .     that is none of your concern .     that is precisely my concern .  i am an immigrant who will qualify for citizenship soon .  i do not wish to have my choice made for me by someone who cannot emerge on the surface and who wants his personal prison made into a prison for all .  i have left earth forever  but only to come to the moon  only to remain a quarter million miles from the home planet .  i have not contracted to be taken forever away for an unlimited distance     then return to earth   said neville  indifferently .   there is still time .     and what of the other citizens of luna .  the other immigrants .     the decision is made .     it is not made .  .  .  .  selene .    selene entered  her face solemn  her eyes a little defiant .   neville s legs uncrossed .  both shoes came down flat upon the ground .   neville said   how long have you been waiting in the next room  selene .     since before you arrived  barron   she said .   neville looked from selene to denison and back again .   you two     he began  finger pointing from one to the other and back .    i don t know what you mean by you two    said selene   but ben found out about the momentum quite a while ago .     it wasn t selene s fault   said denison .   the commissioner spotted something flying at a time when no one could possibly have known he would be observing .  it seemed to me that selene might be testing something i was not thinking of and transfer of momentum eventually occurred to me .  after that       well  then  you knew   said neville .   it doesn t matter .     it does  barron   said selene .   i talked about it with ben .  i found that i didn t always have to accept what you said .  perhaps i can t ever go to earth .  perhaps i don t even want to .  but i found i liked it in the sky where i could see it if i wanted to  i didn t want an empty sky .  then i talked to others of the group .  not everybody wants to leave .  most people would rather build the ships and let those go who wish to go while allowing those to remain behind who wish to remain .    neville s breath was coming hard .   you talked about it .  who gave you the right to       i took the right  barron .  besides  it doesn t matter any more .  you ll be outvoted .     because of     neville rose to his feet and took a menacing step toward denison .   the commissioner said   please don t get emotional  dr .  neville .  you may be of luna  but i don t think you can man handle both of us .     all three   said selene   and i m of luna  too .  i did it  barron  not they .    then denison said   look  neville    for all earth cares  the moon can go .  earth can build its space stations .  it s the citizens of luna city who care .  selene cares and i care and the rest you are not being debarred from space  from escape  from freedom .  in twenty years at the outside  all who want to go will go  including you if you can bring yourself to leave the womb .  and those who want to stay will stay .    slowly  neville seated himself again .  there was the look of defeat on his face .               in selene s apartment  every window now had a view of the earth .  she said   the vote did go against him  you know  ben .  quite heavily .     i doubt that he ll give up  though .  if there s friction with earth during the building of the stations  public opinion on the moon may swing back .     there needn t be friction .     no  there needn t .  in any case  there are no happy endings in history  only crisis points that pass .  we ve passed this one safely  i think  and we ll be sorry about the others as they come and as they can be foreseen .  once the starships are built  the tension will surely subside considerably .     we ll live to see that  i m sure .     you will  selene .     you  too  ben .  don t overdramatize your age .  you re only forty eight .     would you go on one of the starships  selene .     no .  i d be too old and i still wouldn t want to lose earth in the sky .  my son might go .  .  .  .  ben .     yes  selene .     i have applied for a second son .  the application has been accepted .  would you contribute .    denison s eyes lifted and looked straight into hers .  she did not look away .  he said   artificial insemination .    she said   of course .  .  .   .  the gene combination should be interesting .    denison s eyes dropped .   i would be flattered  selene .    selene said  defensively   that s just good sense  ben .  it s important to have good gene combinations .  there s nothing wrong with some natural genetic engineering .     none at all .     it doesn t mean that i don t want it for other reasons  too .  .  .  .  because i like you .    denison nodded and remained silent .   selene said  almost angrily   well  there s more to love than sex .    denison said   i agree to that at least  i love you even with sex subtracted .    and selene said   and for that matter  there s more to sex than acrobatics .    denison said   i agree to that  too .    and selene said   and besides    oh  damn it  you could try to learn .    denison said softly   if you would try to teach .    hesitantly  he moved toward her .  she did not move away .   he stopped hesitating .
