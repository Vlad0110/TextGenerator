aching wondered  that people liked noise so much .  why was noise so important .   something quite close sounded like a cow giving birth .  it turned out to be an old hurdy gurdy organ  hand cranked by a raggedy man in a battered top hat .  she sidled away as politely as she could  but as noise went  it was sticky  you got the feeling that if you let it  it would try to follow you home .   but that was only one sound in the great cauldron of noise around her  all of it made by people and all of it made by people trying to make noise louder than the other people making noise .  arguing at the makeshift stalls  bobbing for apples or frogs   cheering the prize fighters and a spangled lady on the high wire  selling candyfloss at the tops of their voices and  not to put too fine a point on it  boozing quite considerably .   the air above the green downland was thick with noise .  it was as if the populations of two or three towns had all come up to the top of the hills .  and so here  where all you generally heard was the occasional scream of a buzzard  you heard the permanent scream of  well  everyone .  it was called having fun .  the only people not making any noise were the thieves and pickpockets  who went about their business with commendable silence  and they didn   t come near tiffany  who would pick a witch   s pocket .  you would be lucky to get all your fingers back .  at least  that was what they feared  and a sensible witch would encourage them in this fear .   when you were a witch  you were all witches  thought tiffany aching as she walked through the crowds  pulling her broomstick after her on the end of a length of string .  it floated a few feet above the ground .  she was getting a bit bothered about that .  it seemed to work quite well  but nevertheless  since all around the fair were small children dragging balloons  also on the end of a piece of string  she couldn   t help thinking that it made her look more than a little bit silly  and something that made one witch look silly made all witches look silly .   on the other hand  if you tied it to a hedge somewhere  there was bound to be some kid who would untie the string and get on the stick for a dare  in which case most likely he would go straight up all the way to the top of the atmosphere where the air froze  and while she could in theory call the stick back  mothers got very touchy about having to thaw out their children on a bright late summer day .  that would not look good .  people would talk .  people always talked about witches .   she resigned herself to dragging it again .  with luck  people would think she was joining in with the spirit of the thing in a humorous way .   there was a lot of etiquette involved  even at something so deceptively cheerful as a fair .  she was the witch  who knows what would happen if she forgot someone   s name or  worse still  got it wrong .  what would happen if you forgot all the little feuds and factions  the people who weren   t talking to their neighbours and so on and so on and a lot more so and even further on .  tiffany had no understanding at all of the word    minefield     but if she had  it would have seemed kind of familiar .   she was the witch .  for all the villages along the chalk she was the witch .  not just her own village any more  but for all the other ones as far away as ham on rye  which was a pretty good day   s walk from here .  the area that a witch thought of as her own  and for whose people she did what was needful  was called a steading  and as steadings went  this one was pretty good .  not many witches got a whole geological outcrop to themselves  even if this one was mostly covered in grass  and the grass was mostly covered in sheep .  and today the sheep on the downs were left by themselves to do whatever it was that they did when they were by themselves  which would presumably be pretty much the same as they did if you were watching them .  and the sheep  usually fussed and herded and generally watched over  were now of no interest whatsoever  because right here the most wonderful attraction in the world was taking place .   admittedly  the scouring fair was only one of the world   s most wonderful attractions if you didn   t usually ever travel more than about four miles from home .  if you lived around the chalk you were bound to meet everyone that you knew  at the fair .  it was quite often where you met the person you were likely to marry .  the girls certainly all wore their best dresses  while the boys wore expressions of hopefulness and their hair smoothed down with cheap hair pomade or  more usually  spit .  those who had opted for spit generally came off better since the cheap pomade was very cheap indeed and would often melt and run in the hot weather  causing the young men not to be of interest to the young women  as they had fervently hoped  but to the flies  who would make their lunch off their scalps .   however  since the event could hardly be called    the fair where you went in the hope of getting a kiss and  if your luck held  the promise of another one     the fair was called the scouring .   the scouring was held over three days at the end of summer .  for most people on the chalk  it was their holiday .  this was the third day  and most people said that if you hadn   t had a kiss by now you might as well go home .  tiffany hadn   t had a kiss  but after all  she was the witch .  who knew what they might get turned into .   if the late summer weather was clement  it wasn   t unusual for some people to sleep out under the stars  and under the bushes as well .  and that was why if you wanted to take a stroll at night it paid to be careful so as not to trip over someone   s feet .  not to put too fine a point to it  there was a certain amount of what nanny ogg     a witch who had been married to three husbands     called making your own entertainment .  it was a shame that nanny lived right up in the mountains  because she would have loved the scouring and tiffany would have loved to see her face when she saw the giant .    he     and he was quite definitely a he  there was no possible doubt about that     had been carved out of the turf thousands of years before .  a white outline against the green  he belonged to the days when people had to think about survival and fertility in a dangerous world .   oh  and he had also been carved  or so it would appear  before anyone had invented trousers .  in fact  to say that he had no trousers on just didn   t do the job .  his lack of trousers filled the world .  you simply could not stroll down the little road that passed along the bottom of the hills without noticing that there was an enormous  as it were  lack of something     e . g .  trousers     and what was there instead .  it was definitely a figure of a man without trousers  and certainly not a woman .   everyone who came to the scouring was expected to bring a small shovel  or even a knife  and work their way down the steep slope to grub up all the weeds that had grown there over the previous year  making the chalk underneath glow with freshness and the giant stand out boldly  as if he wasn   t already .   there was always a lot of giggling when the girls worked on the giant .   and the reason for the giggling  and the circumstances of the giggling  couldn   t help but put tiffany in mind of nanny ogg  who you normally saw somewhere behind granny weatherwax with a big grin on her face .  she was generally thought of as a jolly old soul  but there was a lot more to the old woman .  she had never been tiffany   s teacher officially  but tiffany couldn   t help learning things from nanny ogg .  she smiled to herself when she thought that .  nanny knew all the old  dark stuff     old magic  magic that didn   t need witches  magic that was built into people and the landscape .  it concerned things like death  and marriage  and betrothals .  and promises that were promises even if there was no one to hear them .  and all those things that make people touch wood and never  ever walk under a black cat .   you didn   t need to be a witch to understand it .  the world around you became more     well  more real and fluid  at those special times .  nanny ogg called it numinous     an uncharacteristically solemn word from a woman who was much more likely to be saying     i would like a brandy  thank you very much  and could you make it a double while you are about it .     and she had told tiffany about the old days  when it seemed that witches had a bit more fun .  the things that you did around the changing of the seasons  for example  all the customs that were now dead except in folk memory which  nanny ogg said  is deep and dark and breathing and never fades .  little rituals .   tiffany especially liked the one about the fire .  tiffany liked fire .  it was her favourite element .  it was considered so powerful  and so scary to the powers of darkness that people would even get married by jumping over a fire together  .  apparently it helped if you said a little chant  according to nanny ogg  who lost no time in telling tiffany the words  which immediately stuck in tiffany   s mind  a lot of what nanny ogg told you tended to be sticky .   but those were times gone by .  everybody was more respectable now  apart from nanny ogg and the giant .   there were other carvings on the chalk lands too .  one of them was a white horse that tiffany thought had once broken its way out of the ground and galloped to her rescue .  now she wondered what would happen if the giant did the same thing  because it would be very hard to find a pair of pants sixty feet long in a hurry .  and on the whole  you   d want to hurry .   she   d only ever giggled about the giant once  and that had been a very long time ago .  there were really only four types of people in the world  men and women and wizards and witches .  wizards mostly lived in universities down in the big cities and weren   t allowed to get married  although the reason why not totally escaped tiffany .  anyway  you hardly ever saw them around here .   witches were definitely women  but most of the older ones tiffany knew hadn   t got married either  mostly because nanny ogg had already used up all the eligible husbands  but also probably because they didn   t have time .  of course  every now and then  a witch might marry a grand husband  like magrat garlick  as was  of lancre had done  although by all accounts she only did herbs these days .  but the only young witch tiffany knew who had even had time for courting was her best friend up in the mountains  petulia     a witch who was now specializing in pig magic  and was soon going to marry a nice young man who was shortly going to inherit his father   s pig farm   which meant he was practically an aristocrat .   but witches were not only very busy  they were also apart   tiffany had learned that early on .  you were among people  but not the same as them .  there was always a kind of distance or separation .  you didn   t have to work at it  it happened anyway .  girls she had known when they were all so young they used to run about and play with only their vests on would make a tiny little curtsy to her when she passed them in the lane  and even elderly men would touch their forelock  or probably what they thought was their forelock  as she passed .   this wasn   t just because of respect  but because of a kind of fear as well .  witches had secrets  they were there to help when babies were being born .  when you got married  it was a good idea to have a witch standing by  even if you weren   t sure if it was for good luck or to prevent bad luck   and when you died there would be a witch there too  to show you the way .  witches had secrets they never told     well  to people who weren   t witches .  among themselves  when they could get together on some hillside for a drink or two  or in the case of mrs ogg  a drink or nine   they gossiped like geese .   but never about the real secrets  the ones you never told  about things done and heard and seen .  so many secrets that you were afraid they might leak .  seeing a giant without his trousers was hardly worth commenting on compared to some of the things that a witch might see .   no  tiffany did not envy petulia her romance  which surely must have taken place in big boots  unflattering rubber aprons and the rain  not to mention an awful lot of    oink    .   she did  however  envy her for being so sensible .  petulia had got it all worked out .  she knew what she wanted her future to be  and had rolled up her sleeves and made it happen  up to her knees in    oink    if necessary .   every family  even up in the mountains  kept at least one pig to act as a garbage can in the summer and as pork  bacon  ham and sausages during the rest of the year .  the pig was important  you might dose granny with turpentine when she was poorly  but when the pig was ill you sent immediately for a pig witch  and paid her too  and paid her well  generally in sausages .   on top of everything else  petulia was a specialist pig borer  and indeed she was this year   s champion in the noble art of boring .  tiffany thought you couldn   t put it better  her friend could sit down with a pig and talk to it gently and calmly about extremely boring things until some strange pig mechanism took over  whereupon it would give a happy little yawn and fall over  no longer a living pig and ready to become a very important contribution to the family   s diet for the following year .  this might not appear the best of outcomes for the pig  but given the messy and above all noisy way pigs died before the invention of pig boring  it was definitely  in the great scheme of things  a much better deal all round .   alone in the crowd  tiffany sighed .  it was hard  when you wore the black  pointy hat .  because  like it or not  the witch was the pointy hat  and the pointy hat was the witch .  it made people careful about you .  they would be respectful  oh yes  and often a little bit nervous  as if they expected you to look inside their heads  which as a matter of fact you could probably do  using the good old witch   s standbys of first sight and second thoughts .   but these weren   t really magic .  anyone could learn them if they had a lick of sense  but sometimes even a lick is hard to find .  people are often so busy living that they never stopped to wonder why .  witches did  and that meant them being needed  oh yes  needed     needed practically all the time  but not  in a very polite and definitely unspoken way  not exactly wanted .   this wasn   t the mountains  where people were very used to witches  people on the chalk could be friendly  but they weren   t friends  not actual friends .  the witch was different .  the witch knew things that you did not .  the witch was another kind of person .  the witch was someone that perhaps you should not anger .  the witch was not like other people .   tiffany aching was the witch  and she had made herself the witch because they needed one .  everybody needs a witch  but sometimes they just don   t know it .   and it was working .  the storybook pictures of the drooling hag were being wiped away  every time tiffany helped a young mother with her first baby  or smoothed an old man   s path to his grave .  nevertheless  old stories  old rumours and old picture books still seemed to have their own hold on the memory of the world .   what made it more difficult was that there was no tradition of witches on the chalk     none would ever have settled there when granny aching had been alive .  granny aching  as everybody knew  was a wise woman  and wise enough not to be a witch .  nothing ever happened on the chalk that granny aching disapproved of  at least not for more than about ten minutes .   so tiffany was a witch alone .   and not only was there no longer any support from the mountain witches like nanny ogg  granny weatherwax and miss level  but the people of the chalk weren   t very familiar with witches .  other witches would probably come and help if she asked  of course  but although they wouldn   t say so  this might mean that you couldn   t cope with responsibility  weren   t up to the task  weren   t sure  weren   t good enough .      excuse me  miss .     there was a nervous giggle .  tiffany looked round and there were two little girls in their best new frocks and straw hats .  they were looking at her eagerly  with perhaps just a hint of mischief in their eyes .  she thought quickly and smiled at them .      oh yes  becky pardon and nancy upright  yes .  what can i do for the two of you .      becky pardon shyly produced a small bouquet from behind her back and held it out .  tiffany recognized it  of course .  she had made them herself for the older girls when she was younger  simply because it was what you did  it was part of the scouring  a little bunch of wild flowers picked from the downland  tied in a bunch with     and this was the important bit  the magic bit     some of the grass pulled up as the fresh chalk was exposed .      if you put this under your pillow tonight  you will dream of your beau     said becky pardon  her face quite serious now .   tiffany took the slightly wilting bunch of flowers with care .     let me see        she said .     we have here sweet mumbles  ladies    pillows  seven leaf clover     very lucky     a sprig of old man   s trousers  jack in the wall  oh     love lies bleeding and        she stared at the little white and red flowers .   the girls said     are you all right  miss .         forget me lots .      said tiffany  more sharply than she had intended .  but the girls hadn   t noticed  so she continued to say  brightly     quite unusual to see it here .  it must be a garden escapee .  and  as i   m sure you both know  you have bound them all together with strips of candle rush  which once upon a time people used to make into rush lights .  what a lovely surprise .  thank you both very much .  i hope you have a lovely time at the fair         becky raised her hand .     excuse me  miss .         was there something else  becky .      becky went pink  and had a hurried conversation with her friend .  she turned back to tiffany  looking slightly more pink but nevertheless determined to see things through .      you can   t get into trouble for asking a question  can you  miss .  i mean  just asking a question .      it   s going to be    how can i be a witch when i   m grown up .     tiffany thought  because it generally was .  the young girls saw her on her broomstick and thought that was what being a witch was .  out loud she said     not from me  at least .  do ask your question .      becky pardon looked down at her boots .     do you have any passionate parts  miss .      another talent needful in a witch is the ability not to let your face show what you   re thinking  and especially not allowing it  no matter what  to go as stiff as a board .  tiffany managed to say  without a single wobble in her voice and no trace of an embarrassed smirk     that is a very interesting question  becky .  can i ask you why you want to know .      the girl looked a lot happier now that the question was  as it were  out in the public domain .      well  miss  i asked my granny if i could be a witch when i was older  and she said i shouldn   t want to  because witches have no passionate parts  miss .      tiffany thought quickly in the face of the two solemn owlish stares .  these are farm girls  she thought  so they had certainly seen a cat have kittens and a dog have puppies .  they   d have seen the birth of lambs  and probably a cow have a calf  which is always a noisy affair that you can hardly miss .  they know what they are asking me about .   at this point nancy chimed in with     only  if that is so  miss  we would quite like to have the flowers back  now we   ve shown them to you  because perhaps it might be a bit of a waste  meaning no offence .     she stepped back quickly .   tiffany was surprised at her own laughter .  it had been a long time since she had laughed .  heads turned to see what the joke was  and she managed to grab both the girls before they fled  and spun them round .      well done  the pair of you     she said .     i like to see some sensible thinking every now and again .  never hesitate to ask a question .  and the answer to your question is that witches are the same as everybody else when it comes to passionate parts  but often they are so busy rushing around that they never have time to think about them .      the girls looked relieved that their work had not been entirely in vain and tiffany was ready for the next question  which came from becky again .     so  do you have a beau  miss .         not right at the moment     tiffany said briskly  clamping down on her expression lest it give anything away .  she held up the little bouquet .     but who knows  if you   ve made this properly  then i   ll get another one  and in that case you will be better witches than me  that is for certain .     they both beamed at this dreadful piece of outright flannel  and it stopped the questions .      and now     said tiffany     the cheese rolling will be starting at any minute .  i   m sure you won   t want to miss that .         no  miss     they said in unison .  just before they left  full of relief and self importance  becky patted tiffany on her hand .     beaus can be very difficult  miss     she said with the assurance of  to tiffany   s certain knowledge  eight years in the world .      thank you     said tiffany .     i shall definitely bear that in mind .      when it came to the entertainment offered at the fair  such as people making faces through a horse collar or fighting with pillows on the greasy pole or even the bobbing for frogs  well  tiffany could take them or leave them alone  and in fact much preferred to leave them alone .  but she always liked to see a good cheese roll     that is to say  a good cheese roll all the way down a slope of the hill  although not across the giant because no one would want to eat the cheese afterwards .   they were hard cheeses  sometimes specially made for the cheese rolling circuit  and the winning maker of the cheese that reached the bottom unscathed won a belt with a silver buckle and the admiration of all .   tiffany was an expert cheese maker  but she had never entered .  witches couldn   t enter that sort of competition because if you won     and she knew she had made a cheese or two that could win     everyone would say that was unfair because you were a witch  well  that   s what they would think  but very few would say it .  and if you didn   t win  people would say     what kind of witch can   t make a cheese that could be beat by simple cheeses made by simple folk like we .      there was a gentle movement of the crowd to the start of the cheese rolling  although the frog bobbing stall still had a big crowd  it being a very humorous and reliable source of entertainment  especially to those people who weren   t actually bobbing .  regrettably  the man who put weasels down his trousers  and apparently had a personal best of nine weasels  hadn   t been there this year  and people were wondering if he had lost his touch .  but sooner or later everyone would drift over to the start line for the cheese rolling .  it was a tradition .   the slope here was very steep indeed and there was always a certain amount of boisterous rivalry between the cheese owners  which led to pushing and shoving and kicking and bruises  occasionally you got a broken arm or leg .  all was going as normal as the waiting men lined up their cheeses  until tiffany saw  and seemed to be the only one to see  a dangerous cheese roll up all by itself .  it was black under the dust and there was a piece of grubby blue and white cloth tied to it .      oh  no     she said .     horace .  and where you are  trouble can   t be far behind .     she spun around  carefully searching for signs of what should not be there .     now you just listen to me     she said under her breath .     i know at least one of you must be somewhere near .  this isn   t for you  it   s just about people .  understand .      but it was too late .  the master of the revels  in his big floppy hat with lace around the brim  blew his whistle and the cheese rolling  as he put it  commenced     which is a far grander word than started .  and a man with lace around his hat was never going to use a short word where a long word would do .   tiffany hardly dared to look .  the runners didn   t so much run as roll and skid behind their cheeses .  but she could hear the cries that went up when the black cheese not only shot into the lead  but occasionally turned round and went back uphill again in order to bang into one of the ordinary innocent cheeses .  she could just hear a faint grumbling noise coming from it as it almost shot to the top of the hill .   cheese runners shouted at it  tried to grab at it and flailed at it with sticks  but the piratical cheese scythed onwards  reached the bottom again just ahead of the terrible carnage of men and cheeses as they piled up  then rolled gently back up to the top and sat there demurely while still gently vibrating .   at the bottom of the slope  fights were breaking out among the cheese jockeys who were still capable of punching somebody  and since everyone was now watching that  tiffany took the opportunity to snatch up horace and shove him into her bag .  after all  he was hers .  well  that was to say  she had made him  although something odd must   ve got into the mix since horace was the only cheese that would eat mice and  if you didn   t nail him down  other cheeses as well .  no wonder he got on so well with the nac mac feegles   who had made him an honorary member of the clan .  he was their kind of cheese .   surreptitiously  hoping that no one would notice  tiffany held the bag up to her mouth and said     is this any way to behave .  aren   t you ashamed .     the bag wobbled a little bit  but she knew that the word    shame    was not in horace   s vocabulary  and neither was anything else .  she lowered the bag and moved a little way from the crowd and said     i know you are here  rob anybody .      there he was  sitting on her shoulder .  she could smell him .  despite the fact that they generally had little to do with bathing  except when it rained  the nac mac feegles always smelled something like slightly drunk potatoes .     the kelda wanted me tae to find out how ye were biding     said the feegle chieftain .     you havenae bin tae the mound to see her these past two weeks     he went on     and i think she is afeared that a harm may come tae ye  ye are working sae hard an    all .      tiffany groaned  but only to herself .  she said     that is very kind of her .  there is always so much to do  surely the kelda knows this .  it doesn   t matter what i do  there is always more to be done .  there is no end to the wanting .  but there is nothing to worry about .  i am doing fine .  and please don   t take horace out again in public     you know he gets excited .         well  in point of fact  it says up on that banner over there that this is for the folk of these hills and we is more than folk .  we is folklore  .  ye cannae argue with the lore .  besides  i wanted tae come and pay my ain respects to the big yin without his breeks .  he is a fine big wee laddie and nae mistake .     rob paused  and then said quietly     so i can tell her that ye are quite well in yourself  aye .     there was a certain nervousness to him  as if he would like to have said more but knew it wouldn   t be welcome .      rob anybody  i would be very grateful if you would do just that     said tiffany     because i have a lot of people to bandage  if i   m any judge .      rob anybody  suddenly looking like a man on a thankless errand  frantically said the words he had been told by his wife to say     the kelda says there   s plenty more fish in the sea  miss .      and tiffany stood perfectly still for a moment .  and then  without looking at rob  said quietly     do thank the kelda for her angling information .  i have to get on  if you don   t mind  rob .  do thank the kelda .      most of the crowd was reaching the bottom of the slope by now  to gawk or rescue or possibly attempt some amateur first aid on the groaning cheese runners .  for the onlookers  of course  it was just another show  you didn   t often see a satisfying pile up of men and cheeses  and     who knew .      there might be some really interesting casualties .   tiffany  glad of something to do  did not have to push her way through  the pointy black hat could create a path through a crowd faster than a holy man through a shallow sea .  she waved the happy crowd away  with one or two forceful pushes for those of slow uptake .  as a matter of fact  as it turned out  the butcher   s bill wasn   t too high this year  with one broken arm  one broken wrist  one broken leg and an enormous number of bruises  cuts and rashes being caused by people sliding most of the way down     grass isn   t always your friend .  there were several young men clearly in distress as a result  but they were absolutely definite that they were not going to discuss their injuries with a lady  thank you all the same  so she told them to put a cold compress on the afflicted area  wherever it was  when they got home  and watched them walk unsteadily away .   well  she   d done all right  hadn   t she .  she had used her skills in front of the rubbernecking crowd and  according to what she overheard from the old men and women  had performed well enough .  perhaps she imagined that one or two people were embarrassed when an old man with a beard to his waist said with a grin     a girl who can set bones would have no trouble finding a husband     but that passed  and with nothing else to do  people started the long climb back up the hill     and then the coach came past  and then  which was worse  it stopped .   it had the coat of arms of the keepsake family on the side .  a young man stepped out .  quite handsome in his way  but also so stiff in his way that you could have ironed sheets on him .  this was roland .  he hadn   t gone more than a step when a rather unpleasant voice from inside the coach told him that he should have waited for the footman to open the door for him  and to hurry up  because they didn   t have all day .   the young man hurried towards the crowd and there was a general smartening up because  after all  here came the son of the baron  who owned most of the chalk and nearly all their houses  and although he was a decent old boy  as old boys go  a little politeness to his family was definitely a wise move         what happened here .  is everybody all right .     he said .   life on the chalk was generally pleasant and the relationship between master and man was one of mutual respect  but nevertheless  the farm workers had inherited the idea that it could be unwise to have too many words with powerful people  in case any of those words turned out to be a word out of place .  after all  there was still a torture chamber in the castle and even though it hadn   t been used for hundreds of years     well  best to be on the safe side  best to stand back and let the witch do the talking .  if she got into trouble  she could fly away .      one of those accidents that was bound to happen  i   m afraid     said tiffany  well aware that she was the only woman present who had not curtsied .     some broken bones that will mend and a few red faces .  all sorted out  thank you .         so i see  so i see .  very well done  young lady .      for a moment tiffany thought she could taste her teeth .  young lady  from     him .  it was almost  but not entirely  insulting .  but no one else seemed to have noticed .  it was  after all  the kind of language that nobs use when they are trying to be friendly and jolly .  he   s trying to talk to them like his father does  she thought  but his father did it by instinct and was good at it .  you can   t talk to people as though they are a public meeting .  she said     thank you kindly  sir .      well  not too bad so far  except that now the coach door opened again and one dainty white foot touched the flint .  it was her  angelica or letitia or something else out of the garden  in fact tiffany knew full well it was letitia  but surely she could be excused just a tiny touch of nasty in the privacy of her own head .  letitia .  what a name .  halfway between a salad and a sneeze .  besides  who was letitia to keep roland away from the scouring fair .  he should have been there .  his father would have been there if the old man possibly could .  and look .  tiny white shoes .  how long would they last on somebody who had to do a job of work .  she stopped herself there  a bit of nasty was enough .   letitia looked at tiffany and the crowd with something like fear and said     do let   s get going  can we please .  mother is getting vexed .      and so the coach left and the hurdy gurdy man thankfully left and the sun left  and in the warm shadows of the twilight some people stayed .  but tiffany flew home alone  up high where only bats and owls could see her face .     this was done blindfolded .       speaking as a witch  she knew them very well .       later on  tiffany realized that all the witches had probably flown across the giant  especially since you could hardly miss him if you were flying from the mountains to the big city .  he kind of stood out  in any case .  but in nanny ogg   s case  she would probably turn round to look at him again .       obviously  tiffany thought  when jumping over a fire together  one ought to be concerned about wearing protective clothing and having people with a bucket of water to hand  just in case .  witches may be a lot of things  but first and foremost  they are practical .       possibly petulia   s romantic ambitions had been helped by the mysterious way the young man   s pigs were forever getting sick and required treating for the scours  the blind heaves  brass neck  floating teeth  scribbling eyeball  grunge  the smarts  the twisting screws  swivelling and gone knees .  this was a terrible misfortune  since more than half of those ailments are normally never found in pigs  and one of them is a disease known only in freshwater fish .  but the neighbours were impressed at the amount of work petulia put in to relieve their stress .  her broomstick was coming and going at all hours of the day and night .  being a witch  after all  was about dedication .       first sight means that you can see what really is there  and second thoughts mean thinking about what you are thinking .  and in tiffany   s case  there were sometimes third thoughts and fourth thoughts  although these were quite difficult to manage and sometimes led her to walk into doors .       the forget me lots is a pretty red and white flower usually given by young ladies to signal to their young men that they never wanted to see them again ever  or at least until they   d learned to wash properly and got a job .       if you do not yet know who the nac mac feegles are     be grateful for your uneventful life  and    be prepared to beat a retreat if you hear anyone about as high as your ankles shout    crivens .     they are  strictly speaking  one of the faerie folk  but it is probably not a good idea to tell them this if you are looking forward to a future in which you still have your teeth .       chapter     rough music    she got one hour   s sleep before the nightmare began .   what she remembered most of all about that evening was the thumping of mr petty   s head against the wall and the banisters as she hauled him bodily out of his bed and dragged him by his filthy nightshirt down the stairs .  he was a heavy man and half asleep  the other half of him being dead drunk .   the important thing was not to give him any time to think  even for one moment  as she towed him behind her like a sack .  he was three times her weight  but she knew about leverage .  you couldn   t be a witch if you couldn   t manoeuvre someone who was heavier than you .  you would never be able to change an invalid   s sheets otherwise .  and now he slithered down the last few steps into the cottage   s tiny kitchen  and threw up on the floor .   she was quite glad about that  lying in stinking vomit was the very least the man deserved  but she had to be quick to take charge  before he had time to compose himself .   the terrified mrs petty  a mouse of a woman  had run screaming along the lanes to the village pub as soon as the beating had begun  and tiffany   s father had sent a lad to wake tiffany up .  mr aching was a man with considerable foresight and must have known that the beery cheerfulness after a day at the fair could be the undoing of everybody  and as tiffany sped towards the cottage on her broom stick  she had heard the rough music begin .   she slapped petty   s face .     can you hear that .     she demanded  waving her hand towards the darkened window .     can you hear it .  that   s the sound of the rough music  and they are playing it for you  mister petty  for you .  and they have sticks .  and they have stones .  they have everything they can pick up  and they have their fists and your daughter   s baby died  mister petty .  you beat your daughter so hard  mister petty  that the baby died  and your wife is being comforted by some of the women and everybody knows that you have done it  everybody knows .      she stared into his bloodshot eyes .  his hands had closed automatically into fists because he had always been a man who thought with them .  soon he would try to use them  she knew it  because it was easier to punch than think .  mr petty had punched his way through life .   the rough music was getting nearer slowly  because it   s hard to walk across fields on a dark night when you   ve had a skinful of beer  no matter how righteous you are currently feeling .  she had to hope that they did not go into the barn first  because they would hang him there and then .  if he was lucky  they would just hang him .  when she had looked into the barn and seen that murder had been done  she knew that  without her  it would be done again .  she had put a charm on the girl to take her pain away  holding it just above her own shoulder .  it was invisible  of course  but in her mind   s eye it burned a fiery orange .      it was that boy     mumbled the man  with vomit trickling down his chest .     coming round here  turning her head so as she wouldn   t listen to her mum or me .  and her being only thirteen .  it   s a scandal .         william is thirteen too     said tiffany  trying to keep her voice level .  it was difficult  the rage was bursting to get out .     are you trying to tell me that she was too young for a bit of romance  but young enough to be beaten so hard that she bled from places where no one should bleed .      she couldn   t tell if he had really come to his senses  because the man had so few of them at the best of times  it was hard to know if he had any at all .      it wasn   t right  what they were doing     he said .     a man   s got to have discipline in his own house  after all  ain   t that right .      tiffany could imagine the fiery language in the pub as the overture to the music got wound up .  there were not very many weapons in the villages of the chalk  but there were such things as reaping hooks and scythes and thatching knives and big  big hammers .  they weren   t weapons     until you hit somebody with them .  and everyone knew about old petty   s temper  and the number of times his wife told the neighbours that she had got her black eye by walking into a door .   oh  yes     she could imagine the conversation in the pub  with the beer joining in and people remembering where all those things that weren   t weapons were hanging in their sheds .  every man was king in his little castle .  everyone knew about that     well  at least every man     and so you minded your own business when it came to another man   s castle until the castle began to stink  and then you had to do something about it lest all castles should fall .  mr petty was one of the neighbourhood   s sullen little secrets  but it was not a secret any more .      i am your only chance  mr petty     she said .     run away .  grab what you can and run away right now .  run away to where they   ve never heard of you  and then run a bit further  just to be on the safe side  because i will not be able to stop them  do you understand .  personally  i could not care less what happens to your miserable frame but i do not wish to see good people get turned into bad people by doing a murder  so you just leg it across the fields and i won   t remember which way you went .         you can   t turn me out of my own house     he mumbled  finding some drunken defiance .      you   ve lost your house  your wife  your daughter     and your grandson  mr petty .  you will find no friends here this night .  i am just offering you your life .         it was the drink what done it .     petty burst out .     it was done in drink  miss .         but you drank the drink  and then you drank another drink  and another drink     she said .     you drank the drink all day at the fair and you only came back because the drink wanted to go to bed .     tiffany could feel only coldness in her heart .      i   m sorry .         not good enough  mr petty  not good enough at all .  go away and become a better person and then  maybe  when you come back as a changed man  people here might find it in their hearts to say hello to you  or at least to nod .      she had been watching his eyes  and she knew the man .  something inside him was boiling up .  he was ashamed  bewildered and resentful  and in those circumstances the pettys of the world struck out .      please don   t  mr petty     she said .     do you have any idea what would happen to you if you hit a witch .      she thought to herself  with those fists  you could probably kill me with a punch and that is why i intend to keep you scared .      you set the rough music on me  didn   t ya .      she sighed .     no one controls the music  mr petty  you know that .  it just turns up when people have had enough .  no one knows where it starts .  people look around  and catch one another   s eye  and give each other a little nod  and other people see that .  other people catch their eye and so  very slowly  the music starts and somebody picks up a spoon and bangs it on a plate  and then somebody else bangs a jug on the table and boots start to stamp on the floor  louder and louder .  it is the sound of anger  it is the sound of people who have had enough .  do you want to face the music .         you think you   re so clever  don   t ya .     petty snarled .     with your broomstick and your black magic  ordering ordin ery folks about .      she almost admired him .  there he was  with no friends in the world  covered in his own sick and     she sniffed  yes  there was urine dripping from the bottom of his nightshirt     yet he was stupid enough to talk back like that .     not clever  mr petty  just cleverer than you .  and that   s not hard .         yeah .  but clever gets you into trouble .  slip of a gel like you  pokin    about in other people   s business     what are you going to do when the music comes for you  eh .         run  mr petty .  get out of here .  it   s your last chance     she said .  and it probably was  she could hear individual voices now .      well  would your majesty let a man put his boots on .     he said sarcastically .  he reached down for them beside the door  but you could read mr petty like a very small book  one with fingermarks on all the pages and a piece of bacon as a bookmark .   he came up with fists swinging .   she took one step backwards  caught his wrist and let the pain out .  she felt it flow down her arm  leaving it tingling  into her cupped hand and into petty  all his daughter   s pain in one second .  it flung him clear across the kitchen and it must have burned away everything inside him except animal fear .  he rushed at the rickety back door like a bull  broke through it and headed off into the darkness .   she staggered back into the barn  where a lamp was burning .  according to granny weatherwax  you did not feel the pain that you carried  but it was a lie .  a necessary lie .  you did feel the pain that you carried  and because it wasn   t actually your pain you could somehow bear it  but its departure left you feeling weak and shocked .   when the charging  clanging mob arrived  tiffany was sitting quietly in the barn with the sleeping girl .  the noise went all around the house but did not go inside  that was one of the unwritten rules .  it was hard to believe that the anarchy of the rough music had rules  but it did  it might go on for three nights  or stop at one  and no one came out of the house when the music was in the air and no one came sneaking home and went back into the house either  unless it was to beg for forgiveness  understanding or ten minutes to pack their bags and run away .  the rough music was never organized .  it seemed to occur to everybody at once .  it played when a village thought that a man had beaten his wife too hard  or his dog too savagely  or if a married man and a married woman forgot that they were married to somebody else .  there were other  darker crimes against the music too  but they weren   t talked about openly .  sometimes people could stop the music by mending their ways  quite often they packed up and moved away before the third night .   petty would not have taken the hint  petty would have come out swinging .  and there would have been a fight  and someone would have done something stupid  that is to say even more stupid than what petty would have done .  and then the baron would find out and people might lose their livelihood  which would mean they would have to leave the chalk and go for perhaps as much as ten miles to find work and a new life among strangers .   tiffany   s father was a man of keen instinct and he gently opened the barn door a few minutes later when the music was dying down .  she knew it was a bit embarrassing for him  he was a well respected man  but somehow  now  his daughter was more important than he was .  a witch did not take orders from anybody  and she knew that he got teased about it by the other men .   she smiled and he sat down on the hay next to her while the wild music found nothing to beat  stone or hang .  mr aching didn   t waste words at the best of times .  he looked around and his gaze fell on the little bundle  hastily wrapped in straw and sacking  that tiffany had put where the girl would not see it .     so it   s true  she was with child  then .         yes  dad .      tiffany   s father appeared to look at nothing at all .     best if they don   t find him     he said after a decent interval .      yes     said tiffany .      some of the lads were talking about stringing him up .  we would have stopped them  of course  but it would have been a bad business  with people taking sides .  it   s like poison in a village .         yes .      they sat in silence for a while .  then her father looked down at the sleeping girl .     what have you done for her .     he asked .      everything i can     said tiffany .      and you did that taking away pain thingy you do .      she sighed .     yes  but that   s not all i shall have to take away .  i need to borrow a shovel  dad .  i   ll bury the poor little thing down in the woods  where no one will know .      he looked away .     i wish it wasn   t you doing this  tiff .  you   re not sixteen yet and i see you running around nursing people and bandaging people and who knows what chores .  you shouldn   t have to be doing all of that .         yes  i know     said tiffany .      why .      he asked again .      because other people don   t  or won   t  or can   t  that   s why .         but it   s not your business  is it .         i make it my business .  i   m a witch .  it   s what we do .  when it   s nobody else   s business  it   s my business     tiffany said quickly .      yes  but we all thought it was going to be about whizzing around on brooms and suchlike  not cutting old ladies    toenails for them .         but people don   t understand what   s needed     said tiffany .     it   s not that they are bad  it   s just that they don   t think .  take old mrs stocking  who   s got nothing in the world except her cat and a whole lot of arthritis .  people were getting her a bite to eat often enough  that is true  but no one was noticing that her toenails were so long they were tangling up inside her boots and so she   d not been able to take them off for a year .  people around here are ok when it comes to food and the occasional bunch of flowers  but they are not around when things get a little on the messy side .  witches notice these things .  oh  there   s a certain amount of whizzing about  that   s true enough  but mostly it   s only to get quickly to somewhere there is a mess .      her father shook his head .     and you like doing this .         yes .         why .      tiffany had to think about this  her father   s eyes never leaving her face .     well  dad  you know how granny aching always used to say     feed them as is hungry  clothe them as is naked  and speak up for them as has no voices    .  well  i reckon there is room in there for    grasp for them as can   t bend  reach for them as can   t stretch  wipe for them as can   t twist     don   t you .  and because sometimes you get a good day that makes up for all the bad days and  just for a moment  you hear the world turning     said tiffany .     i can   t put it any other way .      her father looked at her with a kind of proud puzzlement .     and you think that   s worth it  do you .         yes  dad .         then i am proud of you  jiggit  you are doing a man   s job .      he   d used the pet name only the family knew  and so she kissed him politely and did not tell him that he was unlikely to see a man doing the job that she did .      what are you all going to do about the pettys .     she asked .      your mum and me could take mrs petty and her daughter in and        mr aching paused and gave her a strange look  as if she frightened him .     it   s never simple  my girl .  seth petty was a decent enough lad when we were young .  not the brightest piggy in the litter  i   ll grant you that  but decent enough in his way .  it was his dad who was a madman  i mean  things were a bit rough and ready in those days and you could expect a clip around the head if you disobeyed  but seth   s dad had a thick leather belt with two buckles on it  and he would lay into seth just for looking at him in a funny way .  no word of a lie .  always used to say that he would teach him a lesson .         it seems that he succeeded     tiffany said  but her father held up a hand .      and then there was molly     he went on .     you couldn   t say that molly and seth were made for one another  because in truth neither of them were rightly made for anybody  but i suppose they were sort of happy together .  in those days  seth was a drover  driving the flocks all the way to the big city sometimes .  it wasn   t the kind of job you needed much learning for  and it might be that some of the sheep were a bit brighter than he was  but it was a job that needed doing  and he picked up a wage and no one thought the worse of him for that .  the trouble was  that meant he left molly alone for weeks at a time  and        tiffany   s father paused here  looking embarrassed .      i know what you   re going to tell me     said tiffany  to help him out  but he took care to ignore this .      it   s not that she was a bad girl     he said .     it   s just that she never really understood what it was all about  and there wasn   t anyone to tell her  and you got all kinds of strangers and travellers passing through all the time .  quite handsome chaps  some of them .      tiffany took pity on him  sitting there looking miserable  embarrassed about telling his little girl things his little girl shouldn   t know .   so she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek again .     i know  dad  i really do know .  amber isn   t actually his daughter  right .         well  i never said that  did i .  she might be     said her father awkwardly .   and that would be the trick  wouldn   t it  tiffany thought .  maybe if seth petty had known one way or the other  he might have come to terms with the perhaps .  maybe .  you never know .   but he didn   t know  either  and there would be some days when he thought he did know and some days when he thought the worst .  and for a man like petty  who was a stranger to thinking  the dark thoughts would roll around in his head until they tangled up his brain .  and when the brain stops thinking  the fist steps in .   her father was watching her very closely .     you know about this sort of thing .     he said .      we call it going round the houses .  every witch does it .  please try and understand me  dad .  i have seen horrible things  and some of them all the more horrible because they were  well  normal .  all the little secrets behind closed doors  dad .  good things and nasty things i am not going to tell you about .  it   s just part of being a witch .  you learn to sense things .         well  you know  life is not exactly a bed of roses for any of us        her father began .     there was the time when           there was this old woman up near slice     tiffany interrupted him .     and she died in her bed .  nothing particularly bad about that  really  she had just run out of life .  but she lay there for two months before anyone wondered what had happened .  they are a bit strange over in slice .  the worst part of it was that her cats couldn   t get out and started eating her  i mean  she was cat mad and probably would not have minded  but one of them had kittens in her bed .  in her actual bed .  it was really very difficult to find the kittens homes in places where people hadn   t already heard the story .  they were beautiful kittens too  lovely blue eyes .         er     her father began .     when you say    in her bed     you mean            with her still in it  yes     said tiffany .     i   ve had to deal with dead people  yes .  you throw up a bit first time  and then you just realize that death is  well  part of life .  it is not so bad if you think of it as a list of things to do  and do them one at a time .  you might have a bit of a cry as well  but that   s all part of it .         didn   t anyone help you .         oh  a couple of ladies helped me when i knocked on their doors  but really she was nobody   s business .  it can happen like that .  people disappear in the cracks .     she paused .     dad  we   re still not using the old stone barn  are we .  can you get some of the lads to clean it out for me .         of course     said her father .     do you mind if i ask why .      tiffany heard his politeness  he was talking to a witch .     i think i   m having a kind of idea     she said .     and i think i can make good use of that barn .  it   s only a thought  and it won   t do any harm to have it tidied up in any case .         well  i still feel mightily proud when i see you rushing all over the place on that broomstick of yours     said her father .     that   s magic  isn   t it .      everyone wants magic to exist  tiffany thought to herself  and what can you say .  no  there isn   t .  or  yes  there is  but it   s not what you think .  everyone wants to believe that we can change the world by snapping our fingers .     the dwarfs make them     she said .     i don   t have a clue how they work .  staying on them  that   s the trick .      the rough music had died down now  possibly because there was nothing for it to do  or perhaps because     and this was quite likely     if the rough musicians got back to the pub soon  there might be time for another drink before it closed .   mr aching stood up .     i think we should take this girl home  don   t you .         young woman     corrected tiffany  leaning over her .      what .         young woman     said tiffany .     she deserves that  at least .  and i think i should take her somewhere else first .  she needs more help than i can give her .  can you please go and scrounge some rope .  i   ve got a leather strap on the broomstick  of course  but i don   t think it will be enough .     she heard a rustling from the hayloft above  and smiled .  some friends could be so reliable .   but mr aching looked shocked .     you are taking her away .         not far .  i have to .  but look  don   t worry .  if mum makes up an extra bed i   ll soon have her back .      her father lowered his voice .     it   s them  isn   t it .  do they still follow you .         well     tiffany said     they say they don   t  but you know what little liars the nac mac feegle are .      it had been a long day  and not a good one  otherwise she would not have been so unfair  but     strangely     there was no giveaway reply from above .  to her surprise  a lack of feegle was suddenly almost as distressing as an overdose .   and then  to her delight  a small voice said     ha ha ha  she didnae catch us oot that time  aye  lads .  we kept as quiet as little mices .  the big wee hag didnae suspect a thing .  lads .  lads .         daft wullie  i swear ye dinnae have enough brains to blow your nose     said a similar but angry voice .     what part o       nae one is tae say one wee word    did ye nae understand .  och  crivens .      this last remark was followed by the sounds of a scuffle .   mr aching glanced nervously at the roof and leaned closer .     you know your mother is very worried about you .  you know she   s just been a grandma again .  she   s very proud of them all .  and you too  of course     he added hurriedly .     but all this witchy business  well  that   s not the sort of thing a young man looks for in a wife .  and now that you and young roland         tiffany dealt with this .  dealing was part of witchcraft too .  her father looked so miserable that she put on her cheerful face and said     if i was you  dad  i would go home and get a decent night   s sleep .  i   ll sort things out .  actually  there   s a coil of rope over there  but i   m certain i won   t need to use it now .      he looked relieved at this .  the nac mac feegle could be pretty worrying to those who did not know them very well  although now she thought about it  they could be pretty worrying however long you had known them  a feegle in your life very soon changed it .      have you been here all this time .     she demanded  as soon as her father had hurried off .   for a moment it rained bits of hay and whole feegles .   the problem with getting angry at nac mac feegles was that it was like getting angry at cardboard or the weather  it didn   t make any difference .  she had a go anyway  because by now it was sort of traditional .      rob anybody .  you promised not to spy on me .      rob held up a hand .     ah weel  there ye have it  right enough  but it is one of them miss apprehensions  miss     cause we wasn   t spying at all  was we  lads .      the mass of little blue and red shapes that now covered the floor of the barn raised their voices in a chorus of blatant lying and perjury .  it slowed down when they saw her expression .      why is it  rob anybody  that you persist in lying when you are caught red handed .         ah weel  that   s an easy one  miss     said rob anybody  who was technically the head man of the nac mac feegles .     after all  ye ken  what would be the point of lyin    when you had nae done anything wrong .  anyway  now i am mortally wounded to my giblets on account of me good name being slandered     he said  grinning .     how many times have i lied to you  miss .         seven hundred and fifty three times     said tiffany .     every time you promise not to interfere in my business .         ah weel     said rob anybody     ye are still our big wee hag .         that may or may not be the case     said tiffany haughtily     but i am a lot more big and considerably less wee than i used to be .         and a lot more hag     said a jolly voice .  tiffany did not have to look to know who was talking .  only daft wullie could put his foot in it as far up as his neck .  she looked down at his beaming little face .  and he never did quite understand what it was that he was doing wrong .   hag .  it didn   t sound pretty  but every witch was a hag to the feegles  however young she was .  they didn   t mean anything by it     well  probably didn   t mean anything by it  but you could never tell for certain     and sometimes rob anybody grinned when he said it  but it was not their fault that to anyone not six inches tall the word meant someone who combed her hair with a rake and had worse teeth than an old sheep .  being called a hag when you are nine can be sort of funny .  it isn   t quite so amusing when you are nearly sixteen and have had a very bad day and very little sleep and could really  really do with a bath .   rob anybody clearly noticed this  because he turned to his brother and said     ye will bring to mind  brother o    mine  that there was times when ye should stick your head up a duck   s bottom rather than talk .      daft wullie looked down at his feet .     sorry  rob .  i couldnae find a duck the noo .      the head man of the feegles glanced down at the girl on the floor  sleeping gently under her blanket  and suddenly everything was serious .      if we had been here when that leathering was happening  it would have been a bad day for him  i   ll tell ye     said rob anybody .      just as well that you weren   t here then     said tiffany .     you don   t want to find people coming up to your mound with shovels  do you .  you keep away from bigjobs  you hear me .  you make them nervous .  when people get nervous  they get angry .  but since you   re here you can make yourselves useful .  i want to get this poor girl up to the mound .         aye  we know     said rob .     was it not the kelda herself who was sending us down here to find you .         she knew about this .  jeannie knew about this .         i dinnae ken     said rob nervously .  he always got nervous when talking about his wife  tiffany knew .  he loved her to distraction  and the thought of her even frowning in his direction turned his knees to jelly .  the life of all the other feegles was generally about fighting  stealing and boozing  with a few extra bits like getting food  which they mostly stole  and doing the laundry  which they mostly did not do .  as the kelda   s husband  rob anybody had to do the explaining as well  and that was never an easy job for a feegle .     jeannie has the kenning o    things  ye ken     he said  not looking directly at tiffany .  she felt sorry for him then  it must be better to be between a rock and a hard place than to be between a kelda and a hag  she thought .       chapter     those who stir in their sleep    the moon was well up and turned the world into a sharp edged jigsaw of black and silver as tiffany and the feegles headed up onto the downs .  the nac mac feegles could move in absolute silence when they wanted to  tiffany had been carried by them her  self  and it was always a gentle ride  and really quite pleasant  especially if they had had a bath in the last month or so .   every shepherd on the hills must have seen the feegle mound at some time or other .  no one ever talked about it .  some things were best left unspoken  such as the fact that the loss of lambs on the down where the feegles lived was much less than it was in more distant parts of the chalk  but on the other hand a few sheep would disappear  they would be the weak lambs or the very old ewes  feegles liked old strong mutton  the kind that you could chew for hours      the flocks were guarded  and guards took their pay .  besides  the mound was very close to all that remained of granny aching   s shepherding hut  and that was almost holy ground .   tiffany could smell the smoke leaking up through the thorn bushes as they got nearer .  well  at least it was a blessing that she would not have to slide down the hole to get into it  that sort of thing was all very well when you were nine  but when you were nearly sixteen it was undignified  the ruination of a good dress and  although she would not admit this  far too tight for comfort .   but jeannie the kelda had been making changes .  there was an old chalk pit quite close to the mound  reached by a passageway underground .  the kelda had got the boys working on this with bits of corrugated iron and tarpaulin which they had    found    in that very distinctive way they had of    finding    things .  it still looked like a typical upland chalk pit  because brambles and climbing henry and twirling betty vines had been trained over it so that barely a mouse would be able to find its way inside .  water could get in though  dripping down the iron and filling barrels down below  there was a much larger space now for cooking  and even enough room for tiffany to climb down if she remembered to shout out her name first  when hidden hands pulled strings and opened the way through the impassable brambles as if by magic .  the kelda had her own private bathroom down there  the feegles themselves took a bath only when something reminded them  such as an eclipse of the moon .   amber was whisked down the hole and tiffany waited impatiently close to the right spot in the bramble forest until the thorns magically    moved aside    .   jeannie  the kelda  almost as round as a football  was waiting for her  a baby under each arm .      i am very pleased to see you  tiffany     she said  and for some reason that sounded odd and out of place .     i have told the boys tae go and let off steam outside     the kelda went on .     this is woman   s work  and not a pretty errand at that  i   m sure ye will agree .  they have laid her down by the fire and i have started to put the soothings on her .  i do think she will bide fine  but it was a good job that ye have done this night .  your famous mistress weatherwax her own self could not have done a better job .         she taught me to take away pain     said tiffany .      ye dinnae say .     said the kelda  giving tiffany a strange look .     i hope ye never have occasion to regret the day she did ye that     kindness .      at this point several feegles appeared down the tunnel that led into the main mound .  they looked uneasily from their kelda to their hag  and a very reluctant spokesfeegle said     not to be barging in or anything  ladies  but we was cooking up a wee late night snack  and rob said to ask if the big wee hag would like a wee tasty .      tiffany sniffed .  there was a definite scent in the air  and it was the kind of scent you get when you have sheep meat in close conjunction with  for example  a roasting pan .  all right  she thought  we know they do it  but they might have the good manners not to do it in front of me .   the spokesfeegle must have realized this because  while wringing the edge of his kilt madly with both hands  as a feegle generally did when he was telling an enormous lie  he added     weel  i think i did hear that maybe a piece of sheep kind of accidentally fell intae the pan when it was cooking and we tried to drag it oot but     well  ye ken what sheep is like     it panicked and fought back .     at this point the speaker   s obvious relief at being able to cobble some kind of excuse together led him to attempt greater heights of fiction  and he went on     it is my thinking that it must have been suicidal owing to having nothing to do all day but eat grass .      he looked hopefully at tiffany to see if this had worked  just as the kelda cut in sharply and said     wee honeymouth jock  just you go in there and say that the big wee hag would like a mutton sandwich  ok .     she looked up at tiffany and said     no arguing  girl .  ye look tae me to be all but swaying for want of a decent hot meal .  i ken well that witches looks after everybody but theirselves .  run ye along  boys .      tiffany could still feel a tension in the air .  the kelda   s solemn little gaze stayed fixed on her  and then jeannie said     can you remember yesterday .      it sounded like a silly question  but jeannie was never silly .  it was worth thinking about  although tiffany yearned for some suicidal sheep and a decent night   s sleep .      yesterday     well  i suppose it   s the day before yesterday now     i was called over to buckle without     she said thoughtfully .     the blacksmith there had not been careful with his forge  and it had broken open and shot hot coals all down his leg .  i treated him and took away the pain  which i put in his anvil .  for the doing of this  i was paid twenty four pounds of potatoes  three cured deerskins  half a bucket of nails  one old but serviceable sheet good enough to make bandages and one small jar of hedgehog fat which his wife swore was a capital remedy for inflammation of the pipes .  i also had a good helping of stew with the family .  then  since i was in the vicinity  i went on to buckle with many  where i saw to mr gower   s little problem .  i mentioned to him about the hedgehog fat  and he said it was a wonderful cure for the unmentionables  and traded me one whole ham for the jar .  mrs gower made me tea and allowed me to pick a bushel basket of love in a pickle  which grows more freely in her garden than i have ever seen it grow anywhere else .     tiffany paused a moment .     oh yes  and then i stopped off at wits end to change a poultice  and then i went and saw to the baron  and then  of course  the rest of the day was my own  hah .  but on the whole it was not a bad day  as days go  as people were too busy thinking about the fair .         and as days go  the day has gone     said the kelda     and no doubt it was a busy and useful one .  but all day i had premonitions about ye  tiffany aching .     jeannie held up a small nut brown hand as tiffany began to protest  and went on     tiffany  ye must know that i watch over you .  ye are the hag o    the hills  after all  and i have the power to  watch ye in my heid  to keep an eye on ye  because somebody must .  i know ye know this because ye are clever  and i know that ye pretend to me that ye do not know  just as i pretend not to know that i know  and i am sure that ye know that too  yes .         i might have to work all that out with a pencil and paper     tiffany said  trying to laugh it off .      it is nae funny .  i can see ye clouded in my heid .  danger around ye .  and the worst of it is  i cannae see from whence it comes .  and that is not right .      just as tiffany opened her mouth  half a dozen feegles came scurrying down the tunnel from the mound  carrying a plate between them .  tiffany couldn   t help noticing  because witches always noticed things if they possibly can  that the blue decoration around the edge of the plate looked very much like that on her mother   s second best dinner service .  the rest of the plate was obscured by a large piece of mutton  along with jacket potatoes .  it smelled wonderful  and her stomach took over her brain .  a witch took her meals where she could  and was happy to get them .   the meat had been cut in half  although the half for the kelda was slightly smaller than the half for tiffany .  strictly speaking  you cannot have a half that is smaller than the other half  because it wouldn   t be a half  but human beings know what it means .  and keldas always had a huge appetite for their size  because they had babies to make .   this wasn   t time to talk anyway .  a feegle offered tiffany a knife which was  in fact  a feegle claymore  and then held up a rather grubby tin can with a spoon stuck in it .      relish .     he suggested shyly .   this was a bit posh for a feegle meal  although jeannie was civilizing them somewhat  in so far as you could civilize a feegle .  at least they were getting the right idea .  nevertheless  tiffany understood enough to be wary .      what   s in it .     she asked  knowing that this was a dangerous question .      oh  wonderful stuff     said the feegle  rattling the spoon in the can .     there   s crabapple  there is  and mustard seed and horseradish and snails and wild herbs and garlic and a sprinkling of johnny come lately       but he had gabbled one word a bit too quickly for tiffany   s taste .      snails .     she interrupted .      oh aye  yes  very nourishing  full of vit   mins and min   rals  ye ken  and those wee pro teenies  and the nice thing is  with enough garlic  they taste of garlic .         what do they taste of if you don   t use garlic .     said tiffany .      snails     said the kelda  taking pity on the waiter     and i have to say they are good eating  my girl .  the boys let them out at night to graze on wild cabbage and dog lettuce .  they are quite tasty  and i think ye might approve of the fact that there is no stealing involved .      well  that was a good thing  tiffany had to admit .  feegles did steal  joyously and repeatedly  as much for sport as anything else .  on the other hand  to the right people  in the right place  at the right time  they could be very generous  and this was  fortunately  happening right now .      even so  feegles farming .     she said aloud .      oh no     said the spokesfeegle  while his fellows behind him pantomimed insulted distaste by making    yuk    noises and sticking their fingers down their throat .     it is nae farming  it is livestock herding  as is suitable for them who is free o    spirit and likes to feel the wind up their kilt .  mind ye  the stampedes can be a wee bit embarrassing .         have some  please do     the kelda pleaded .     it will encourage them .      in fact  the new feegle cuisine was quite tasty .  perhaps it   s true what they say  thought tiffany  that anything goes with garlic .  except custard .      don   t mind my boys     said jeannie when they had both eaten their fill .     the times are changing and i think they know it .  for ye too .  how do ye feel .         oh  you know .  the usual     said tiffany .     tired  flustered and upset .  that sort of thing .         ye work too hard  my girl .  i fear ye do not have enough to eat  and i can certainly see ye don   t get enough sleep .  when did ye last sleep the night in a proper bed  i wonder .  ye ken that ye must have sleep  ye cannae think properly without some time to rest .  i fear ye will soon need all the strength ye can muster .  would ye like me to put the soothings on ye .      tiffany yawned again .     thank you for offering  jeannie     she said     but i don   t think i need them  if it   s all the same to you .     there was a pile of greasy fleeces in the corner that had probably not long before belonged to sheep who had decided to say goodbye to the cruel world and commit suicide .  they looked very inviting .     i had better go and see to the girl .     tiffany   s legs did not seem to want her to move .     still  i expect she is as safe as houses in a feegle mound .         oh  no     said jeannie softly as tiffany   s eyes shut .     much  much safer than houses .      when tiffany was actually snoring  jeannie walked slowly up and into the mound itself .  amber was curled up near the fire  but rob anybody had stationed some of the older and wiser feegles around her .  this was because the evening fighting was going on .  the nac mac feegle fought as often as they breathed  and generally at the same time .  it was by way of being a way of life  in a way .  besides  when you were only a few inches tall  you had the whole world to fight and so you might as well learn early .   jeannie sat down by her husband and watched the brawling for a while .  young feegles were bouncing off the walls  their uncles and one another .  then she said     rob  do ye think we are bringing our boys up properly .      rob anybody  who was sensitive to jeannie   s mood  glanced across at the sleeping girl .      oh aye  no doubt about it   hey  did ye no    see that .  slightly more wee than wee jock jock kicked daft wullie in the pog .  wonderful dirty fightin     and he   s still only three inches high .         he is going to make a grand warrior one day  rob  that   s true enough     said jeannie     but            i always tell them     rob anybody went on excitedly as the young feegle flew over their heads     that the way to success is always to attack only people who are much bigger than ye are .  important rule .      jeannie sighed as another young feegle smacked into the wall  shook his head and rushed back into the fight .  it was almost impossible to hurt a feegle .  any human who tried to stamp on a feegle would find that the little man he thought was under his boot was now in fact climbing up his trouser leg  and after that the day could only get worse .  besides  if you saw one feegle  there were probably many more around that you hadn   t spotted  and they had certainly spotted you .   perhaps the bigjobs have bigger problems because they   re bigger than us  the kelda thought .  she sighed inwardly .  she would never let her husband know this  but sometimes she did wonder whether a young feegle might profitably be taught something like  well  accountancy .  something that didnae mean ye had to bounce off the walls  and didnae mean you had to fight all the time .  but then  would he still be a feegle .      i   m feared for the big wee hag  rob     she said .     something is wrong .         she wanted to be a hag  lassie     said rob .     now she has to dree her weird  same as us .  she is a bonny fighter  ye ken .  she kissed the lord of the winter to his death and banged the queen o    the elves with a frying pan .  and i mind the time that invisible beastie got into her heid  and she wrestled it and sent it away .  she fights .         oh  i ken that well enough     said the kelda .     she kissed the face o    winter and made springtime come again .  it was a great thing that she did  sure enough  but she had the mantle of the summer about her .  it was that power she dealt to him  not just her own .  she did it well  mind  i can think of none who would have done it better  but she must beware .         what enemy can she have that we cannae face with her .     rob asked .      i cannae tell     said the kelda     but in my heid  it seems like this .  when she kissed the winter  it shook me to my roots  it seemed like it shook the world and i cannae but wonder that there might be those who stirred in their slumber .  you mak    certain  rob anybody  to keep more than one eye on her .          chapter     the real shilling    tiffany woke hungry and to the sound of laughter .  amber was awake and  against all probability  happy .   tiffany found out why when she managed to squeeze most of herself into the tunnel that led to the mound .  the girl was still lying curled up on one side  but a group of young feegles were entertaining her with somersaults and handsprings and occasionally tripping one another up in humorous ways .   the laughter was younger than amber was  it sounded like the chuckle a baby makes when it sees shiny things in pretty colours .  tiffany did not know how the soothings worked  but they were better than anything a witch could do  they seemed to settle people down and make them better from inside their head outwards .  they made you well and  best of all  they made you forget .  sometimes  it seemed to tiffany  the kelda talked about them as if they were alive     living thoughts perhaps  or kindly living creatures that somehow took away the bad things .      she   s doing well     said the kelda  appearing out of nowhere .     she will bide fine .  there will be nightmares as the darkness comes out .  the soothings can   t do everything .  she   s coming back into herself now  right from the start  and that   s the best thing .      it was still dark but dawn edged the horizon .  tiffany had a dirty job to do before daylight .      can i leave her here with you for a little while .     she said .     there   s a small task that needs doing .      i shouldn   t have gone to sleep  she thought as she climbed out of the pit .  i should have gone right back .  i shouldn   t have left the poor little thing there .   she tugged the broomstick out of the thorn bushes around the mound  and stopped dead .  someone was watching her  she could feel it on the back of her neck .  she turned sharply  and saw an old woman all in black  quite tall  but leaning on a walkingstick .  even as tiffany looked  the woman vanished  slowly  as if evaporating into the scenery .      mistress weatherwax .     tiffany said to the empty air  but that was silly .  granny weatherwax would not be seen dead with a walkingstick  and certainly wouldn   t be seen alive with one .  and there was movement in the corner of her eye .  when she spun round again there was a hare  right up on her  hind legs  watching her with interest and no sign of fear .   it was what they did  of course .  the feegles didn   t hunt them  and the average sheepdog would run out of legs before a hare ran out of breath .  the hare had no stuffy burrow to be trapped in  speed was where a hare lived  shooting across the landscape like a dream of the wind     she could afford to sit and watch the slow world go by .   this one burst into flames .  she blazed for a moment and then  entirely unharmed  sped away in a blur .   all right  thought tiffany as the broomstick came free  let   s approach this from the point of view of common sense .  the turf isn   t scorched and hares are not known for bursting into flames  so   she stopped as a tiny trapdoor flicked open in her memory .   the hare runs into the fire .   had she seen that written down anywhere .  had she heard it as part of a song .  a nursery rhyme .  what had the hare got to do with anything .  but she was a witch  after all  and there was a job to do .  mysterious omens could wait .  witches knew that mysterious omens were around all the time .  the world was always very nearly drowning in mysterious omens .  you just had to pick the one that was convenient .   bats and owls steered effortlessly out of tiffany   s way as she sped over the sleeping village .  the petty house was on the very edge .  it had a garden .  every house in the village had a garden .  most of them had a garden full of vegetables or  if the wife had the upper hand  half vegetables and half flowers .  the petty house was fronted by a quarter of an acre of stinging nettles .   that had always annoyed tiffany right down to her country boots .  how hard would it have been to grub up the weeds and put in a decent crop of potatoes .  all they needed was muck  and there was plenty of that in a farming village  the trick was to stop it getting into the house .  mr petty could have made an effort .   he had been back to the barn  or at least somebody had .  the baby was now on top of the heap of straw .  tiffany had come prepared with some old  but still serviceable linen  which was at least better than sacking and straw .  but somebody had disturbed the little body  and put flowers around it  except that the flowers were  in fact  stinging nettles .  they had also lit a candle in one of the tin plate candlesticks that every house in the village owned .  a candlestick .  a light .  on a pile of loose straw .  in a barn full of tinder dry hay and more straw .  tiffany stared in horror  and then heard the grunt overhead .  a man was hanging from the barn   s rafters .   they creaked .  a little dust and some shreds of hay floated down .  tiffany caught them quickly and picked up the candle before the next fall of wisps set the whole barn alight .  she was about to blow it out when it struck her that this would leave her in the dark with the gently spinning figure that may or may not be a corpse .  she put it down ever so carefully by the door and scrabbled around to find something sharp .  but this was petty   s barn  and everything was blunt  except a saw .   it had to be him up there .  who else could it be .     mr petty .     she said  clambering into the dusty rafters .   there was something like a wheeze .  was this good .   tiffany managed to hook one leg round a beam  leaving one hand free to wield the saw .  the trouble was that she needed two more hands .  the rope was tight round the man   s neck  and the blunt teeth of the saw bounced on it  making the man swing even more .  and he was beginning to struggle too  the fool  so that the rope not only swung  but twisted as well .  in a moment  she would fall down .   there was a movement in the air  a flash of iron  and petty dropped like a rock .  tiffany managed to hold her balance long enough to grab a dusty rafter and half climb and half slither after him .   her fingernails clawed at the rope round his neck but it was as tight as a drum     and there should have been a flourish of music because suddenly rob anybody was there  right in front of her  he held up a tiny  shiny claymore and looked at her questioningly .   she groaned inwardly .  what good are you  mr petty .  what good have you been .  you can   t even hang yourself properly .  what good will you ever do .  wouldn   t i be doing the world and you a favour by letting you finish what you began .   that was the thing about thoughts .  they thought themselves  and then dropped into your head in the hope that you would think so too .  you had to slap them down  thoughts like that  they would take a witch over if she let them .  and then it would all break down  and nothing would be left but the cackling .   she had heard it said that  before you could understand anybody  you needed to walk a mile in their shoes  which did not make a whole lot of sense because  probably after you had walked a mile in their shoes you would understand that they were chasing you and accusing you of the theft of a pair of shoes     although  of course  you could probably outrun them owing to their lack of footwear .  but she understood what the proverb actually meant  and here was a man one breath away from death .  she had no option  no option at all .  she had to give him that breath  for the sake of a handful of nettles  something inside the wretched hulk had still managed to be good .  it was a tiny spark  but it was there .  and there was no argument .   hating herself deep down for being so soppy  she nodded at the big man of the feegle clan .     all right     she said .     try not to hurt him too much .      the sword sparkled  and the cut was made with the delicacy of a surgeon  although the surgeon would have washed his hands first .   the rope actually sprang out as the feegle severed it  and shot away as though it was a serpent .  petty gasped air so hard that the candle flame by the door seemed to flatten for a moment .   tiffany got up off her knees and brushed herself down .     what did you come back for .     she said .     what were you looking for .  what did you expect to find .      mr petty lay there .  there wasn   t even a grunt in reply .  it was hard to hate him now  wheezing on the floor .   being a witch meant you had to make choices  usually the choices that ordinary people did not want to make or even to know about .  so she washed his face with a bit of torn cloth moistened from the pump outside and wrapped the dead child in the rather larger and cleaner bit of cloth that she had brought for the purpose .  it wasn   t the best of shrouds  but it was honest and civilized .  she reminded herself  in a dreamy kind of way  that she needed to build up her store of makeshift bandages and realized how grateful she should be .     thank you  rob     she said .     i don   t i think i could have managed by myself .         i reckon that maybe ye could     said rob anybody  while they both knew that she couldn   t .     it just so happened that i was passing by  ye ken  and not following ye at all .  one of them coincidences .         there have been a lot of those coincidences lately     said tiffany .      aye     said rob  grinning     it must be another coincidence .      it was impossible to embarrass a feegle .  they just couldn   t grasp the idea .   he was watching her .     what happens now .     he said .   that was the question  wasn   t it .  a witch needed to make people believe she knew what to do next  even if she didn   t .  petty was going to live  and the poor child was not going to stop being dead .     i   ll take care of things     she said .     it   s what we do .      only it   s just me  there is no    us     she thought as she flew through the mists of morning to the place of flowers .  i wish  i wish there was .   in the hazel woods there was a clearing of flowers from early spring to late autumn .  there was meadowsweet and foxglove and old man   s trousers and jack jump into bed and ladies    bonnets and three times charlie and sage and southernwood and pink yarrow and ladies    bedstraw and cowslips and primroses and two types of orchid .   it was where the old lady that they had called the witch was buried .  if you knew where to look  you could see what little was left of her cottage underneath all that greenery  and if you really knew where to look  you could see the place where she had been buried .  if you really and truly knew where to look  you could find the spot where tiffany had buried the old lady   s cat too  there was catnip growing on it .   once upon a time  the rough music had come for the old woman and her cat  oh yes it had  and the people walking to its drumming had dragged her out into the snow and pulled down the rickety cottage and burned her books because they had pictures of stars in them .   and why .  because the baron   s son had gone missing and mrs snapperly had no family and no teeth and  to be honest  cackled a bit as well .  and that made her a witch  and the people of the chalk didn   t trust witches  so she was pulled out into the snow  and while the fire ate up the thatch of the cottage  page after page of stars crackled and crinkled into the night sky while the men stoned the cat to death .  and that winter  after she had hammered on doors that remained closed to her  the old woman died in the snow  and because she had to be buried somewhere  there was a shallow grave where the old cottage used to be .   but the old woman had nothing to do with the loss of the baron   s son  had she .  and soon after  tiffany had gone all the way to a strange fairyland to bring him back  hadn   t she .  and nobody talked about the old lady these days  did they .  but when they walked past the place in the summer  the flowers filled the air with delight and bees filled it with the colours of honey .   no one talked about it .  after all  what would you say .  rare flowers growing on the grave of the old woman and catnip growing where the aching girl had buried the cat .  it was a mystery  and maybe a judgement  although whose judgement it was  on whom  for what and why  was best not thought about  let alone discussed .  nevertheless  wonderful flowers growing over the remains of the possible witch     how could that happen .   tiffany didn   t ask that question .  the seeds had been expensive to buy and she had had to go all the way to twoshirts to get them  but she had vowed that every summer the brilliance in the wood would remind people that there had been an old lady they had hounded to death and been buried there .  she did not quite know why she thought that was important  but she was certain to the centre of her soul that it was .   when she had finished digging the deep but sad little hole in a patch of love in a hurry  tiffany looked around to make certain that no early morning traveller was watching and used both hands to fill the hole with dirt  moving dead leaves and transplanting some forget me lots .  they weren   t really right here  but they grew fast and that was important because     someone was watching her .  it was important not to look round .  she knew she couldn   t be seen .  in all her life she had met only one person who was better than her at not being seen  and that was granny weatherwax .  it was still misty too  and she would have heard if anyone had come along the path .  it wasn   t a bird or animal  either .  they always felt different .   a witch should never have to look around because they should know who was behind them .  usually she could work it out  but every sense she had told her that no one but tiffany aching was there  and somehow  in some strange way  it felt wrong .      too much to do  not enough sleep     she said aloud  and thought she heard a faint voice say     yes .     it was like an echo except there was nothing for it to echo from .  she flew away as fast as she could make the broomstick go  which  not being very fast at all  at least served to prevent it looking as though she was running away .   going nuts .  witches didn   t often talk about it  but they were aware of it all the time .   going nuts  or  rather not going nuts  was the soul and centre of witchcraft  and this was how it worked .  after a while  a witch  who almost always worked by herself in the tradition of witches  had a tendency to go     strange .  of course  it depended on the length of time and the strength of mind of the witch  but sooner or later they tended to get confused about things like right and wrong and good and bad and truth and consequences .  that could be very dangerous .  so witches had to keep one another normal  or at least what was normal for witches .  it didn   t take very much  a tea party  a singsong  a stroll in the woods  and somehow everything balanced up  and they could look at adverts for gingerbread cottages in the builder   s brochure without putting a deposit on one .   on top of everything else tiffany was worried about going nuts .  it was two months since she had last been up into the mountains and three months since she had last seen miss tick  the only other witch you ever saw down here .  there wasn   t time to go visiting .  there was always too much to do .  perhaps that was the trick of it  tiffany thought .  if you kept yourself busy you wouldn   t have time to go nuts .   the sun was well up when she got back to the feegle mound and she was shocked to see amber sitting out on the side of the mound  surrounded by feegles and laughing .  the kelda was waiting for tiffany by the time she had garaged the broomstick in the thorn bushes .      i hope ye do not mind     she said when she saw tiffany   s face .     the sunshine is a great healer .         jeannie  it was wonderful of you to put the soothings on her  but i don   t want her to see too much of you .  she might tell people .         oh  it will all seem like a dream tae her  the soothings will see to that     said jeannie calmly     and who will take much heed of a wee girl prattling about the fairies .         she is thirteen .     said tiffany .     it   s not supposed to happen .         is she no    happy .         well  yes  but         there was a steely look in jeannie   s eye .  she had always been very respectful to tiffany  but respect requires respect in its turn .  it was jeannie   s mound  after all  and probably her land as well .   tiffany settled for saying     her mother will be worrying .         is that so .     said jeannie .     and did her mam worry when she left the poor thing taking a beating .      tiffany wished the kelda wasn   t so astute .  people used to tell tiffany that she was so sharp she would cut herself  but the kelda   s steady grey gaze could chop iron nails .      well  amber   s mother is     she   s not very     clever .         so i hear     said jeannie     but most beasts is short on brains  and yet still the doe will stand her ground to defend her fawn  and a fox for her cub will face down the dog .         humans are more complicated     said tiffany .      so it seems     said the kelda  her voice chilly just for that moment .      well  the soothings is working fine  so maybe the girl needs to be back in your complicated world .      where her father is still alive  tiffany reminded herself .  i know he is .  he was bruised  but he was breathing  and i hope to goodness he sobers up .  and is this problem ever going to end .  it has to be sorted out .  i   ve got other things to do .  and i   ve got to go and see the baron this afternoon .   tiffany   s father met them when they walked into the farmyard  tiffany generally left the broomstick tied to a tree just outside  in theory because flying overhead frightened the chickens  but mostly because she was never able to land very gracefully and certainly didn   t want an audience .   he looked from amber to his daughter .     is she all right .  she looks a bit     dreamy .         she   s had something to calm her down and make her feel better     said tiffany     and she shouldn   t run around .         her mum has been in a dreadful state  you know     tiffany   s father went on reproachfully     but i told her you were looking after amber in a very safe place .      there was more than a hint of    you are sure about that  aren   t you .     in the way he spoke  and tiffany was careful to ignore it  and simply said     i was .     she tried to imagine mrs petty in a dreadful state  and it didn   t work .  every time she had ever seen the woman she had a look of baffled apprehension  as if life had too many puzzles and you just had to wait until the next one hit you .   tiffany   s father pulled his daughter to one side and lowered his voice .     petty came back in the night     he hissed     and they say that someone tried to kill him .         what .         true as i   m standing here .      tiffany turned to amber .  the girl was staring at the sky as if hoping patiently for something interesting to happen .      amber     she said carefully     you know how to feed chickens  don   t you .         oh yes  miss .         well  go and feed ours  will you .  there   s grain in the barn .         your mum fed them hours ago       her father began  but tiffany dragged him away quickly .      when did this happen .     she asked  watching amber walking obediently into the barn .      some time last night .  mrs petty told me .  he was beaten badly .  in that rackety old barn .  right where we were sitting last night .         mrs petty went back .  after everything that happened .  what does she see in him .      mr aching gave a shrug .     he is her husband .         but everyone knows he beats her up .      her father looked a bit embarrassed .     well     he said     i suppose to some women any husband is better than none .      tiffany opened her mouth to reply  looked into her father   s eyes and saw the truth of what he had said .  she had seen some of them up in the mountains  worn out by too many children and not enough money .  of course  if they knew nanny ogg  something could be done about the children at least  but you still found the families who sometimes  in order to put food on the table  had to sell the chairs .  and there was never anything you could do about it .      mr petty wasn   t beaten up  dad  although it wouldn   t be such a bad idea if he was .  i found him trying to hang himself  and i cut him down .         he   s got two broken ribs  and bruises all over him .         it was a long way down  dad     he was choking to death .  what should i have done .  let him swing .  he has lived to see another day  whether he deserves to or not .  it   s not my job to be an executioner .  there was a bouquet  dad .  weeds and nettles .  his hands were swollen with nettle stings .  there   s at least some part of him that deserves to live  do you see .         but you did steal the baby away .         no  dad  i stole away with the baby .  listen  dad  do get it right .  i buried the child  which was dead .  i saved the man who was dying .  i did those things  dad .  people might not understand     might make up stories .  i don   t care .  you do the job that is in front of you .      there was a clucking  and amber walked across the yard with the chickens following her in a line .  the clucking was being done by amber  and as tiffany and her father watched  the chickens marched back and forth as if under the command of a drill sergeant .  the girl was giggling to herself in between clucks  and after managing to get the chickens to walk solemnly in a circle she looked up at tiffany and her father as if nothing had happened and led the fowls back into the barn .   after a pause tiffany   s father said     that did just happen  didn   t it .         yes     said tiffany .     i have no idea why .         i   ve been talking to some of the other lads     said her father     and your mother has been talking to the women .  we   ll keep an eye on the pettys .  things have been let go that shouldn   t have .  people can   t expect to leave everything to you .  people mustn   t think that you can fix everything  and if you   ll take my advice  neither will you .  there are some things a whole village has to do .         thanks  dad     said tiffany     but i think i had better go and see to the baron now .      tiffany could only just remember ever seeing the baron as a well man .  nor did anyone seem to know what was wrong with him .  but  like many other invalids she had seen  he somehow kept on going  living in a holding pattern and waiting to die .   she had heard one of the villagers call him a creaking door which never slammed  he was getting worse now  and in her opinion it was not going to be very long before his life slammed shut .   but she could take away the pain  and even frighten it a little so it wouldn   t come back for a while .   tiffany hurried to the castle .  the nurse  miss spruce  was waiting when she arrived  and her face was pale .      it   s not one of his good days     she said  then added with a modest little smile     i have been praying for him all morning .         i   m sure that was very kind of you     said tiffany .  she had taken care to keep any sarcasm out of her voice  but she got a frown from the nurse anyway .   the room tiffany was ushered into smelled like sickrooms everywhere  all too much of people  and not enough air .  the nurse stood in the doorway as if she was on guard .  tiffany could feel her permanently suspicious gaze on the back of her neck .  there was more and more of that sort of attitude about .  sometimes you got wandering preachers around who didn   t like witches  and people would listen to them .  it seemed to tiffany that people lived in a very strange world sometimes .  everybody knew  in some mysterious way  that witches ran away with babies and blighted crops  and all the other nonsense .  and at the same time  they would come running to the witch when they needed help .   the baron lay in a tangle of sheets  his face grey  his hair totally white now  with little pink patches where it had all gone .  he looked neat  though .  he had always been a neat man  and every morning one of the guards would come and give him a shave .  it cheered him up  as far as anyone could tell  but right now he looked straight through tiffany .  she was used to this  the baron was what they called    a man of the old school    .  he was proud and did not have the best of tempers  but he would stand up for himself at all times .  to him  the pain was a bully  and what do you do to bullies .  you stood up to them  because they always ran away in the end .  but the pain didn   t know about that rule .  it just bullied even more .  and the baron lay with thin white lips  tiffany could hear him not screaming .   now  she sat down on a stool beside him  flexed her fingers  took a deep breath  and then received the pain  calling it out of the wasted body and putting it into the invisible ball just above her shoulder .      i don   t hold with magic  you know     said the nurse from the doorway .   tiffany winced like a tightrope walker who has just felt someone hit the other end of the rope with a big stick .  carefully  she let the flow of pain settle down  a little bit at a time .      i mean     said the nurse     i know it makes him feel better  but where does all this healing power come from  that   s what i   d like to know .         perhaps it comes from all your praying  miss spruce     said tiffany sweetly  and was glad to see the moment of fury on the woman   s face .   but miss spruce had the hide of an elephant .     we must be sure that we don   t get involved with dark and demonic forces .  better a little pain in this world than an eternity of suffering in the next .      up in the mountains there were sawmills driven by water  and they had big circular saws that spun so fast they were nothing but a silver blur in the air     until an absent minded man forgot to pay attention  when it became a red disc and the air was raining fingers .   tiffany felt like that now .  she needed to concentrate and the woman was determined to go on talking  while the pain was waiting for just one moment   s lack of attention .  oh well  nothing for it     she threw the pain at a candlestick beside the bed .  it shattered instantly  and the candle flashed into flame  she stamped on it until it went out .  then she turned to the astonished nurse .      miss spruce  i am sure that what you have to say is very interesting  but on the whole  miss spruce  i don   t really care what you think about anything .  i don   t mind you staying in here  miss spruce  but what i do mind  miss spruce  is that this is very difficult and can be dangerous for me if it goes wrong .  go away  miss spruce  or stay  miss spruce  but most of all  shut up  miss spruce  because i   ve only just started and there is still a lot of pain to shift .      miss spruce gave her another look .  it was fearsome .   tiffany returned this with a look of her own  and if there is one thing that a witch learns how to do  it is how to look .   the door shut behind the enraged nurse .      talk quietly     she listens at doors .      the voice came from the baron  but it was hardly a voice at all  you could just hear in it the tones of someone used to command  but now it was cracked and failing  every word pleading for enough time to say the next word .      i   m sorry  sir  but i must concentrate     said tiffany .     i would hate for this to go wrong .         of course .  i shall remain silent .      taking away pain was dangerous  difficult and very tiring  but there was  well  a wonderful compensation in seeing the grey face of the old man come back to life .  there was already some pinkness to his skin  and it was fleshing out as more and more pain flowed out of him and through tiffany and into the new little invisible ball floating above her right shoulder .   balance .  it was all about balance .  that had been one of the first things that she had learned  the centre of the seesaw has neither up nor down  but upness and downness flow through it while it remains unmoved .  you had to be the centre of the seesaw so that pain flowed through you  not into you .  it was very hard .  but she could do it .  she prided herself on it  even granny weatherwax had grunted when tiffany had showed her one day how she had mastered the trick .  and a grunt from granny weatherwax was like a round of applause from anybody else .   but the baron was smiling .     thank you  miss tiffany aching .  and now  i would like to sit in my chair .      this was unusual  and tiffany had to think about it .     are you sure  sir .  you are still very weak .         yes  everybody tells me that     said the baron  waving a hand .     i can   t imagine why they think i don   t know .  help me up  miss tiffany aching  for i must speak to you .      it wasn   t very difficult .  a girl who could heave mr petty out of his bed had little problem with the baron  whom she handled like a piece of fine china  which he resembled .      i do not think that you and i  miss tiffany aching  have had more than the simplest and most practical of conversations in all the time you have been seeing to me  yes .     he said when she had him settled with his walking stick in his hands so that he could lean on it .  the baron was not a man to lounge in a chair if he could sit on the edge of it .      well  yes  sir  i think you are right     said tiffany carefully .      i dreamed i had a visitor here last night     said the baron  giving her a wicked little grin .     what do you think of that then  miss tiffany aching .         at the moment i have no idea  sir     said tiffany  thinking  not the feegles .  let it not be the feegles .      it was your grandmother  miss tiffany aching .  she was a fine woman  and extremely handsome .  oh yes .  i was rather upset when she married your grandfather  but i suppose it was for the best .  i miss her  you know .         you do .     said tiffany .   the old man smiled .     after my dear wife passed on  she was the only person left who would dare to argue with me .  a man of power and responsibility nevertheless needs somebody to tell him when he is being a bloody fool .  granny aching fulfilled that task with commendable enthusiasm  i must say .  and she needed to  because i was often a bloody fool who needed a kick up the arse  metaphorically speaking .  it is my hope  miss tiffany aching  that when i am in my grave you will perform the same service to my son roland who  as you know  is inclined to be a bit too full of himself at times .  he will need somebody to kick him up the arse  metaphorically speaking  or indeed in real life if he gets altogether all too snotty .      tiffany tried to hide a smile  then took a moment to adjust the spin of the ball of pain as it hovered companionably by her shoulder .     thank you for your trust in me  sir .  i shall do my best .      the baron gave a polite little cough and said     indeed  at one point i harboured hopes that you and the boy might make a more     intimate arrangement .         we are good friends     said tiffany carefully .     we were good friends and i trust that we will continue to be     good friends .     she hurriedly had to stop the pain wobbling dangerously .   the baron nodded .     jolly good  miss tiffany aching  but please don   t let the bond of friendship prevent you from giving him a righteous kick up the arse if he needs one .         i will take some pleasure in doing so  sir     said tiffany .      well done  young lady     said the baron     and thank you for not chiding me for using the word    arse    or asking me the meaning of the word    metaphorical    .         no  sir .  i know what    metaphorical    means  and    arse    is a traditional usage     nothing to be ashamed of .      the baron nodded .     it has a commendable grown up sharpness to it .     ass     on the other hand  is quite frankly for spinsters and little children .      tiffany turned the words on her tongue for a moment  and said     yes  sir .  i think that is probably the long and the short of it .         very good .  incidentally  miss tiffany aching  i cannot conceal my interest in the fact that you do not curtsy in my presence these days .  why not .         i am a witch now  sir .  we don   t do that sort of thing .         but i am your baron  young lady .         yes .  and i am your witch .         but i have soldiers out there who will come running if i call .  and i am sure you know  too  that people around here do not always respect witches .         yes  sir .  i know that  sir .  and i am your witch .      tiffany watched the baron   s eyes .  they were a pale blue  but right now there was a foxy glint of mischief in them .   the worst thing you could possibly do right now  she told herself  would be to show any kind of weakness at all .  he   s like granny weatherwax  he tests people .   as if he was reading her mind exactly at that point  the baron laughed .     then you are your own person  miss tiffany aching .         i don   t know about that  sir .  just lately i feel as if i belong to everybody .         hah     said the baron .     you work very hard and conscientiously  i   m told .         i am a witch .         yes     said the baron .     so you have said  clearly and consistently and with some considerable repetition .     he leaned both skinny hands on his walking stick and looked at her over the top of them .     it is true then  is it .     he said .     that some seven years ago you took an iron skillet and went into some sort of fairyland  where you rescued my son from the queen of the elves     a most objectionable woman  i have been given to understand .      tiffany hesitated about this .     do you want it to be so .     she said .   the baron chuckled and pointed a skinny finger at her .     do i want it to be .  indeed .  a good question  miss tiffany aching  who is a witch .  let me think     let us say     i want to know the truth .         well  the bit about the frying pan is true  i must admit  and well  roland had been pretty well knocked about so i  well  had to take charge .  a bit .         a     bit .     said the old man  smiling .      not an unreasonably large bit     said tiffany quickly .      and why didn   t anybody tell me this at the time  pray .     said the baron .      because you are the baron     said tiffany simply     and boys with swords rescue girls .  that   s how the stories go .  that   s how stories work .  no one really wanted to think the other way round .         didn   t you mind .     he wasn   t taking his eyes off her  and he hardly seemed to blink .  there was no point in lying .      yes     she said .     a bit .         was it a reasonably large bit .         i would say so  yes .  but then i went off to learn to be a witch  and it didn   t seem to matter any more .  that   s the truth of it  sir .  excuse me  sir  who told you this .         your father     said the baron .     and i am grateful to him for telling me .  he came to see me yesterday  to pay his respects  seeing as i am  as you know  dying .  which is  in fact  another truth .  and don   t you dare tell him off  young lady  witch or otherwise .  promise me .      tiffany knew that the long lie had hurt her father .  she   d never really worried about it  but it had worried him .      yes  sir  i promise .      the baron was silent for a moment  staring at her .     you know  miss tiffany aching  who is  by regular repetition  a witch  i am at a time when my eyes are cloudy  but my mind  somehow  sees further than you think .  but perhaps it is not too late for me to make amends .  under my bed is a chest bound with brass .  go and open it .  go on .  do that now .      tiffany pulled out the chest  which felt as if it was full of lead .      you will find some leather bags     said the old man behind her .      take one of them out .  it will contain fifteen dollars .     the baron coughed .     thank you for saving my son .         look  i can   t take       tiffany began  but the baron banged his stick on the floor .      shut up and listen  please  miss tiffany aching .  when you fought the queen of the elves  you were not a witch and therefore the tradition against witches taking money does not apply     he said sharply  his eyes glittering like sapphires .     with regard to your personal services to myself  i believe you have been paid in food and clean used linen  second hand footwear and firewood .  i trust my housekeeper has been generous .  i told her not to stint .         what .  oh  oh yes  sir .     and that was true enough .  witches lived in a world of second hand clothes  old sheets  good for making bandages   boots with some life left in them and  of course  hand me downs  hand me outs  hands me ups  hand me rounds and hand me overs .  in such a world  the pickings to be had from a working castle were like being given the key to a mint .  as for the money     she turned the leather bag over and over in her hands .  it was very heavy .      what do you do with all that stuff  miss tiffany aching .         what .     she said absentmindedly  still looking at the bag .     oh  er  trade it  pass it on to people who need it     that sort of thing .         miss tiffany aching  you are suddenly vague .  i believe that you were engrossed in thinking that fifteen dollars isn   t much  is it  for saving the life of the baron   s son .         no .         i   ll take that as a    yes    then  shall i .         you will take it from me as a no  sir .  i am your witch .     she glared at him  panting .     and i am trying to balance a rather difficult ball of pain  sir .         ah  granny aching   s granddaughter .  i humbly beg your forgiveness  as i occasionally should have asked for hers .  but nevertheless  will you please do me the favour and honour of taking that bag  miss tiffany aching  and putting its contents to such use as you may determine in memory of me .  i   m sure it   s more money than you have ever seen before .         i don   t often see any money at all     she protested  stunned by this .   the baron banged his stick on the floor again  as if applauding .     i doubt very much if you have ever seen money like this     he said merrily .     you see  although there are fifteen dollars in the bag  they are not the dollars that you are used to  or would be if you were used to them at all .  they are old dollars  from before they started mucking about with the currency .  the modern dollar is mostly brass  in my opinion  and contains as much gold as sea water .  these  however  are the real shilling  if you   ll excuse my little joke .      tiffany excused his little joke  because she didn   t get it .  he smiled at her puzzlement .     in short  miss tiffany aching  if you take these coins to the right dealer  he should pay you  oh  i would estimate somewhere in the region of five thousand ankh morpork dollars .  i don   t know what that would be in terms of old boots  but quite possibly it could buy you an old boot the size of this castle .      and tiffany thought  i can   t take this .  apart from anything else the bag had become extremely heavy .  instead  she said     that   s far too much for a witch .         but not too much for a son     said the baron .     not too much for an heir  not too much for continuity down the generations .  not too much for removing a lie from the world .         but it can   t buy me another pair of hands     said tiffany     or change one second of the past .         nevertheless  i must insist that you take it     said the baron     if not for your sake  then for mine .  it will take a burden off my soul and  believe me  it could do with a bit of shining up at this time  don   t you agree .  i am going to die soon  am i not .         yes  sir .  very soon  i think  sir .      tiffany was beginning to understand something about the baron by now  and she wasn   t surprised when he laughed .      you know     he said     most people would have said     oh  no  old chap  you   ve got ages yet  you will be up and out of here in no time  lots of life left in you .            yes  sir .  i   m a witch  sir .         and in this context that means     .         i try very hard not to have to tell lies  sir .      the old man shifted in his chair  and was suddenly solemn .     when the time comes        he began  and hesitated .      i will keep you company  sir  if you wish     said tiffany .   the baron looked relieved .     have you ever seen death .      she had been expecting this and was ready .     usually you just feel him passing  sir  but i have seen him twice  in what would have been the flesh  if he had any .  he   s a skeleton with a scythe  just like in the books     in fact  i think it   s because that   s what he looks like in the books .  he was polite but firm  sir .         i   ll bet he is .     the old man was silent for a little while and then went on .     did he     drop any hints about the afterlife .         yes  sir .  apparently it contains no mustard  and i got the impression that it contains no pickles either .         really .  bit of a blow  that .  i suppose that chutney is out of the question .         i did not go into the subject of pickled condiments in any depth  sir .  he had a big scythe .      there was a loud knocking at the door  and miss spruce called loudly     are you all right  sir .         in tip top condition  dear miss spruce     said the baron loudly  then lowered his voice to say conspiratorially     i believe our miss spruce does not like you very much  my dear .         she thinks i   m unhygienic     said tiffany .      never really understood about all that nonsense     said the baron .      it   s quite easy     said tiffany .     i have to stick my hands in the fire at every opportunity .         what .  you put your hands in the fire .      now she was sorry she had mentioned it  but she knew the old man would not now be satisfied until she had shown him .  she sighed and crossed over to the fireplace  pulling a large iron poker out of its stand .  she admitted to herself that she liked showing off this trick occasionally  and the baron would be an appreciative audience .  but should she do it .  well  the fire trick was not that complicated and the balance of the pain was fine  and it wasn   t as if the baron had much time left .   she drew a bucket of water from the little well at the far end of the room .  the well had frogs in it  and therefore so did the bucket  but she was kind and dropped them back into their well .  no one likes boiling a frog .  the bucket of water was not strictly necessary  but it did have a part to play .  tiffany coughed theatrically .     do you see  sir .  i have one poker and one bucket of cold water .  cold metal poker  cold bucket of water .  and now     i hold in my left hand the poker  and i stick my right hand into the hottest part of the fire  like this .      the baron gasped as flames burst around her hand and the tip of the poker in her other hand suddenly glowed red hot .   with the baron suitably impressed  tiffany dowsed the poker in the bucket of water  from which erupted a cloud of steam .  then she stood in front of the baron  holding up both hands  quite unscathed .      but i saw flames come up .     said the baron  his eyes wide .     well done .  very well done .  some sort of trick  yes .         more of a skill  sir .  i put my hand in the fire and sent the heat into the poker .  i just moved the heat around .  the flame you saw was caused by the burning of bits of dead skin  dirt  and all those nasty  invisible little biting things that unhygienic people might have on their hands        she paused .     are you all right  sir .     the baron was staring at her .     sir .  sir .      the old man spoke as if he was reading from an invisible book     the hare runs into the fire .  the hare runs into the fire .  the fire  it takes her  she is not burned .  the fire  it loves her  she is not burned .  the hare runs into the fire .  the fire  it loves her  she is free     it all comes back to me .  how did i ever forget it .  how did i dare to forget it .  i told myself i would remember it for ever  but time goes on and the world fills up with things to remember  things to do  calls on your time  calls on your memory .  and you forget the things that were important  the real things .      tiffany was shocked to see tears streaming down his face .      i remember it all     he whispered  his voice punctuated with sobs .     i remember the heat .  i remember the hare .      at which point the door banged open and miss spruce stepped into the room .  what happened next took a moment  but seemed to tiffany to go on for an hour .  the nurse looked at her holding the poker  and then at the old man in tears  then at the cloud of steam  then back to tiffany as she let the poker go  and then back to the old man  and then back to tiffany as the poker landed in the hearth with a clang that echoed around the world .  and then miss spruce took a deep breath like a whale preparing to dive to the bottom of the ocean and screamed     what do you think you are doing to him .  get out of here  you brazen hussy .      tiffany   s ability to speak came back quickly  and then grew into an ability to shout .     i am not brazen and i don   t huss .         i   m going to fetch the guards  you black and midnight hag .     the nurse screamed  heading for the door .      it   s only eleven thirty .     tiffany shouted after her and hurried back to the baron  totally at a loss as to what to do next .  the pain shifted .  she could feel it .  she wasn   t keeping her mind straight .  things were getting out of balance .  she concentrated for a moment and then  trying to smile  turned to the baron .      i   m very sorry if i have upset you  sir     she began  and then realized that he was smiling through his tears and his whole face seemed full of sunlight .      upset me .  good gracious no  i   m not upset .     he tried to pull himself upright in the chair and pointed towards the fire with a trembling finger .     i am  in fact  set up .  i feel alive .  i am young  my dear miss tiffany aching .  i remember that perfect day .  can you not see me .  down in the valley .  a perfect  crisp september day .  a little boy in the tweed jacket that was far too itchy  as i recall  yes  was far too itchy and smelled of wee .  and my father was singing    the larks they sang melodious     and i was trying to harmonize  which of course i couldn   t do then because i had about as much voice as a rabbit  and we were watching them burn the stubbles .  there was smoke everywhere  and as the fire swept along  mice  rats  rabbits and even foxes were running towards us away from the flames .  pheasants and partridges were taking off like rockets at the last minute  as they do  and suddenly there was no sound at all and i saw this hare .  oh  she was a big one     did you know that country people used to think all hares were female .      and she just stood there  looking at me  with bits of burning grass falling around us  and the flames behind her  and she was looking directly at me  and i will swear that when she knew that she had caught my eye  she flicked herself into the air and jumped straight into the fire .  and of course i cried like anything  because she was so fine .  and my father picked me up and said he   d tell me a little secret  and he taught me the hare song  so that i would know the truth of it  and stop crying .  and then later on  we walked over the ashes and there was no dead hare .     the old man turned his head awkwardly towards her  and beamed  really beamed .  he shone .   where is that coming from .  tiffany wondered .  it   s too yellow for firelight  but the curtains are shut .  it   s always too gloomy in here  but now it is the light of a crisp september day         i remember doing a crayon picture of it when we got home  and my father was so proud of it he took it all around the castle so that everybody could admire it     the old man went on  as enthusiastic as a boy .     a child   s scrawl  of course  but he talked about it as if it were a work of genius .  parents do such things .  i found it among his documents after he died  and in fact  if you are interested  you will find it in a leather folder within the money chest .  it is  after all  a precious thing .  i   ve never told anyone else that     said the baron .     people and days and memories come and go but that memory has always been there .  no money that i could give you  miss tiffany aching  who is the witch  could ever repay you for bringing back to me that wonderful vision .  which i shall remember until the day i        for a moment the flames on the fire stood still and the air was cold .  tiffany was never actually sure that she ever saw death  not actually saw  perhaps in some strange way it had all happened inside her head .  though wherever he was  well  he was there .   wasn   t that appropriate .  death said .   tiffany didn   t step back .  there was no point .     did you arrange that .     she asked .   much as i would like to take the credit  other forces are at work .  good morning to you  miss aching .   death left  and the baron followed  a little boy in his new tweed jacket  which was terribly itchy and sometimes smelled of wee    following his father across the smoking field .   then tiffany placed her hand on the dead man   s face and  with respect  closed his eyes  where the light of burning fields was dimming .     whatever sex a hare is  to the true countryman  all hares are referred to as    her    .        the old cloth makers used urine as a mordant for the dyes used in making woollen clothes  so that the colours would be fixed and not run  as a result  they can be a bit smelly for years .  not even miss tick could have explained it better and stayed so calm  although she would probably have used the term    evacuated bodily juices    .       chapter     the mother of tongues    there should have been a moment of peace  in fact there was a moment of metal .  some of the castle guard were approaching  their armour making even more noise than armour usually does because none of it fitted properly .  there hadn   t been any battles here for hundreds of years  but they still wore armour  because it seldom needed mending and didn   t wear out .   the door was pushed open by brian  the sergeant .  he wore a complicated expression .  it was the expression of a man who has just been told that an evil witch  whom he has known since she was a kid  has killed the boss  and the boss   s son is away  and the witch is still in the room  and a nurse  whom he does not like very much  is prodding him in the bottom and shouting     what are you waiting for  man .  do your duty .      all this was getting on his nerves .   he gave tiffany a sheepish look .     morning  miss  is everything all right .     then he stared at the baron in his chair .     he   s dead then  is he .      tiffany said     yes  brian  he is .  he died only a couple of minutes ago  and i have reason to believe that he was happy .         well  that   s good then  i suppose     said the sergeant  and then his face twisted into tears so that the next words were gulped and damp .     you know  he was really very good to us when my nan was ill  he had hot meals sent over to her every day  right up until the end .      she held his unprotesting hand and looked over his shoulder .  the other guards were crying too  and crying all the more because they knew they were big strong men  or so they hoped  and shouldn   t cry at all .  but the baron had always been there  part of life  like the sunrise .  all right  maybe he   d give you a dressing down if you were asleep on duty or had a blunt sword  despite the fact that no guard in living memory had needed to use his sword for anything more than levering the lid off a tin of jam   but when all was said and done  he was the baron and they were his men and now he was gone .      ask her about the poker .     screamed the nurse behind brian .     go on  ask her about the money .      the nurse could not see brian   s face .  tiffany could .  he had probably been prodded in the bottom again  and was suddenly livid .      sorry  tiff     i mean  miss  but this lady here says she thinks you done a murder and a robbery     he said  and his face added that its owner right now was not thinking the same thing and didn   t want to get into trouble with anyone  especially tiffany .   tiffany rewarded him with a little smile .  always remember you are a witch  she told herself .  don   t start shouting your innocence .  you know you are innocent .  you don   t have to shout anything .     the baron was kind enough to give me some money for     looking after him     she said     and i suppose miss spruce must have inadvertently heard him doing so and formed a wrong impression .         it was a lot of money .     miss spruce insisted  red in the face .     the big chest under the baron   s bed was open .         all that is true     said tiffany     and it would appear that miss spruce was accidentally hearing for quite some time .      some of the guards sniggered  which made miss spruce even more angry  if that were possible .  she pushed her way forward .      do you deny that you were standing there with a poker and your hand on fire .     she demanded  her face as red as a turkey .      i would like to say something  please     said tiffany .     it   s rather important .     she could feel the impatient pain now  fighting to get free .  her hands felt clammy .      you were doing black magic  admit it .      tiffany took a deep breath .     i don   t know what that is     she said     but i know i am holding just above my shoulder the last pain that the baron will ever know  and i have to get rid of it soon  and i can   t get rid of it in here  what with all these people .  please .  i need an open space right now .     she pushed miss spruce out of the way and the guards swiftly stood aside for her  to the nurse   s extreme annoyance .      don   t let her go .  she will fly away .  that   s what they do .      tiffany knew the layout of the castle very well  everybody did .  there was a courtyard down some steps  and she headed there rapidly  feeling the pain stirring and unfolding .  you had to think of it as a kind of animal that you could keep at bay  but that only worked for so long .  about as long as     well  now  in fact .   the sergeant appeared beside her  and she grabbed his arm .     don   t ask me why     she managed to say through gritted teeth     but throw your helmet in the air .      he was bright enough to follow orders  and spun the helmet into the air like a soup plate .  tiffany hurled the pain after it  feeling its dreadful silkiness as it found its freedom .  the helmet stopped in midair as if it had hit an invisible wall  and dropped onto the cobblestones in a cloud of steam and bent almost in half .   the sergeant picked it up and immediately dropped it again .     it   s bloody hot .     he stared at tiffany  who was leaning against the wall and trying to catch her breath .     and you   ve been taking away pain like that every day .      she opened her eyes .     yes  but i normally get plenty of time to find somewhere to dump it .  water and rock aren   t very good  but metal is quite reliable .  don   t ask me why .  if i try to think about how it works  it doesn   t work .         and i   ve heard that you can do all kinds of tricks with fire too .     said sergeant brian admiringly .      fire is easy to work with if you keep your mind clear  but pain     pain fights back .  pain is alive .  pain is the enemy .      the sergeant gingerly attempted to reclaim his helmet  hoping that by now it was cool enough to hold .     i will have to make certain i knock the dent out of it before the boss sees it     he began .     you know what a stickler he is for smartness     oh .     he stared down at the ground .      yes     said tiffany  as kindly as she could .     it   s going to take a bit of getting used to  isn   t it .     wordlessly  she handed him her hand kerchief  and he blew his nose .      but you can take away pain     he began     so does that mean you can     .      tiffany held up a hand .     stop right there     she said .     i know what you   re going to ask  and the answer is no .  if you chopped your hand off i could probably make you forget about it until you tried to eat your dinner  but things like loss  grief and sadness .  i can   t do that .  i wouldn   t dare meddle with them .  there is something called    the soothings     and i know only one person in the world who can do that  and i   m not even going to ask her to teach me .  it   s too deep .         tiff        brian hesitated and looked around as though he expected the nurse to appear and prod him from behind again .   tiffany waited .  please don   t ask  she thought .  you   ve known me all your life .  you can   t possibly think      brian looked at her pleadingly .     did you     take anything .     his voice tailed off .      no  of course not     tiffany said .     what maggot   s got into your head .  how could you think such a thing .         dunno     said brian  flushing with embarrassment .      well  that   s all right then .         i suppose i had better make sure the young master knows     said brian after another good nose blow     but all i know is that he   s gone to the big city with his       he stopped again  embarrassed .      with his fianc  e     said tiffany determinedly .     you can say it out loud  you know .      brian coughed .     well  you see  we thought     well  we all thought that you and him were  well  you know            we have always been friends     said tiffany     and that   s all there is to it .      she felt sorry for brian  even though he too often opened his mouth before he got it attached to his brain  so she patted him on the shoulder .     look  why don   t i fly down to the big city and find him .      he almost melted with relief .     would you do that .         of course .  i can see you have a lot to do here  and it will take a load off your mind .      admittedly it will put the load on mine  she thought as she hurried away through the castle .  the news had spread .  people were standing around  crying or just looking bewildered .  the cook ran up to her just as she was leaving .     what am i to do .  i   ve got the poor soul   s dinner on the stove .         then take it off and give it to someone who needs a good dinner     said tiffany briskly .  it was important to keep her tone cool and busy .  the people were in shock .  she would be too  when she had the time  but right at this moment it was important to bounce people back into the world of the here and now .      listen to me  all of you     and her voice echoed around the big hall .     yes  your baron is dead but you still have a baron .  he will be here soon with his     lady  and you must have this place spotless for them .  you all know your jobs .  get on with them .  and remember him kindly and clean the place up for his sake .      it worked .  it always did .  a voice that sounded as if its owner knew what she was doing could get things done  especially if its owner was wearing a pointy black hat .  there was a sudden rush of activity .      i suppose you think you   ve got away with it  do you .     said a voice behind her .   tiffany waited a moment before turning round  and when she did turn round  she was smiling .     why  miss spruce     she said     are you still here .  well  perhaps there are some floors that need scrubbing .      the nurse was a vision of fury .     i do not scrub floors  you arrogant little           no  you don   t scrub anything  do you  miss spruce .  i   ve noticed that .  now  miss flowerdew  who was here before you  now she could scrub a floor .  she could scrub a floor so that you could see your face in it  although in your case  miss spruce  i can imagine why that would not appeal .  miss jumper  who we had before her  would even scrub floors with sand  white sand .  she chased dirt like a terrier chasing a fox .      the nurse opened her mouth to speak  but tiffany didn   t allow the words any space .     the cook has told me that you are a very religious woman  always on your knees  and that is fine by me  absolutely fine  but didn   t it ever occur to you to take a mop and bucket down there with you .  people don   t need prayers  miss spruce  they need you to do the job in front of you  miss spruce .  and i have had enough of you  miss spruce  and especially of your lovely white coat .  i think roland was very impressed by your wonderful white coat  but i am not  miss spruce  because you never do anything that will get it dirty .      the nurse raised a hand .     i could slap you .         no     said tiffany firmly .     you couldn   t .      the hand stayed where it was .     i have never been so insulted before in my life .     screamed the enraged nurse .      really .     said tiffany .     i   m genuinely surprised .     she turned on her heel  left the nurse standing and marched over to a young guard who had just come into the hall .     i   ve seen you around .  i don   t think i know who you are .  what   s your name  please .      the trainee guard gave what he probably thought was a salute .     preston  miss .         has the baron been taken down to the crypt  preston .         yes  miss  and i   ve took down some lanterns and some cloths and a bucket of warm water  miss .     he grinned when he saw her expression .     my grandma used to do the laying out when i was a little boy  miss .  i could help  if you wanted .         did your grandma let you help .         no  miss     said the young man .     she said men weren   t allowed to do that sort of thing unless they had a certificate in doctrine .      tiffany looked puzzled for a moment .     doctrine .         you know  miss .  doctrine  pills and potions and sawing off legs and similar .      light dawned .     oh  you mean doctoring .  i should hope not .  this isn   t about making the poor soul better .  i will do it by myself  but thank you for asking  anyway .  this is women   s work .      exactly why it is women   s work i don   t know  she said to herself as she arrived in the crypt and rolled up her sleeves .  the young guard had even thought to bring down a dish of soil and a dish of salt .    well done  your granny  she thought .  at last someone had taught a boy something useful .   she cried as she made the old man    presentable    as granny weatherwax called it .  she always cried .  it was a needful thing .  but you didn   t do it where anyone else could see  not if you were a witch .  people wouldn   t expect that .  it would make them uneasy .   she stood back .  well  the old boy looked better than he had done yesterday  she had to admit .  as a final touch  she took two pennies out of her pocket and laid them gently over his eyelids .   those were the old customs  taught to her by nanny ogg  but now there was a new custom  known only to her .  she leaned on the edge of the marble slab with one hand and held the bucket of water in the other .  she stayed there  motionless  until the water in the bucket began to boil and ice was forming on the slab .  she took the bucket outside and tipped its contents down the drain .   the castle was bustling when she had finished  and she left people to get on with things .  she hesitated as she stepped out of the castle and stopped to think .  people often didn   t stop to think .  they thought as they went along .  sometimes it was a good idea .  just to stop moving  in case you moved the wrong way .   roland was the baron   s only son and  as far as tiffany knew  his only relative  or at least his only relative who was allowed to come anywhere near the castle  after some horrible and expensive legal fighting  roland had succeeded in banishing the dreadful aunts  the baron   s sisters who  frankly  even the old baron thought were as nasty a pair of old ferrets as any man should find down the trousers of his life .  but there was another person who should know  who was in no conceivable way at all kin to the baron  but was nevertheless  well  someone who should know something as important as this  as soon as possible .  tiffany headed up to the feegle mound to see the kelda .   amber was sitting outside when tiffany arrived  doing some sewing in the sunlight .      hello  miss     she said cheerfully .     i   ll just go and tell mrs kelda that you   re here .     and with that she disappeared down the hole as easily as a snake  just as tiffany had once been able to do .   why had amber gone back there .  tiffany wondered .  she had taken her to the aching farm to be safe .  why had the girl walked up the chalk to the mound .  how had she even remembered where it was .      very interesting child  that     said a voice  and the toad   stuck his head out from under a leaf .     i must say you look extremely flustered  miss .         the old baron is dead     said tiffany .      well  only to be expected .  long live the baron     said the toad .      he   s not going to live long     said tiffany .     he   s dead .         no     croaked the toad .     it   s what you   re supposed to say .  when a king dies  you have to immediately announce that there is another king .  it   s important .  i wonder what the new one will be like .  rob anybody says that he   s a wet nelly who is not fit to lick your boots .  and has scorned you very badly .      whatever the circumstances of the past  tiffany was not going to let that go by unchallenged .     i don   t need anybody to lick anything for me  thank you very much .  anyway     she added     he   s not their baron  is he .  the feegles pride themselves on not having a lord .         you are correct in your submission     said the toad ponderously     but you must remember that they also pride themselves on having as much as possible to drink at the slightest possible excuse  which leaves them of an uncertain temper  and that the baron quite definitely believes that he is  de facto  the owner of all the property hereabouts .  a claim that stands up in law .  although i am sorry to say that i can no longer do the same .  but the girl  now  she is something strange .  haven   t you noticed .      haven   t i noticed .  tiffany thought quickly .  what should i have noticed .  amber was just a kid    she had seen her around     not so quiet as to be worrying  not so noisy as to be annoying .  and that was it .  but then she thought  the chickens .  that was strange .      she can speak feegle .     said the toad .     and i don   t mean all that crivens business  that   s just the patois .  i mean the serious old fashioned stuff that the kelda speaks  the language they spoke from wherever it was they came from before they came from there .  i am sorry  with preparation i am sure i could have made a better sentence .     he paused .     i don   t understand a word of feegle myself  but the girl seems to have just picked it up .  and another thing  i   ll swear she   s been trying to talk to me in toad .  i   m not much good at it myself  but a little bit of understanding did come with the     shape change  as it were .         are you saying that she understands unusual words .     said tiffany .      i   m not certain     said the toad .     i think she understands meaning .         are you sure .     said tiffany .     i   ve always thought she was a bit simple .         simple .     said the toad  who seemed to be enjoying himself .     well  as a lawyer i can tell you that something that looks very simple indeed can be incredibly complicated  especially if i   m being paid by the hour .  the sun is simple .  a sword is simple .  a storm is simple .  behind everything simple is a huge tail of complicated .      amber poked her head out of the hole .     mrs kelda says to meet her in the chalk pit     she said excitedly .   there was a faint cheering coming from the chalk pit as tiffany lowered herself gingerly through the careful camouflage .   she liked the pit .  it seemed impossible to be truly unhappy there  with the damp white walls cradling her and the light of the blue day pricking through the briars .  sometimes  when she was much younger  she had seen the ancient fish swimming in and out of the chalk pit  ancient fish from the time when the chalk was the land under the waves .  the water had gone long ago  but the souls of the ghost fish hadn   t noticed .  they were as armoured as knights and ancient as the chalk .  but she didn   t see them any more .  perhaps your eyesight changes as you get older  she thought .   there was a strong smell of garlic .  a large part of the bottom of the pit was full of snails .  feegles were walking carefully among them  painting numbers on their shells .  amber was sitting next to the kelda  with her hands clasped round her knees .  seen from above  it looked for all the world like a sheepdog trials  but with less barking and a lot more stickiness .   the kelda spotted tiffany  and raised a tiny finger to her lips  followed by a brief nod at amber  who was now engrossed in the proceedings .  jeannie patted the space on the other side of her  and said     we are watching the lads putting our brand on the livestock  ye ken .     there was a slight touch of strangeness to her voice .  it was the kind of voice a grown up uses when it tells a child    we are having fun  aren   t we .      in case the child hasn   t reached that conclusion yet .  but amber really did look as if she was enjoying herself .  it occurred to tiffany that being around the feegles seemed to make amber happy .   she got the impression that the kelda wanted to keep the conversation light  so she simply asked     why mark them .  who   s going to try to steal them .         other feegles  of course .  my rob reckons they will be queuing up to steal our snails while they are left unprotected  ye ken .      tiffany was mystified .     why would they be unprotected .         because my lads  ye ken  will be away stealing their livestock .  it   s an old feegle tradition  it means everyone gets in lots of fighting  rustling and stealing and  of course  the all time favourite  boozing .     the kelda winked at tiffany .     well  it keeps the lads happy  and stops them fretting and getting under our feet  ye ken .      she winked at tiffany again and patted amber on the leg  and said something to her in the language that sounded like a very old version of feegle .  amber answered in the same language .  the kelda nodded meaningfully at tiffany and pointed to the other end of the pit .      what did you just say to her .     said tiffany  looking back at the girl  who was still watching the feegles with the same smiling interest .      i told her that you and i were going to have a conversation for grown ups     said the kelda     and she just said the boys were very funny  and i don   t know how  but she has picked up the mother of tongues .  tiffany  i only use it to a daughter and the gonnagle    ye ken  and i was talking to him on the mound last night when she joined in .  she picked it up just by listening .  that shouldn   t happen .  that   s a rare gift she has  and no mistake .  she must ken the meanings in her head  and that   s magic  missy  it   s the pure quill and no mistake .         how could it happen .         who knows .     said the kelda .     it   s a gift .  and if ye take my advice  ye will set this girl to training .         isn   t she a bit too old to be starting .     said tiffany .      put her to the craft  or find some channel for her gift .  believe me  my girl  i wouldnae want ye to believe that beating a girl nigh on to death is a good thing  but who kens how our paths are chosen .  and so she ended up here  with me .  she has the gift of understandin    .  would she have found it else .  ye know full well that the meaning of life is to find your gift .  to find your gift is happiness .  never tae find it is misery .  ye said she   s a bit simple  find her a teacher who can bring out the complicated in her .  the girl learned a difficult language just by listening to it .  the world sore needs folk that can do that .      it made sense .  everything the kelda said made sense .   jeannie paused and then said     i am very sorry the baron is dead .         i   m sorry     tiffany said .     i meant to tell you .      the kelda smiled at her .     do you think a kelda would need to be told something like that  my girl .  he was a decent man  and ye did right by him .         i   ve got to go and find the new baron     said tiffany .     and i   ll need the boys to help me find him .  there   s thousands of people in the city  and the lads are very good at finding things .       she glanced up at the sky .  tiffany had never flown all the way to the big city before and didn   t much fancy flying there in the darkness .     i shall leave at first light .  but first of all  jeannie  i think i   d better take amber back home .  you   d like that  wouldn   t you  amber     she said hopelessly      three quarters of an hour later  tiffany flew her stick back down towards the village  the screams still ringing in her head .  amber wasn   t going back .  she had  in fact  made her reluctance to leave the mound abundantly clear by bracing her arms and legs in the hole and staying there screaming at the top of her voice every time tiffany gave a gentle pull  when she let go  the girl went back to sit next to the kelda .  so that was that .  you try to make plans for people  and the people make other plans .   however you looked at it  amber had parents  pretty awful parents  you might say  and you might add that that was giving them the best of it .  at least they had to know that she was safe     and in any case  what possible harm could come to amber in the care of the kelda .   mrs petty slammed the door shut when she saw that it was tiffany on the step  then opened it again almost immediately  in a flood of tears .  the place stank  not just of stale beer and bad cooking but also of helplessness and bewilderment .  a cat  the mangiest that tiffany had ever seen  was almost certainly another part of the problem .   mrs petty was frightened out of whatever wits she had and dropped to her knees on the floor  pleading incoherently .  tiffany made her a cup of tea  which was no errand for the squeamish  given that such crockery as the cottage possessed was piled up in the stone sink  which was otherwise filled with slimy water that occasionally bubbled .  tiffany spent several minutes of heavy scrubbing before she had a cup she   d care to drink from  and even then something was rattling inside the kettle .   mrs petty sat on the one chair that had all four legs and babbled about how her husband was really a good man provided his dinner was on time and amber wasn   t naughty .  tiffany had grown used to that sort of desperate conversation when she was    going round the houses    up in the mountains .  they were generated by fear     fear of what would happen to the speaker when they were left alone again .  granny weatherwax had a way of dealing with this  which was to put the fear of granny weatherwax into absolutely everyone  but granny weatherwax had had years of being  well  granny weatherwax .   careful non aggressive questioning brought news that mr petty was asleep upstairs  and tiffany simply told mrs petty that amber was being looked after by a very kind lady while she healed .  mrs petty started to cry again .  the misery of the place was getting on tiffany   s nerves too  and she tried to stop herself being cruel  but how hard was it to slosh a bucket of cold water over a stone floor and swoosh it out of the door with a broom .  how hard was it to make some soap .  you could make quite a serviceable one out of wood ash and animal fat .  and  as her mother had said once     no one is too poor to wash a window     although her father  just to annoy her mother  occasionally changed it to     no one is too poor to wash a widow .     but where could you start with this family .  and whatever it was that was in the kettle was still rattling  presumably trying to get out .   most of the women in the villages had grown up to be tough .  you needed to be tough to bring up a family on a farm labourer   s wages .  there was a local saying  a sort of recipe for dealing with a trouble some husband .  it was     tongue pie  cold barn and the copper stick .     it meant that a troublesome husband got a nagging instead of his dinner  he would be shoved out to the barn to sleep  and if he raised his hand to his wife  he might get a good wallop from the long stick every cottage had for stirring the washing in the wash tub .  they usually learned the error of their ways before the rough music played .      wouldn   t you like a short holiday away from mr petty .     tiffany suggested .   the woman  pale as a slug and skinny as a broom  looked horrified .     oh no .     she gasped .     he wouldn   t know what to do without me .      and then     it all went wrong  or rather  a lot more wrong than it was already .  and it was all so innocent  because the woman was so downcast .     well  at least i can clean your kitchen for you     tiffany said cheerfully .  it would have been fine if she had simply grabbed a broom and got to work but  oh no  she had to go and look up at the grey  cobweb filled ceiling and say     all right  i know you   re here  you always follow me  so make yourself useful and clean this kitchen thoroughly .     nothing happened for a few seconds  and then she heard  because she was listening for it  a muffled conversation from up near the ceiling .      did ye no    hear that .  she kens we is here .  how come she always gets it right .      a slightly different feegle voice said     it   s because we always follow her  ye wee dafty .         oh aye  i ken that well enough  but my point is  did we not promise faithfully not to follow her around any more .         aye  it was a solemn oath .         exactly  and so i cannae but be a wee bit disappointed that the big wee hag will nae take heed of a solemn promise .  it   s a wee bit hurtful to the feelings .         but we have broken the solemn oath  it   s a feegle thing .      a third voice said     look lively  ye scunners  it   s the tapping o    the feets .      a whirlwind hit the grubby little kitchen .    foaming water swirled across tiffany   s boots  which had indeed been tapping .  it has to be said that no one could create a mess more quickly than a party of feegles  but strangely  they could clean one up as well  without even the help of bluebirds and miscellaneous woodland creatures .   the sink emptied in an instant and filled again with soap suds .  wooden plates and tin mugs hummed through the air as the fire burst into life .  with a bang bang bang the log box filled .  after that  things speeded up  and a fork shuddered in the wall beside tiffany   s ear .  steam rose like a fog  with strange noises coming out of it  the sunlight flooded in through the suddenly clean window  filling the room with rainbows  a broom shot past pushing the last of the water in front of it  the kettle boiled  a vase of flowers appeared on the table     some of them  admittedly  upside down     and suddenly the room was fresh and clean and no longer smelled of rotted potatoes .   tiffany looked up at the ceiling .  the cat was holding onto it by all four paws .  it gave her what was definitely a look .  even a witch can be out looked by a cat that has had it up to here  and is still up here .   tiffany finally located mrs petty under the table  with her hands over her head .  when she had finally been persuaded to come out and sit down on a nice clean chair in front of a cup of tea from a wonderfully clean mug  she was very keen to agree that there had been a great improvement  although later on tiffany couldn   t help but admit that mrs petty would probably have agreed to absolutely anything if only tiffany would go away .   not a success  then  but at least the place was a whole lot cleaner and mrs petty was bound to be grateful when she   d had time to think about it .  a snarl and a thump that tiffany heard as she was leaving the ragged garden was probably the cat  parting company with the ceiling .   halfway back to the farm  carrying her broomstick over her shoulder  she thought aloud     perhaps that was a bit stupid .         dinnae fash yourself     said a voice .     if we had had the time we could have made some bread as well .     tiffany looked down  and there was rob anybody  along with half a dozen others known variously as the nac mac feegle  the wee free men and  sometimes  the defendants  the culprits  people wanted by the police to help them with their enquiries and sometimes as    that one  second on the left  i swear it was him .         you keep on following me .     she complained .     you always promise not to and you always do .         ah  but ye dinnae take into account the geas that is laid on us  ye ken .  ye are the hag o    the hills and we must always be ready to protect ye and help ye  no matter what ye say     said rob anybody stoutly .  there was a rapid shaking of heads among the other feegles  causing a fallout of bits of pencil  rats    teeth  last night   s dinner  interesting stones with holes in  beetles  promising bits of snot tucked away for leisurely examination later  and snails .      look     said tiffany     you can   t just go around helping people whether they want you to or not .      rob anybody scratched his head  put back the snail that had fallen out and said     why not  miss .  you do .         i don   t .     she said aloud  but inside an arrow struck her heart .  i wasn   t kind to mrs petty  was i .  she thought .  yes  it was true that the woman seemed to have the brains as well as the demeanour of a mouse  but filthy though it was  the stinking house was mrs petty   s house  and tiffany had burst in with a lot of  well  not to put too fine a point on it  nac mac feegles  and just messed it up  even if it was less of a mess than it had been before .  i was brusque and bossy and self righteous .  my mother could have handled it better .  if it comes to that  probably any other woman in the village could have handled it better  but i am the witch and i blundered in and blundered about and scared the wits out of her .  me  a slip of a girl with a pointy hat .   and the other thing she thought about herself was that if she didn   t actually lie down very soon  she was going to fall over .  the kelda was right  she couldn   t remember when she   d last slept in a proper bed  and there was one waiting for her at the farm .  and  she thought suddenly and guiltily  she still had to let her own parents know that amber petty was back with the feegles      there   s always something  she thought  and then there   s another something on top of the something  and then there is no end to the somethings .  no wonder witches were given broomsticks .  feet just couldn   t do it by themselves .          her mother was tending to tiffany   s brother wentworth  who had a black eye .      he   s been fighting the big boys     her mother complained .     got a black eye  didn   t we  wentworth .         yes  but i did kick billy teller in the fork .      tiffany tried to starve a yawn .     what have you been fighting for  went .  i thought you were more sensible .         they said you was a witch  tiff     said wentworth .  and tiffany   s mother turned with a strange expression on her face .      yes  well  i am     said tiffany .     that   s my job .         yeah  but i doubt you do the kind of things they said you was doing     said her brother .   tiffany met her mother   s gaze .     were these bad things .     she said .      hah .  that   s not the half of it     said wentworth .  blood and snot covered his shirt  where it had dripped from his nose .      wentworth  you go upstairs to your room     mrs aching ordered     and probably  tiffany thought  not even granny weatherwax would have been able to speak an order that was so instantly obeyed .  and so full of the implicit threat of doomsday if it was not .   when the boots of the reluctant boy had disappeared around the staircase  tiffany   s mother turned to her youngest daughter  folded her arms and said     it   s not the first time he   s been in a fight like this .         it   s all down to the picture books     said tiffany .     i   m trying to teach people that witches aren   t mad old women who go around putting spells on people .         when your dad comes in  i   ll get him to go and have a word with billy   s dad     said her mother .     billy   s a foot taller than wentworth but your dad     he   s two foot taller than billy   s dad .  there won   t be any fighting .  you know your dad .  he   s a calm man  your dad .  never seen him punch a man more than about twice  never has to .  he   ll keep people calm .  they   ll be calm or else .  but something   s not quite right  tiff .  we   re all very proud of you  you know  what you   re doing and everything  but it   s getting to people somehow .  they   re saying some ridiculous things .  and we   re having difficulties selling the cheeses .  and everybody knows you are the best at cheeses .  and now  amber petty .  you think it is right that she is running around there with     them .         i hope so  mum     said tiffany .     but the girl has a very strong mind of her own and  mum  when it comes right down to it  all i can do is the best that i can .      later that night  tiffany  dozing in her ancient bed  could hear her parents talking very quietly in the room below .  and although  of course  witches didn   t cry  she had an overwhelming urge to do so .     the soil and the salt were an ancient tradition to keep ghosts away .  tiffany had never seen a ghost  so they probably worked  but in any case they worked on the minds of people  who felt better for knowing that they were there  and once you understood that  you understood quite a lot about magic .        the toad had no other name but that of the toad and had joined the feegle clan some years previously  and found life in the mound much to be preferred over his former existence as a lawyer or  to be precise  as a lawyer who had got too smart in the presence of a fairy godmother .  the kelda had offered several times to turn him back  but he always refused .  the feegles themselves considered him the brains of the outfit since he knew words that were longer than he was .        that was to say  from tiffany   s point of view  that meant a couple of years younger than tiffany .        see glossary  page     .        she kept to herself any thought about the fact that what they were most good at finding was things that belonged to other people .  it was true  though  that the feegles could hunt like dogs  as well as drink like fish .        tiffany had earned the admiration of other witches by persuading the feegles to do chores .  the unfortunate fact was that feegles would do any chore  provided it was loud  messy and flamboyant .  and  if possible  included screams .       chapter     the coming of the cunning man    tiffany was angry at herself for oversleeping .  her mother actually had to bring her up a cup of tea .  but the kelda had been right .  she hadn   t been sleeping properly and the ancient but homely bed had just closed around her .   still  it could have been worse  she told herself as they set off .  for example  there could have been snakes on the broomstick .  the feegles had been only too glad  as rob anybody put it  to    feel the wind beneath their kilts    .  feegles were probably better than snakes  but that was only a guess .  they would do things like run from one side of the stick to the other to look at interesting things they were flying over  and on one occasion she glanced over her shoulder to see about ten of them hanging onto the back of the stick or  to put it more precisely  one of them was hanging onto the back of the stick and then one was hanging onto his heels and one was hanging onto his heels  and so on  all the way to the last feegle .  they were having fun  screaming with laughter  their kilts indeed flapping in the wind .  presumably the thrill of it made up for the danger and the lack of a view  or at least  of a view that anyone else would want to look at .   one or two actually did lose their grip on the bristles  floating away and down while waving at their brothers and making yahoo .  noises and generally treating it as a big game .  feegles tended to bounce when they hit the ground  although sometimes they damaged it a little .  tiffany wasn   t worried about their journey home  undoubtedly there would be lots of dangerous creatures prepared to jump out on a little running man  but by the time he got home there would in fact be considerably fewer of them .  actually  the feegles were     by feegle standards     pretty well behaved on the flight  and didn   t actually set fire to the broomstick until they were about twenty miles from the city  an incident heralded by daft wullie saying    whoops .     very quietly  and then guiltily trying to conceal the fact that he   d set fire to the bristles by standing in front of the blaze to hide it .      you   ve set fire to the broomstick again  haven   t you  wullie     tiffany stated firmly .     what was it that we learned last time .  we don   t light fires on the broomstick for no good reason .      the broomstick began to shake as daft wullie and his brothers tried to stamp out the flames .  tiffany searched the landscape below them for something soft and preferably wet to land on .   but it was no use getting angry with wullie  he lived in a wullie shaped world of his own .  you had to try thinking diagonally .      i just wonder  daft wullie     she said as the broomstick developed a nasty rattle     if  working together  we might find out why my broomstick is on fire .  do you think it might be something to do with the fact that you are holding a match in your hand .      the feegle looked at the match as if he had never seen one before  and then put it behind his back and stared at his feet  which was quite brave of him in the circumstances .     don   t really know  miss .         you see     said tiffany as the wind whipped around them     without enough bristles i can   t steer very well  and we are losing height but still regrettably going quite fast .  perhaps you could help me with this conundrum  wullie .      daft wullie stuck his little finger in his ear and wiggled it about as if rummaging in his own brain .  then he brightened up .     should we no    land  miss .      tiffany sighed .     i would like to do that  daft wullie  but  you see  we are going quite fast and the ground is not .  what we have in those circumstances is what they call a crash .         i wasnae considering that ye should land in the dirt  miss     said wullie .  he pointed down  and added     i was just considering that ye might like to land on that .      tiffany followed the line of his pointing finger .  there was a long white road below them  and on it  not too far ahead  was something oblong  moving almost as fast as the broomstick itself .  she stared  listening to her brain calculating  and then said     we will still have to lose some speed         and that was how a smouldering broomstick carrying one terrified witch and about two dozen of the nac mac feegles  holding their kilts out to slow themselves down  landed on the roof of the lancre to ankh morpork parcel express .   the coach had good springs and the driver got the horses back under control quite quickly .  there was silence as he climbed down from his seat  while white dust began to settle back on the road .  he was a heavy looking man who winced at every step  and in one hand he held a half eaten cheese sandwich and in the other an unmistakable length of lead pipe .  he sniffed .     my supervisor will have to be told .  damage to paintwork  see .  got to do a report when it   s damage to paintwork .  i hate reports  never been a man what words come to with ease .  got to do it  though  when it   s damage to paintwork .     the sandwich and  more importantly  the lead pipe disappeared back into his very large overcoat  and tiffany was amazed at how happy she felt about that .      i really am very sorry     she said as the man helped her down from the coach roof .      it   s not me  you understand  it   s the paintwork .  i tell them  look  i tell them there   s trolls  there   s dwarfs  huh  and you know how they drive  eyes half closed most of the time    cause of them not liking the sun .      tiffany sat still as he inspected the damage and then looked up at her and noticed the pointy hat .      oh     he said flatly .     a witch .  first time for everything  i suppose .  do you know what i   m carrying in here  miss .      what could be the worst thing .  tiffany thought .  she said     eggs .         hah     said the man .     that we should be so lucky .  it   s mirrors  miss .  one mirror  in point of fact .  not a flat one  either  it   s a ball  they tell me .  it   s all packed up very snug and sound  or so they say  not knowing that somebody was going to drop out of the sky on it .     he didn   t sound angry  just worn out  as if he permanently expected the world to hand him the dirty end of the stick .     it was made by the dwarfs     he added .     they say it cost more than a thousand ankh morpork dollars  and you know what it   s for .  to hang up in a dance hall in the city  where they intend to dance the waltz  which a well brought up young lady such as you should not know about  on account of the fact  it says in the paper  that it leads to depravity and goings on .         my word .     said tiffany  thinking that something like this was expected of her .      well  i suppose i   d better go and see what the damage is     said the driver  laboriously opening the back of the coach .  a large box filled quite a lot of the space .     it   s mostly packed with straw     he said .     give me a hand to get it down  will you .  and if it tinkles  we   re both in trouble .      it turned out not to be as heavy as tiffany expected .  nevertheless  they lowered it gently onto the road and the coachman rummaged among the straw inside  bringing out the mirror ball  holding it aloft like a rare jewel which  indeed  it resembled .  it filled the world with sparkling light  dazzling the eyes and sending beams of flashing rays across the landscape .  and at this point the man screamed in pain and dropped the ball  which shattered into a million pieces  filling the sky just for a moment with a million images of tiffany  while he  curling up  landed on the road  raising more white dust and making little whimpering noises as the glass dropped around him .   in slightly less than an instant  the moaning man was surrounded by a ring of feegles  armed to whatever teeth they still possessed with claymores  more claymores  bludgeons  axes  clubs and at least one more claymore .  tiffany had no idea where they had been hiding  a feegle could hide behind a hair .      don   t hurt him     she shouted .     he wasn   t going to hurt me .  he   s very ill .  but make yourselves useful and tidy up all this broken glass .     she crouched down in the road and held the man   s hand .     how long have you had jumping bones  sir .         oh  i   ve been a martyr to them these past twenty years  miss  a martyr     the coachman moaned .     it   s the jolting of the coach  you see .  it   s the suspenders     they don   t work .  i don   t think i get more than just one decent night   s sleep in five  miss  and that   s the truth  i have a little snooze  turn over  like you do  and there   s this little click and then it   s agony  believe me .      except for a few dots on the edge of sight  there was no one else around apart from  of course  for a bunch of nac mac feegles who  against all common sense  had perfected the art of hiding behind one another .      well  i think i may be able to help you     tiffany said .   some witches used a shambles to see into the present  and  with any luck  into the future as well .  in the smoky gloom of the feegle mound  the kelda was practising what she called the hiddlins     the things you did and passed on but  on the whole  passed them on as a secret .  and she was acutely aware of amber watching with clear interest .  a strange child  she thought .  she sees  she hears  she understands .  what would we give for a world full of people like her .  she had set up the cauldron   and lit a small fire underneath the leather .   the kelda closed her eyes  concentrated and read the memories of all the keldas who had ever been and would ever be .  millions of voices floated through her brain in no particular order  sometimes soft  never very loud  often tantalizingly beyond her reach .  it was a wonderful library of information  except that all the books were out of order and so were all the pages  and there wasn   t an index anywhere .  she had to follow threads that faded as she listened .  she strained as small sounds  tiny glimpses  stifled cries  currents of meaning pulled her attention this way and that     and there it was  in front of her as if it had always been there  coming into focus .   she opened her eyes  stared at the ceiling for a moment  and said     i look for the big wee hag and what is it that i see .      she peered forward into the mists of memories old and new  and jerked her head back  nearly knocking over amber  who said  with interest     a man with no eyes .         well  i think i may be able to help you  mr  er            carpetlayer  miss .  william glottal carpetlayer .         carpetlayer .     said tiffany .     but you   re a coachman .         yes  well  there   s a funny story attached to that  miss .  carpetlayer  you see  is my family name .  we don   t know how we got it because  you see  none of us have ever laid a carpet .      tiffany gave him a kind little smile .     and     .      mr carpetlayer gave her a puzzled look .     and what .  that was the funny story .     he started to laugh  and screamed again as a bone jumped .      oh yes     said tiffany .     sorry i   m a bit slow .     she rubbed her hands together .     and now  sir  i will sort out your bones .      the coach horses watched with quiet interest as she helped the man up  lending a hand as he took off his huge overcoat  with many a grunt and minor scream  and stood him so that his hands rested on the coach .   tiffany concentrated  feeling the man   s back through his thin vest and     yes  there it was  a jumping bone .   she stepped across to the horses  whispering a word into each fly flicking ear  just to be on the safe side .  then she went back to mr carpetlayer  who was waiting obediently  not daring to move .  as she rolled up her sleeves  he said     you   re not going to turn me into anything unnatural  are you  miss .  i wouldn   t want to be a spider .  mortally afraid of spiders  and all my clothes are made for a man with two legs .         why in the world would you think i   d turn you into anything  mr  carpetlayer .     said tiffany  gently running her hand down his spine .      well  saving your honour   s presence  miss  i thought that   s what witches do  miss     nasty things  miss  earwigs and all that .         who told you that .         can   t rightly say     said the coachman .     it   s just sort of     you know  what everybody knows .      tiffany placed her fingers carefully  found the jumping bone  said     this might smart a little     and pushed the bone back into place .  the coachman screamed again .   his horses tried to bolt  but their legs were not doing business as usual  not with the word still ringing in their ears .  tiffany had felt ashamed at the time  a year ago  when she had acquired the knowing of the horseman   s word  but then again  the old blacksmith she had helped to his death  with kindness and without pain  well  he had felt ashamed that he had nothing with which to pay her for her painstaking work  and you had to pay the witch  the same as you had to pay the ferryman  and so he had whispered into her ear the horseman   s word  which gave you the control of any horse that heard it .  you couldn   t buy it  you couldn   t sell it  but you could give it away and still keep it  and even if it   d been made of lead it would have been worth its weight in gold .  the former owner had whispered in her ear     i promised to tell no man the word  and i ain   t .     and he was chuckling as he died  his sense of humour being somewhat akin to that of mr carpetlayer .   mr carpetlayer was also pretty heavy  and had slipped gently down the side of the coach and        why are you torturing that old man  you evil witch .  can you not see that he   s in dreadful pain .      where had he come from .  a shouting man  his face white with fury  his clothes as dark as an unopened cave or     and the word came to tiffany suddenly     as a crypt .  there had been no one around  she was sure of it  and no one on either side except the occasional farmer watching the stubbles burn as they cleared the land .   but his face was now a few inches from hers .  and he was real  not some kind of monster  because monsters don   t usually have little blobs of spittle on their lapel .  and then she noticed     he stank .  she   d never smelled anything so bad .  it was physical  like an iron bar  and it seemed to her that she wasn   t smelling it with her nose  but with her mind .  a foulness that made the average privy as fragrant as a rose .      i   m asking you politely to step back  please     said tiffany .     i think you might have got hold of the wrong idea .         i assure you  fiendish creature  that i have only the right idea .  and that is to return you to the miserable and stinking hell from which you spawned .      all right  a madman  thought tiffany  but if he     too late .  the man   s waggling finger got too close to her nose  and suddenly the empty road contained a lifetime   s supply of nac mac feegles .  the man in black flailed at them  but that sort of thing does not work very well with a feegle .  he did manage  despite the feegle onslaught  to shout     be gone  nefarious imps .      every feegle head turned hopefully when they heard this .     oh aye     said rob anybody .     if there   s any imps aboot  we are the boys to deal with them .  your move  mister .     they leaped at him and ended up in a heap on the road behind him  having passed straight through .  they automatically punched one another as they staggered up  on the basis that if you   re having a good fight you don   t want to spoil the rhythm .   the man in black glanced at them and then paid them no attention whatsoever .   tiffany stared down at the man   s boots .  they gleamed in the sunlight  and that was wrong .  she had been standing in the dust of the road for only a few minutes and her boots were grey .  and there was the ground that the man was standing on  and that was wrong too .  very wrong  on a hot  cloudless day .  she glanced at the horses .  the word was holding them  but they were trembling with fear  like rabbits in the gaze of a fox .  then she closed her eyes and looked at him with first sight  and saw .  and said     you cast no shadow .  i knew something wasn   t right .      and now she looked directly into the man   s eyes  almost hidden under the wide hat brim and     he     had     no eyes .  the understanding dawned on her like ice melting     no eyes at all  not ordinary eyes  not blind eyes  no eye sockets     just two holes in his head  she could see right through to the smouldering fields beyond .  she didn   t expect what happened next .   the man in black glared at her again and hissed     you are the witch .  you are the one .  wherever you go  i will find you .      and then he vanished  leaving only a pile of fighting feegles in the dust .   tiffany felt something on her boot .  she looked down  and a hare  which must have fled the burning stubbles  stared back at her .  they held each other   s gaze for a second  and then the hare jumped into the air like a leaping salmon and headed off across the road .  the world is full of omens and signs  and a witch did indeed have to pick the ones that were important .  where could she begin here .   mr carpetlayer was still slumped against the coach  totally ignorant of what had just happened .  so was tiffany in a way  but she would find out .  she said     you can get up again now  mr carpetlayer .      he did so very gingerly  grimacing as he waited for the lightning strokes of agony all down his back .  he shifted experimentally  and gave a little jump in the dust  as if he was squashing an ant .  that seemed to work  and he tried a second jump and then  throwing his arms out wide  he shouted    yippee .     and spun like a ballerina .  his hat fell off and his hobnailed boots smacked into the dust and mr carpetlayer was a very happy man as he twirled and hopped  very nearly turned a cartwheel  and when it turned out to be about half a cartwheel  he rolled back onto his feet  picked up the astonished tiffany and danced her along the road  shouting     one two three  one two three  one two three     until she managed to shake herself loose  laughing .     me and the wife is going to go out tonight  young lady  and we are going to go waltzing .         but i thought that led to depraved behaviour .     said tiffany .   the coachman winked at her .     well  we can but hope .     he said .      you don   t want to overdo it  mr carpetlayer     she warned .      as a matter of fact  miss  i rather think i do  if it   s all the same to you .  after all the creaking and groaning and not sleeping hardly at all  i think i would like to overdo it a little  or if possible a lot .  oh  what a good girl to think of the horses     he added .     that shows a kind nature .         i am pleased to see you in such fine spirits  mr carpetlayer .      the coachman did a little twirl in the middle of the road .     i feel twenty years younger .     he beamed at her  and then his face clouded just a little .     er     how much do i owe you .         how much will the damage to the paintwork cost me .     said  tiffany .   they looked at one another  and then mr carpetlayer said     well  i can   t ask you for anything  miss  given that it was me that busted the mirror ball .      a little tinkling sound made tiffany look behind them  where the mirror ball  apparently unharmed  was spinning gently and  if you looked carefully  just above the dirt .   she knelt down on a road totally free of broken glass and said  apparently to nothing at all     did you stick it back together again .         oh aye     said rob anybody happily from behind the ball .      but it was smashed to smithereens .         oh aye  but a smithereen is easy  ye ken .  see  the tinier bits are  the more they all fit together again .  ye just hae to give them a little push and the wee molly cules remembers where they should be and they sticks together again  nae problemo .  ye dinnae have to act surprised  we dinnae just smash things .      mr carpetlayer stared at her .     did you do that  miss .         well  sort of     said tiffany .      well i should say so .     said carpetlayer  all smiles .     so i says quid pro quo  give and take  knock for knock  tit for tat  one thing for another  an eye for an eye and me for you .     he winked .     i   ll say it worked out even  and the company can put their paperwork where the monkey put his jumper     what you say to that  eh .     he spat on his hand and held it out .   oh dear  thought tiffany  a handshake with spit seals an unbreakable accord  thank goodness i have a reasonably clean handkerchief .   she nodded speechlessly .  and there had been a broken ball  and now it appeared to have mended itself .  the day was hot  a man with holes where his eyes should be had vanished into nothing     where would you even begin .  some days you trimmed toenails  removed splinters and sewed up legs  and some days were days like this .   they shook hands  rather damply  the broomstick was shoved among the bundles behind the driver  tiffany climbed up alongside him  and the journey continued  dust rising up from the road as it passed and forming strangely unpleasant shapes until it settled down again .   after a while mr carpetlayer said  in a careful kind of voice     er  that black hat you   ve got on  are you going to carry on wearing it .         that   s right .         only  well  you are wearing a nice green dress and  if i may say so  your teeth are lovely and white .     the man seemed to be wrestling with a problem .      i clean them with soot and salt every day .  i can recommend it     said tiffany .   it was turning into a difficult conversation .  the man seemed to reach a conclusion .     so you are not really a witch then .     he said hopefully .      mr carpetlayer  are you scared of me .         that   s a scary question  miss .      actually it is  tiffany thought .  aloud  she said     look  mr carpetlayer  what   s this all about .         well  miss  since you ask  there have been some stories lately .  you know  about babies being stolen  that sort of thing .  kids running off and that .     he brightened up a bit .     still  i expect those were wicked old     you know  with  like  hooked noses  warts and evil black dresses     not nice girls like you .  yes  that   s just the sort of thing they would do .     having sorted out that conundrum to his satisfaction  the coachman said little for the rest of the journey  although he did whistle a lot .   tiffany  on the other hand  sat quietly .  for one thing  she was now very worried  and for another thing she could just about hear the voices of the feegles back among the mail bags  reading other people   s letters to each other .    she had to hope that they were putting them back in the right envelopes .   the song went     ankh morpork .  it   s a wonderful town .  the trolls are up and the dwarfs are down .  slightly better than living in a hole in the ground .  ankh morpork .  it   s a wonderfuuuuuulllll townnn .      it wasn   t  really .   tiffany had only been there once before and didn   t like the big city very much .  it stank  and there were too many people  and far too many places .  and the only green was on the surface of the river  which could only be called mud because a more accurate word would not have been printable .   the coachman pulled up outside one of the main gates  even though they were open .      if you take my advice  miss  you   ll take your hat off and walk in by yourself .  that broomstick looks like firewood now  in any case .     he gave her a nervous grin .     best of luck  miss .         mr carpetlayer     she said loudly  aware of people around her .     i do hope that when you hear people talk about witches  you will mention that you met one and she made your back better     and  may i suggest  saved your livelihood .  thank you for the ride .         oh well  i   ll definitely tell people i met one of the good ones     he said .   with her head held high  or at least as high as is appropriate when you are carrying your own damaged broomstick over your shoulder  tiffany walked into the city .  the pointy hat got one or two glances  and perhaps a couple of frowns  but mostly people didn   t look at her at all  in the country  everyone you meet is someone you know or a stranger worth investigating  but here it seemed there were so many people that it was a waste of time even to look at them at all  and possibly dangerous in any case .   tiffany bent down .     rob  you know roland  the baron   s son .         ach  the wee streak o    nothing     said rob anybody .      well  nevertheless     said tiffany     i know you can find people and i would like you to go and find him for me now please .         would you no    mind if we had just the one wee drink while we are looking .     said rob anybody .     a man could drown o    thirst around here .  i can   t remember a time when i wasn   t bogging for a wee dram or ten .      tiffany knew that it would be foolish to say either yes or no and settled for     just the one then .  when you   ve found him .      there was the faintest of whooshing noises behind her  and no more feegles .  still  they would be easy to find  you just had to listen for breaking glass .  oh yes  breaking glass that repaired itself .  another mystery  she had looked at the mirror ball very carefully as they put it back in its box  and there hadn   t been even a scratch on it .   she glanced up at the towers of unseen university  crammed with wise men in pointy hats  or at least men in pointy hats  but there was another address  well known to witches  which was in its own way just as magical  boffo   s joke emporium  number four  tenth egg street .  she had never been there  but she did get a catalogue occasionally .   people started to notice her more when she got off the main streets and made her way through the neighbourhoods  and she could feel eyeballs on her as she walked over the cobbles .  people weren   t angry or unfriendly as such .  they were just     watching  as if wondering what to make of her  and she had to hope that it was not  for example  stew .   there wasn   t a bell on the door of boffo   s joke emporium .  there was a whoopee cushion  and for most of the people who came to buy things in the emporium  a whoopee cushion  perhaps in conjunction with a generous dollop of fake sick  was the last word in entertainment  which indeed it is  unfortunately .   but real witches often needed boffo too .  there were times when you had to look like a witch  and not every witch was good at it and was just too busy to get her hair in a mess .  so boffo   s was where you bought your fake warts and wigs  stupidly heavy cauldrons and artificial skulls .  and  with any luck  you might get the address of a dwarf who could help you repair your broomstick .   tiffany stepped inside and admired the deep throated farting of the whoopee cushion  pushed her way round and more or less through a ludicrous fake skeleton with glowing red eyes  and reached the counter  at which point somebody blew a squeaker at her .  it disappeared  to be replaced by the face of a small  worried looking man  who said     did you by any chance find that even remotely amusing .      his voice suggested that he expected the answer to be    no    and tiffany saw no reason to disappoint him .     absolutely not     she said .   the man sighed and pushed the unfunny squeaker down the counter .     alas  no one ever does     he said .     i   m sure i   m doing something wrong somewhere .  oh well  what can i do for you  miss   oh     you are a real one  aren   t you .  i can always tell  you know .         look     said tiffany     i   ve never ordered anything from you  but i used to work with miss treason  who         but the man wasn   t listening to her .  instead he was shouting at a hole in the floor .     mother .  we   ve got a real one .      a few seconds later  a voice by tiffany   s ear said     derek is sometimes mistaken and you might have found the broomstick .  you are a witch  aren   t you .  show me .      tiffany vanished .  she did it without thinking     or  rather  thinking so fast that her thoughts had no time to wave to her as they flashed by .  only when the man  who was apparently derek  was staring open mouthed at nothing at all did she realize that she had faded into the foreground so quickly because disobeying that voice behind her would definitely be an unwise thing to do .  a witch was standing behind her  most definitely a witch  and a skilled one too .      very good     said the voice approvingly .     very good indeed  young woman .  i can still see you  of course  because i was watching very carefully .  my word  a real one .         i   m going to turn round  you know     tiffany warned .      i don   t recall saying that you couldn   t  my dear .      tiffany turned round and was faced with the witch of nightmares  battered hat  wart encrusted nose  claw like hands  blackened teeth and     tiffany looked down     oh yes  big black boots .  you did not have to be very familiar with boffo   s catalogue to see that the speaker was wearing the full range of cosmetics in the    hag in a hurry    range     because you   re worthless      .      i think we should continue this conversation in my workshop     said the horrible hag  disappearing into the floor .     just stand on the trapdoor when it comes back up  will you .  make some coffee  derek .      when tiffany arrived in the basement  the trapdoor working wonderfully smoothly  she found what you would expect in the workshop of the company that made everything needed by a witch who felt she needed some boffo in her life .  rows of rather scary hag masks were hanging on a line  benches were full of brightly coloured bottles  racks of warts had been laid out to dry  and various things that went bloop were doing so in a big cauldron by the fireplace .  it was a proper cauldron too .     the horrible hag was working at a bench  and there was a terrible cackle .  she turned round  holding a small square wooden box with a piece of string sticking out of it .     first class cackle  don   t you think .  a simple thread and resin arrangement with a sounding board because  quite frankly  cackling is a bit of a pain in the neck  don   t you think .  i believe i can make it work by clockwork too .  let me know when you   ve seen the joke .         who are you .     tiffany burst out .   the hag had put the box on her workbench .     oh dear     she said     where are my manners .         i don   t know     said tiffany  who was getting a bit fed up .     perhaps the clockwork has run down .      the hag grinned a black toothed grin .     ah  sharpness .  i like that in a witch  but not too much .     she held out a claw .     mrs proust .      the claw was less clammy than tiffany had expected .     tiffany aching     she said .     how do you do .     feeling that something further was expected of her  tiffany added     i used to work with miss treason .         oh yes  a fine witch     said mrs proust .     and a good customer .  very keen on her warts and skulls  as i recall .     she smiled .     and since i doubt that you want to get hagged up for a girls    night out  i must assume you need my help .  the fact that your broomstick has about half the bristles needed for aerodynamic stability confirms my initial surmise .  incidentally  have you seen the joke yet .      what should she say .     i think so            go on then .         i   m not going to say until i   m sure     said tiffany .      very wise     said mrs proust .     well  let   s get your broomstick mended  shall we .  it will mean a little stroll  and if i was you i would leave your black hat behind .      instinctively tiffany grabbed at the brim of her hat .     why .      mrs proust frowned  causing her nose to very nearly catch her chin .     because you might find     no  i know what we can do .     she rummaged on the workbench and  without asking any permission  stuck something on tiffany   s hat  right at the back .     there     she said .     no one will take any notice now .  sorry  but witches are a little bit unpopular at the moment .  let   s get that stick of yours repaired as soon as possible  just in case you need to leave in a hurry .      tiffany pulled off her hat and looked at what mrs proust had stuck in the hat band .  it was a brightly coloured piece of cardboard on a string and it said  apprentice witch hat with evil glitter .  size   .  price  am   .    .  boffo .  a name to conjure with .  .  .      what   s all this .     she demanded .     you   ve even sprinkled evil glitter on it .         it   s a disguise     said mrs proust .      what .  do you think any self respecting witch would walk down the street wearing a hat like this .     said tiffany angrily .      of course not     said mrs proust .     the best disguise for a witch is a rather cheap witch   s outfit .  would a real witch buy clothes from a shop that also does a pretty good trade in naughty fido jokes  indoor fireworks  laughable pantomime wigs and     our best and most profitable line     giant inflatable pink willies  suitable for hen nights .  that would be unthinkable .  it   s boffo  my dear  pure  unadulterated boffo .  disguise  subterfuge and misdirection are our watchwords .  all watchwords .  and  amazing value for money  they   re our watchwords too .  no refunds under any circumstances  they   re important watchwords .  as is our policy of dealing terminally with shoplifters .  oh  and we also have a watchword about people smoking in the shop  although that   s not a very important word .         what .     said tiffany who  out of shock  had not heard the list of watchwords because she was staring at the pink    balloons    hanging from the ceiling .     i thought they were piglets .      mrs proust patted her hand .     welcome to life in the big city  my dear .  shall we go .         why are witches so unpopular at the moment .     asked tiffany .      it   s amazing the ideas people get into their heads sometimes     said mrs proust .     generally speaking  i find it best just to keep your head down and wait until the problem goes away .  you just need to be careful .      and tiffany thought that she did indeed need to be careful .     mrs proust     she said .     i think i know the joke by now .         yes  dear .         i thought you were a real witch disguising herself as a fake witch            yes  dear .     said mrs proust  her voice like treacle .      which would be quite amusing  but i think there   s another joke  and it   s not really very funny .         oh  and what would that be  dear .     said mrs proust in a voice which now had sugary gingerbread cottages in it .   tiffany took a deep breath .     that really is your face  isn   t it .  the masks you sell are masks of you .         well spotted .  well spotted  my dear .  only  you didn   t spot it exactly  did you .  you felt it  when you shook hands with me .  and   but come on now  we   ll get your broomstick over to those dwarfs .      when they stepped outside  the first thing tiffany saw was a couple of boys .  one of them was poised to throw a stone at the shop window .  he spotted mrs proust and a sort of dreadful silence descended .  then the witch said     throw it  my lad .      the boy looked at her as if she was mad .      i said throw it  my lad  or the worst will happen .      clearly assuming now that she was mad  the boy threw the stone  which the window caught and threw back at him  knocking him to the ground .  tiffany saw it .  she saw the glass hand come out of the glass and catch the stone .  she saw it throw the stone back .  mrs proust leaned over the boy  whose friend had taken to his heels  and said     hmm  it will heal .  it won   t if i ever see you again .     she turned to tiffany .     life can be very difficult for the small shopkeeper     she said .     come on  it   s this way .      tiffany was a bit nervous about how to continue the conversation and so she opted for something innocent  like     i didn   t know there were any real witches in the city .         oh  there   s a few of us     said mrs proust .     doing our bit  helping people when we can .  like that little lad back there  who will now have learned to mind his own business and it does my heart good to think that i may have dissuaded him from a lifetime of vandalism and disrespect for other people   s property that would  you mark my words  have resulted in him getting a new collar courtesy of the hangman .         i didn   t know you could be a witch in the city     said tiffany .     i was told once that you need good rock to grow witches  and everyone says the city is built on slime and mud .         and masonry     said mrs proust gleefully .     granite and marble  chert and miscellaneous sedimentary deposits  my dear tiffany .  rocks that once leaped and flowed when the world was born in fire .  and do you see the cobbles on the streets .  surely every single one of them  at some time  has had blood on it .  everywhere you look  stone and rock .  everywhere you can   t see  stone and rock .  can you imagine what it feels like to reach down with your bones and feel the living stones .  and what did we make from the stone .  palaces  and castles and mausoleums and gravestones  and fine houses  and city walls  oh my .  not just in this city either .  the city is built on itself  all the cities that came before .  can you imagine how it feels to lie down on an ancient flagstone and feel the power of the rock buoying you up against the tug of the world .  and it   s mine to use  all of it  every stone of it  and that   s where witchcraft begins .  the stones have life  and i   m part of it .         yes     said tiffany .     i know .      suddenly mrs proust   s face was a few inches from hers  the fearsome hooked nose almost touching her own  the dark eyes ablaze .  granny weatherwax could be fearsome  but at least granny weatherwax was  in her way  handsome  mrs proust was the evil witch from the fairy stories  her face a curse  her voice the sound of the oven door slamming on the children .  the sum of all night time fears  filling the world .      oh  you know  do you  little witch in your jolly little dress .  what is it that you know .  what is it that you really know .     she took a step back  and blinked .     more than i suspected  as it turns out     she said  relaxing .     land under wave .  in the heart of the chalk  the flint .  yes  indeed .      tiffany had never seen dwarfs on the chalk  but up in the mountains they were always around  generally with a cart .  they bought  and they sold  and for witches they made broomsticks .  very expensive broomsticks .  on the other hand  witches seldom ever bought one .  they were heirlooms  passed down the generations from witch to witch  sometimes needing a new handle  sometimes needing new bristles  but  of course  always remaining the same broomstick .   tiffany   s stick had been left to her by miss treason .  it was uncomfortable and not very fast and had the occasional habit of going backwards when it rained  and when the dwarf who was in charge of the clanging  echoing workshop saw it  he shook his head and made a sucking noise through his teeth  as if the sight of the thing had really spoiled his day  and he might have to go away and have a little cry .      well  it   s elm  isn   t it     he said to an uncaring world in general .     it   s a lowland wood  your elm  heavy and slow  and of course there   s your beetles to consider .  very prone to beetles  your elm .  struck by lightning  was it .  not a good wood for lightning  your elm .  attracts it  so they say .  tendency to owls as well .      tiffany nodded and tried to look knowledgeable  she had made up the lightning strike  because the truth  while a valuable thing  was just too stupid  embarrassing and unbelievable .   another  and almost identical  dwarf materialized behind his colleague .     should have gone for ash .         oh yes     said the first dwarf gloomily .     can   t go wrong with ash .     he prodded tiffany   s broomstick and sighed again .      looks like it   s got the start of bracket fungus in the base joint     the second dwarf suggested .      wouldn   t be surprised at anything  with your elm     said the first dwarf .      look  can you just patch it up enough to get me home .     tiffany asked .      oh  we don   t    patch things up        said the first dwarf loftily or  rather  metaphorically loftily .     we do a bespoke service .         i just need a few bristles     said tiffany desperately  and then  because she forgot she hadn   t been going to admit to the truth     please .  it wasn   t my fault the feegles set fire to the broomstick .      up until that point  there had been quite a lot of background noises in the dwarf workshop as dozens of dwarfs had been working away on their own benches and not taking much heed of the discussion  but now there was a silence  and in that silence a single hammer dropped to the floor .   the first dwarf said     when you say feegles  you don   t mean nac mac feegles  do you  miss .         that   s right .         the wild ones .  do they say     crivens  .     he asked very slowly .      practically all the time     said tiffany .  she thought she ought to make things clear and added     they are my friends .         oh  are they .     said the dwarf .     and are any of your little friends here at this moment .         well  i told them to go and find a young man of my acquaintance     said tiffany     but they are probably in a pub by now .  are there many pubs in the city .      the two dwarfs looked at one another .     about three hundred  i should say     said the second dwarf .      that many .     said tiffany .     then i don   t expect they   ll come looking for me for at least half an hour .      and suddenly the first dwarf was all frantic good humour .     well  where are our manners .     he said .     anything for a friend of mrs proust .  tell you what  it will be our pleasure to give you our express service gratis and for nothing  including free bristles and creosote at no charge whatsoever .         express service meaning you leave straight away afterwards     said the second dwarf flatly .  he took off his iron helmet  wiped the sweat off the inside with his handkerchief and put it back on his head quickly .      oh yes  indeed     said the first dwarf .     right away  that   s what express means .         friends with the feegles  are you .     said mrs proust as the dwarfs hurried to deal with tiffany   s broomstick .     they don   t have many  i understand .  but talking of friends     she continued in a suddenly chatty tone     you did meet derek  didn   t you .  he   s my son  you know .  i met his father in a dance hall with very bad lighting .  mr proust was a very kind man who was always gracious enough to say that kissing a lady without warts was like eating an egg without salt .  he passed on twenty five years ago  of the crisms .  i am very sorry i couldn   t help him .     her face brightened .     but i   m glad to say that young derek is the joy of my        she hesitated        middle age .  a wonderful lad  my dear .  it   s going to be some lucky girl who takes her chance on young derek  i can tell you .  he   s totally devoted to his work and pays such attention to detail .  do you know  he tunes all the whoopee cushions every morning and frets if any of them are wrong .  and conscientious .  when we were developing our forth coming    pearls of the pavement    hilarious artificial dog poo collection  he must have spent weeks following just about every type of dog in the city with a notebook  a scoop and a colour chart  just to get everything exactly right .  a very meticulous lad  clean in his ways  with all his own teeth .  and very careful about his company        she gave tiffany a hopeful but rather sheepish look .     this isn   t working  is it .         oh dear  did it show .     said tiffany .      i heard the spill words     said mrs proust .      what   s a spill word .         you don   t know .  a spill word is a word that somebody almost says  but doesn   t .  for a moment they hover in the conversation but aren   t spoken     and may i say that in the case of my son derek  it is as well that you didn   t say them aloud .         i   m really very sorry     said tiffany .      yes  well  be told     said mrs proust .   five minutes later  they walked out of the workshop with tiffany towing a fully functional broomstick behind her .      actually     said mrs proust as they walked     now i come to think about it  your feegles remind me a lot of wee mad arthur .  tough as nails and about the same size .  haven   t heard him say    crivens     though .  he   s a policeman in the watch .         oh dear  the feegles really don   t like policemen     said tiffany  but she felt she ought to balance this somewhat  so she added     but they are very loyal  mostly helpful  good natured in the absence of alcohol  honourable for a given value of honour and  after all  they did introduce the deep fried stoat to the world .         what   s a stoat .     said mrs proust .      well  er     you know a weasel .  it   s very much like a weasel .      mrs proust raised her eyebrows .     my dear  i treasure my ignorance of stoats and weasels .  sounds like countryside stuff to me .  can   t abide countryside .  too much green makes me feel bilious     she said  giving tiffany   s dress a shuddering glance .   at which point  on some celestial cue  there was a distant cry of    crivens .     followed by the ever popular sound  at least to a feegle  of breaking glass .      a message from the author  not all cauldrons are metal .  you can boil water in a leather cauldron  if you know what you are doing .  you can even make tea in a paper bag if you are careful and know how to do it .  but please don   t  or if you do  don   t tell anyone i told you .        jeannie  a modern kelda  had encouraged literacy among her sons and brothers .  with rob anybody   s example to follow  they had found the experience very worthwhile  because now they could read the labels on bottles before they drank them  although this didn   t make too much of a difference  because unless there was a skull and crossbones on it  a feegle would probably drink it anyway  and even then it would have to be a very scary skull and crossbones .        most people who cook with cauldrons use them as a kind of double boiler  with small saucepans filled with water around the edge  picking up the heat of the big cauldron into which perhaps you might put a leg of pork weighted down  and possibly a few dumplings in a bag .  this way  quite a large meal for several people can be cooked quite cheaply all in one go  including the pudding .  of course  it meant you had to stomach a lot of boiled food     but eat it up  it   s good for you .       chapter     songs in the night    when tiffany and mrs proust got to the source of the shouting  the street was already covered with a rather spectacular layer of broken glass  and worried looking men with armour and the kind of helmet that you could eat your soup out of in an emergency .  one of them was putting up barricades .  other watchmen were clearly unhappy about being on the wrong side of the barricades  especially since at that moment an extremely large watchman came flying out of one of the pubs that occupied almost all of one side of the street .  the sign on it proclaimed it to be the king   s head  but by the look of it  the king   s head now had a headache .   the watchman took what remained of the glass with him  and when he landed on the pavement  his helmet  which could have held enough soup for a large family and all their friends  rolled off down the street making a gloing .  gloing .  noise .   tiffany heard another watchman shout     they got sarge .      as more watchmen came running from both ends of the street  mrs proust tapped tiffany on the shoulder and said sweetly     tell me again about their good points  will you .      i   m here to find a boy and tell him that his father is dead  said tiffany to herself .  not to pull the feegles out of yet another scrape .      their hearts are in the right place     she said .      i don   t doubt it     said mrs proust  who looked as though she was enjoying herself no end     but their arses are on a pile of broken glass .  oh  here come the reinforcements .         i don   t think they will do much good     said tiffany     and to her surprise turned out to be wrong .   the guards were fanning out now  leaving a clear path to the pub entrance  tiffany had to look hard to see a small figure walking purposely along it .  it looked like a feegle  but it was wearing     she stopped and stared     yes  it was wearing a watchman   s helmet slightly bigger than the top of a salt cellar  which was unthinkable .  a legal feegle .  how could there be such a thing .   nevertheless  it reached the doorway of the pub and shouted     you scunners are all under arrest .  now this is how it   s going to go  ye ken  ye can hae it the hard way  or        he paused for a moment .     no  that   s about it  aye     he finished .     i don   t know any other way .     and with that he sprang through the doorway .   feegles fought all the time .  for them  fighting was a hobby  exercise and entertainment all combined .   tiffany had read in professor chaffinch   s famous book on mythology that many ancient peoples thought that when heroes died they went to some kind of feasting hall  where they would spend all eternity fighting  eating and boozing .   tiffany thought that this would be rather boring by about day three  but the feegles would love it  and probably even the legendary heroes would throw them out before eternity was half done  having first shaken them down to get all the cutlery back .  the nac mac feegle were indeed ferocious and fearsome fighters  with the minor drawback     from their point of view     that seconds into any fight  sheer enjoyment took over  and they tended to attack one another  nearby trees and  if no other target presented itself  themselves .   the watchmen  after reviving their sergeant and finding his helmet for him  sat down to wait for the noise to die away  and it seemed that it was after only a minute or two that the tiny watchman came back out of the stricken building  dragging by one leg big yan  a giant among feegles and now  it appeared  fast asleep .  he was dropped  the policeman went back in again and came out with an unconscious rob anybody over one shoulder  and daft wullie over the other .   tiffany stared  with her mouth open .  this could not be happening .  the feegles always won .  nothing beats a feegle .  they were unstoppable .  but there they were  stopped  and stopped by a creature so small that he looked like one half of a salt and pepper set .   when he had run out of feegles  the little man ran back into the building and came out very quickly  carrying a turkey necked woman who was trying to hit him with her umbrella  a fruitless endeavour since he was balancing her carefully over his head .  she was followed by a trembling young maidservant  clutching a voluminous carpet bag .  the little man put the woman down neatly alongside the pile of feegles  and while she screamed at the watchmen to arrest him  went back inside and came out again  balancing three heavy suitcases and two hat boxes .   tiffany recognized the woman  but not with any pleasure .  she was the duchess  the mother of letitia  and fairly fearsome .  did roland really understand what he was letting himself in for .  letitia herself was all right  if you liked that kind of thing  but her mother apparently had so much blue blood in her veins that she ought to explode  and right now looked as if that was going to happen .  and how appropriate that the feegles should have trashed the very building that the nasty old baggage was staying in .  how lucky could one witch get .  and what would the duchess think about roland and his watercolour painting wife to be being left in the building unchaperoned .   this question was answered by the sight of the little man dragging both of them out of the building by some very expensive clothing .  roland was wearing a dinner jacket slightly too big for him  while letitia   s apparel was simply a mass of flimsy frills upon frills  in tiffany   s mind not the clothing of anyone who was any use whatsoever .  hah .   still more watchmen were turning up  presumably because they had dealt with feegles before and had had the sense to walk  not run  to the scene of the crime .  but there was a tall one     more than six feet in height     with red hair and wearing armour so polished that it blinded  who was taking a witness statement from the owner  it sounded like a long drawn out scream to the effect that the watchmen should make this terrible nightmare not have happened .   tiffany turned away and found herself staring directly into the face of roland .      you .  here .     he managed .  in the background  letitia was bursting into tears .  hah  just like her .      look  i have to tell you something very           the floor fell in     said roland before she could finish  like someone still in a dream .     the actual floor actually fell in .         look  i must       she began again  but this time letitia   s mother was suddenly in front of tiffany .      i know you .  you   re his witch girl  yes .  don   t deny it .  how dare you follow us here .         how did they make the floor fall in .     roland demanded  his face white .     how did you make the floor fall in .  tell me .      and then the smell came .  it was like being hit  unexpectedly  with a hammer .  under her bewilderment and horror tiffany sensed something else  a stink  a stench  a foulness in her mind  dreadful and unforgiving  a compost of horrible ideas and rotted thoughts that made her want to take out her brain and wash it .   that   s him  the man in black with no eyes .  and the smell .  a toilet for sick weasels couldn   t smell worse .  i thought it was bad last time  but that was a bed of primroses .  she looked around desperately  hoping against hope not to see what she was looking for .   letitia   s sobs were getting louder  and mixing very badly with the sounds of the feegles groaning and swearing as they started to wake up .   the mother in law to be grabbed roland by his jacket .     come away from her right now  she is nothing but a           roland  your father is dead .      that silenced everybody  and tiffany was suddenly in a thicket of stares .   oh dear  she thought .  it shouldn   t have happened like this .      i   m sorry     she managed in the accusing silence .     there was nothing i could do .     she saw colour flow into his face .      but you were looking after him     said roland  as if trying to work out a puzzle .     why did you stop keeping him alive .         all i could do was take the pain away .  i   m so very sorry  but that   s all i could do .  i   m sorry .         but you   re a witch .  i thought you were good at it  you   re a witch .  why did he die .      what did the bitch do to him .  do not trust her .  she is a witch .  do not suffer a witch to live .   tiffany didn   t hear the words  they seemed to crawl across her mind like some kind of slug  leaving slime behind it  and later she wondered how many other minds it had crawled across  but now she felt mrs proust grip her by the arm .  she saw roland   s face contort into fury  and she remembered the screaming figure on the road  shadowless in full sunlight  delivering abuse as if it was vomit and leaving her with a sick feeling that she would never be able to get clean again .   and the people around her had a worried  hunted look  like rabbits who have smelled a fox .   then she saw him .  hardly visible  at the edge of the crowd .  there they were  or rather there they weren   t .  the two holes in the air staring at her just for a moment  before vanishing .  and not knowing where they had gone made them worse .   she turned to mrs proust .     what is that  .      the woman opened her mouth to answer  but the tall watchman   s voice said     excuse me  ladies and gentlemen  or rather just one gentleman in fact .  i am captain carrot  and since i am the duty officer this evening  the doubtful pleasure of dealing with this incident falls to me  and so        he opened his notebook  pulled out a pencil  and gave them a confident smile .     who is going to be the first to help me unravel this little conundrum .  to begin with  i would very much like to know what a bunch of nac mac feegle are doing in my city  apart from recovering .      the glint off his armour hurt the eyes .  and also he smelled strongly of soap  and that was good enough for tiffany .   she began to raise her hand  but mrs proust grabbed it and held it firmly .  this caused tiffany to shake off mrs proust even more firmly and then say in a voice firmer than the grip     that would be me  captain .         and you would be      .      running away as soon as possible  tiffany said to herself  but spoke up with     tiffany aching  sir .         off to a hen night  are you .         no     said tiffany .      yes .     said mrs proust quickly .   the captain put his head on one side .     so only one of you is going .  that doesn   t sound like much fun     he said  with his pencil poised over the page .   this was clearly too much for the duchess  who pointed an accusing finger at tiffany  it trembled with anger .     it is as clear as the nose on your face  officer .  this     this     this witch knew we were travelling down to the city in order to buy jewellery and gifts  and clearly  i repeat clearly  conspired with her imps to rob us .         i never did .     tiffany yelled .   the captain held up a hand  as if the duchess was a line of traffic .     miss aching  did you indeed encourage feegles into the city .         well  yes  but i didn   t really intend to .  it was a sort of spur of themoment thing .  i didn   t intend        the captain held up his hand again .     stop talking  please .     he rubbed his nose .  then he sighed .     miss aching  i   m arresting you on suspicion of     well  i   m just feeling suspicious .  besides  i am well aware that it is impossible to lock up a feegle who doesn   t want to be locked up .  if they are friends of yours  i trust        he looked around meaningfully        they will not do anything to get you into further trouble and  with luck  all of us will be able to get a decent night   s sleep .  my fellow officer  captain angua  will escort you down to the watch house .  mrs proust  would you be so good as to go along with them and explain the way of the world to your young friend .     captain angua stepped forward  she was female and beautiful and blonde     and     odd .   captain carrot turned to her ladyship .     madam  my officers will be happy to escort you to any other hotel or inn of your choice .  i see that your maidservant is holding a rather strong looking bag .  would this be containing the jewellery of which you spoke .  in which case  can we ascertain that it has not been stolen .      her ladyship was not happy about this  but the captain cheerfully did not notice  in that very professional way policemen have of not seeing things they don   t want to see .  and there was a definite sense that he wouldn   t have paid much attention in any case .   it was roland who opened the bag and held the purchase up to the light .  the tissue paper was carefully pulled off  and in the light of the lamps something sparkled so brilliantly that it seemed not only to reflect the light but to generate it too  somewhere inside its glowing stones .  it was a tiara .  several of the watchmen gasped .  roland looked smug .  letitia looked objectionably winsome .  mrs proust sighed .  and tiffany     went back in time  just for a second .  but in that second she was a little girl again  reading the well thumbed book of fairy stories that all her sisters had read before her .   but she had seen what they had not seen  she had seen through it .  it lied .  no  well  not exactly lied  but told you truths that you did not want to know  that only blonde and blue eyed girls could get the prince and wear the glittering crown .  it was built into the world .  even worse  it was built into your hair colouring .  redheads and brunettes sometimes got more than a walk on part in the land of story  but if all you had was a rather mousy shade of brown hair you were marked down to be a servant girl .   or you could be the witch .  yes .  you didn   t have to be stuck in the story .  you could change it  not just for yourself  but for other people .  you could change the story with a wave of your hand .   she sighed anyway  because the jewelled headdress was such a wonderful thing .  but the sensible witch part of her said     how often would you wear it  miss .  once in a blue moon .  something as expensive as that will spend all its time in a vault .         not stolen then     said captain carrot happily .     well  that   s good  isn   t it .  miss aching  i suggest you tell your little chums to follow you quietly  yes .      tiffany looked down at the nac mac feegle  who were silent  as if in shock .  of course  when about thirty deadly fighters found themselves being beaten into submission by one tiny man  it takes a while to come up with a face saving excuse .   rob anybody looked up at her with a very rare expression of shame .     sorry  miss .  sorry  miss     he said .     we just had considerably too much of the booze .  and ye ken  the more ye have of the booze  you ken ye want to have even more of the booze  until ye falls over  which is when ye know ye   ve had enough of the booze .  by the way  what the heel is cr  me de menthe .  a nice green colour  ye ken  i must have drunk a bucket of that stuff .  i suppose there is no point in saying we are verrae sorry .  but ye ken  we did find the useless streak of rubbish for ye .      tiffany looked up at what remained of the king   s head .  flickering in the torchlight it looked like some kind of skeleton of a building .  even as she watched  a large beam began to creak and dropped apologetically onto a pile of broken furniture .      i told you to find him  i didn   t tell you you were supposed to pull the doors off     she said .  she folded her arms  and the little men huddled even closer together  the next stage of female anger would be the tapping o    the feets  which generally led them to burst into tears and walk into trees .  now  though  they formed up neatly behind her and mrs proust and captain angua .   the captain nodded at mrs proust and said     i   m sure we can all agree that handcuffs won   t be necessary     yes  ladies .         oh  you know me  captain     said mrs proust .   captain angua   s eyes narrowed .     yes  but i don   t know anything about your little friend .  i would like you to carry the broomstick  mrs proust .      tiffany could see there was no point in arguing  and handed the stick over without complaining .  they walked on in silence apart from the muted mumbling of the nac mac feegles .   after a while the captain said     not a good time to be wearing pointy black hats  mrs proust .  there   s been another case  out on the plains .  some dead and alive hole you would never go to .  they beat up an old lady for having a book of spells .         no .      they turned to look at tiffany  and the feegles walked into her ankles .   captain angua shook her head .     sorry  miss  but it   s true .  turned out to be a book of klatchian poetry  you know .  all that wiggly writing .  i suppose it looks like a spell book for those inclined to think that way .  she died .         i blame the times     said mrs proust .     when they put that sort of thing in the paper  it gives people ideas .      angua shrugged .     from what i hear the people who did it weren   t much for reading .         you   ve got to stop it .     said tiffany .      how  miss .  we are the city watch .  we don   t have any real jurisdiction outside the walls .  there are places out there in the woods that we probably haven   t even heard of .  i don   t know where this stuff comes from .  it   s like some mad idea dropping out of the air .     the captain rubbed her hands together .     of course  we don   t have any witches in the city     she said     although there are quite a lot of hen nights  eh  mrs proust .     and the captain winked .  she really winked  tiffany was certain of it  in the same way she had been certain that captain carrot really did not like the duchess very much .      well  i think real witches would soon stop it     tiffany said .     they certainly would in the mountains  mrs proust .         oh  but we don   t have real witches in the city .  you heard the captain .     mrs proust glared at tiffany and then hissed     we do not argue around the normal people .  it makes them jittery .      they stopped outside a large building with blue lamps on either side of the doors .     welcome to the watch house  ladies     said captain angua .     now  miss aching  i shall have to lock you in a cell  but it will be a clean one     no mice  hardly at all     and if mrs proust will keep you company  then  shall we say  i might be a bit forgetful and leave the key in the lock  do you understand .  please do not leave the building  because you will be hunted .     she looked directly at tiffany and added     and no one should be hunted .  it is a terrible thing  being hunted .      she led them through the building and down to a row of surprisingly cosy looking cells  gesturing for them to go inside one of them .  the door of the cell clanged behind her and they heard the sound of her boots as she went back down the stone corridor .   mrs proust walked over to the door and reached through the bars .  there was a tinkle of metal and her hand came back in with the key in it .  she put it in the keyhole on this side  and turned it .     there     she said .     now we are doubly safe .         och  crivens .     said rob anybody .     will ye no    look at us .  slammed up in the banger .         again .     said daft wullie .     i dinnae ken if i will ever look m   self in the face .      mrs proust sat back down and stared at tiffany .     all right  my girl  what was that we saw .  no eyes  i noticed .  no windows into the soul .  no soul  perhaps .      tiffany felt wretched .     i don   t know .  i met him on the road here .  the feegles walked right through him .  he seems like a ghost .  and he stinks .  did you smell it .  and the crowd were turning on us .  what harm were we doing .         i   m not certain he   s a him     said mrs proust .     he might even be an it .  could be a demon of some sort  i suppose     but i don   t know much about them .  small trade retail is more my forte .  not that that can   t be a bit demonic at times .         but even roland turned on me     said tiffany .     and we   ve always been     friends .         ah ha     said mrs proust .      don   t you ah ha me     snapped tiffany .     how dare you ah ha me .  at least i don   t go around making witches look ridiculous .      mrs proust slapped her .  it was like being hit with a rubber pencil .     you   re a rude slip of a girl  you young hussy .  and i go around keeping witches safe .      up in the shadows of the ceiling  daft wullie nudged rob anybody and said     we cannae let somebody smack oor big wee hag  eh  rob .      rob anybody put a finger to his lips .     ah weel  it can be a wee bit difficult with womenfolk arguing  ye ken .  keep right oot of it  if ye   ll tak    ma advice as a married man .  any man who interferes in the arguin    of women is gonnae find both of them jumping up and doon on him in a matter o    seconds .  i   m nae talkin    about the foldin    of the arms  the pursin    of the lips and the tappin    of the feets .  i   m talking about the smacking around with the copper stick .      the witches stared at one another .  tiffany felt suddenly disorientated  as if she had gone from a to z without passing through the rest of the alphabet .      did that just happen  my girl .     said mrs proust .      yes  it did     said tiffany sharply .     it still stings .     mrs proust said     why did we do it .         to tell the truth  i hated you     said tiffany .     just for a moment .  it frightened me .  i just wanted to be rid of you .  you were just           all wrong .     said mrs proust .      that   s right .         ah     said mrs proust .     discord .  turning on the witch .  always blame the witch .  where does it start .  perhaps we have found out .     her ugly face stared at tiffany  then she said     when did you become a witch  my girl .         i think it was when i was about eight     said tiffany .  and she told mrs proust the story about mrs snapperly  the witch in the hazel woods .   the woman listened carefully and settled down on the straw .     we know it happens sometimes     she said .     every few hundred years or so  suddenly everyone thinks witches are bad .  no one knows why it is .  it just seems to happen .  have you been doing anything lately that might attract attention .  any especially important piece of magic or something .      tiffany thought back and then said     well  there was the hiver .  but he wasn   t all that bad .  and before that there was the queen of the fairies  but that was ages ago .  it was pretty awful too  but generally speaking  i think hitting her over the head with a frying pan was the best thing i could have done at the time .  and  well  i suppose i   d better say that a couple of years ago  i did kiss the winter         mrs proust had been listening to this with her mouth open  and now she said     that was you .         yes     said tiffany .      are you sure .     said mrs proust .      yes .  it was me .  i was there .         what was it like .         chilly  and then damp .  i didn   t want to have to do it .  i   m sorry  ok .         about two years ago .     said mrs proust .     that   s interesting .  the trouble seemed to start around then  you know .  nothing particularly major  it was just as though people didn   t respect us any more .  just something in the air  you might say .  i mean  that kid with the stone this morning .  well  he would never have dared try that a year ago .  people always gave me a nod when i passed by in those days .  and now they frown .  or they make some little sign  just in case i bring bad luck .  the others have told me about this too .  what   s it been like where you are .         can   t really say     said tiffany .     people were a bit nervous of me  but on the whole i suppose i was related to a lot of them .  but everything felt odd .  and i thought that was how it had to feel .  i   d kissed the winter  and everybody knew it .  honestly  they do go on about it .  i mean  it was only once .         well  people are packed a little more closely together around here .  and witches have long memories .  i mean  not individual witches  but all the witches put together can remember the really bad times .  when wearing a pointy hat got a stone thrown at you  if not something worse .  and when you go back further than that     it   s like a disease     mrs proust said .     it sort of creeps up .  it   s in the wind  as if it goes from person to person .  poison goes where poison   s welcome .  and there   s always an excuse  isn   t there  to throw a stone at the old lady who looks funny .  it   s always easier to blame somebody .  and once you   ve called someone a witch  then you   d be amazed how many things you can blame her for .         they stoned her cat to death     said tiffany  almost to herself .      and now there   s a man without a soul who   s following you .  and the stink of him makes even witches hate witches .  you don   t feel inclined to set fire to me  by any chance  miss tiffany aching .         no  of course not     said tiffany .      or press me flat on the ground with lots of stones on me .         what are you talking about .         it wasn   t just stones     said mrs proust .     you hear people talk about witches being burned  but i don   t reckon many real witches ever did get burned unless they were tricked in some way  i think it was mostly poor old women .  witches are mostly too soggy  and it was probably a wicked waste of good timber .  but it   s very easy to push an old lady down to the ground and take one of the doors off the barn and put it on top of her like a sandwich and pile stones on it until she can   t breathe any more .  and that makes all the badness go away .  except that it doesn   t .  because there are other things going on  and other old ladies .  and when they run out  there are always old men .  always strangers .  there   s always the outsider .  and then  perhaps  one day  there   s always you .  that   s when the madness stops .  when there   s no one left to be mad .  do you know  tiffany aching  that i felt it when you kissed the winter .  anyone with an ounce of magical talent felt something .     she paused and her eyes narrowed .  now she was staring at tiffany .     what did you wake up  tiffany aching .  what rough thing opened the eyes that it had not got and wondered who you were .  what have you brought upon us  miss tiffany aching .  what have you done .         you think that        tiffany hesitated and then said     that he is after me .      she closed her eyes so that she couldn   t see the accusing face  and remembered the day she had kissed the winter .  there had been terror  and dreadful apprehension  and the strange feeling of being warm whilst surrounded by ice and snow .  and as for the kiss  well  it had been as gentle as a silk handkerchief falling on a carpet .  until she had poured all the heat of the sun into the lips of winter and melted him into water .  frost to fire .  fire to frost .  she   d always been good with fire .  fire had always been her friend .  it wasn   t as if the winter had ever died  there had been other winters since  but not so bad  never so bad .  and it hadn   t just been a snog .  she had done the right thing at the right time .  it was what you did .  why had she had to do it .  because it was her fault  because she had disobeyed miss treason and joined in a dance that wasn   t just a dance but the curving of the seasons and the turning of the year .   and  with horror  she wondered  where does it end .  you do one foolish thing and then one thing to put it right  and when you put it right something else goes wrong .  where did it ever stop .  mrs proust was watching her as though fascinated .      all i did was dance     said tiffany .   mrs proust put a hand on her shoulder .     my dear  i think you will have to dance again .  could i suggest you do something very sensible at this point  tiffany aching .         yes     said tiffany .      listen to my advice     said mrs proust .     i don   t usually give things away  but i feel quite chipper about catching that lad who kept breaking my windows .  so i   m in the mood for a good mood .  there is a lady who i am sure would be very keen to talk to you .  she lives in the city  but you   ll never find her no matter how hard you try .  she will find you  though  in the blink of a second  and my advice is that when she does  you listen to everything she might tell you .         so how do i find her .     said tiffany .      you   re feeling sorry for yourself and not listening     said mrs proust .     she will find you .  you   ll know it when she does .  oh my word  yes .     she reached into a pocket and produced a small round tin  the lid of which she flicked open with a black fingernail .  the air suddenly felt prickly .     snuff  .     she said  offering the tin to tiffany .     dirty habit  of course  but it clears the tubes and helps me think .     she took a pinch of the brown powder  tipped it onto the back of the other hand and sniffed it up with a sound like a honk in reverse .  she coughed and blinked once or twice and said     of course  brown bogeys are not to everybody   s liking  but i suppose they add to that nasty witch look .  anyway  i expect they   ll soon give us dinner .         they   re going to feed us .     said tiffany .      oh yes  they   re a decent bunch  although the wine last time was a bit off in my opinion     said mrs proust .      but we   re in prison .         no  my dear  we   re in the police cells .  and  though nobody   s saying it  we   re locked in here for our protection .  you see  everyone else is locked out  and although they sometimes act dumb  policemen can   t help being clever .  they know that people need witches  they need the unofficial people who understand the difference between right and wrong  and when right is wrong and when wrong is right .  the world needs the people who work around the edges .  they need the people who can deal with the little bumps and inconveniences .  and little problems .  after all  we are almost all human .  almost all of the time .  and almost every full moon captain angua comes to me to make up a prescription for her hardpad .      the snuff tin was produced again .   after a while tiffany said     hardpad is a disease of dogs .         and werewolves     said mrs proust .      oh .  i thought there was something odd about her .         she stays on top of it  mind you     said mrs proust .     she shares lodgings with captain carrot and doesn   t bite anybody     although  come to think about it  she possibly bites captain carrot  but least said soonest mended  i   m sure you will agree .  sometimes what is legal isn   t what is right  and sometimes it needs a witch to tell the difference .  and sometimes a copper too  if you have the right kind of copper .  clever people know this .  stupid people don   t .  and the trouble is  stupid people can be oh so very clever .  and by the way  miss  your boisterous little friends have escaped .         yes     tiffany said .     i know .         isn   t that a shame  despite the fact that they faithfully promised the watch to stay .     mrs proust evidently did like to retain a reputation for nastiness .   tiffany cleared her throat .     well     she said     i suppose rob anybody would tell you that there are times when promises should be kept and times when promises should be broken  and it takes a feegle to know the difference .      mrs proust grinned hugely .     you could almost be from the city  miss tiffany aching .      if you needed to guard something that didn   t need guarding  possibly because no one in their right mind would want to steal it  then corporal nobbs of the city watch was  for want of a better way of describing him  and in the absence of any hard biological evidence to the contrary  your man .  and now he stood in the dark and crunching ruins of the king   s head  smoking a horrible cigarette made by rolling up all the stinking butts of previously smoked cigarettes into some fresh cigarette paper and sucking the horrible mess until some kind of smoke appeared .   he never noticed the hand that lifted his helmet off  hardly even felt the forensic blow to the head  and certainly did not feel the calloused little hands that placed the helmet back on his head as they lowered his sleeping body to the ground .      ok     said rob anybody in a hoarse whisper  looking around at the blackened timbers .     now  we don   t have much time  ye ken  so           well  well  i just knew that you wee scunners would come back here if i waited long enough for ye     said a voice in the dark .     as a dog returneth to his vomit and a fool to his folly  so the criminal returns to the scene of his crime .      the watchman known as wee mad arthur struck a match  which was  for a feegle  a pretty good torch .  there was a clink as something that was the size of a shield for a feegle  but would have been a badge for a human policeman  landed on the floor in front of him .     that   s tae show you wee fools that i   m nae on duty  ok .  cannae be a policeman withoot a badge  ain   t that so .  i just wanted tae see why ye wee deadbeats talks properly  like what i do  because ye ken  i   m no    a feegle .      the feegles looked at rob anybody  who shrugged and said     what the heel do you think ye are  then .      wee mad arthur ran his hands through his hair  and nothing fell out .     well  my ma an    poppa told me i was a gnome  like them        he stopped talking because the feegles were hooting and slapping their legs with mirth  which tends to go on for a long time .   wee mad arthur watched for a little while before shouting     i do not find this funny .         will ye no    listen to yourself .     said rob anybody  wiping his eyes .     ye are speaking feegle  sure enough .  did yer mammy and yer pappy nae tell ye .  we feegles are born knowing how to speak .  crivens .  it   s just like a dog knowing how to bark .  ye cannae tell me ye are a gnome .  ye   ll be telling me ye are a pixie next .      wee mad arthur looked down at his boots .     my dad made me these boots     he said .     i couldnae bring mesel    to tell him i didnae like boots on my feet .  the whole family had been making and repairing shoes for hundreds of years  ye ken  and i wasnae good at the cobbling at all  and then one day all the elders of the tribe called me together and told me i was a lost foundling .  they was moving to a new camp  and they ha    found me  a tiny wee bairn  greeting by the road  right next to a sparrowhawk that i had strangled to death after it had snatched me from me cradle  they reckoned it was taking me home to feed me tae its chicks .  and the old gnomes put their hats together  and said that while they were very happy to let me stay  what with being able to bite foxes to death and everything  it might be time for me to go out into the big world and find out who my people were .         well  laddie  ye have found them     said rob anybody  slapping him on the back .     ye did well to listen to a load of old cobblers .  that was wisdom they told you  sure enough .      he hesitated for a moment  and then went on     however  it   s a wee bitty difficult that ye are     no offence meant     a policeman .     he jumped back slightly  just in case .      granted     said wee mad arthur with satisfaction .     whereas ye are a bunch of thieving drunken reprobates and scoff laws with no respect for the law whatsoever .      the feegles nodded happily  although rob anybody said     would you no    mind adding the words drunk and disorderly .  we wouldnae want to be sold short here .         and what about the snail rustling  rob .     said daft wullie happily .      weel     said rob anybody     in actual point of fact  the snailrustling is still in the early stages of development at this time .         have you no good points .     said wee mad arthur desperately .   rob anybody looked puzzled .     we kind of thought them is our good points  but if you want to get picky  we never steal from them as has nae money  we has hearts of gold  although maybe     ok  mostly     somebody else   s gold  and we did invent the deep fried stoat .  that must count for something .         how is that a good point .     said arthur .      weel  it saves some other poor devil having tae do it .  it   s what ye might call a taste explosion  ye take a mouthful  taste it  and then there is an explosion .      despite himself  wee mad arthur was grinning .     have you boys got no shame .      rob anybody matched him grin for grin .     i couldnae say     he replied     but if we have  it probably belonged tae somebody else .         and what about the poor wee big lassie locked up and down in the watch house .     said wee mad arthur .      oh  she   ll bide fine till the morning     said rob anybody  as loftily as he could in the circumstances .     she is a hag o    considerable resource .         ye think so .  you wee scunners punched an entire pub to death .  how can anyone put that right .      this time rob anybody gave him a longer  more thoughtful look before saying     well  mr policeman  it seems ye are a feegle and a copper .  well  that   s the way the world spins .  but the big question for the pair of ye is  are you a sneak and a snitch .      in the watch house the shift was changing .  somebody came in and shyly handed mrs proust quite a large plate of cold meats and pickles  and a bottle of wine with two glasses .  after a nervous look at tiffany  the watchman whispered something to mrs proust  and in one movement she   d taken a small packet out of her pocket and shoved it into his hand .  then she came back and sat down on the straw again .      and i see he   s had the decency to open the bottle and let the wine breathe for a while     she said  and added  when she saw tiffany   s glance     lance constable hopkins has a little problem that he   d rather his mother never found out about and i make a rather helpful ointment .  i don   t charge him  of course .  one hand washes the other  although in the case of young hopkins i hope he scrubs it first .      tiffany had never drunk wine before  at home you drank small beer or small cider  which had just enough alcohol to kill off the nasty invisible tiny biting things  but not enough alcohol to make you more than a bit silly .      well     she said     i never thought prison would be like this .         prison .  i told you  my dear girl  this isn   t prison .  if you want to know what a prison is like  visit the tanty .  that   s a dark place if you like .  in here the watchmen don   t gob in your grub     at least when you   re watching  and certainly never in mine  you can be sure of that .  the tanty is a tough place  they like to think that anyone who gets put in there will think more than twice before doing anything that will get them put in there again .  and they   ve tidied it up a bit these days  and not everybody who goes in comes out in a pine box  but the walls still scream silently to those with hearing .  i hear them .     she opened her snuffbox with a click .     and worse than the screaming is the sound of the canaries in d wing  where they lock up the men who they don   t dare hang .  they bang up each one by himself in a little room  and they give him a canary as company .     at this point mrs proust took a pinch of snuff  at such speed and volume that tiffany was surprised that it didn   t come out of her ears .   the box   s lid snapped back down .     those men  mark you  are not your average murderer     oh no  they killed people for a hobby  or for a god or for something to do  or because it wasn   t a very nice day .  they did worse things than just murder  but murder was how it always ended .  i see you haven   t touched your beef     .  oh well  if you   re quite sure        mrs proust paused with rather a large piece of heavily pickled lean beef on her knife and went on     funny thing  though  these cruel men used to look after their canaries  and cried when they died .  the warders used to say it was all a sham  they said it gave them the creeps  but i   m not sure .  when i was young  i used to run errands for the warders and i would look at those great heavy doors and i would listen to the little birds  and i would wonder what it is that makes the difference between a good man and a man so bad that no hangman in the city     not even my dad  who could have a man out of his cell and stone cold dead in seven and a quarter seconds     would dare to put a rope round his neck in case he escaped from the fires of evil and came back with a vengeance .     mrs proust stopped there and shivered  as if shaking off the memories .     that   s life in the big city  my girl  it   s not an easy bed of sweet primroses  like in the country .      tiffany wasn   t very happy with being called a girl again  but that wasn   t the worst of it .     sweet primroses .     she said .     it wasn   t sweet primroses the other day when i had to cut down a hanged man .     and she had to tell mrs proust all about mr petty and amber .  and about the bouquet of nettles .      and your dad told you about the beatings .     said mrs proust .     sooner or later  it   s all about the soul .      the meal had been tasty  and the wine surprisingly strong .  and the straw was a lot cleaner than you might have expected .  it had been a long day  piled on top of other long days .     please     tiffany said     can we get some sleep .  my father always says that things will look better in the morning .      there was a pause .     upon reflection     mrs proust said     i think your father will turn out to be wrong .      tiffany let the clouds of tiredness take her .  she dreamed about canaries singing in the dark .  and perhaps she imagined it  but she thought she woke up for a moment and saw the shadow of an old lady looking at her .  it certainly wasn   t mrs proust  who snored something terrible .  the shape was there for a moment  and then it vanished .  tiffany remembered  the world is full of omens  and you picked the ones you liked .       chapter     the king   s neck    iffany was woken by the squeak of the cell door opening .  she sat up and looked around .  mrs proust was still asleep  and snoring so hard that her nose wobbled .  correction  mrs proust appeared to be asleep .  tiffany liked her  in a wary kind of way  but could she trust her .  sometimes she seemed to almost     read her mind .      i don   t read minds     said mrs proust  turning over .      mrs proust .      mrs proust sat up and started to pull bits of straw off her dress .     i don   t read minds     she said  flicking the straw onto the floor .     i really have keen  but not supernatural  skills which i have honed to the sharpest of edges  and don   t you forget it  please .  i hope to goodness they   re going to give us a cooked breakfast .         no problem there     what would ye like us to fetch for ye .      they looked up to see the feegles sitting on the beam overhead  and dangling their feet happily .   tiffany sighed .     if i asked you what you were doing last night  would you lie to me .         absolutely not  on our honour as feegles     said rob anybody  with his hand on where he thought his heart was .      well  that seems conclusive     said mrs proust  standing up .   tiffany shook her head and sighed again .     no  it   s not quite as simple as that .     she looked up at the beam and said     rob anybody  was the answer you gave me just then truthful .  i   m asking you as the hag o    the hills .         oh aye .         and that one .         oh aye .         and that one .         oh aye .         and that one .         oh     well  only a tiny wee lie  ye ken  hardly a lie  just something that it wouldnae be good for ye tae know .      tiffany turned to mrs proust  who was grinning .     the nac mac feegles feel that the truth is so precious that it shouldn   t be waved about too much     she said apologetically .      ah  people after my own heart     said mrs proust  and then  remembering herself  she added     if i had one  that is .      there was a sound of heavy boots  which got nearer and no less heavy very quickly  and turned out to belong to a tall and skinny watchman  who touched his helmet politely to mrs proust and gave tiffany a nod .      good morning  ladies .  my name is constable haddock and i have been told to tell you that you   ve been let go with a warning     he said .     although i have to tell you that no one quite knows what to warn you about  as far as i can tell  so if i was you  i   d consider myself generally in the situation of being warned  as it were  in a general and generically non specific way  and hopefully slightly chastened by the experience  no offence meant  i   m sure .     he coughed  and went on  after giving mrs proust a nervous look     and commander vimes has asked me to make it clear that the individuals known jointly as the nac mac feegle are to be out of this city by sunset .      there was a chorus of complaints from the feegles on the beam  who in tiffany   s opinion were as good at astonished indignation as they were at drunkenness and thievery      och  ye wouldnae pick on us if we was big .         it wasnae us .  a big boy did it and ran awee .         i wasnae there .  ye can ask them .  they wasnae there either .     and otherrr excuses o    that ilk  ye ken .   tiffany banged her tin plate on the bars until they subsided into silence .  then she said     excuse me  please  constable haddock .  i   m sure they   re all very sorry about the pub       she began  and he waved a hand at her .      if you   ll take my advice  miss  you would just leave quietly and not talk to anybody about pubs .         but look     we all know that they smashed up the king   s head  and        the constable stopped her again .     i went past the king   s head this morning     he said     and it was very definitely not smashed up .  in fact  there were crowds of people there .  everyone in the city is going to have a look at it .  the king   s head is just like it   s always been  as far as i can see  with just the one tiny little detail which is  to wit  that it is now back to front .         what do you mean     back to front    .     said mrs proust .      i mean that it is the wrong way round     said the policeman patiently     and when i was over there just now  you can bet they weren   t calling it the king   s head any more .      tiffany   s forehead wrinkled .     so     they   re calling it the king   s neck .      constable haddock smiled .     well  yes  i can see you are a well brought up young lady  miss  because most of the people out there are calling it the king   s           i cannot abide smut .     said mrs proust severely .   really .  tiffany thought .  with half a shop window full of pink inflatable wossnames and other mysterious items that i didn   t get a chance to see very clearly .  but i suppose it would be a strange world if we were all the same  and especially if we were all the same as mrs proust .   and overhead she could hear the susurration of the nac mac feegles  with daft wullie making more noise than usual .     i told ye  didn   t i tell ye  i said this lot is back to front  i said  but no  ye would nae pay heed .  i may be daft  but i   m no    stupid .      the king   s head  or at least whatever part of the king   s anatomy it now was  was not very far away  but the witches had to push their way through the crowds when they were at least a hundred yards away  and many of the people making up the crowd were holding pint mugs in their hands .  mrs proust and tiffany both wore hob nailed boots  a boon to anyone who must get through a crowd in a hurry and there  in front of them was  for want of a better word     although the feegles would have used a different word  and indeed the feegles would not have hesitated to use a different word     was  in fact  the king   s back  which came as a relief .  standing in front of the back door  which was now doing the duty formerly left to the front door  and handing out mugs of beer with one hand while taking money with the other  was mr wilkin  the landlord .  he looked like a cat on the day it rained mice .   every now and again he managed to find time in this heroic endeavour to say a few words to a skinny but purposeful looking lady who was writing things down in a notebook .   mrs proust nudged tiffany .     see her .  that   s miss cripslock of the times  and over there        she pointed at a tall man in the uniform of the watch        see there  the man she   s talking to is commander vimes of the city watch .  decent man  always looks grumpy  won   t stand any nonsense .  this is going to be interesting  because he doesn   t like kings of any sort  one of his ancestors chopped off the head of the last king we had .         that   s dreadful .  did he deserve it .      mrs proust hesitated for a moment  and then said     well  if it   s true about what they found in his private dungeon  then the answer is    yes    in great big letters .  they put the commander   s ancestor on trial anyway  because chopping heads off kings always causes a certain amount of comment  apparently .  when the man stood in the dock  all he said was     had the beast a hundred heads i would not have rested until i had slain every last one .     which was taken as a guilty plea .  he was hanged  and then much later they put up a statue to him  which tells you more about people than you might wish to know .  his nickname was old stoneface  and as you can see  it runs in the family .      tiffany could  and this was because the commander was moving purposefully towards her  his expression that of a man who had a lot of things to do  all of them more important than what he was having to do right now .  he gave a respectful little nod to mrs proust  and tried unsuccessfully not to glare at tiffany .      did you do this .         no  sir .         do you know who did .         no  sir .      the commander frowned .     young lady  if a burglar breaks into a house and then comes back later and puts everything back where it was  a crime has still happened  do you understand .  and if the building that has been badly damaged  along with its contents  is found next morning looking all shiny and new  albeit facing the wrong way  that too     and therefore those involved     are  nevertheless  still criminals .  except that i have no idea what to call it and quite frankly i would rather be shot of the whole damn business .      tiffany blinked .  she hadn   t heard that last sentence  not exactly heard it  but could remember it anyway .  they must have been spill words .  she glanced at mrs proust  who nodded happily  and in tiffany   s head there was a little spill word that said    yes    .   out loud  mrs proust said     commander  it seems to me that no real harm has been done  given that  if i   m any judge  mr wilkin here is doing a roaring trade in the king   s back and would probably not welcome it becoming the king   s head again .         too right .     said the landlord  who was shovelling money into a bag .   commander vimes was frowning  and tiffany caught the words that he was almost but not actually saying     no king   s coming back while i   m here .      mrs proust butted in again .     how about letting it be called the king   s neck .     she suggested .     especially since he appears to have dandruff  greasy hair and a big ripe boil .      to tiffany   s delight  the commander   s face stayed as stony as ever  but she caught a tremble of a spill word that was a triumphant    yes .     and at that point mrs proust  who believed in securing victory by every means at her disposal  chimed in again with     this is ankhmorpork  mr vimes  in the summer the river catches fire and it has been known to rain fish and bedsteads  so  in the great scheme of things  when you think about it  what   s so wrong about a pub spinning on its axis .  most of its customers do the same .  how is your little boy  by the way .      this innocent enquiry appeared to floor the commander .     oh .  he     oh  i     he   s fine .  oh yes  fine .  you were right .  all he needed was a fizzy drink and a really big burp .  could i have a word with you in private  mrs proust .     the look he gave tiffany made it quite clear that    private    didn   t include her  so she carefully made her way through the crowds of jolly  and sometimes too jolly  people waiting to have their pictures taken in front of the king   s neck  and let herself fade into the foreground and listen to rob anybody command the troops  who would listen to him when there was nothing better to do .      all right     he said     which one of you scunners decided to paint a real neck on the sign .  i   m sure it   s no    normally done like that .         that was wullie     said big yan .     he reckoned people would think it had always been like that .  he is daft  ye ken .         sometimes daft works     said tiffany .  she looked around     and there he was  the man with no eyes  walking through the crowd  walking through the crowd  as if they were ghosts  but she could see that they felt his presence in some way  one man brushed his hand across his face  as if feeling the footsteps of a fly  another one slapped at his own ear .  but afterwards they were     changed .  when their eyes saw tiffany they narrowed  and the ghostly man headed towards her and the whole of the crowd became one huge frown .  and here came the stench  trailing behind him and turning the daylight grey .  it was like the bottom of a pond  where things had died and rotted for centuries .   tiffany looked around desperately .  the turning of the king   s head had filled the street with the curious and the thirsty .  people were trying to go about their business  but were being hemmed in by the crowd in front and the crowd behind them and  of course  by the people with trays and little carts who swarmed through the city and would try to sell something to anyone who stood still for more than two seconds .  she could feel the menace in the air  but in fact it was more than a menace     it was hatred  growing like a plant after rain  and still the man in black came nearer .  it scared her .  of course  she had the feegles with her  but generally speaking the feegles got you out of trouble by getting you into a different kind of trouble .   the ground moved quite suddenly underneath her .  there was a metallic scraping noise  and the bottom dropped out of her world  but only by about six feet .  as she staggered in the gloom under the pavement  someone pushed past her with a cheerful    excuse me .     there were more inexplicable metal noises and the round hole now above her head vanished in darkness .      real piece of luck there     said the polite voice .     the only one we   re going to get today  i fancy .  please try not to panic until i have lit the safety lantern .  if you want to panic thereafter  that is entirely up to you .  stay close to me and when i say     walk as fast as possible while holding your breath     do so  for the sake of your sanity  your throat  and possibly your life .  i don   t care if you understand or not     just do it  because we may not have much time .      a match flared .  there was a small popping noise and a green blue glow in the air just in front of tiffany .     only a bit of marsh gas     said the invisible informant .     not too bad  nothing to worry about yet  but stay close  mind you .      the green blue glow began to move very fast  and tiffany had to walk quickly to keep up  which was no mean feat  because the ground beneath her boots was  by turns  like gravel  mud or occasionally a liquid of some sort but probably not a sort that you would want to know about .  here and there  in the distance  there were tiny little glows of other mysterious lights  like will o    the wisps you sometimes got over marshy ground .      do keep up .     said the voice ahead of her .   soon tiffany lost all sense of direction and  for that matter  time .   then there was a click and the figure was outlined against what looked like a perfectly ordinary doorway  except that it was in an arch  and so the door itself came to a point at the top .      please be so good as to wipe your feet very thoroughly on the mat just inside  it pays to take precautions down here .      behind the still shadowy figure  candles were lighting themselves  and now they illuminated someone in heavy  stiff clothing  big boots and a steel helmet on her head     although  as tiffany watched  the figure carefully lifted the helmet off .  she shook out her ponytail  which suggested that she was young  but her hair was white  suggesting that she was old .  she was  tiffany thought  one of those people who picks for themselves a look that suits them and doesn   t get in the way  and never changes it until they die .  there were wrinkles too  and tiffany   s guide had the preoccupied air of somebody who is trying to think of several things at once  and by the look on her face she was trying to think of everything .  there was a small table in the room  set with a teapot  cups and a pile of small cupcakes .      do come on in     said the woman .     welcome .  but where are my manners .  my name is miss     smith  for the moment .  i believe mrs proust may have mentioned me .  and you are in the unreal estate  quite possibly the most unstable place in the world .  would you like some tea .      things tend to look better when the world has stopped spinning and you have a warm drink in front of you  even if it   s standing on an old packing case .      i   m sorry it   s not a palace     said miss smith .     i never stay here for more than a few days at a time  but i do need to be close to the university  and to have absolute privacy .  this was a little cottage outside the university walls  you see  and the wizards just used to chuck all their waste over  after a while  all the different bits of magical rubbish started to react with one another in what i can only call unpredictable ways .  well  what with talking rats  and people   s eyebrows growing up to six feet long  and shoes walking around by themselves  the people that lived nearby ran away  and so did their shoes .  and since there was no one complaining any more  the university simply chucked even more stuff over the wall .  wizards are like cats going to the toilet in that respect  once you   ve walked away from it  it isn   t there any more .      of course  it then became a free for all  with just about anybody throwing over just about anything and running away very quickly  often pursued by shoes  but not always successfully .  would you like a cupcake .  and don   t worry  i bought them off quite a reliable baker tomorrow  so i know they   re fresh  and i pretty much tamed the magic around here a year ago .  it wasn   t too hard  magic is largely a matter of balance  but of course you   d know that .  anyway  the upshot is that there is such a magical fog over this place that i doubt if even a god could see into it .     miss smith delicately ate half a cup cake  and balanced the other half on her saucer .  she leaned closer to tiffany .     how did it feel  miss tiffany aching  when you kissed the winter .      tiffany stared at her for a moment .     look  it was just a peck  ok .  certainly no tongues .     then she said     you are the person that mrs proust said was going to find me  aren   t you .         yes     said miss smith .     i would hope that is obvious .  i could give you a long  complicated lecture     she continued brusquely     but i think it would be better if i told you a story .  i know you have been taught by granny weatherwax  and she will tell you that the world is made up of stories .  i had better admit that this one is one of the nasty ones .         i am a witch  you know     said tiffany .     i have seen nasty things .         so you may think     said miss smith .     but for now i want you to picture a scene  more than a thousand years ago  and imagine a man  still quite young  and he is a witchfinder and a book burner and a torturer  because people older than him who are far more vile than him have told him that this is what the great god om wants him to be .  and on this day he has found a woman who is a witch  and she is beautiful  astonishingly beautiful  which is rather unusual among witches  at least in those days           he falls in love with her  doesn   t he .     tiffany interrupted .      of course     said miss smith .     boy meets girl  one of the greatest engines of narrative causality in the multiverse  or as some people might put it     it had to happen .     i would like to continue this discourse without interruptions  if you don   t mind .         but he is going to have to kill her  isn   t he .      miss smith sighed .     since you ask  not necessarily .  he thinks that if he rescues her and they can get to the river  then they might have a chance .  he is bewildered and confused .  he has never had feelings like this before .  for the first time in his life  he is really having to think for himself .  there are horses not far away .  there are a few guards  and some other prisoners  and the air is full of smoke because there is a pile of burning books  which is making people   s eyes water .      tiffany leaned forward in her seat  listening to the clues  trying to work out the ending in advance .      there are some apprentices that he is training  and also some very senior members of the omnian church who have come to watch and bless the proceedings .  and finally there are a number of people from the nearby village who are cheering very loudly because it is not them who are going to be killed and generally they don   t get much entertainment .  in fact  it   s pretty much another day at the office  except that the girl being tied to the stake by the apprentices has caught his eye and is now watching him very carefully  not saying a word  not even screaming a word  not yet .         does he have a sword .     asked tiffany .      yes  he does .  may i continue .  good .  now  he walks towards her .  she is staring at him  not shouting  just watching  and he is thinking     what is he thinking .  he is thinking     could i take on both of the guards .  will the apprentices obey me .     and then  as he gets nearer  he wonders if they could make it to the horses in all this smoke .  and this is a moment eternally frozen in time .  huge events await his decision .  one simple deed either way  and history will be different and you are thinking it depends on what he does next .  but you see  what he is thinking doesn   t matter  because she knows who he is and what he has done  and the bad things that he has done and is famous for  and as he walks towards her  uncertain  she knows him for what he is  even if he wishes he wasn   t  and reaches with both hands smoothly through the wicker basket they   ve put around her to keep her upright  and grabs him  and holds him tight as the torch drops down onto the oily wood and the flames spring up .  she never takes her eyes off him  and never loosens her grip     would you like a fresh cup of tea .      tiffany blinked away smoke and flames and shock .     and how do you know so much about it  please .     she said .      i was there .         a thousand years ago .         yes .         how did you get there .         i walked     said miss smith .     but that is not the point .  the point is that then was the death     and birth     of the thing we call the cunning man .  and he was still a man  to begin with .  he was terribly injured  of course .  for quite some time .  and witchfinding went on     oh my word  didn   t it just .  you couldn   t tell who the other witchfinders feared most  the witches  or the wrath of the cunning man if they didn   t find him the witches he demanded and believe me  with the cunning man on your heels  you will find as many witches as he wants  oh yes .      and the cunning man himself could always find witches .  it was quite amazing .  you would have some quiet little village where everybody got on reasonably well and no one had noticed any witches at all .  but when the cunning man arrived  suddenly there were witches everywhere  but unfortunately not for very long .  he believed that witches were the reason for just about everything bad that happened  and that they stole babies and caused wives to run away from their husbands  and milk to go sour .  i think my favourite one was that witches went to sea in eggshells in order to drown honest sailors .     at this point miss smith held up a hand .     no  don   t say that it would be impossible for even a small witch to get inside an eggshell without crushing it  because that is what we in the craft would call a logical argument and therefore no one who wanted to believe that witches sank ships would pay any attention to it .      it couldn   t go on  of course .  people can be very stupid  and people can be easily frightened  but sometimes you find people who aren   t that stupid and aren   t that fearful  and so the cunning man is thrust out of the world .  thrown out like the rubbish he is .      but that wasn   t the end of him .  so great  so fearsome was his hatred for anything that he thought of as witchcraft that he somehow managed to live on despite finally having no body .  though there was no skin to him  no bone any more  his rage was such that he lived on .  as a ghost  perhaps .  and  every so often  finding someone who would let him in .  there are plenty of people out there whose poisonous minds will open for him .  and there are those who would rather be behind evil than in front of it  and one of them wrote for him the book known as the bonfire of the witches .      but when he takes over a body     and believe me  in the past  there are those unpleasant people who have thought that their terrible ambitions would be furthered by allowing him to do so     the owner of the body soon finds they have no control at all .  they become a part of him too .  and not until it is too late do they realize that there is no escape  no release .  except death            poison goes where poison   s welcome     said tiffany .     but it looks as though it can push its way in  welcome or not .         i   m sorry     said miss smith     but i will say    well done .     you are as good as they say .  there really is nothing physical now to the cunning man .  nothing you can see .  nothing you can possess .  and while he often kills those who have been so generous in their hospitality  he nevertheless still appears to thrive .  without a body to call his own  he drifts on the wind and  i suppose  sleeps in some way .  and if he does  i know what he dreams of .  he dreams of a beautiful young witch  the most powerful of all the witches .  and he thinks of her with such hatred that  according to elasticated string theory  it goes all the way round the universe and comes back from a different direction so that it seems to be a kind of love .  and he wants to see her again .  in which case  she will almost certainly die .      some witches     real flesh and blood witches     have tried to fight him and have won .  and sometimes they tried  and died .  and then one day  a girl called tiffany aching  because of her disobedience  kissed the winter .  which  i have to say  no one has ever done before .  and the cunning man woke up .     miss smith put down her cup .     as a witch  you know you must have no fear .      tiffany nodded .      well  tiffany  you must make a place for fear  fear under control .  we think that the head is important  that the brain sits like a monarch on the throne of the body .  but the body is powerful too  and the brain cannot survive without it .  if the cunning man takes over your body  i don   t think you would be able to fight him .  he would be like nothing you have met before .  to be caught will be  ultimately  to die .  what is worse  to be his creature .  in which case  death will be a longed for release .  and there you have it  miss tiffany aching .  he wakes up  he drifts  he looks for her .  he looks for you .         well  at least we   ve found her     said rob anybody .     she   s somewhere in that festering midden .      the feegles stood with their mouths open in front of the bubbling  suppurating mess of the unreal estate .  mysterious things plopped  spun and exploded under the debris .      it will be certain death to go in there     said wee mad arthur .     certain death .  you   ll be doomed .         oh aye  we   re all doomed sooner or later     said rob anybody jovially .  he sniffed .     what the heel is that stink .         sorry  rob  that was me     said daft wullie .      ach no  i ken your smell     rob said .     but i ken i smelled it before .  it was that walking gawky that we smelled on the road .  ye ken .  all in black .  very lacking in the eyeball department .  bad cess to him  and bad cess he smelled .  and i recollect he used very bad words about oor big wee hag .  my jeannie said we must stay close to the big wee hag and i reckon this scunner needs a bath .      wee mad arthur precipitated matters .     weel  rob  ye going in there is against the law  ye ken .     he pointed to an ancient and half melted sign on which  just readable  were the words  access strictly forbidden .  by order .   rob anybody stared at it .     ach  now you give me nae choice at all     he said     and you made me remember that we   re all dead already .    charge .      there were dozens of questions that tiffany could ask but the one struggling to the top was     what will happen if the cunning man catches up with me .      miss smith stared at the ceiling for a moment .     well  i suppose from his point of view  it will be rather like a wedding .  from your point of view  it will be exactly like being dead .  no  worse  because you will be inside  looking out at what he can do with all your powers and all your skills to all the people that you know .  did we have the last cupcake .      i   m not going to show any fear  said tiffany to herself .      i   m glad to hear that     said miss smith out loud .   tiffany leaped off the chair in a rage .     don   t you dare do that  miss smith .         i   m sure there was one more cupcake     said miss smith  and then added     that   s the spirit  miss tiffany aching .         you know  i did defeat a hiver .  i can look after myself .         and your family .  and everybody you know .  from an attack that they won   t even know is happening .  you don   t understand .  the cunning man isn   t a man  although he was once  and now he   s not even a ghost .  he is an idea .  unfortunately he is an idea whose time has come .         well  at least i know when he   s near me     tiffany said thoughtfully .     there   s a dreadful stink .  even worse than the feegles .      miss smith nodded .     yes  it   s coming from his mind .  it   s the smell of corruption     corruption of thinking and of action .  your mind picks it up and doesn   t know what to do with it  so it files it under    stink    .  all the magically inclined can smell it  but when people encounter it  it changes them  makes them a little bit like him .  and so trouble follows wherever he goes .      and tiffany knew exactly what kind of trouble she meant  even though her memories shot her back in time to before the cunning man had woken again .   in her mind   s eye she could see the black edged pieces blowing back and forth in the late autumn wind  which sighed with despair in her mind   s ear  and worst of all  oh yes  worst of all  her mind   s nose snuffed up the sharp acrid stink of ancient  half burned paper .  in her memory some of the pieces fluttered in the pitiless wind like moths that had been swatted and broken  but were still hopelessly trying to fly .   and there were stars on them .   people had marched to the rough music and roughly dragged out the cracked old woman whose only crime  as far as tiffany could see  was that she had no teeth left and smelled of wee .  they had thrown stones  they had smashed windows  they had killed the cat  and all this had been done by good people  nice people  people that she knew and met every day  and they had done all these things which  even now  they never talked about .  it was a day that somehow had vanished from the calendar .  and on that day  with a pocketful of charred stars  not knowing what it was she was doing  but determined to do it  she had become a witch .      you said that others have fought him .     she said now to miss smith .     how did they manage it .         that last cupcake was still in the bag with the baker   s name on it  i   m sure of it .  you   re not sitting on it  are you .     miss smith cleared her throat and said     by being very powerful witches  by understanding what it means to be a powerful witch  and by taking every chance  using every trick and  i suspect  understanding the cunning man   s mind before he understands theirs .  i have trudged through a long time to learn about the cunning man     she added     and the one thing i can tell you for certain is that the way to kill the cunning man is with cunning .  you will need to be more cunning than he is .         he can   t be that cunning if he   s taken all this time to find me     said tiffany .      yes  that puzzles me     said miss smith .     and it should puzzle you .  i would have expected it to have taken him a very long time .  more than two years  anyway .  he   s either been very clever     and frankly he has nothing to be clever with     or somehow something else has drawn you to his attention .  someone magical  i would guess .  do you know any witches who aren   t your friend .         certainly not     said tiffany .     are any of the witches who have defeated him still alive .         yes .         i was wondering  if i found one     perhaps they could tell me how they did it .         i   ve told you .  he   s the cunning man .  why should he fall for the same trick twice .  you have to find your own way .  those who have trained you would expect nothing less .         this isn   t some kind of test  is it .     said tiffany  and then felt embarrassed at how lame that sounded .      don   t you remember what granny weatherwax always says .     said miss smith .      everything is a test .     they said it together with one voice  looked at one another and laughed .   at which point  there was a squawk .  miss smith opened the door and a small white chicken walked in  looked around curiously and exploded .  where it had been was an onion  fully rigged with mast and sails .      i   m sorry you had to see that     said miss smith .  she sighed .     happens all the time  i   m afraid .  the unreal estate is never static  you see .  all the magic  banging together  bits of spells winding themselves around other spells  whole new spells being created that nobody has ever thought of before     it   s a mess .  it generates things quite randomly .  yesterday i found a book on growing chrysanthemums  printed in copper on water .  you would think it would tend to slosh about a bit  but it all seemed to hang together until the magic ran out .         that was bad luck for the chicken     said tiffany nervously .      well  i can guarantee that it wasn   t a chicken two minutes ago     said miss smith     and now it   s probably enjoying being a seagoing vegetable .  now perhaps you can see why i don   t spend too much time down here .  i had an incident with a toothbrush once that i will not forget in a hurry .     she pushed open the door still further  and tiffany saw the shambles .   there was no mistaking a shambles .    well  there was at first and she mistook it for a heap of rubbish .      it   s amazing what you can find in your pockets if you   re in a magical junk yard     said miss smith calmly .   tiffany stared at the giant shambles again .     isn   t that a horse   s skull .    and isn   t that a bucket of tadpoles .         yes .  something alive always helps  don   t you find .      tiffany   s eyes narrowed .     but that is a wizard   s staff  isn   t it .  i thought they stopped working if a woman touched one .      miss smith smiled .     well  i   ve had mine ever since i was in my cradle .  if you know where to look  you can see the marks i made when i was teething .  it   s my staff and it works  although i have to say it started to work better when i took the knob off the end .  it didn   t do anything practical and it upsets the balance .  now  will you stop standing there with your mouth open .      tiffany   s mouth clamped shut  and then sprang open again .  a penny had dropped and it felt as if it had dropped from the moon .      you   re her  aren   t you .  you must be  you   re her .  eskarina smith  right .  the only woman who ever became a wizard .         somewhere inside  i suppose so  yes  but it seems such a long time ago  and you know  i never really felt like a wizard  so i never really worried about what anyone said .  and anyway  i had the staff  and no one could take that away from me .     eskarina hesitated for a moment  and then went on     that   s what i learned at university  to be me  just what i am  and not worry about it .  that knowledge is an invisible magical staff  all by itself .  look  i don   t really want to talk about this .  it brings back bad memories .         please forgive me     said tiffany .     i just couldn   t stop myself .  i   m very sorry if i have dredged up any scary recollections .      eskarina smiled .     oh  the scary ones are never a problem .  it   s good ones that can be difficult to deal with .     there was a click from the shambles .  eskarina stood up and walked over to it .     oh dear  of course  only the witch that makes it can read her own shambles  but trust me when i say that the way the skull has turned and the position of the pincushion along the axis of the spinning wheel mean that he is very close .  almost right on top of us  in fact .  or the random magic in this place may be confusing him  and you seem to be everywhere and nowhere  so he   ll go away soon and try to pick up the trail somewhere else .  and  as i mentioned  somewhere on the trail he will eat .  he   ll get into some fool   s head  and some old lady or some girl who is wearing quite dangerous cult symbols without an inkling of what they really mean will suddenly find herself hounded .  let us hope she can run .      tiffany looked around  bewildered .     and what happens will be my fault .         is that the sarcastic whine of a little girl or the rhetorical question of a witch with her own steading .      tiffany began to reply  and then stopped .     you can travel in time  can   t you .     she said .      yes .         then you know what i   m going to answer .         well  it   s not quite as simple as that     said eskarina  and looked slightly uncomfortable for a moment  much to tiffany   s surprise and  it has be said  delight .     i know  let me see  there are fifteen different replies you might make  but i don   t know which one it will be until you make it  because of the elasticated string theory .         then all i will say     said tiffany     is thank you very much .  i am sorry to have taken up your time .  but i need to be getting on  i have so many things to do .  do you know what the time is .         yes     said eskarina .     it is a way of describing one of the notional dimensions of four dimensional space .  but for your purposes  it   s about ten forty five .      that seemed to tiffany to be a bafflingly complicated way of answering the question  but as she opened her mouth to say so  the shambles collapsed and the door opened to let in a stampede of chickens     which did not  however  explode .   eskarina grabbed tiffany   s hand  shouting     he has found you .  i don   t know how .      a chicken half jumped  half flapped and half tumbled onto the wreck of the shambles and crowed .  cock a doodle crivens .   then the chickens exploded  they exploded into feegles .   on the whole there wasn   t a great deal of difference between the chickens and the feegles  since both run around in circles making a noise .  an important distinction  however  is that chickens are seldom armed .  the feegles  on the other hand  are armed all the time  and once they had shaken off the last of their feathers they fell to fighting one another out of embarrassment     and for something to do .   eskarina took one look at them and kicked at the wall behind her  revealing a hole which a person might just be able to crawl through  and snapped at tiffany     go .  get him away from here .  get on the stick as soon as you can and go .  don   t worry about me .  don   t be afraid  you will be all right .  you just have to help yourself .      heavy  nasty smoke was filling the room .     what do you mean .     tiffany managed  struggling with the stick .      go .      not even granny weatherwax could command tiffany   s legs so thoroughly .   she went .      in truth  the nac mac feegle believe that the world is such a wonderful place that in order to have got into it they must have been very good in another existence and had arrived in  as it were  heaven .  of course  they appeared to die sometimes  even here  but they like to think of it as going off to be born again .  numerous theologians had speculated that this was a stupid idea  but it was certainly more enjoyable than many other beliefs .        a witch made a shambles out of anything you happened to have in your pockets  but if you care about appearances  you paid attention to the things you    accidentally    had in your pockets .  it wouldn   t make any difference to how the shambles worked  but if there were going to be other people around  then a mysterious nut  or an interesting bit of wood  a piece of lace and a silver pin suggested    witch    rather more flatteringly than did  say  a broken shoelace  a torn piece of paper bag  half a handful of miscellaneous and unspeakable fluff  and a handkerchief which had been used so many times that  dreadfully  it needed both hands to fold it .  tiffany generally kept one pocket just for shambles ingredients  but if miss smith had made this shambles the same way  then she had pockets larger than a wardrobe  it nearly touched the ceiling .        a horse   s skull always looks scary  even if someone has put lipstick on it .       chapter     the duchess and the cook    tiffany liked flying .  what she objected to was being in the air  at least at a height greater than her own head .  she did it anyway  because it was ridiculous and unbecoming to witchcraft in general to be seen flying so low that her boots scraped the tops off ant hills .  people laughed  and sometimes pointed .  but now  navigating the stick through the ruined houses and gloomy  bubbling pools  she ached for the open sky .  it was a relief when she slid out from behind a stack of broken mirrors to see good clean daylight  despite the fact that she had emerged next to a sign which said  if you are close enough to read this sign  you really  really  shouldn   t be .   that was the last straw .  she tipped the stick until it was leaving a groove in the mud behind it  and ascended like a rocket  clinging desperately to the strap  which was creaking  to avoid slipping off .  she heard a small voice say     we are experiencing some turbulence  ye ken .  if ye look to the right and tae the left ye will see that there are no emergency exits        the speaker was interrupted by another voice  which said     in point o    fact  rob  the stick has got emergency exits all round  ye ken .         oh aye     said rob anybody     but there is such a thing as style  ok .  just waiting until ye have nearly hit the ground and stepping off makes us look like silly billys .      tiffany hung on  trying not to listen  and also trying not to kick feegles  who had no sense of danger  feeling as they always did that they were more dangerous than anything else .   finally she had the broomstick flying level and risked a look down .  there seemed to be a fight going on outside whatever it was they were going to decide was the new name of the king   s head  but you couldn   t see any sign of mrs proust .  the witch of the city was a woman of resource  wasn   t she .  mrs proust could look after herself .   mrs proust was looking after herself  by running very fast .  she hadn   t waited a second once she sensed the danger  but headed for the nearest alley as the smog rose around her .  the city was always full of smokes and smogs and fumes  easy work for a witch who had the knack .  they were the breath of the city  and its halitosis  and she could play them like a foggy piano .  and now she leaned against a wall and got some breath of her own .   she had felt it building up like a thunderstorm in a city that was normally remarkably easy going .  any woman who even looked like a witch was becoming a target .  she had to hope that old and ugly women everywhere were going to be as safe as she was .   a moment later  a couple of men burst out of the smog  one of them holding a large stick  the other one didn   t need a stick  because he was huge and therefore was his own stick .   as the man with the stick ran towards her  mrs proust tapped her foot on the pavement and the stone under the man   s feet tilted up  tripping him so that he landed safely on his chin with a crack  the stick rolling away .   mrs proust folded her arms and glared at the heavy man .  he wasn   t as stupid as his friend  but his fists were opening and closing and she knew it would only be a matter of time .  she tapped her foot on the stones again before he plucked up courage .   the big man was trying to work out what might happen next  but didn   t expect the equestrian statue   of lord alfred rust     famed for bravely and valiantly losing every military engagement in which he had ever taken part     to gallop out of the fog on bronze hooves and kick him so hard between the legs that he flew backwards and knocked his head on a lamppost before sliding to the ground .   mrs proust then recognized him as a customer who sometimes bought itching powder and exploding cigars from derek  it didn   t do to kill customers .  she picked him up  groaning  by his hair  and whispered into his ear     you weren   t here .  nor was i .  nothing happened  and you did not see it .     she thought for a moment and  because business is business added     and when you next go past boffo   s joke emporium  you will be taken with its range of extremely droll  practical jokes for all the family  and this week   s new    pearls of the pavement    naughty fido jokes for the connoisseur who takes his laughter seriously .  i look forward to the pleasure of your custom .  p . s .  our new range of    thunderbolt    exploding cigars are a laugh a minute  and please do try our hilariously funny rubber chocolate .  take a moment also to browse in our new gentlemen   s necessaries department for all that is best in moustache waxes  moustache cups  cut throat razors  a range of first class snuffs  ebony backed nose hair clippers and our ever popular glandular trousers  supplied in a plain wrapper and limited to one pair per customer .      satisfied  mrs proust let the head fall backwards and was forced to accept that unconscious people don   t buy anything  so she turned her attention to the previous owner of the stick  who was groaning .  well  yes  it was the fault of the man with no eyes  she thought  and perhaps that might be an excuse  but mrs proust wasn   t known for her forgiving nature .     poison goes where poison   s welcome     she said to herself .  she snapped her fingers  then climbed onto the bronze horse  taking a cold but comfortable seat in the late lord rust   s metal lap .  clanking and groaning  the bronze horse walked away into the bank of smog that followed mrs proust all the way back to her shop .   back in the alleyway  though  it seemed to be snowing  until you realized that what was falling from the sky onto the unconscious bodies had previously been in the stomachs of the pigeons who were now flocking in from every quarter of the city at mrs proust   s command .  she heard them and smiled grimly .     in this neighbourhood we don   t just watch .     she said with satisfaction .   tiffany felt better when the reek and smoke of the city was behind them again .  how do they live with the smell .  she wondered .  it   s worse than a feegle   s spog .     but now there were fields below her  and although the smoke from the burning stubbles reached this high  it was a fragrance compared to the world within the city walls .   and eskarina smith lived there     well  sometimes lived there .  eskarina smith .  she really was real .  tiffany   s mind raced almost as fast as the broomstick itself .  eskarina smith .  every witch had heard something about her  but no two witches agreed .   miss tick had said that eskarina was the girl that got a wizard   s staff by mistake .   the first witch ever trained by granny weatherwax .  who got her into unseen university by giving the wizards there a piece of her     that is to say  granny weatherwax   s     mind .  quite a large piece  if you listened to some of the stories  which included tales of magical battles .   miss level had assured tiffany that she was some kind of fairy story .   miss treason had changed the subject .   nanny ogg had tapped the side of her nose conspiratorially and whispered     least said  soonest mended .      and annagramma had loftily assured all the young witches that eskarina had existed  but was dead .   but there was one story that just would not go away and curled around truth and lies like honeysuckle .  it told the world that the young eskarina had met at the university a young man called simon who  it seemed  had been cursed by the gods with almost every possible ailment that mankind was prone to .  but  because the gods have a sense of humour  even though it   s a rather strange one  they had granted him the power to understand     well     everything .  he could barely walk without assistance  but was so brilliant that he managed to keep the whole universe in his head .   wizards with beards that went down to the floor would flock to hear him talk about space and time and magic as if they were all part of the same thing .  and young eskarina had fed him and cleaned him and helped him get about and learned from him     well     everything .   and  the rumours went  that she had learned secrets that made the mightiest of magics look like nothing more than conjuring tricks .  and the story was true .  tiffany had talked to it and had cupcakes with it  and there really was a woman  then  who could walk through time and make it take orders from her .  wow .   yes  and there was something very strange about eskarina     a sense not that she wasn   t all there  but that somehow she was everywhere else at the same time  and at this point tiffany saw the chalk on the skyline  shadowy and mysterious  like a beached whale .  it was still a long way off  but her heart leaped .  that was her ground  she knew every inch of it  and part of her was always there .  she could face anything there .  how could the cunning man  some old ghost  beat her on her own ground .  she had family there  more than she could count  and friends  more than     well  not so many now that she was a witch  but that was the way of the world .   tiffany was aware of somebody climbing up her dress .  this was not the problem it might have been  a witch would not  of course  dream of not wearing a dress  but if you were going to ride on a broomstick you definitely invested in some really tough pants  if possible with some padding .  it made your bum look bigger but it also made it warmer  and at a hundred feet above the ground  fashion rather took second place to comfort .  she glanced down .  there was a feegle there  wearing a watchman   s helmet  which appeared to have been hammered out of the top of an old salt cellar  an equally small breastplate and  amazingly  trousers and boots .  you never normally saw boots on a feegle .      you   re wee mad arthur  aren   t you .  i saw you at the king   s head .  you   re a policeman .         oh aye .     wee mad arthur grinned a grin that was pure feegle .     it   s a grand life in the watch  and the money is good .  a penny goes a lot further when it buys you food for a week .         so are you coming over here to keep our lads in order .  are you planning to stay .         oh no  i dinnae believe so .  i like the city  ye ken .  i like coffee that is nae made from them wee acorns and i goes to the theatre and the opera and the ballet .     the broomstick wobbled a little .  tiffany had heard of ballet  and had even seen pictures in a book  but it was a word that somehow did not fit in any sentence which included the word    feegle    .      ballet .     she managed .      oh aye  it   s grand .  last week i saw swan on a hot tin lake  a reworking of a traditional theme by one of our up and coming young performance artists  and the day after that  of course  there was a reinterpretation of die flabbergast at the opera house  and ye ken  they had a whole week of porcelain at the royal art museum  with a free thimble of sherry .  oh aye  it   s the city of culture  right enough .         are you sure that you are a feegle .     said tiffany in a fascinated voice .      that   s what they tell me  miss .  there is nae law says i cannot be interested in culture  is there .  i told the lads that when i go back i will take them along to see the ballet for themselves .      the stick seemed to fly itself for a while as tiffany stared at nothing  or rather at a mental picture of feegles in a theatre .  she had never been inside one herself  but she had seen pictures and the thought of feegles among ballerinas was so unthinkable that it was better to just let her mind boggle and then forget about it .  she remembered in time that she had a broomstick to land  and brought it down very neatly near the mound .   to her shock there were guards outside it .  human guards .   she stared in disbelief .  the baron   s guards never came up onto the downland .  never .  it was unheard of .  and     she felt the anger rising     one of them was holding a shovel .   she jumped off the stick so fast that it was left to skim over the turf  scattering feegles until it fetched up against an obstruction  shaking off the last few feegles that had managed to hang on .      you hold onto that shovel  brian roberts .     she screamed at the sergeant of the guard .     if you let it cut the turf there will be a reckoning .  how dare you .  why are you here .  and nobody is to cut anybody into pieces  do you all understand .      this last order was to the feegles  who had surrounded the men with a ring of small  but ever so sharp  swords .  a feegle claymore was so sharp that a human might not know his legs had been cut off until he tried to walk .  the guards themselves suddenly had the look of men who knew they were supposed to be big and strong but were now faced with the realization that    big    or    strong    wouldn   t be nearly enough .  they   d heard the stories  of course     oh yes  everyone on the chalk had heard the stories about tiffany aching and her little     helpers .  but they had only been stories  hadn   t they .  until now .  and they were threatening to run up their trousers .   in a shocked silence  tiffany looked around  panting for breath .  everyone was watching her now  which was better than everyone fighting  wasn   t it .      very well     she said like a schoolteacher who is only just satisfied with the naughty class .  she added a sniff  which would usually be translated to mean  i   m only just satisfied  mark you .  she sniffed again .     very well  then .  is anybody going to tell me what   s going on here .      the sergeant actually raised his hand .     can i have a word in private  miss .     tiffany was impressed that he had even been able to speak  given that his mind was trying to suddenly make sense of what his eyes were telling him .      very well  follow me .     she spun round suddenly  causing both guards and feegles to jump .     and nobody  and i mean nobody  is to dig up anybody   s home or cut off anybody   s legs while we are gone  is that understood .  i said  is that understood .     there was a mumbled chorus of yeses and oh ayes  but it didn   t include one from the face she was looking down at .  rob anybody was trembling with rage and crouching ready to spring .     did you hear me  rob anybody .      he glared at her  eyes ablaze .     i will give ye nae promise on that score  miss  hag though you may be .  where is my jeannie .  where are the others .  these scunners hae swords .  what were they going to do with them .  i will have an answer .         listen to me  rob     tiffany began  but stopped .  rob anybody   s face was dripping tears  and he was pulling desperately at his beard as he fought the horrors of his own imagination .  they were an inch from a war  tiffany reckoned .      rob anybody .  i am the hag o    these hills and i put an oath on you not to kill these men until i tell you to .  understand .      there was a crash as one of the guards fell over backwards in a faint .  now the girl was talking to the creatures .  and about killing them .  they weren   t used to this sort of thing .  usually the most exciting thing that happened was that the pigs got into the vegetable garden .   the big man of the feegles hesitated as his spinning brain digested tiffany   s order .  true  it wasn   t an order to kill anybody right now  but at least it held out the possibility that he might be able to do so very soon  so he could free his head from the terrible pictures in his mind .  it was like holding a hungry dog on a leash of cobweb  but at least it bought her time .      you will see that the mound has not been touched     said tiffany     so whatever may have been intended has not yet been achieved .     she turned back to the sergeant  who had gone white  and said     brian  if you want your men to live with all their arms and legs  you will tell them right now  and very carefully  to put down their weapons .  your lives depend on the honour of one feegle and he is driving himself mad with horror .  do it now .      to tiffany   s relief he gave the command  and the guards     glad to have their sergeant ordering them to do something that every atom in their bodies was telling them was exactly what they should be doing     dropped their weapons from their shaking hands .  one even raised his arms in the universal sign of surrender .  tiffany pulled the sergeant a little way away from the glowering feegles and whispered     what do you think you are doing  you stupid idiot .         orders from the baron  tiff .         the baron .  but the baron is           alive  miss .  he   s been back for three hours .  drove through the night  they say .  and people have been talking .     he looked down at his boots .     we were     we were  well  we were sent up here to find the girl that you gave to the fairies .  sorry  tiff .         gave .  gave .         i didn   t say it  tiff     said the sergeant  backing away     but  well  you hear stories .  i mean  no smoke without fire  right .      stories  thought tiffany .  oh yes  once upon a time there was a wicked old witch        and you think they apply to me  do you .  am i on fire or just smoking .      the sergeant shifted uneasily and sat down .     look  i   m just a sergeant  ok .  the young baron   s given me orders  yes .  and his word is law  right .         he may be the law down there .  up here  it   s me .  look over there .  yes  there .  what do you see .      the man looked where she pointed and his face paled .  the old cast iron wheels and stove with its short chimney were clearly visible  even though a flock of sheep was happily grazing around them as usual .  he leaped to his feet as if he had been sitting on an ant   s nest .      yes     said tiffany with some satisfaction .     granny aching   s grave .  remember her .  people said she was a wise woman  but at least they had the decency to make up better stories about her .  proposing to cut the turf .  i   m amazed that granny doesn   t rise up through the turf and bite your bum .  now take your men down the hill a little way and i will sort this out  you understand .  we don   t want anyone to get jumpy .      the sergeant nodded .  it was not as if he had any other option .   as the guards moved away  dragging their unconscious colleague with them and trying not to look like  well  guards who were turning a walk away as closely into a running away as was possible  tiffany knelt down by rob anybody and lowered her voice .      look  rob  i know about the secret tunnels .         what scunner told ye about the secret tunnels .         i am the hag o    the hills  rob     said tiffany soothingly .     shouldn   t i know about the tunnels .  you are feegles  and no feegle will sleep in a house with only one entrance  right .      the feegle was calming down a bit now .     oh aye  ye have a point there .         then can i please suggest you go and fetch young amber .  nobody is going to touch the mound .      after a little hesitation  rob anybody sprang into the entrance hole and was gone .  it took some time for him to return     time tiffany thankfully used by getting the sergeant to come back and help her gather up the guards    dropped weapons     and when rob did resurface he was accompanied by a great many more feegles and the kelda .  and also by a rather reluctant amber  who blinked nervously in the daylight and said     oh  crivens .      tiffany knew that her own smile was false when she said     i   ve come to take you home  amber .     well  at least i   m not stupid enough to say something like    won   t that be nice .     she added to herself .   amber glared at her .     ye willnae get me back in that place     she announced     and ye can stick it where the monkey put his jumper .      and i don   t blame you  thought tiffany  but now i can pass for being a grown up and i have to say some stupid grown up things         but you do have a mother and father  amber .  i   m sure they miss you .      she winced at the look of scorn the girl gave her .      oh aye  and if the old scunner misses me he   ll aim another blow .         maybe we can go together  and help him change his ways .     tiffany volunteered  despising herself  but the image of those thick fingers heavy with nettle stings from that awful bouquet wouldn   t go away .   this time amber actually laughed .     sorry  mistress  but jeannie told me you were clever .      what was it that granny weatherwax had said once .     evil begins when you begin to treat people as things .     and right now it would happen if you thought there was a thing called a father  and a thing called a mother  and a thing called a daughter  and a thing called a cottage  and told yourself that if you put them all together you had a thing called a happy family .   aloud  she said     amber  i want you to come with me to see the baron  so that he knows you are safe .  after that  you can do as you please .  that   s a promise .      tiffany felt a knocking on her boot  and looked down at the kelda   s worried face .     can i have a wee word with ye .     said jeannie .  beside her  amber was crouching down so that she could hold the kelda   s other hand .   then jeannie spoke again  if it was speech  and not song .  but what could you sing that stayed in the air  so that the next note twisted around it .  what could be sung that seemed to be a living sound that sung itself right back to you .   and then the song was gone  leaving only a hole and a loss .      that   s a kelda song     said jeannie .     amber heard me singing it to the little ones .  it   s part of the soothings  and she understood it  tiffany .  i gave her nae help but she understood it .  i know the toad has tol    ye this .  but do ye ken what i am telling ye now .  she recognizes meaning  and learns it .  she is as close to being a kelda as any human could be .  she is a treasure not to be thrown away .       the words came out with unusual force for the kelda  who was usually so softly spoken .  and tiffany recognized it as helpful information that  ever so nicely  was a kind of threat .   even the journey off the downland and into the village had to be negotiated .  tiffany  holding amber by the hand  walked past the waiting guards and continued on  much to the embarrassment of the sergeant .  after all  if you have been sent to bring somebody in  then you are going to look pretty silly if they go and bring themselves in by  as it were  themselves .  but on the other hand  if tiffany and amber walked behind the guards  it looked as though they were being driven  this was sheep country  after all  and everybody knew  didn   t they  that the sheep walked in front and a shepherd walked behind .   finally they compromised on a rather awkward method where they all moved forward with a certain amount of revolving and shuffling that made it look as if they were travelling by square dance .  tiffany had to spend a lot of the time stopping amber from giggling .   that was the funny part .  it would have been nice if the funny part could have lasted longer .      look  i was only told to fetch the girl     said the sergeant desperately as they walked through the castle gates .     you don   t have to come .     he said this in a way which meant  please  please  don   t barge in and show me up in front of my new boss .  but it didn   t work .   the castle was what was once called a bustle  which meant extremely busy  with cross people running around at cross purposes in every direction except straight up .  there was going to be a funeral and then there was going to be a wedding  and two big occasions so close together could test the resources of a small castle to the utmost  especially since people who would come a long way for one would probably stay for the other  saving time but causing extra work for everybody .  but tiffany was glad for the absence  now  of miss spruce  who had been altogether too unpleasant by half and had never been one to get her hands dirty .   and then there would always be the problem of seating .  most of the guests would be aristocrats  and it was vitally important that no one had to sit next to somebody who was related to someone who had killed one of their ancestors at some time in the past .  given that the past is a very big place  and taking into account the fact that everybody   s ancestors were generally trying to kill everybody else   s ancestors  for land  money or something to do  it needed very careful trigonometry to avoid another massacre taking place before people had finished their soup .   none of the servants seemed to pay any particular attention to tiffany  amber or the guards  though at one point tiffany thought she saw someone making one of those tiny little signs people make when they think they need protection from evil     here  in her place .      and she had the strong feeling that somehow the people were not paying attention in a very definite way of not paying attention  as if looking at tiffany might be dangerous to the health .  when tiffany and amber were ushered into the baron   s study  it seemed that he was not going to take much notice of them either .  he was bent over a sheet of paper that covered the whole of his desk  and was holding in his hand a bundle of different coloured pencils .   the sergeant coughed  but even choking to death would not have shaken the baron   s concentration .  finally  tiffany shouted    roland .     quite loudly .  he spun round  his face red with embarrassment and a side order of anger .      i would prefer    my lord     miss aching     he said sharply .      and i would prefer    tiffany     roland     said tiffany  with a calmness that she knew annoyed him .   he laid down his pencils with a click .     the past is past  miss aching  and we are different people .  it would be just as well if we remembered that  don   t you think .         the past was only yesterday     said tiffany     and it would be just as well if you remembered that there was a time when i called you roland and you called me tiffany  don   t you think .     she reached up to her neck and pulled off the necklace with the silver horse that he had given her .  it felt like a hundred years ago now  but this necklace had been important .  she had even stood up to granny weatherwax for this necklace .  and now she held the necklace like an accusation .     the past needs to be remembered .  if you do not know where you come from  then you don   t know where you are  and if you don   t know where you are  then you don   t know where you   re going .      the sergeant looked from one to the other  and with that instinct for survival that any soldier develops by the time he   s become a sergeant  decided to leave the room before things started getting thrown .      i   ll just go and see to the  er     the     things that need seeing to  if that   s ok .     he said  opening and closing the door so quickly that it slammed back tightly on the last syllable .  roland stared at it for a moment  and then turned .      i know where i am  miss aching .  i am standing in my father   s shoes  and he is dead .  i have been running this estate for years  but everything i did  i did in his name .  why did he die  miss aching .  he wasn   t all that old .  i thought you could do magic .      tiffany looked down at amber  who was listening with interest .     is this best discussed later .     she said .     you wanted your men to bring you this girl  and here she is  healthy in mind and body .  and i did not  as you say  give her to the fairies  she was a guest of the nac mac feegle  whose help you have had on more than one occasion .  and she went back there of her own free will .     she looked carefully at roland   s face  and said     you don   t remember them  do you .      she could see that he didn   t  but his mind was struggling with the fact that there was definitely something that he should have remembered .  he was a prisoner of the fairy queen  tiffany reminded herself .  forgetfulness can be a blessing  but i wonder what horrors were in his mind when the pettys told him that she had taken their girl to the feegles .  to fairies .  how could i imagine what he felt .   she softened her voice a little .     you remember something vague about fairies  yes .  nothing bad  i hope  but nothing very clear  as if perhaps it was something you read in a book  or a story that somebody told you when you were little .  am i right .      he glowered at her  but the spill word that he had strangled on his lips told her that she was right .      they call it the last gift     she said .     it   s part of the soothings .  it is for when it is best for everybody that you forget things that were too awful  and also the things that were too wonderful .  i   m telling you this  my lord  because roland is still in there somewhere .  by tomorrow you will forget even what i have told you .  i don   t know how it works  but it works for nearly everybody .         you took the child from her parents .  they came to see me as soon as i arrived this morning .  everyone came to see me this morning .  did you kill my father .  did you steal money from him .  did you try to throttle old petty .  did you beat him with nettles .  did you fill his cottage with demons .  i can   t believe i just asked you that question  but mrs petty appears to think so .  personally  i don   t know what to think  especially since some fairy woman might be messing around with my thoughts .  do you understand me .      while tiffany was trying to put together some kind of coherent answer  he flopped down in the ancient chair behind the desk and sighed .      i have been told you were standing over my father with a poker in your hand  and that you demanded money from him     he said sadly .      that   s not true .         and would you tell me if it was .         no .  because there never would be a was .  i would never do such a thing .  well  perhaps i was standing over him            ah ha .         don   t you dare ah ha me  roland  don   t you dare .  look  i know people have been telling you things  but they are not true .         but you just admitted that you were standing over him  yes .         it   s simply that he wanted me to show him how i keep my hands clean .     she regretted this as soon as she said it .  it was true  but what did that matter .  it didn   t sound true .     look  i can see that it           and you didn   t steal a bag of money .         no .         and you don   t know anything about a bag of money .         yes  your father asked me to take one out of the metal chest .  he wanted to        roland interrupted her .     where is that money now .     his voice was flat and without expression .      i have no idea     said tiffany .  and as his mouth opened again  she shouted     no .  you will listen  understand .  sit there and listen .  i attended your father for the better part of two years .  i liked the old man and i would do nothing to hurt him or you .  he died when it was his time to die .  when that time comes  there is nothing anyone can do .         then what is magic for .      tiffany shook her head .     magic  as you call it  kept the pain away  and don   t you dare think that it came without a price .  i have seen people die  and i promise you your father died well  and thinking of happy days .      tears were streaming down roland   s face  and she sensed his anger at being seen like that  stupid anger  as if tears made him less of a man and less of a baron .   she heard him mutter     can you take away this grief .         i   m sorry     she replied quietly .     everyone asks me .  and i would not do so even if i knew how .  it belongs to you .  only time and tears take away grief  that is what they are for .      she stood up and took amber   s hand  the girl was watching the baron intently .      i   m going to take amber home with me     tiffany announced     and you look as if you need a decent sleep .      this didn   t get a response .  he sat there  staring at the paperwork as if hypnotized by it .  that wretched nurse  she thought .  i might have known she would make trouble .  poison goes where poison   s welcome  and in miss spruce   s case  it would have been welcomed with cheering crowds and possibly a small brass band .  yes  the nurse would have invited the cunning man in .  she was exactly the sort of person who would let him in  give him power  envious power  jealous power  prideful power .  but i know i haven   t done anything wrong  she told herself .  or have i .  i can only see my life from the inside  and i suppose that on the inside nobody does anything wrong .  oh  blast it .  everybody brings their troubles to the witch .  but i can   t blame the cunning man for everything people have said .  i just wish there was somebody     other than jeannie     to talk to who would take no notice of the pointy hat .  so what do i do now .  yes  what do i do now  miss aching .  what would you advise  miss aching  who is so good at making decisions for other people .  well  i would advise that you get some sleep as well .  you didn   t sleep too well last night  what with mrs proust being a champion snorer  and an awful lot has happened since then .  also  i cannot remember when you last ate regular meals  and may i also point out that you are talking to yourself .   she looked down at roland slumped in the chair  his gaze far away .     i said i am taking amber home with me for now .      roland shrugged .     well  i can hardly stop you  can i .     he said sarcastically .     you are the witch .             tiffany   s mother uncomplainingly made up a bed for amber  and tiffany dropped off to sleep in her own bed at the other end of the big bedroom .   she woke up on fire .  flames filled the entire room  flickering orange and red but burning as gently as the kitchen stove .  there was no smoke  and although the room felt warm  nothing was actually burning .  it was as if fire had just dropped in for a friendly visit  not for business .  its flames rustled .   enthralled  tiffany held a finger to the flame and raised it as if the little flame was as harmless as a baby bird .  it seemed to get colder but she blew on it anyway  and it plopped back into life .   tiffany got carefully out of the burning bed  and if this was a dream it was making a very good job of the tinkles and pings that the ancient bed traditionally made .  amber was lying peacefully on the other bed under a blanket of flame  as tiffany watched  the girl turned over and the flames moved with her .   being a witch meant that you didn   t simply run around shouting just because your bed was on fire .  after all  it was no ordinary fire  a fire that did not harm .  so it   s in my head  she thought .  fire that does no harm .  the hare runs into the fire     somebody is trying to tell me something .   silently  the flames went out .  there was an almost imperceptible blur of movement in the window and she sighed .  the feegles never gave up .  ever since she was nine years old  she had known that they watched over her at night .  they still did  which was why she bathed in a hip bath behind a sheet .  in all probability she hadn   t got anything that the nac mac feegles would be interested in looking at  but it made her feel better .   the hare runs into the fire     it certainly sounded like a message that she had to work out  but who from .  from the mysterious witch who had been watching her  maybe .  omens were all very well  but sometimes it would help if people just wrote things down .  it never paid  though  to ignore those little thoughts and coincidences  those sudden memories  little whims .  quite often they were another part of your mind  trying hard to get a message through to you     one that you were too busy to notice .  but it was bright daylight outside and puzzles could wait .  other things couldn   t .  she   d start at the castle .      my dad beat me up  didn   t he .     said amber in a matter of fact voice as they walked towards the grey towers .     did my baby die .         yes .         oh     said amber in the same flat voice .      yes     said tiffany .     i   m sorry .         i can sort of remember  but not exactly     said amber .     it   s all a bit     fuzzy .         that   s the soothings working .  jeannie has been helping you .         i understand     said the girl .      you do .     said tiffany .      yes     said amber .     but my dad  is he going to get into trouble .      he would if i told how i found you  tiffany thought .  the wives would see to it .  the village people had a robust attitude to the punishing of boys  who almost by definition were imps of mischief and needed to be tamed  but hitting a girl that hard .  not good .     tell me about your young man     she said aloud instead .     he is a tailor  isn   t he .      amber beamed  and amber could light up the world with a smile .      oh yes .  his grandad learned him a lot before he died .  he can make just about anything out of cloth  can my william .  everyone around here says he should be put to an apprenticeship and he   d be a master himself in a few years .     then she shrugged .     but masters want paying for the learning of the knowing  and his mum is never going to find the money to buy him an indenture .  oh  but my william has wonderful fine fingers  and he helps his mum with the sewing of her corsets and making beautiful wedding dresses .  that means working with satins and suchlike     said the girl proudly .     and william   s mum is much complimented on the fineness of the stitching .     amber beamed with second hand pride .  tiffany looked at the glowing face  where the bruises  despite the kelda   s soothing touch  were still quite plain .   so the boyfriend is a tailor  she thought .  to big beefy men like mr petty  a tailor was hardly a man at all  with his soft hands and indoor work .  and if he stitched clothes for ladies too  well  that was even more shame that the daughter would be bringing to the unhappy little family .      what do you want to do now  amber .     she said .      i   d like to see my mum     said the girl promptly .      but supposing you meet your dad .      amber turned to her .     then i   ll understand     please don   t do anything nasty to him  like turn him into a pig or something .      a day as a pig might help him mend his ways  thought tiffany .  but there was something of the kelda in the way that amber had said     i   ll understand .     a shining light in a dark world .   tiffany had never seen the gates of the castle closed shut except at night .  by day it was a mixture of the village hall  a place for the carpenter and the blacksmith to set up shop  a space for the children to play in when it rained and  for that matter  for temporarily storing the harvests of hay and wheat  at those times when the barns alone could not cope .  there wasn   t much room in even the biggest cottage  if you wanted a bit of peace and quiet  or somewhere to think  or somebody to talk to  you wandered over to the castle .  it always worked .   at least by now the shock of the new baron   s return had worn off  but the place was still humming with activity when tiffany entered  but it was rather subdued and people were not talking very much .  possibly the reason for this was the duchess  roland   s mother in law to be  who was striding around in the great hall and occasionally prodding people with a stick .  tiffany didn   t believe it the first time that she saw it  but there it was again     a shiny black stick with a silver knob on the end with which she prodded a maid carrying a basket of laundry .  it was only at this point that tiffany noticed  too  the future bride trailing behind her mother as if she was too embarrassed to go much closer to somebody who prodded people with sticks .   tiffany was going to protest  and then felt curious as she glanced around .  she stepped back a few paces and let herself disappear .  it was a knack and a knack that she was good at .  it wasn   t invisibility  just that people didn   t notice you .  all unseen  she drifted close enough to hear what the pair of them were saying  or at least what the mother was saying and the daughter was listening to .   the duchess was complaining .     been allowed to go to rack and ruin .  really  it needs a thorough overhaul .  you cannot afford to be lax in a place like this .  firmness is everything .  heaven knows what this family thought it was doing .      her speech was punctuated by the whack of the stick on the back of another maid who was hurrying  but clearly not hurrying fast enough  under the weight of a basket full of laundry .      you must be rigorous in your duty to see that they are equally rigorous in theirs     the duchess went on  scanning the hall for another target .     the laxity will stop .  you see .  you see .  they do learn .  you must never relax your guard in your pursuit of slovenliness  both in deed and manner .  do not suffer any undue familiarity .  and that  of course  includes smiles .  oh  you may think  what could be so bad about a happy smile .  but the innocent smile can so easily become a knowing smirk  and suggests perhaps the sharing of a joke .  are you listening to what i   m telling you .      tiffany was astonished .  single handedly the duchess had made her do something that she never thought she would do  which was to feel sorry for the bride to be  who at this point was standing in front of her mother like a naughty child .   her hobby  and quite possibly one activity in life  was painting in watercolours  and although tiffany was trying  against the worst of her instincts  to be generous to the girl  there was no denying that she looked like a watercolour     and not just a watercolour  but a watercolour painted by someone who had not much colour but large supplies of water  giving her the impression of not only being colourless but also rather damp .  you could add  too  that there was so little of her that in a storm it might be quite possible that she would snap .  unseen as she was  tiffany felt just the tiniest pang of guilt and stopped inventing other nasty things to think .  besides  compassion was setting in  blast it .      now  letitia  recite again the little poem that i taught you     said the duchess .   the bride to be  not just blushing but melting in embarrassment and shame  looked around like a stranded mouse on a great wide floor  uncertain of which way to run .      if you     her mother prompted irritably  and gave her a prod with the stick .      if you        the girl managed .     if you     if you grasp the nettle lightly  it will sting you for your pain  but if you grasp the nettle boldly  soft as silk it will remain .  so it is with human nature  treat them kindly  they rebel  but if you firmly grasp the nettle  then your bidding they do well .      tiffany realized  as the damp little voice faded away  that there was otherwise absolute silence in the hall and everybody was staring .  she rather hoped that somebody might forget themselves sufficiently to start clapping  although that would probably mean the end of the world .  instead  the bride took one look at the open mouths and fled  sobbing  as fast as her very expensive but seriously impractical shoes would carry her  tiffany heard them clicking madly all the way up the stairs  followed very shortly afterwards by the slamming of a door .   tiffany walked away slowly  just a shadow in the air to anyone who wasn   t paying attention .  she shook her head .  why had he done it .  why in the world had roland done it .  roland could have married anyone .  not tiffany herself  of course  but why had he chosen that  well     not to be unpleasant     skinny girl .   and her father had been a duke  her mother was a duchess and she was a duckling     well  one might try to be charitable  but she did tend to walk like one .  well  she did .  if you looked carefully you could see her feet stuck out .   and if you cared about these things  the dreadful mother and the soppy daughter outranked roland .  they could officially bully him .   the old baron  now  had been a different sort of person .  oh yes  he liked it if the children gave a little bow or curtsied if he passed them in the lane  but he knew everybody   s name  and generally their birthdays as well  and he was always polite .  tiffany remembered him stopping her one day and saying     would you be so kind as to ask your father to come and see me  please .     it was such a gentle phrase for a man with such power .   her mother and father used to argue about him  when they thought she was safely tucked up in bed .  in between the symphony of the bedsprings she often heard them almost  but not exactly  having a row .  her father would say things like     it   s all very well you saying he is generous and all that  but don   t you tell me that his ancestors didn   t get their money by grinding the faces of the poor .     and her mother would retort     i have never seen him grind anything .  anyway  that was the olden days .  you   ve got to have someone to protect us .  that stands to reason .     and her father would come back with something along the lines of     protect us from who .  another man with a sword .  i reckon we could do that by ourselves .     and around this time the conversation would peter out  since her parents were still in love  in a comfortable type of way  and neither of them really wanted anything to change at all .   it seemed to her  looking down the length of the hall  that you didn   t need to grind the faces of the poor if you taught them to do their own grinding .   the shock of the thought made her giddy  but it stayed in her mind .  the guards were all local boys  or married to local girls  and what would happen if everybody in the village got together and said to the new baron     look  we will let you stay here  and you can even sleep in the big bedroom  and of course we   ll give you all your meals and flick a duster around from time to time  but apart from that this land is ours now  do you understand .     would it work .   probably not .  but she remembered asking her father to get the old stone barn cleaned up .  that would be a start .  she had plans for the old barn .      you there .  yes .  you there in the shadows .  are you lollygagging .      this time she paid attention .  all that thinking had meant that she hadn   t paid enough attention to her little don   t see me trick .  she stepped out of the shadows  which meant that the pointy black hat was not just a shadow .  the duchess glared at it .   it was time for tiffany to break the ice  even though it was so thick as to require an axe .  she said politely     i don   t know how to lollygag  madam  but i will do my best .         what .  what .  what did you call me .      the people in the hall were learning fast and they were scuttling as quickly as they could to get out of the place  because the duchess   s tone of voice was a storm warning  and nobody likes to be out in a storm .   the sudden rage overtook tiffany .  it wasn   t as if she had done anything to deserve being shouted at like that .  she said     i   m sorry  madam  i did not call you anything  to the best of my belief .      this did not do anything to help  the duchess   s eyes narrowed .     oh  i know you .  the witch     the witch girl who followed us to the city on who knows what dark errand .  oh  we know about witches where i   m from .  meddlers  sowers of doubt  breeders of discontent  lacking all morality  and charlatans into the bargain .      the duchess pulled herself right up and glowered at tiffany as if she had just won a decisive victory .  she tapped her cane on the ground .   tiffany said nothing  but nothing was hard to say .  she could sense the watching servants behind curtains and pillars  or peering around doors .  the woman was smirking  and really needed that smirk removed  because tiffany owed it to all witches to show the world that a witch could not be treated like this .  on the other hand  if tiffany spoke her mind it would certainly be taken out on the servants .  this needed some delicate wording .  it did not get it  because the old bat gave a nasty little snigger and said     well  child .  aren   t you going to try to turn me into some kind of unspeakable creature .      tiffany tried .  she really tried .  but there are times when things are just too much .  she took a deep breath .      i don   t think i shall bother  madam  seeing as you are making such a good job of it yourself .      the sudden silence was nevertheless peppered with little sounds like a guard behind a pillar sticking his hand over his mouth so that his shocked laughter would not be heard  and a splutter as     on the other side of a curtain     a maid almost achieved the same thing .  but it was the tiny little click of a door high above that stayed in tiffany   s memory .  was that letitia .  had she overheard .  well  it didn   t matter  because the duchess was gloating now  with tiffany safely in the palm of her hand .   she shouldn   t have risen to the stupid insults  whoever was listening .  and now the woman was going to take terrible delight in making trouble for tiffany  anyone near to her and quite probably everyone she   d ever known .   tiffany felt chilly sweat running down her back .  it had never been like this before     not even with the wintersmith  not even annagramma being unpleasant on a bad day  not even the fairy queen  who was good at spite .  the duchess beat them all  she was a bully  the kind of bully who forces her victim into retaliation  which therefore becomes the justification for further and nastier bullying  with collateral damage to any innocent bystanders who would be invited by the bully to put the blame for their discomfiture onto the victim .   the duchess looked around the shadowy hall .     is there a guard here .     she waited in delighted malice .     i know there is a guard here somewhere .      there was the sound of hesitant footsteps and preston  the trainee guard  appeared from out of the shadows and walked a nervous walk towards tiffany and the duchess .  of course  it would have to be preston  tiffany thought  the other guards would be too experienced to risk a generous helping of the duchess   s wrath .  and he was smiling nervously too  not a good thing to do when dealing with people like the duchess .  at least he had the sense to salute when he reached her  and by the standards of people who had never been told how to salute properly  and in any case had to do so very rarely  it was a good salute .   the duchess winced .     why are you grinning  young man .      preston gave the question some serious thought  and said     the sun is shining  madam  and i am happy being a guard .         you will not grin at me  young man .  smiling leads to familiarity  which i will not tolerate at any price .  where is the baron .      preston shifted from one foot to the other .     he is in the crypt  madam  paying his respects to his father .         you will not call me madam .     madam    is a title for the wives of grocers .  nor can you call me    my lady     which is a title for the wives of knights and other riffraff .  i am a duchess and am therefore to be addressed as    your grace    .  do you understand .         yes     m     your grace .     preston threw in another salute in self defence .   for a moment  at least  the duchess seemed satisfied  but it was definitely among the shorter kinds of moments .      very well .  and now you will take this creature        she waved a hand towards tiffany        and lock her in your dungeon .  do you understand me .      shocked  preston looked to tiffany for guidance .  she gave him a wink  just to keep his spirits up .  he turned back to the duchess .      lock her in the dungeon .      the duchess glared at him .     that is what i said .      preston frowned .     are you sure .     he said .     it means taking the goats out .         young man  it is not my concern what you do with the goats .  i order you to incarcerate this witch immediately .  now  get on with it  or i will see to it that you lose your position .      tiffany was already impressed with preston  but now he won a medal .     can   t do that     he said         cause of happy ass .  the sergeant told me all about it .  happy ass .  happy ass corp ass .  means you can   t just lock somebody away if they haven   t broken the law .  happy ass corp ass .  it   s all written down .  happy ass corp ass     he repeated helpfully .   this defiance seemed to push the duchess beyond rage and into some sort of fascinated horror .  this spotty faced youth in ill fitting armour was defying her over some stupid words .  such a thing had never happened to her before .  it was like finding out that frogs talked .  that would be very fascinating and everything  but sooner or later a talking frog has to be squashed .      you will hand in your armour and leave this castle forthwith  do you understand .  you are sacked .  you have lost your position and i will make it my business to see that you never get a job as a guard ever again  young man .      preston shook his head .     can   t happen like that  your lady grace .      cause of happy ass corp ass .  the sergeant said to me     preston  you stick to happy ass corp ass .  it is your friend .  you can stand on happy ass corp ass .         the duchess glared at tiffany  and since tiffany   s silence appeared to annoy her even more than anything she would have to say  she smiled and said nothing  in the hope that the duchess might possibly explode .  instead  and as expected  she turned on preston .      how dare you talk back to me like that  you scoundrel .     she raised the shiny stick with the knob on it .  but suddenly  it seemed immovable .      you will not hit him  madam     said tiffany in a calm voice .     i will see your arm breaks before you strike him .  we do not strike people in this castle .      the duchess snarled and tugged at the stick  but neither stick nor arm seemed to want to move .      in a moment  the stick will come free     said tiffany .     if you attempt to strike anyone with it again  i will break it in half .  please understand that this is not a warning     it is a forecast .      the duchess glared at her  but must have seen something in tiffany   s face that her own resolute stupidity could worry about .  she let go of the stick and it fell to the floor .     you have not heard the last of this  witch girl .         just witch  madam .  just witch     said tiffany as the woman strutted at speed out of the hall .      are we going to get into trouble .     said preston quietly .   tiffany gave a little shrug .     i will see to it that you don   t     she said .  and she thought  and so will the sergeant .  i   ll make sure of it .  she looked around the hall and saw the faces of the watching servants hurriedly turn away  as if they were afraid .  there wasn   t any real magic  she thought .  i just stood my ground .  you have to stand your ground  because it   s your ground .      i was wondering     said preston     if you were going to turn her into a cockroach and stamp on her .  i   ve heard that witches can do that     he added hopefully .      well  i won   t say that it is impossible     said tiffany     but you won   t see a witch doing it .  besides  there are practical problems .      preston nodded sagely .     well  yes     he said .     the different body mass for one thing  which would mean you would end up with either one enormous human sized cockroach  which i think would probably collapse under its own weight  or dozens or even hundreds of people shaped cockroaches .  but the snag there  i think  might be that their brain might work very badly     though  of course  if you had the right spells  i suppose you could magic all the bits of the human that wouldn   t fit into the cockroach into some kind of big bucket so they could use it to get themselves bigger again when they were tired of being small .  but the problem there would be what happened if some hungry dog came along when the lid was off .  that would be quite bad .  sorry  have i said something wrong .         er  no     said tiffany .     er  don   t you think that you   re a bit too smart to be a guard  preston .      preston shrugged .     well  the lads all think that i am useless     he said cheerfully .     they think that there   s got to be something wrong with someone who can pronounce the word    marvellous    .         but  preston     i know you are very clever and sufficiently erudite to know the meaning of the word    erudite    .  why do you sometimes pretend to be stupid     you know  like    doctrine    and    happy ass corp ass    .      preston grinned .     i was unfortunately born clever  miss  and i   ve learned that sometimes it   s not such a good idea to be all that clever .  saves trouble .      right now  it seemed to tiffany that the clever thing would be not to be in the hall any longer .  surely the horrible woman couldn   t do too much damage  could she .  but roland had been so strange  acting as if they had never been friends  sounding as though he believed every complaint against her     he had never been like that before .  oh  yes     he was mourning his father  but he just didn   t seem     himself .  and that dreadful old baggage had just bundled off to harry him while he was saying goodbye to his father in the coolness of the crypt  trying to find a way of saying the words that there had never been time for  trying to make up for too much silence  trying to bring back yesterday and nail it firmly to now .   everyone did that .  tiffany had come back from quite a few deathbeds  and some were very nearly merry  where some decent old soul was peacefully putting down the weight of their years .  or they could be tragic  when death had needed to bend down to harvest his due  or  well  ordinary     sad but expected  one light blinking off in a sky full of stars .  and she had wondered  as she made tea  and comforted people  and listened to the tearful stories about the good old days from people who always had words left over that they thought should have been spoken .  and she had decided that they weren   t there to be said in the past  but remembered in the here and now .      what do you think about the word    conundrum    .      tiffany stared at preston  her mind still full of words people never said .     what was that you asked .     she said  frowning .      the word    conundrum        preston repeated helpfully .     when you say the word  doesn   t it look in your head like a copper coloured snake  curled up asleep .      now  tiffany thought  during a day like this  anyone who wasn   t a witch would dismiss that as a bit of silliness  so that means i shouldn   t .   preston was the worst dressed guard in the castle  the newest guard always was .  to him were given chain mail trousers that were mostly full of holes   and suggested  against everything we know about moths  that moths could eat through steel .  to him was given the helmet that  no matter what size your head was  would slide down and make your ears look big  and this was not forgetting that he had also inherited a breastplate with so many holes in it that it might be more useful for straining soup .   but his gaze was always alert  to the point where it made people uneasy .  preston looked at things .  really looked at things  so intensely that afterwards they must have felt really looked at .  she had no idea what went on in his head  but it was surely pretty crowded .      well  i must say i   ve never thought about that word    conundrum        she said slowly     but it is certainly metallic and slithery .         i like words     said preston .        forgiveness     doesn   t it sound like what it is .  doesn   t it sound like a silk handkerchief gently falling down .  and what about    susurration    .  doesn   t it sound to you like whispered plots and dark mysteries .      sorry  is something wrong .         yes  i think something may be wrong     said tiffany  looking at preston   s worried face .     susurration    was her favourite word  she had never met anyone else who even knew it .     why are you a guard  preston .         don   t like sheep very much  not very strong so i can   t be a ploughman  too ham fisted to be a tailor  too scared of drowning to run away to sea .  my mother taught me to read and write  much against my dad   s wishes  and since that meant i was no good for a proper job  i got packed off to be an apprentice priest in the church of om .  i quite liked that  i learned a lot of interesting words  but they threw me out for asking too many questions  such as     is this really true or what .        he shrugged .     actually  i quite like the guarding .     he reached down and pulled a book out of his breastplate  which in fact could have accommodated a small library  and went on    there   s plenty of time for reading if you keep out of sight  and the metaphysics is quite interesting as well .      tiffany blinked .     i think you just lost me there  preston .         really .     said the boy .     well  for example  when i   m on night duty and somebody comes to the gate  i have to say    who goes there  friend or foe .     to which  of course  the correct answer is    yes    .      it took tiffany a moment to work this one out  and she began to have some insight into how preston might have a problem holding down a job .  he continued     the conundrum begins if the person at the gate says    friend     since they may well be lying  but the lads who have to go out at night have very cleverly devised their own shibboleth with which to answer my question  and that is     get your nose out of that book  preston  and let us in right now .               shibboleth    being     .     the boy was fascinating .  it was not often you found somebody who could make nonsense sound wonderfully sensible .      a kind of code word     said preston .     strictly speaking  it means a word that your enemy would be unable to say .  for example  in the case of the duchess  it might be a good idea to choose a word like    please    .      tiffany tried not to laugh .     that brain of yours is going to get you into trouble one day  preston .         well  so long as it   s good for something .      there was a scream from the distant kitchen  and one thing that makes humans different from animals is that they run towards a distress call  rather than away from it .  tiffany arrived only seconds behind preston  and even they weren   t the first .  a couple of girls were comforting mrs coble the cook  who was sobbing on a chair while one of the girls was wrapping a kitchen towel around her arm .  the floor was steaming and a black cauldron was lying on its side .      i tell you  they were there .     the cook managed between sobs .     all wriggling .  i shall always remember it .  and kicking and crying out    mother .     i shall remember their little faces for as long as i live .     she began sobbing again  great big sobs that threatened to choke her .  tiffany beckoned to the nearest kitchen maid  who reacted as though she   d been struck and tried to cower back .      look     said tiffany     can someone please tell me what    what are you doing with that bucket .     this was to another maid  who was dragging a bucket up from the cellar and who  at the sound of a command on top of the turmoil  dropped it .  shards of ice flew across the floor .  tiffany took a deep breath .     ladies  you don   t put ice on a scald  however sensible it seems .  cool some tea     but don   t make it cold     and soak her arm in it for at least a quarter of an hour .  everybody understand .  good .  now  what happened  .         it was full of frogs .     the cook screamed .     they was puddings and i set them to boiling  but when i opened it up  they was little frogs  all shouting for their mother .  i told everyone  i told them .  a wedding and a funeral from the same house  that   s bad luck  that is .  it   s witchcraft  that   s what it is .     then the woman gasped and clamped her free hand over her mouth .   tiffany kept a straight face .  she looked in the cauldron  and she looked around on the floor .  there was no sign of any frogs anywhere  although there were two enormous puddings  still wrapped in their pudding cloths  at the bottom of the cauldron .  when she picked them out  still very hot  and placed them on the table  she couldn   t help noticing that the maids backed away from them .      perfectly good plum duff     she said cheerily .     nothing to worry about here .         i have often noticed     said preston     that in some circumstances  boiling water can seethe in a very strange way  with water droplets appearing to jump up and down just above the surface  which i might suggest is one reason why mrs coble thought she was seeing frogs .     he leaned closer to tiffany and whispered     and another reason may quite possibly be that bottle of finest cream sherry i can see on the shelf over there  which appears to be almost empty  coupled with the lone glass noticeable in the washing up bowl over there .     tiffany was impressed  she hadn   t noticed the glass .   everyone was watching her .  somebody ought to have been saying something  and since nobody was  it had better be her .      i   m sure the death of our baron has upset us all     she began  and got no further  because the cook sat bolt upright in the chair and pointed a trembling finger at her .      all except you  you creature .     she accused .     i seed you  oh yes  i seed you .  everyone was sobbing and crying and wailing  but not you .  oh no .  you were just strutting around  giving orders to your elders and betters .  just like your granny .  everybody knows .  you was sweet on the young baron  and when he chucked you over  you killed the old baron  just to spite him .  you was seen .  oh yes  and now the poor lad is beside himself with grief and his bride is in tears and won   t come out of her room .  oh  how you must be laughing inside .  people is saying that the marriage should be put off .  i   d bet you   d like that  wouldn   t you .  that would be a feather in your black hat  and no mistake .  i remember when you were small  and then off you went up to the mountains  where the folks are so strange and wild  as everybody knows  and what comes back .  yes  what comes back .  what comes back  knowing everything  acting so hoity toity  treating us like dirt  tearing a young man   s life apart .  and that ain   t the worst of it .  you just talk to mrs petty .  don   t tell me about frogs .  i know frogs when i sees them  and that   s what i saw .  frogs .  they must        tiffany stepped out of her body .  she was good at this now  oh yes .  sometimes she practised the trick on animals  who were generally very hard to fool  even if only a mind seemed to be there  they got nervous and eventually ran away .  but humans .  humans were easy to fool .  provided your body stayed where you left it  blinking its eyes  and breathing  and keeping its balance  and all the other little things bodies are good at doing even when you are not there  other humans thought you were .   and now she let herself drift towards the drunken cook  while she muttered and shouted and repeated herself  spitting out hurtful idiocies and bile and hatred  and also little flecks of spittle that stayed on her chins .   and now tiffany could smell the stench .  it was faint but it was there .  she wondered  if i turn round  will i see two holes in a face .  no  things weren   t that bad  surely .  perhaps he was just thinking about her .  should she run .  no .  she might be running to rather than from .  he could be anywhere .  but at least she could try to stop this mischief .   tiffany was careful not to walk through people  it was possible  but even though she was in theory as insubstantial as a thought  walking through a person was like walking through a swamp     sticky and unpleasant and dark .   she had got past the kitchen girls  who seemed hypnotised  time always seemed to pass more slowly when she was out of her body .   yes  the bottle of sherry was almost empty  and there was another empty one just visible behind a sack of potatoes .  mrs coble herself reeked of it .  she had always been partial to a drop of sherry  and possibly another drop as well  it could be a work related illness among cooks  along with three wobbly chins .  but all that foul stuff .  where had that come from .  was it something she   d always wanted to say  or had he put it into her mouth .   i have done nothing wrong  she thought again .  it might be useful to keep that firmly in mind .  but i have been stupid too  and i shall have to remember that as well .   the woman  still hypnotising the girls with her ranting  looked very ugly in the slow motion world  her face was a vicious red  and every time she opened her mouth her breath stank  and there was a piece of food stuck in her uncleaned teeth .  tiffany shifted sideways a little .  would it be possible to reach an invisible hand into her stupid body and see if she could stop the beating of the heart .   nothing like that had ever occurred to her before  and it was a fact that you could not  of course  pick up anything when you were outside your body  but perhaps it would be possible to interrupt some little flow  some tiny spark .  even a big fat wretched creature like the cook could be brought down by the tiniest of upsets  and that stupid red face would shudder  and that stinking breath would gasp  and that foul mouth would shut     first thoughts  second thoughts  third thoughts  and the very rare fourth thoughts lined up in her head like planets to scream in chorus  that   s not us .  watch what you are thinking .   tiffany slammed back into her body  nearly losing her balance  and was caught by preston  who was standing right behind her .   quick .  remember that mrs coble had lost her husband only seven months ago  she told herself  and remember that she used to give you biscuits when you were small  and remember that she had a row with her daughter in law and doesn   t get to see her grand  children any more .  remember this  and see a poor old lady who has drunk too much and has listened to too much gossip     from that nasty miss spruce  for one .  remember this  because if you hit back at her  you will become what he wants you to be .  don   t give him space in your head again .   behind her  preston grunted  and said     i know it   s not the right thing to say to a lady  miss  but you are sweating like a pig .      tiffany  trying to get her shattered thoughts together  muttered     my mother always said that horses sweat  men perspire  and ladies merely glow            is that so .     said preston cheerfully .     well  miss  you are glowing like a pig .      this caused a lot of giggling from the girls  already shaken up by the cook   s ranting  but any laughter would be better than that and  it occurred to tiffany  maybe preston had worked that out .   but mrs coble had managed to get to her feet and waved a threatening finger at tiffany     although she was swaying so much that for some of the time  depending on which way she was leaning  she was also threatening preston  one of the girls and a rack of cheeses .      you don   t fool me  you evil looking minx     she said .     everyone knows you killed the old baron .  the nurse saw you .  how dare you show your face in here .  you   ll take us all sooner or later  and i won   t have that .  i hope the ground opens up and swallows you .     the cook snarled .  she tottered backwards .  there was a heavy thud  a creak and  just for a moment until it was cut off  the beginning of a scream as the cook fell into the cellar .      there is a lot of folklore about equestrian statues  especially the ones with riders on .  there is said to be a code in the number and placement of the horse   s hooves  if one of the horse   s hooves is in the air  the rider was wounded in battle  two legs in the air means that the rider was killed in battle  three legs in the air indicates that the rider got lost on the way to the battle  and four legs in the air means that the sculptor was very  very clever .  five legs in the air means that there   s probably at least one other horse standing behind the horse you   re looking at  and the rider lying on the ground with his horse lying on top of him with all four legs in the air means that the rider was either a very incompetent horseman or owned a very bad tempered horse .        see glossary  page     .        in fact  chain mail trousers are always full of holes  but they shouldn   t be full of holes seven inches wide .       chapter      the melting girl       miss aching  i must ask you to leave the chalk     said the baron  his face wooden .      i will not .      the baron   s expression did not change .  roland could be like that  she remembered  and it was worse now  of course .  the duchess had insisted on being in his office for this interview  and had further insisted on having two of her own guards there  as well as two from the castle .  that pretty much filled all the space in the study  and the two pairs of guards glared at each other in all out professional rivalry .      it is my land  miss aching .         i know i have some rights .     said tiffany .   roland nodded like a judge .     that is a very important point  miss aching  but regrettably you have no rights at all .  you are not a leaseholder  you are not a tenant and you own no land .  in short  you have nothing on which rights are based .     he said all this without looking up from the foolscap paper in front of him .   deftly  tiffany reached across and snatched it from his fingers  and was back in her chair before the guards could react .     how dare you talk like that without looking me in the eye .     but she knew what the words meant .  her father was a tenant of the farm .  he had rights .  she did not .     look     she said     you can   t just turn me out .  i   ve done nothing wrong .      roland sighed .     i really hoped that you would see reason  miss aching  but since you assert total innocence  i must spell out the following facts .  item  you admit that you took the child amber petty away from her parents and lodged her with the fairy folk who live in holes in the ground .  did you think this was the right place for a young girl .  according to my men  there seemed to be a lot of snails in the vicinity .         now just hold on  roland           you will address my future son in law as    my lord        snapped the duchess .      and if i don   t  will you hit me with your stick  your grace .  will you grasp the nettle firmly .         how dare you .     the duchess said  her eyes blazing .     is this how you like your guests to be addressed  roland .      at least his bewilderment seemed genuine .     i haven   t the faintest idea what is being talked about here     he said .   tiffany pointed her finger at the duchess  causing the duchess   s bodyguards to reach for their weapons  thus causing the castle guards to draw theirs too  so as not to be left out .  by the time swords were safely disentangled and put where they belonged  the duchess was already launching a counter attack .     you should not put up with this insubordination  young man .  you are the baron  and you have given this     this creature notice to leave your lands .  she is not conducive to public order  and if she still wilfully insists on not leaving  do i need to remind you that her parents are your tenants .      tiffany was already seething because of    creature     but to her surprise the young baron shook his head and said     no  i cannot punish good tenants for having a wayward daughter .         wayward    .  that was worse than    creature    .  how dare he     .  and her thoughts ran together .  he wouldn   t dare .  he never had dared  not in all the time they   d known each other  all the time when she had been just tiffany and he had been just roland .  it had been a strange relationship  mostly because it wasn   t a relationship at all .  they hadn   t been drawn to one another  they had been pushed towards one another by the way the world worked .  she was a witch  which meant that she was automatically different from the village kids  and he was the baron   s son  which automatically meant he was different from the village kids .   and where they had gone wrong was in believing  somewhere in their minds  that because two things were different  they must therefore be alike .  slowly finding out that this wasn   t true hadn   t been nice for either of them and there had been a certain number of things that both of them wished hadn   t been said .  and then it wasn   t over  because it had never begun  not really  of course .  and so it was best for both of them .  of course .  certainly .  yes .   and in all that time he   d never been like this  never so cold  never so stupid in such a meticulous kind of way that you couldn   t blame it all on the wretched duchess  although tiffany would have loved to .  no  there were other things happening .  she had to be on her guard .  and there  watching them watching her  she realized how a person could be both stupid and clever .   she picked up her chair  placed it neatly in front of the desk  sat down on it  folded her hands and said     i am very sorry  my lord .     she turned to the duchess  bowed her head and said     and to you too  your grace .  i temporarily forgot my place .  it will not happen again .  thank you .      the duchess grunted .  it would have been impossible for tiffany to have thought any less of her but  well  a grunt .  after a climb down like that .  humbling an uppity young witch deserved a lot better than that     some remark so cutting that it blunted on the bone .  honestly  she might have made an effort .   roland was staring at tiffany  so nonplussed he was nearly minused .  she confused him a little more by handing him the now crumpled sheet of paper and saying     do you want to deal with the other matters  my lord .      he struggled for a moment  managed to flatten the paper on the desk to his satisfaction  smoothed it out and said     there is the matter of the death of my father and the theft of money from his strongbox .      tiffany fixed him with a helpful smile  which made him nervous .     anything else  my lord .  i am anxious that everything should be dealt with .         roland  she is up to something     said the duchess .     be on your guard .     she waved a hand towards the guards .     and you guards should be on your guard as well  mind .      the guards  having some difficulty with the idea of being even more on their guard when they were already     through nervousness     much further on their guard in any case than they had ever been before  strained to look a bit taller .   roland cleared his throat .     ahem  then there is the matter of the late cook  who fell to her death almost coincidentally with  i believe  insulting you .  do you understand these charges .         no     said tiffany .   there was a moment of silence before roland said     er  why not .         because they aren   t charges  my lord .  you are not declaring outright that you think i stole the money and killed your father and the cook .  you are simply sort of waving the idea in front of me in the hope that i will burst into tears  i suppose .  witches don   t cry  and i want something that probably no other witch has ever asked for before .  i want a hearing .  a proper hearing .  and that means evidence .  and that means witnesses  and that means that the people who say have to say it in front of everybody .  and that means a jury of my peers  which means people like me  and that means habeas corpus  thank you very much .     she stood up and turned towards the doorway  which was blocked by a struggling crowd of guards .  now she looked at roland  and bobbed a little curtsy .     unless you feel entirely confident enough to have me arrested  my lord  i am leaving .      they watched with open mouths as she walked up to the guards .      good evening  sergeant  good evening  preston  good evening  gentlemen .  this won   t take a minute .  if you would just excuse me  i am leaving .     she saw preston wink at her as she pushed past his sword  and then she heard the guards suddenly collapse in a heap .   she walked along the corridor to the hall .  there was a huge fire in the even bigger fireplace  which was large enough to be a room all by itself .  the fire was peat .  it couldn   t do much to heat most of the hall  which never got warm even in the heart of summer  but it was cosy to be close to  and if you have to breathe smoke  then you can   t do better than peat smoke  which rose up to the chimney and drifted like a warm mist around the sides of bacon  which were hung up there to smoke .   it was all going to get complicated again  but for the moment tiffany sat there simply for a rest and  while she was about it  to shout at herself for being so stupid .  how much poison can he seep into their heads .  how much does he need to .   that was the problem with witchcraft  it was as if everybody needed the witches  but hated the fact that they did  and somehow the hatred of the fact could become the hatred of the person .  people then started thinking  who are you to have these skills .  who are you to know these things .  who are you to think you   re better than us .  but tiffany didn   t think she was better than them .  she was better than them at witchcraft  that was true  but she couldn   t knit a sock  she didn   t know how to shoe a horse  and while she was pretty good at making cheese  she had to have three tries to bake a loaf that you could actually bite into with your teeth .  everybody was good at something .  the only wicked thing was not finding out in time .   there was fine dust on the floor of the fireplace  because there is nothing like peat for dust  and as tiffany watched  tiny little footprints appeared in it .      all right     she said     what did you do to the guards .      a shower of feegles landed lightly on the seat beside her .      weel     rob anybody said     personally i would have liked to take them to the cleaners  the mound digging cromwells that they are  but i could see where that might make it a wee bit difficult for ye  so we just tied their bootlaces together .  maybe they   ll blame it on the wee mice .         look  you   re not to hurt anybody  all right .  the guards have to do what they are told .         nae  they didnae     said rob scornfully .     that   s nae errand for a warrior  doing what you   re told .  and what would they have done to ye  doing what they were told .  that old carlin of a mother in law was glaring claymores at ye the whole time  bad cess to her .  hah .  let   s see how she likes her bathwater tonight .      the edge to his voice put tiffany on the alert .     you are not to hurt anybody  do you understand .  nobody at all  rob .      the big man grumbled .     och yes  miss  i   ve taken what you said on board .         and you promise on your honour as a feegle not to throw it over the side as soon as my back is turned  do you .      rob anybody started grumbling again  using crackling feegle words that she had never heard before .  they sounded like curses  and once or twice  when he spat them out  smoke and sparks came out with them .  he was stamping his feet too  always a sign of a feegle at the end of his tether .     they came arrayed with sharp steel to dig up me home  dig up me clan and dig up me family     he said  and his words were all the more menacing because they were so level and quiet .  then he spat a short sentence towards the fire  which burned green for a moment when the words hit the flames .      i   ll no    disobey the hag o    the hills  ye ken  but i put ye on firm notice that if i can see a shovel near my mound again  the owner will find it shoved up his kilt blunt end first  so that he hurts his hands trying to pull it out .  and that will only be the start of his problems .  and if there is any clearances here  i swear on my spog that it will be us that is doing the clearing .     he stamped up and down a bit  and then added     and what is this we are hearing about ye demanding the law .  we is nae friends of the law  ye ken .         what about wee mad arthur .     said tiffany .   it was almost impossible to make a feegle look sheepish  but rob anybody looked as if he was about to say    bah    .     oh  it   s a terrible thing them gnomes did to him     he said  looking sad .     do ye ken he washes his face every day .  i mean  that sort of thing is ok when the mud gets too thick  but every day .  i ask ye  how can a body stand it .      one moment there were the feegles  and then there was a faint whoosh  followed by a total lack of feegles  and the next moment there was a more than adequate supply of guards .  fortunately they were the sergeant and preston  stamping to attention .   the sergeant cleared his throat .     am i addressing miss tiffany aching .     he said .      it looks to me as if you are  brian     said tiffany     but you be the judge .      the sergeant looked around quickly and then leaned closer .     please  tiff     he whispered     it   s all gone serious on us .     he straightened up quickly and then said  far louder than was necessary     miss tiffany aching .  i am commanded by my lord the baron to inform you that it is his command that you must stay within the irons of the castle           the what .     said tiffany .   wordlessly  his eyes on the ceiling  the sergeant handed her a piece of parchment .      oh  you mean the environs     she said .     that means the castle and the places around it too     she told him helpfully .     but i thought the baron wanted me to leave .         look  i   m just reading out what it says here  tiff  and i am ordered to lock your broomstick in the dungeon .         that   s an impressive errand that you have there  officer .  it   s leaning against the wall  help yourself .      the sergeant looked relieved .     you   re not going to make any     trouble .     he said .   tiffany shook her head .     not at all  sergeant .  i have no quarrel with a man who is only doing his duty .      the sergeant walked cautiously up to the broomstick .  they all knew it  of course  they had seen it going overhead  and generally only just overhead  practically every day .  but he hesitated  with his hand a few inches from the wood .     er  what happens when i touch it .     he said .      oh  then it   s ready to fly     said tiffany .   the sergeant   s hand very slowly drew back from the vicinity  or possibly the environs  of the broomstick .     but it won   t fly for me  right .     he said in a voice full of air sickness and pleading .      oh  not very far or very high  probably     said tiffany  without looking round .  the sergeant was well known to get vertigo simply by standing on a chair .  she walked over to him and picked up the stick .     brian  what were your orders if i refused to obey your orders  if you see what i mean .         i was supposed to arrest you .         what .  and lock me up in the dungeon .      the sergeant winced .     you know i wouldn   t want to do that     he said .     some of us are grateful  and we all knew that poor old mrs coble was as drunk as a skunk  poor woman .         then i won   t put you to the trouble     said tiffany .     so why don   t i put this broomstick  which you seem so worried about  down in the dungeon and lock it in .  then i won   t be going anywhere  yes .      relief flooded the sergeant   s face  and as they walked down the stone steps to the dungeon he lowered his voice and said     it   s not me  you understand  it   s them upstairs .  it seems like her grace is calling the shots now .      tiffany hadn   t seen very many dungeons  but people said that the one in the castle was pretty good by dungeon standards and would probably earn at least five ball and chains if anybody ever decided to write a good dungeon guide .  it was spacious and well drained  with a handy gutter right down the middle  which ended up in the inevitable round hole  which did not smell very bad on  as it were  the whole .   neither did the goats  which unfolded themselves from their snug beds in piles of straw and watched her through slot eyes in case she did anything interesting  such as feeding them .  they didn   t stop eating  because being goats  they were already eating their dinner for the second time .   the dungeon had two entrances .  one went straight outdoors  it was probably there to drag the prisoners in by  back in the old days  because that would save having to pull them across the great hall  getting the floor all mucky with blood and mud .   these days the dungeon was mostly used as a goat shed and  on racks higher up     high enough to be out of reach of all but the most determined goat     an apple store .   tiffany lifted the broomstick up onto the lowest apple rack  while the sergeant petted one of the goats  taking care not to look up in case it made him feel dizzy .  that meant he was entirely unprepared when tiffany pushed him back out of the doorway  took the keys out of the lock  swung herself back into the dungeon and locked the door on the inside .      i   m sorry  brian  but  you see  it is you .  not just you  of course  and not even mostly you  and it was rather unfair of me to take advantage of you  but if i   m going to be treated like a criminal  i might as well act like one .      brian shook his head .     we do have another key  you know .         hard to use it if i blocked the keyhole     said tiffany     but look on the bright side .  i   m under lock and key  which i think some people would rather like  so all you are worried about is the fine detail .  you see  i think you might be looking at this the wrong way round .  i   m safe in a dungeon .  i haven   t been locked away from you  the rest of you have been locked away from me .     brian looked as if he was about to cry and she thought  no  i can   t do it .  he   s always been decent to me .  he   s trying to be decent now .  just because i   m cleverer than he is doesn   t mean that he should lose his job .  and besides  i already know the way out of here .  that   s the thing about people who have dungeons  they don   t spend enough time in them themselves .  she handed the keys back .   his face brightened with relief .     obviously we will bring you food and water     he said .     you can   t live on apples all the time .      tiffany sat down on the straw .     you know  it   s quite cosy in here .  it   s funny how goat burps make everything sort of warm and comfortable .  no  i won   t eat the apples  but some of them do need turning or else they will rot  so i will take care of that while i   m in here too .  of course  when i   m locked in here i can   t be out there .  i can   t make medicines .  i can   t clip toenails .  i can   t help .  how is your old mum   s leg these days .  still well  i hope .  would you mind leaving now  please  because i   d like to use the hole .      she heard his boots on the stairs .  it had been a bit cruel  but what else could she have done .  she looked around and lifted up a pile of very old and very dirty straw that hadn   t been touched for a long time .  all sorts of things crawled  hopped or slithered away .  around her  now that the coast was clear  feegle heads rose  bits of straw dropping off them .      fetch my lawyer  please     tiffany said brightly .     i think he   s going to like working here         the toad turned out to be quite enthusiastic  for a lawyer who knew that he was going to be paid in beetles .      i think we will start with wrongful imprisonment .  judges don   t like that sort of thing .  if anyone   s going to be put in prison  they like to be the ones who do it .         er  actually i locked myself in     said tiffany .     does that count .         i wouldn   t worry about that at the moment .  you were under duress  your freedom of movement was being curtailed and you were put in fear .         i certainly was not .  i was extremely angry .      the toad slapped a claw down on an escaping centipede .     you were interrogated by two members of the aristocracy in the presence of four armed men  yes .  nobody warned you .  nobody read you your rights .  and you say the baron apparently believes on no evidence that you killed his father  and the cook  and stole some money .         i think roland   s trying hard not to believe it     said tiffany .     someone has told him a lie .         then we must challenge it  indeed we must .  he can   t go around making allegations of murder when they can   t be substantiated .  he can get into serious trouble for that .         oh     said tiffany     i don   t want any harm to come to him .     it is hard to see when the toad is smiling  so tiffany had to take a guess .     did i say something funny .         not funny at all  not really  but in its way rather sad and rather droll     said the toad .     droll  in this case  meaning somewhat bittersweet .  this young man is making accusations against you which could  if true  lead to you being executed in many places in this world  and yet you do not wish him to be put to any inconvenience .         i know it   s soppy  but the duchess is pushing him all the time  and the girl he   s going to marry is as wet as       she stopped .  there were footfalls on the stone stairs that led from the hall to the dungeon  and they certainly did not have the heavy ring of guards    hobnails .   it was letitia  the bride to be  all in white and all in tears .  she reached the bars of tiffany   s cell  hung onto them  and carried on crying  not big sobs  but just an endless snivelling  nose dripping  fumbling in the sleeve for the lace hanky that is already totally soaking wet kind of tears .   the girl didn   t really look at tiffany  just sobbed in her general direction .     i   m so sorry .  i really am very sorry .  what can you think of me .      and there  right there  was the drawback of being a witch .  here was a person whose mere existence had led tiffany  one evening  to wonder about that whole business of sticking pins into a wax figure .  she hadn   t actually done it  because it was something that you shouldn   t do  something that witches greatly frowned on  and because it was cruel and dangerous  and above all because she hadn   t been able to find any pins .   and now the wretched creature was in some kind of agony  so distraught that modesty and dignity were all being washed away in a rolling flood of gummy tears .  how could they not wash away hatred as well .  and  in truth  there had never been all that much hatred  more of a kind of miffed feeling .  she   d known all along that she   d never be a lady  not without the long blonde hair .  it was totally against the whole book of fairytales .  she just hadn   t liked being rushed into accepting it .      i really never wanted things to happen like this .     gulped letitia .     i really am very  very sorry  i don   t know what i could   ve been thinking about .     and so many tears  rolling down that silly  lacy dress and     oh no  there was a perfect snot balloon on a perfect nose .   tiffany watched in fascinated horror as the weeping girl had a great bubbling blow and     oh no  she wasn   t going to  was she .  yes  she was .  yes .  she squeezed out the dripping handkerchief onto the floor  which was already wet from the incessant crying .      look  i   m sure things can   t be as bad as all that     said tiffany  trying not to hear the ghastly blobby noises on the stone .     if you would only stop crying for a moment  i   m sure everything can be sorted out  whatever it is .      this caused more tears and some actual  genuine  old fashioned sobs  the kind you never heard in real life     well  at least  up until now .  tiffany knew that when people cried  they said boo hoo     or at least  that   s how it was written down in books .  no one said it in real life .  but letitia did  while projectile crying all over the steps .  there was something else there too  and tiffany caught the spill words as they were well and truly spilled  and read them as  somewhat soggy  they landed in her brain .   she thought  oh  really .  but before she could say anything  there was a clattering on the steps again .  roland  the duchess  and one of her guards came hurrying down  followed by brian  who had clearly been getting very annoyed about other people   s guards clattering on his home cobbles  and so was making sure that whenever a clattering was taking place  he was fully involved .   roland skidded on the damp patch  and threw his arms protectively around letitia  who squelched and oozed slightly .  the duchess loomed over the pair of them  which left little looming space available for the guards  who had to put up with looking angrily at one another .      what have you done to her .     roland demanded .     how did you lure her down here .      the toad cleared his throat and tiffany gave him an undignified nudge with her boot .     don   t you say a word  you amphibian     she hissed .  he might be her lawyer  but if the duchess saw a toad acting as her legal counsel  then it could only make things worse .   as it happens  her not seeing the toad did make things worse  because the duchess screamed     did you hear that .  is there no end to her insolence .  she called me an amphibian .      tiffany was about to say     i didn   t mean you  i meant the other amphibian     but stopped herself in time .  she sat down  one hand shovelling straw over the toad and turned to roland .     which question would you like me not to answer first .         my men know how to make you talk .     said the duchess over roland   s shoulder .      i already know how to talk  thank you     said tiffany .     i thought that maybe she had come to gloat  but things seem to be more     afloat .         she can   t get out  can she .     said roland to the sergeant .   the sergeant saluted smartly and said     no  sir .  i have the keys to both doors firmly in my pocket  sir .     he gave a smug look to the duchess   s guard when he said this  as if to say  some people get asked important questions and come back with accurate and snappy answers around here  thank you so very much .   this was rather spoiled by the duchess saying     he twice called you    sir    instead of    my lord     roland .  you must not let the lower orders act so familiarly to you .  i have told you this before .      tiffany would cheerfully have kicked roland for not coming back sharply on that one .  brian had taught him to ride a horse  she knew  and taught him how to hold a sword and how to hunt .  perhaps he should have taught him manners too .      excuse me     she said sharply .     do you intend to keep me locked up for ever .  i wouldn   t mind some more socks and couple of spare dresses  and  of course  some unmentionables if that is going to be the case .      possibly the mention of the word    unmentionables    was what flustered the young baron .  but he rallied quite quickly and said     we  er     that is to say  i  er     feel we should perhaps keep you carefully but humanely where you can do no mischief until after the wedding .  you do seem to be the centre of a lot of unfortunate events recently .  i   m sorry about this .      tiffany didn   t dare say anything  because it isn   t polite to burst out laughing after such a solemn and stupid sentence as that .   he went on  trying to smile     you will be made comfortable  and of course we will take the goats out  if you wish .         i   d like you to leave them in here  if it   s all the same to you     said tiffany .     i am beginning to enjoy the pleasure of their company .  but may i ask a question .         yes  of course .         this is not going to be about spinning wheels  is it .     tiffany asked .  well  after all  there was only one way this stupid reasoning could be taking them .      what .     said roland .   the duchess laughed triumphantly .     oh yes  it would be just like the saucy and all too confident young madam to taunt us with her intentions .  how many spinning wheels do we have in this castle  roland .      the young man looked startled .  he always did when his future mother in law addressed him .     er  i don   t really know .  i think the housekeeper has one  my mother   s wheel is still in the high tower     there   s always a few around .  my father likes     liked     to see people busy with their hands .  and     really  i don   t know .         i shall tell the men to search the castle and destroy every single one of them .     said the duchess .     i shall call her bluff  .  surely everyone knows about spiteful witches and spinning wheels .  one little prick upon the finger and we   ll all end up going to sleep for a hundred years .      letitia  who had been standing in a state of snuffle  managed to say     mother  you know you   ve never let me touch a spinning wheel .         and you never will touch a spinning wheel  ever  letitia  never in your life .  such things are there for the labouring classes .  you are a lady .  spinning is for servants .      roland had gone red .     my mother used to spin     he said in a deliberate kind of way .     i used to sit up in the high tower when she was using it sometimes .  it was inlaid with mother of pearl .  nobody is to touch it .     it seemed to tiffany  watching through the bars  that only someone with half a heart  very little kindness and no common sense at all would have said anything at this point .  but the duchess had no common sense  probably because it was  well  too common .      i insist       she began .      no     said roland .  the word wasn   t loud  but it had a quietness that was somehow louder than a shout  and undertones and overtones that would have stopped a herd of elephants in their tracks .  or  in this case  one duchess .  but she gave her son in law a look which promised him a hard time when she could be bothered to think of one .   out of sympathy  tiffany said     look  i only mentioned about the spinning wheels to be sarcastic .  that sort of thing just doesn   t happen any more .  i   m not sure that it ever did .  i mean  people going to sleep for a hundred years while all the trees and plants grow up over the palace .  how is that supposed to work .  why weren   t the plants sleeping as well .  otherwise you would get brambles growing up people   s nostrils  and i bet that would wake up anybody .  and what happened when it snowed .     as she said this she fixed her attention on letitia  who was almost screaming a very interesting spill word  which tiffany had noted for later consideration .      well  i can see that a witch causes disruption wherever she walks     said the duchess     and so you will stay here  being treated with more decency than you deserve  until we say so .         and what will you tell my father  roland .     said tiffany sweetly .   he looked as if he   d been punched  and probably he would be if mr aching got wind of this .  he   d need an awful lot of guards if mr aching found out that his youngest daughter had been locked up with goats .      i   ll tell you what     said tiffany .     why don   t we say that i am staying in the castle to deal with important matters .  i   m sure the sergeant here can be trusted to take a message to my dad without upsetting him .     she made this into a question and saw roland nod  but the duchess couldn   t help herself .      your father is a tenant of the baron and will do what he is told .      now roland was trying not to squirm .  when mr aching had worked for the old baron  they had  as men of the world  reached a sensible arrangement  which was that mr aching would do whatever the baron asked him to do .  provided the baron asked mr aching to do what mr aching wanted to do and needed to be done .   that was what loyalty meant  her father had told her one day .  it meant that good men of all sorts worked well when they understood about rights and duties and the dignity of everyday people .  and people treasured that dignity all the more because that was  give or take some bed linen  pots and pans and a few tools and cutlery  more or less all they had .  the arrangement didn   t need to be talked about  because every sensible person knew how it worked  while you   re a good master  i will be a good worker .  i will be loyal to you  while you are loyal to me  and while the circle is unbroken  this is how things will continue to be .   and roland was breaking the circle  or at least allowing the duchess to do it for him .  his family had ruled the chalk for a few hundred years  and had pieces of paper to prove it .  there was nothing to prove when the first aching had set foot on the chalk  no one had invented paper then .   people weren   t happy about witches right now     they were upset and confused     but the last thing roland could do with was mr aching seeking an answer .  even with some grey in his hair mr aching could ask some very hard questions .  and i need to stay here now  tiffany thought .  i   ve found a thread  and what you do with threads is pull them .  aloud  she said     i don   t mind staying here .  i   m sure we don   t want any little problems .      roland looked relieved about this but the duchess turned to the sergeant and said     are you sure she   s locked in .      brian stood up straight  he   d been standing up straight already  and was probably now on tiptoe .     yes  m    your graceship  like i said  there   s only one key to fit both the doors  and i have them in my pocket right here .     he slapped his right hand pocket  which jingled .  apparently  the jingle was enough to satisfy the duchess  who said     then i think we might rest a little happier in our beds tonight  sergeant .  come  roland  and do take care of letitia .  i fear she needs her medicine again     goodness knows what the wretched girl said to her .      tiffany watched them go  all except brian  who had the decency to look embarrassed .     could you come over here please  sergeant .      brian sighed  and walked a little nearer to the bars .     you   re not going to make trouble for me  are you  tiff .         certainly not  brian  and i hope and trust that you will not try to make trouble for me .      the sergeant shut his eyes and groaned .     you   re planning something  aren   t you .  i knew it .         let me put it like this     said tiffany  leaning forward .     how likely is it  do you think  that i   m going to stay in the cell tonight .      brian went to pat his pocket .     well  don   t forget i   ve got the       it was terrible to see his face crumple up like a little puppy that   s been given a sharp telling off .     you picked my pocket .     he looked at her pleadingly  like a little puppy who was now expecting much worse than a telling off .   to the sergeant   s shock and awe  tiffany handed the keys back to him again  with a smile .     you surely don   t think a witch needs keys .  and i promise you that i will be back in here by seven o   clock in the morning .  i think you will agree  in the circumstances  that this is very good deal  especially since i will find some time to change the bandage on your mother   s leg .      the look on his face was enough .  he grabbed the keys thankfully .     i suppose it   s no good me asking you how you intend to get out .     he said hopefully .      i don   t think you ought to ask that question in the circumstances  do you  sergeant .      he hesitated  and then smiled .     thank you for thinking about my mother   s leg     he said .     it   s looking a bit purple at the moment .      tiffany took a deep breath .     the trouble is  brian  you and i are the only ones thinking about your mother   s bad leg .  there   s old folks out there who need someone to help them in and out of the bathtub .  there   s pills and potions that need making and taking to people in the hard to get to places .  there is mr bouncer  who can hardly walk at all unless i give him a good rubbing of embrocation .     she pulled out her diary  held together with bits of string and elastic bands  and waved it at him .     this is full of things for me to do  because i am the witch .  if i don   t do them  who will .  young mrs trollope is due to have twins soon  i   m sure of it  i can hear the separate heartbeats .  first time births too .  she is already scared stiff  and the nearest other midwife is ten miles away and  i have to say  a bit short sighted and forgetful .  you are an officer  brian .  officers are supposed to be men of resource  so if the poor young mother comes looking for help  i am sure you will know what to do .      she had the pleasure of seeing his face go very nearly white .  before he could stutter a reply she continued     but i can   t help  you see  because the wicked witch must be locked up in case she gets her hands on a loaded spinning wheel .  locked up for a fairy story .  and the trouble is  i think somebody might die .  and if i let them die  then i am a bad witch .  the trouble is  i am a bad witch anyway .  i must be  because you have locked me up .      she did actually feel sorry for him .  he hadn   t become a sergeant to deal with things like this  most of his tactical experience lay in catching escaped pigs .  should i blame him for what he   s been ordered to do .  she wondered .  after all  you can   t blame the hammer for what the carpenter does with it .  but brian has got a brain  and the hammer hasn   t .  maybe he should try to use it .   tiffany waited until the sound of his boots indicated that the sergeant had decided quite correctly that it might be a good idea to have a plausible distance between the cell and himself that evening  and also perhaps a little think about his future .  besides  the feegles began to appear from every crevice  and they had a wonderful instinct for not getting spotted .      you shouldn   t have pick pocketed his keys     she said as rob anybody spat out a piece of straw .      aye .  he wants to keep you locked up .         well  yes  but he   s a decent person .     she knew that sounded stupid  and rob anybody must have known that too .      oh aye  sure  a decent person who will lock you up at the bidding of that snotty old carlin .     he snarled .     and what about that big wee strip o    dribbling in the white dress .  i was reckoning we   d have to build guttering in front of her .         was she one o    them water nymphs .     said daft wullie  but the majority view was that the girl was somehow made of ice and had been melting away .  lower down the steps  a mouse was swimming to safety .   almost without her knowing it  tiffany   s left hand slid into her pocket and pulled out a piece of string  which was temporarily dropped onto rob anybody   s head .  the hand went back into her pocket and came back out with one interesting small key she had picked up by the side of the road three weeks ago  an empty packet that had once contained flower seeds  and a small stone with a hole in it .  tiffany always picked up small stones with holes in them  because they were lucky  she kept them in her pocket until the stone wore through the cloth and fell out  leaving only the hole .  that was enough to make an emergency shamble  except that you usually needed something alive  of course .  the toad   s dinner of beetles had entirely disappeared  mostly into the toad  so she picked him up and tied him gently into the pattern  paying no attention to his threats of legal action .      i don   t know why you don   t use one of the feegles     he said .     they like this sort of thing .         yes  but half the time the shamble ends up pointing me to the nearest pub .  now  just hang on  will you .      the goats carried on chewing as she moved the shamble this way and that  searching for a clue .  letitia had been sorry  deeply damply sorry .  and that last set of spill words was a set of words she wasn   t brave enough to say but not quick enough to stop .  they were     i didn   t mean it .      no one knew how a shamble worked .  everybody knew that it did .  perhaps all it did do was make you think .  maybe what it did do was give your eyes something to look at while you thought  and tiffany thought  someone else in this building is magical .  the shamble twisted  the toad complained and the silver thread of a conclusion floated across tiffany   s second sight .  she turned her eyes towards the ceiling .  the silver thread glittered  and she thought  someone in this building is using magic .  someone who is very sorry that they did .   was it possible that the permanently pale  permanently damp and irrevocably watercolouring letitia was actually a witch .  it seemed unthinkable .  well  there was no sense in wondering what was happening when you could simply go and find out for yourself .   it was nice to think that the barons of the chalk had got along with so many people over the years that they   d forgotten how to lock anybody up .  the dungeon had become a goat shed  and the difference between a dungeon and a goat shed is that you don   t need a fire in a goat shed  because goats are pretty good at keeping themselves warm .  you do need one in a dungeon  however  if you want to keep your prisoners nice and warm  and if you really don   t like your prisoners then you   ll need a fire to get them nasty and warm .  terminally hot .  granny aching had told tiffany once that when she was a girl there had been all kinds of horrible metal things in the dungeon  mostly for taking people apart a little bit at a time  but as it turned out there was never a prisoner bad enough to use them on .  and  if it came to that  no one in the castle wanted to use any of the things  which often trapped your fingers if you weren   t careful  so they were all sent down to the blacksmith for turning into more sensible things like shovels and knives  except for the iron maiden  which had been used as a turnip clamp until the top fell off .   and so  because nobody in the castle had ever been very enthusiastic about the dungeon  everybody had forgotten that it had a chimney .  and that is why tiffany looked up and saw  high above her  that little patch of blue which a prisoner calls the sky  but which she  as soon as it was dark enough  intended to call the exit .   it turned out to be a little more tricky to use than she had hoped  it was too narrow for her to go up sitting on the stick  so she had to hang onto the bristles and let the broomstick drag her up while she fended herself off the walls with her boots .   at least she knew her way around up there .  all the kids did .  there probably wasn   t a boy growing up in the chalk who hadn   t scratched his name in the lead on the roof  quite probably alongside the names of his father  grandfathers  great grandfathers and even great great grandfathers  until the names got lost in the scratches .   the whole point about a castle is that nobody should get in if you don   t want them to  and so there were no windows until you got nearly to the top  where the best rooms were .  roland had long ago moved into his father   s room     she knew that because she had helped him move his stuff in when the old baron had finally accepted that he was too sick to manage the stairs any longer .  the duchess would be in the big guestroom  halfway between that room and the maiden tower     which really was its name     where letitia would be sleeping .  no one would draw attention to this  but the arrangement meant that the bride   s mother would be sleeping in the room between the groom and the bride  possibly with her ears highly tuned at all times for any sound of hanky or even panky .   tiffany crept quietly through the gloom and stepped neatly into an alcove when she heard footsteps coming up the stairs .  they belonged to a maid  carrying a jug on a tray  which she very nearly spilled when the door to the duchess   s room was flung open and the duchess herself was glaring at her  just to check nothing was going on .  when the maid moved on again  tiffany followed her  silently and  as she had the trick of it  invisibly too .  the guard sitting by the door looked up hopefully when the tray arrived  and was told sharply to go downstairs and get his own supper  then the maid stepped into the room  the tray was placed beside the big bed  and the maid left  wondering for a moment whether her eyes had been playing tricks on her .   letitia looked as though she was sleeping under freshly fallen snow  and it rather spoiled the effect when you realized that mostly it was screwed up tissue paper .  used tissue paper  at that .  it was very rare indeed on the chalk  because it was quite expensive  and if you had any  it was not considered bad manners to dry it out in front of the fire for re use later on .  tiffany   s father said that when he was a little boy he had to blow his nose on mice  but this was probably said in order to make her squeal .   right now  letitia blew her nose with an unladylike honking noise and  to tiffany   s surprise  looked suspiciously around the room .  she even said     hello .  is there anybody there .         a question which  considered sensibly  is never going to get you anywhere .   tiffany pulled herself further into a shadow .  she could sometimes fool granny weatherwax on a good day  and a soppy princess had no business sensing her presence .      i can scream  you know     said letitia  looking around .     there   s a guard right outside my door .         actually  he   s gone down to get his dinner     said tiffany     which frankly i call very unprofessional .  he should have waited to be relieved by another guard .  personally  i think your mother is more worried about how her guards look than about how they think .  even young preston guards better than they do .  sometimes people never know he   s there until he taps them on the shoulder .  did you know that people very seldom start screaming while someone is still talking to them .  i don   t know why .  i suppose it   s because we are brought up to be polite .  and if you think you   re going to do so now  i would like to point out that if i was planning to do anything nasty i would have done so already  don   t you think .      the pause was rather longer than tiffany liked .  then letitia said     you have every right to be angry .  you are angry  aren   t you .         not at the moment .  by the way  aren   t you going to drink your milk before it gets cold .         actually  i always tip it down the privy .  i know that it   s a wicked waste of good food and that there are a lot of poor children who would love a nightcap of warm milk  but they don   t deserve mine because my mother makes the maids put a medicine in it to help me sleep .         why .     said tiffany incredulously .      she thinks i need it .  i don   t  really .  you have no idea what it   s like .  it   s like being in prison .         well  i think i know what that   s like now     said tiffany .  the girl in the bed started to cry again  and tiffany hushed her into silence .      i didn   t mean it to get that bad     said letitia  blowing her nose like a hunting horn .     i just wanted roland not to like you so much .  you can   t imagine what it   s like  being me .  the most i   m allowed to do is paint pictures  and only watercolours at that .  not even charcoal sketches .         i wondered about that     said tiffany absent mindedly .     roland once used to write to lord diver   s daughter  iodine  and she used to paint watercolours all the time too .  i wondered if it was some kind of punishment .      but letitia wasn   t listening .     you don   t have to just sit and paint pictures .  you can fly around all the time     she was saying .     order people about  do interesting things .  hah  i wanted to be a witch when i was little .  but just my luck  i had long blonde hair and a pale complexion and a very rich father .  what good was that .  girls like that can   t be witches .      tiffany smiled .  they were getting to the truth  and it was important to stay helpful and friendly before the dam broke again and they were all flooded .     did you have a book of fairy stories when you were young .      letitia blew her nose again .     oh  yes .         was it the one with a very frightening picture of the goblin on page seven by any chance .  i used to shut my eyes when i came to that page .         i scribbled all over him with a black crayon     said letitia in a low voice  as if it was a relief to tell somebody .      you didn   t like me .  and so you decided to do some magic against me        tiffany said it very quietly  because there was something brittle about letitia .  in fact the girl did reach for some more tissue but appeared to have run out of sobs for a moment     as it turned out  only for a moment .      i am so sorry .  if only i had known  i would never have           perhaps i should tell you     tiffany went on     that roland and i were     well  friends .  more or less the only friend the other one had .  but in a way  it was the wrong kind of friendship .  we didn   t come together  things happened that pushed us together .  and we didn   t realize that .  he was the baron   s son  and once you know that you   re the baron   s son and all the kids have been told how to act towards the baron   s son  then you don   t have many people you can talk to .  and then there was me .  i was the girl smart enough to be a witch and i have to say that this is not a job which allows you to have that much of a social life .  if you like  two people who were left out thought they were the same kind of person .  i know that now .  unfortunately roland was the first to realize that .  and that   s the truth of it .  i am the witch  and he is the baron .  and you will be the baroness  and you should not worry if the witch and the baron     for the benefit of everybody     are on good terms .  and that is all there is to is  and in fact there isn   t even an it  just the ghost of an it .      she saw relief travel across letitia   s face like the rising sun .      and that   s the truth from me  miss  so i would like the truth from you .  look  can we get out of here .  i   m afraid that some guards might rush in at any moment and try and put me in a place i can   t get out of .      tiffany managed to get letitia onto the broomstick with her .  the girl fidgeted  but simply gasped as the stick sailed down gently from the castle battlements  drifted over the village and touched down in a field .      did you see those bats .     said letitia .      oh  they often fly around the stick if you don   t move very fast     said tiffany .     you   d think they would avoid it  really .  and now  miss  now we   re both far from any help  tell me what you did that made people hate me .      panic filled letitia   s face .      no  i   m not going to hurt you     said tiffany .     if i was going to  i would have done it a long time ago .  but i want to clean up my life .  tell me what you did .         i used the ostrich trick     said letitia promptly .     you know  it   s called unsympathetic magic  you make a model of the person and stick them upside down in a bucket of sand .  i really am very  very sorry            yes  you already said so     said tiffany     but i   ve never heard of this trick .  i can   t see how it could work .  it doesn   t make sense .      but it worked on me  she thought .  this girl isn   t a witch  and whatever she tried wasn   t a real spell  but it worked on me .      it doesn   t have to make sense if it   s magic     said letitia hopefully .      it has to make some sense somewhere     said tiffany  staring up at the stars that were coming out .      well     said letitia     i got it out of spells for lovers by anathema bugloss  if that   s any help .         that   s the one with the picture of the author sitting on a broomstick  isn   t it .     said tiffany .     sitting on it the wrong way round  i might add .  and it hasn   t got a safety strap .  and no witch i   ve ever met wears goggles .  and as for having a cat on it with you  that doesn   t bear thinking about .  it   s a made up name too .  i   ve seen the book in the boffo catalogue .  it   s rubbish .  it   s for soppy girls who think all you need to do to make magic is buy a very expensive stick with a semiprecious stone glued on the end  no offence meant .  you might as well pick a stick out of the hedge and call it a wand .      without saying anything  letitia walked a little way down to the hedge that lay between the field and the road .  there   s always a useful stick under a hedge if you poke around enough .  she waved it vaguely in the air  and it left a light blue line after it .      like this .     she said .  for quite a while  there was no sound apart from the occasional hoot of an owl and  for the really good of hearing  the rustling of the bats .      i think it   s time we had a proper little chat  don   t you .     said tiffany .       chapter      the bonfire of the witches       i told you i alwayswanted to be a witch     said letitia .     you don   t know how hard that can be when your family lives in a great big mansion and is so old that the coat of arms has even got a few legs on it as well .  all that gets in the way and  if you excuse me  i really wish that i had been born with your disadvantages .  i only found out about the boffo catalogue when i heard two of the maids giggling over it when i went into the kitchen one day .  they ran away  still giggling  i might add  but they left it behind .  i can   t order as much stuff as i would want to  because my maid spies on me and tells mother .  but the cook is a decent sort  so i give her money and the catalogue numbers and they get delivered to her sister in ham on rye .  i can   t order anything very big  though  because the maids are always dusting and cleaning everywhere .  i would really like one of the cauldrons that bubble green  but from what you tell me it   s just a joke .      letitia had taken a couple of other sticks from the hedge and stuck them in the ground in front of her .  there was a blue glow on the tip of each one .      well  for everybody else it   s a joke     tiffany said     but for you i expect it would produce fried chickens .         do you really think so .     said letitia eagerly .      i   m not sure i can think at all if i am upside down with my head in a bucket of sand     said tiffany .     you know that sounds a bit like wizard magic .  this trick     it was in mistress bugloss   s book  you say .  look  i   m sorry  but that really is boffo stuff .  it   s not real .  it   s just for people who think that witchcraft is all about flowers and love potions and dancing around without your drawers on     something i can   t imagine any real witch doing        tiffany hesitated  because she was naturally honest  and went on     well  maybe nanny ogg  when the mood takes her .  it   s witchcraft with all the crusts cut off  and real witchcraft is all crusts .  but you took one of her silly spells for giggling housemaids and used it on me and it   s worked .  is there a real witch in your family .      letitia shook her head and her long blonde hair sparkled even in the moonlight .     i   ve never heard of one .  my grandfather was an alchemist     not professionally  of course .  he was the reason why the hall has no east wing any more .  my mother     i can   t imagine her doing magic  can you .         her .  absolutely .         well  i   ve never seen her do any and she does mean well .  she says that all she wants is the best for me .  she lost all her family in a fire  don   t you know .  lost everything     said letitia .   tiffany couldn   t dislike the girl .  it would be like disliking a rather baffled puppy  but she couldn   t help saying     and did you mean well .  you know  when you made a model of me and put it upside down in a bucket of sand .      there must have been reservoirs in letitia .  she was never more than a teacup away from a tear .      look     tiffany said     i don   t mind  honestly .  though frankly i wish i believed that it was just a spell .  just take it out again then  and we can forget all about it .  please don   t start crying again  it makes everything so soggy .      letitia sniffed .     oh  it   s just that  well  i didn   t do it here .  i left it at home .  it   s in the library .      the last word in that sentence tinkled in tiffany   s head .     a library .  with books .     witches were not supposed to be particularly bothered about books  but tiffany had read every one she could .  you never knew what you could get out of a book .     it   s a very warm night for the time of year     she said     and your place is not too far  is it .  you could be back in the tower and in bed in a couple of hours .      for the first time since tiffany had met her  letitia smiled  genuinely smiled .     can i go on the front this time then .     she said .   tiffany flew low over the downs .   the moon was well on the way to full  and it was a real harvest moon  the copper colour of blood .  that was the smoke from the stubble burning  hanging in the air .  how the blue smoke from burning wheat stalks made the moon go red  she didn   t know  and she wasn   t going to fly all that way to find out .   and letitia seemed to be in some kind of personal heaven .  she chattered the whole time  which was admittedly better than the sobbing .  the girl was only eight days younger than herself .  tiffany knew that  because she had taken great care to find out .  but that was just numbers .  it didn   t feel like that .  in fact she felt old enough to be the girl   s mother .  it was strange  but petulia and annagramma and the rest of them back in the mountains had all told her the same thing  witches grew old inside .  you had to do things that needed doing but which turned your stomach like a spinning wheel .  you saw things sometimes that no one should have to see .  and  usually alone and often in darkness  you needed to do the things that had to be done .  out in distant villages  when a new mother was giving birth and things had run into serious trouble  you hoped that there was an old local midwife who might at least give you some moral support  but still  when it came down to it and the life or death decision had to be made  then it was made by you  because you were the witch .  and sometimes it wasn   t a decision between a good thing and a bad thing  but a decision between two bad things  no right choices  just     choices .   and now she saw something speeding over the moonlit turf and easily keeping up with the stick .  it kept pace for several minutes and then  with a spinning jump  headed back into the moon light shadows .   the hare runs into the fire  tiffany thought  and i have a feeling that i do too .   keepsake hall was at the far end of the chalk  and it was truly the far end of the chalk because there the chalk gave way to clay and gravel .  there was parkland here  and tall trees     forests of them     and fountains in front of the house itself  which stretched the word    hall    to breaking point  since it looked like half a dozen mansions stuck together .  there were outbuildings  wings  a large ornamental lake  and a weathervane in the shape of a heron  which tiffany nearly ran into .     how many people live here .     she managed to say as she steadied the stick and landed on what she had expected to be a lawn but turned out to be dried grass almost five feet deep .  rabbits scattered  alarmed at the aerial intrusion .      just me and mother now     said letitia  the dead grass crackling under her feet as she jumped down     and the servants  of course .  we have quite a lot of them .  don   t worry  they will all be in bed by now .         how many servants do you need for two people .     tiffany asked .      about two hundred and fifty .         i don   t believe you .      letitia turned as she led the way to a distant door .     well  including families  there   s about forty on the farm and another twenty in the dairy  and another twenty four for working in the woodlands  and seventy five for the gardens  which include the banana house  the pineapple pit  the melon house  the water lily house and the trout fishery .  the rest work in the house and the pension rooms .         what are they .      letitia stopped with her hand on the corroded brass doorknob .     you think my mother is a very rude and bossy person  don   t you .      tiffany couldn   t see any alternative to telling the truth  even at the risk of midnight tears .  she said     yes  i do .         and you are right     said letitia  turning the doorknob .     but she is loyal to people who are loyal to us .  we always have been .  no one is ever sacked for being too old or too ill or too confused .  if they can   t manage in their cottages  they live in one of the wings .  in fact  most of the servants are looking after the old servants .  we may be oldfashioned and a bit snobbish and behind the times  but no one who works for the keepsakes will ever need to beg for their food at the end of their life .      at last the cranky doorknob turned  opening into a long corridor that smelled of     that smelled of     that smelled of old .  that was the only way to describe it  but if you had enough time to think  you would say it was a mix of dry fungi  damp wood  dust  mice  dead time and old books  which have an intriguing smell of their own .  that was it  tiffany decided .  days and hours had died quietly in here while nobody noticed .   letitia fumbled on a shelf inside the door  and lit a lamp .     no one ever comes in here these days except me     she said     because it   s haunted .         yes     said tiffany  trying to keep her voice matter of fact .     by a headless lady with a pumpkin under her arm .  she is walking towards us right now .      had she expected shock .  or tears .  tiffany certainly hadn   t expected letitia to say     that would be mavis .  i shall have to change her pumpkin as soon as the new ones are ripe .  they start to get all  well  manky after a while .     she raised her voice .     it   s only me  mavis  nothing to be frightened of .      with a sound like a sigh  the headless woman turned and began to walk back up the corridor .      the pumpkin was my idea     letitia continued chattily .     she was just impossible to deal with before that .  looking for her head  you know .  the pumpkin gives her some comfort  and frankly i don   t think she knows the difference  poor soul .  she wasn   t executed  by the way .  i think she wants everybody to know that .  it was simply a freak accident involving a flight of stairs  a cat and a scythe .      and this is the girl who spends all her time in tears  thought tiffany .  but this is her place .  aloud  she said     any more ghosts to show me  just in case i want to wet myself again .         well  not now     said letitia  setting off along the corridor .     the screaming skeleton stopped screaming when i gave him an old teddy bear  although i   m not certain why that worked and  oh yes  the ghost of the first duke now sticks to haunting the lavatory next to the dining room  which we don   t use very often .  he has a habit of pulling the chain at inconvenient moments  but that   s better than the rains of blood we used to have .         you are a witch .     the words came out of tiffany   s mouth all by themselves  unable to stay in the privacy of her mind .   the girl looked at her in astonishment .     don   t be silly     she said .     we both know how it goes  don   t we .  long blonde hair  milk white skin  noble     well  a reasonably noble birth     and rich  at least technically .  i   m officially a lady .         you know     said tiffany     maybe it   s wrong to base one   s future on a book of fairy stories .  normally  girls of the princess persuasion don   t help out distressed headless ghosts by giving them a pumpkin to carry .  as for stopping the screaming skeleton screaming by giving it a teddy bear  i have to say i am impressed .  that is what granny weatherwax calls headology .  most of the craft is headology  when you get right down to it  headology and boffo .      letitia looked flustered and gratified at the same time  making her face blotch white and pink .  it was  tiffany had to agree  the kind of face that peered out of tower windows  waiting for a knight with nothing better to do with his time than save its owner from dragons  monsters and  if all else failed  boredom .      you don   t have to do anything about it     tiffany added .     the pointy hat is optional .  but if miss tick was here  she would definitely suggest a career .  it is not good to be a witch alone .      they had reached the end of the corridor .  letitia turned another creaky doorknob  which complained as the door opened  and so did the door .     i   ve certainly found that out     said letitia .     and miss tick is      .         she travels around the country finding girls who have the talent for the craft     said tiffany .     they say that you don   t find witchcraft  it finds you  and generally it   s miss tick who taps you on the shoulder .  she   s a witchfinder  but i don   t suppose she goes into many big houses .  they make witches nervous .  oh my .     and this was because letitia had lit an oil lamp .  the room was full of bookcases  and the books on them gleamed .  these weren   t cheap modern books  these were books bound in leather  and not just leather  but leather from clever cows who had given their lives for literature after a happy existence in the very best pastures .  the books gleamed as letitia moved around the large room lighting other lamps .  she hauled them up towards the ceiling on their long chains  which swung gently as she pulled so that the shine from the books mixed with the gleam from the brasswork until the room seemed to be full of rich  ripe gold .   letitia was clearly pleased by the way tiffany stood and stared .     my great grandfather was a huge collector     she said .     do you see all the polished brass .  that   s not for show  that   s for the point three   three bookworm  which can move so fast that it can bore a hole all the way through an entire shelf of books in a fraction of a second .  hah  but not when they run into solid brass at the speed of sound .  the library used to be bigger  but my uncle charlie ran away with all the books on     i think it was called erotica .  i   m not sure  but i can   t find it on any map .  i may be the only one who comes in here now  anyway .  mother thinks that reading makes people restless .  pardon me  but why are you sniffing .  i hope another mouse hasn   t died in here .      there is something very wrong about this place  thought tiffany .  something     strained     straining .  maybe it   s all the knowledge in the books  just bursting to get out .  she had heard talk of the library at unseen university     of the soulful books all pressed together in space and time so that at night  it was said  they spoke to one another and a kind of lightning flashed from book to book .  too many books in one place  who knew what they could do .  miss tick had told her one day     knowledge is power  power is energy  energy is matter  matter is mass  and mass changes time and space .     but letitia looked so happy among the shelves and desks that tiffany hadn   t got the heart to object .   the girl beckoned her over .     and this is where i do my little bits of magic     she said  as if she was telling tiffany this was where she played with her dollies .   tiffany was sweating now  all the little hairs on her skin were trembling  a signal to herself that she should turn and run  but letitia was chattering away  quite oblivious to the fact that tiffany was trying not to throw up .   his stink was terrible .  it rose in the cheery library like a long dead whale rising again to the surface  full of gas and corruption .   tiffany looked around desperately for something to take her mind off that image .  mrs proust and derek had certainly benefited from letitia keepsake .  she had bought the whole range  warts and all .      but i only use warts at the moment .  i think they have the right feel  without going overboard  don   t you .     she was saying .      i   ve never bothered with them     said tiffany weakly .   letitia sniffed .     oh dear  i am so sorry about the smell  it   s the mice  i think .  they eat the glue out of the books  although i   d say that they must have found a particularly unpleasant book .      the library was really beginning to upset tiffany .  it was like  well  waking up and finding a family of tigers had wandered in during the night and were fast asleep on the end of the bed  everything was peaceful at the moment  but at any minute now  somebody was going to lose an arm .  there was the boffo stuff  which was sort of witchcraft for show .  it impressed people  and maybe helped a novice get into the mood  but surely mrs proust wasn   t sending out stuff that actually worked  was she .   there was a clank of a bucket handle behind her as letitia came round a bookcase  holding the bucket in both hands .  sand tipped out of it as she dropped it on the floor and she scrabbled in it for a moment .     ah  there you are     she said  pulling out something that looked like a carrot which had been chewed by a mouse that wasn   t really very hungry .      is that supposed to be me .     said tiffany .      i   m afraid i   m not very good at woodcarving     said letitia     but the book says it   s what you   re thinking that counts .     it was a nervous statement with a wiry little question clinging to the end of it  waiting to burst into tears .      sorry     said tiffany .     the book has got that wrong .  it   s not as nice as that .  it   s what you do that counts .  if you want to put a hex on someone  you need something that has belonged to them     hair  a tooth maybe .  and you shouldn   t mess about with it  because it   s not nice and it   s very easy to get wrong .     she looked closely at the very badly carved witch .     and i see you   ve written the word    witch    on it in pencil .  er     you know i said it   s easy to get it wrong .  well  there are times when    getting it wrong    just doesn   t cover messing up somebody else   s life .      her lower lip trembling  letitia nodded .   the pressure on tiffany   s head was getting worse and the horrible stench was now so powerful that it felt like a physical thing .  she tried to concentrate on the little pile of books on the library table .  they were sad little volumes  of the sort that nanny ogg  who could be uncharacteristically scathing when she felt like it  called    tiddly twinkle poo    for girls who played at being witches for fun .   but at least letitia had been thorough  there were a couple of notebooks on the lectern which dominated the table .  tiffany turned to say something to the girl  but somehow her head did not want to stay turned .  her second sight was dragging it back .  and her hand rose slowly  almost automatically  and moved aside the little pile of silly books .  what she had thought was the top of the lectern was in fact a much larger book  so thick and dark it seemed to merge with the wood itself .  dread trickled into her brain like black syrup  telling her to run and     no  that was all .  just run  and go on running  and not stop .  ever .   she tried to keep her voice level .     do you know anything about this book .      letitia looked over her shoulder .     it   s very ancient .  i don   t even recognize the writing .  wonderful binding  though  and the funny thing is  it   s always slightly warm .      here and now  thought tiffany  it   s facing me here and now .  eskarina said that there was a book of his .  could this possibly be a copy .  but a book can   t hurt  can it .  except that books contain ideas  and ideas can be dangerous .   at this point  the book on the lectern opened itself with a leathery creak and a little flap noise as the cover turned over .  the pages rustled like a lot of pigeons taking flight  and then there it was  one page filling the midnight room with brilliant  eye watering sun light .  and in that sunlight  running towards her  across the scorching desert  was a figure in black      automatically  tiffany slammed the book shut and held it shut in both hands  clutching it like a schoolgirl .  he saw me  she thought .  i know he did .  the book jumped in her arms as something heavy hit it  and she could hear     words  words she was glad she couldn   t understand .  another blow struck the book  and the cover bulged  nearly knocking her over .  when the next thump came  she fell forward  landing with the cover under her and all her weight on the book .   fire  she thought .  he hates fire .  but i don   t think i could carry this very far and  well  you don   t set fire to libraries  you just don   t .  and besides  this whole place is as dry as a bone .      is something trying to get out of the book .     said letitia .   tiffany looked up at her pink and white face .     yes     she managed  and slammed the book down on the table as it jumped again in her arms .      it   s not going to be like that goblin in the fairytale book  is it .  i was always so scared that it would squeeze itself out between the pages .      the book sprang up into the air and slammed back down again on the table  knocking the wind out of tiffany .  she managed to grunt     i think this is a lot worse than the goblin .     which was our goblin  she remembered inconveniently .  they had the same book  after all .  it wasn   t a good book in many respects  but then you grow up and it   s just a silly picture  but part of you never forgets .   it seemed to be something that happened to everybody .  when she had mentioned to petulia about being frightened by a picture in a book  the girl confessed that she had been hugely frightened by a happy looking skeleton in a picture book when she was young .  and it turned out all the other girls remembered something like that too .  it was as if it was a fact of life .  a book would start out by scaring you .      i think i know what to do     said letitia .     can you keep it occupied for a while .  i won   t be a moment .     and with that she disappeared from view  and after a few seconds tiffany  still straining to keep the book closed  heard a squeaking noise .  she did not take much notice  because her arms  clinging tightly to the bouncing book  felt redhot .  then  behind her  letitia said quietly     look  i   m going to guide you to the book press .  when i say so  push the book in and get your hands out of the way really  really quickly .  it is quite important that you do it quickly .      tiffany felt the girl help her turn  and together they edged along to something metallic waiting in the gloom  while all the time the book rocked with anger and thumped on her chest  it was like holding an elephant   s heart while it was still beating .   she hardly heard letitia   s voice above the pounding as she shouted     put the book down on the metal plate  push it a little way forward and get your fingers out of the way     right now .      something spun .  in one pants wetting moment tiffany saw a hand thrust its way through the book   s cover before a metal plate slammed down on it  clipping the ends of tiffany   s fingernails .      help me with this bar  will you .  let   s tighten it down as far as we can .     that was from letitia  who was leaning on     what .     it   s the old book press     she said .     my grandfather used to use it all the time when he was tidying up old books that got damaged .  it helps when you have to glue a page back in  for example .  we hardly use it except at hogswatch .  very good for the precision cracking of walnuts  you see .  just wind the handle until you hear them start to crack .  they look like tiny little human brains .      tiffany risked a look at the press  the top and bottom plates of which were now pressed tightly together  to see if any human brains were dripping down the outside .  they weren   t  but it didn   t help very much at this point  as a small human skeleton walked out of the wall  through the library shelves as though they were smoke  and disappeared .  it had been holding a teddy bear .  it was one of those things that the brain files under    something i would rather not have seen    .      was that some kind of ghost .     said letitia .     not the skeleton     i told you about him  didn   t i .  poor little thing .  i mean  the other one .  the one in the book            he is  well  i suppose you could say that he is something like a disease  and also something like a nightmare that turns out to be standing in your bedroom when you wake up .  and i think you may have called him .  summoned him  if you like .         i don   t like either of those .  all i did was a simple little spell out of a book that cost one dollar .  all right  i know i must   ve been a silly girl  but i didn   t mean anything like     that .     she pointed to the press  which was still creaking .      stupid woman     said tiffany .   letitia blinked .     what did you say .         stupid woman .  or silly woman  if you prefer .  you   re going to get married in a few days  remember .  and you tried to do a spell on somebody out of jealousy .  did you see the title of that book .  i did .  it was right in front of me .  it was the bonfire of the witches .  it was dictated by an omnian priest who was so mad that he wouldn   t have been able to see sanity with a telescope .  and you know what .  books live .  the pages remember .  have you heard about the library at the unseen university .  they have books in there that have to be chained down  or kept in darkness or even under water .  and you  miss  played at magic a matter of inches away from a book that boils with evil  vindictive magic .  no wonder you got a result .  i woke him up and ever since then he   s been searching  hunting me .  and you     with your little spell     have shown him where i was .  you helped him .  he   s come back  and he   s found me now .  the witch burner .  and he is infectious  just as i told you  a kind of disease .      she paused for breath  which came  and the torrent of tears  which didn   t .  letitia just stood there as if she was thinking deeply .  then she said     i suppose that    sorry    isn   t enough  right .         as a matter of fact  it would be rather a good start     said tiffany  but she thought  this young woman  who has never realized it   s time to stop wearing girly dresses  gave a headless ghost a pumpkin to carry under its arm so that it would feel better and presented a screaming little skeleton with a teddy bear .  would i have thought to do that .  it   s absolutely something that a witch would do .      look     she said     you have definitely got some magical talent  i really mean it .  but you   ll get into a terrible amount of trouble if you start mucking about when you don   t know what you are doing .  although giving the teddy bear to the poor little skeleton was a stroke of genius .  build on that thought and get some training  and you might have quite a magical future .  you will have to go and spend some time with an old witch  just like i did .         well  that   s wonderful  tiffany     letitia said .     but i have to go and spend some time getting married .  shall we get back now .  and what do you suggest we do with the book .  i don   t like the idea of him being in there .  supposing he gets out .         he is out  already .  but the book is     well  a kind of window that makes it easy for him to come through .  to reach me .  you get that sort of thing occasionally .  it   s a sort of way into another world  or perhaps somewhere else in this world .      tiffany had felt rather lofty when she explained this  and so was somewhat chastened when letitia said     oh yes  the bluebell wood with the cottage that sometimes has smoke coming out of the chimney and sometimes does not  and the girl feeding the ducks on the pond  where the pigeons on the house behind her are sometimes flying and sometimes perched .  they are mentioned in h . j .  toadbinder   s book floating worlds .  would you like it .  i know where it is .     and before tiffany could say a word  the girl hurried off among the bookshelves .  she came back within a minute  much to tiffany   s relief  and she was carrying a large  shiny leather volume which was suddenly dropped into tiffany   s hands .      it   s a present .  you   ve been kinder to me than i was to you .         you can   t give me that .  it   s part of the library .  it   ll leave a gap .         no  i insist     said letitia .     i   m the only one who comes in here now  in any case .  my mother keeps all the books of family history  genealogy and heraldry in her own room  and she   s the only one who is interested in them .  apart from me  the only other person who ever comes in here these days is mr tyler  and i think i hear him now  making his last round of the night .  well     she added     he   s very old and very slow and it takes him about a week to go about his night watching  bearing in mind he sleeps through the day .  let   s go .  he   ll have a heart attack if he actually finds anybody .      there was indeed a creaking sound of a distant doorknob .   letitia lowered her voice .     do you mind if we sneak out the other way .  he might have a nasty turn if he actually discovers anybody .      a light was coming down the long corridor  although you needed to watch it for quite some time to see that it was moving .  letitia opened the door to the outer world and they hurried onto what would have been the lawn if anyone had mown it in the past ten years .  tiffany got the impression that lawn mowing here went at the same decrepit speed as mr tyler .  there was dew on the grass  and a certain sense that daylight was a distinct possibility sometime in the future .  as soon as they reached the broomstick  letitia made yet another muttered apology and hurried back into the sleeping house via another door  coming out again five minutes later carrying a large bag .     my mourning clothes     she said as the broomstick rose into the soft air .     it will be the old baron   s funeral tomorrow  the poor man .  my mother always travels with her funeral clothes .  she says you never know when someone is going to drop down dead .         that is a very interesting point of view  letitia  but when you get back to the castle i would like you to tell roland what you did  please .  i don   t care about anything else  but please tell him about the spell you did .     tiffany waited .  letitia was sitting behind her and  right now  silent .  very silent .  so much silence that you could hear it .   tiffany spent the time looking at the landscape as it wound past .  here and there smoke rose from kitchen fires  even though the sun was still below the horizon .  generally speaking  women in the villages raced to be the first to show smoke  it proved you were a busy housewife .  she sighed .  the thing about the broomstick was that when you rode it you looked down on people .  you couldn   t help it  however much you tried .  human beings seemed to be nothing but a lot of scurrying dots .  and when you started thinking like that  it was time you found the company of some other witches  to get your head straight .  you shall not be a witch alone  the saying went .  it wasn   t so much advice as a demand .   behind her  letitia said  in a voice that sounded as though she had weighed out every word very carefully before deciding to speak     why aren   t you angrier with me .         what do you mean .         you know .  after what i did .  you are just being dreadfully     nice .      tiffany was glad the girl couldn   t see her face and for that matter  she couldn   t see hers .      witches don   t often get angry .  all that shouting business never really gets anybody anywhere .      after another pause letitia said     if that is true  then maybe i   m not cut out to be a witch .  i feel very angry sometimes .         oh  i feel very angry a lot of the time     said tiffany     but i just put it away somewhere until i can do something useful with it .  that   s the thing about witchcraft     and wizardry  come to that .  we don   t do much magic at the best of times  and when we do  we generally do it on ourselves .  now  look  the castle   s right ahead .  i   ll drop you off on the roof  and frankly i   m looking forward to seeing how comfortable the straw is going to be .         look  i really am very  very           i know .  you said .  there   s no hard feelings  but you have to clear up your own mess .  that   s another part of witchcraft  that is .     and she added to herself  and don   t i know it .       chapter      the sin o    sins    the straw turned out to be comfortable enough  little cottages usually do not have spare rooms  so a witch there on business  such as the birthing of a child  was lucky to get a bed in the cowshed .  very lucky  in fact .  it often smelled better  and tiffany wasn   t alone in thinking that the breath of a cow  warm and smelling of grass  was a kind of medicine in itself .   the goats in the dungeon were nearly as good  though .  they sat placidly chewing their supper over and over again  while never taking their solemn gaze off her  as if they expected her to start juggling or doing some kind of song and dance act .   her last thought before falling asleep was that somebody must have given them the feed  and must therefore have noticed that the dungeon was minus one prisoner .  in that case  she was in more trouble  but it was hard to see how much more trouble she could be in .  possibly not that much  it seemed  because when she woke again  just an hour or so later  somebody had put a cover over her while she was asleep .  what was happening .   she found out when preston appeared with a tray of eggs and bacon  the eggs and bacon being slightly coffee flavoured on account of slopping on their way down the long stone staircase .     his lordship says it is with his compliments and apologies     said preston  grinning     and i   m to tell you that if you would like it  he could arrange for a hot bath to be waiting for you in the black and white chamber .  and when you   re ready  the baron     the new baron would like to see you in his study .      the idea of a bath sounded wonderful  but tiffany knew that there just wouldn   t be any time  and besides  even a halfway useful bath meant that some poor girls had to drag a load of heavy buckets up four or five flights of stone stairs .  she would have to make do with a quick swill out of a wash basin when the opportunity arose   .  but she was certainly ready for the bacon and eggs .  she made a mental note  as she wiped the plate  that if this was going to be a    be nice to tiffany day     she might try for another helping later on .   witches liked to make the most of gratitude while it was still warm .  people tended to become a little bit forgetful after a day or so .  preston watched with the expression of a boy who had eaten salt porridge for breakfast  and when she had finished said  carefully     and now will you go and see the baron .      he is concerned for me  tiffany thought .     first  i   d like to go and see the old baron     she said .      he   s still dead     preston volunteered  looking worried .      well  that   s some comfort anyway     said tiffany .     imagine the embarrassment otherwise .     she smiled at preston   s puzzlement .     and his funeral is tomorrow and that   s why i should see him today  preston  and right now .  please .  right now  he is more important than his son .      tiffany felt people   s eyes on her as she strode towards the crypt with preston almost running to keep up and clattering down the long steps after her .  she felt a bit sorry for him  because he had always been kind and respectful  but no one was to think that she was being led anywhere by a guard .  there had been enough of that .  the looks that people gave her seemed rather more frightened than angry  and she didn   t know if this was a good sign or not .   at the bottom of the steps she took a deep breath .  there was just the usual smell of the crypt  chilly with a hint of potatoes .  she smiled a little smile of self congratulation .  and there was the baron  lying peacefully just as she had left him  with his hands crossed on his chest  looking for all the world as though he was sleeping .      they thought i was doing witchcraft down here  didn   t they  preston .     she said .      there was some gossip  yes  miss .         well  i was .  your granny taught you about the care of the dead  right .  so you know it   s not right for the dead to be too long in the land of the living .  the weather is warm  and the summer has been hot  and the stones that could be as chilly as the grave are not as chilly as all that .  so  preston  go and get me two pails of water  please .     she sat quietly by the side of the slab as he scurried away .   earth and salt and two coins for the ferryman  those were the things that you gave to the dead  and you watched and listened like the mother of a newborn baby      preston came back  carrying two large pails with     she was pleased to see     only a limited amount of slopping .  he put them down quickly and turned to go .      no  stay here  preston     she commanded .     i want you to see what i do  so that if anyone asks  you can tell them the truth .      the guard nodded mutely .  she was impressed .  she placed one of the buckets beside the slab and knelt down by it  put one hand in the chilly bucket  pressed the other hand against the stone of the slab and whispered to herself     balance is everything .      anger helped .  it was amazing how useful it could be  if you saved it up until it could do some good  just as she had told letitia .  she heard the young guard gasp as the water in the bucket began to steam  and then to bubble .   he jumped to his feet .     i understand  miss .  i   ll take the boiling bucket away and bring you another cold one  yes .      three buckets of boiling water had been tipped away by the time the air in the crypt once again had the chill of the midwinter .  tiffany walked up the steps with her teeth very nearly chattering .     my granny would have loved to be able to do something like that     preston whispered .     she always said the dead don   t like the heat .  you put cold into the stone  right .         actually  i moved heat out of the slab and the air and put it in the bucket of water     said tiffany .     it   s not exactly magic .  it   s just a     a skill .  you just have to be a witch to do it  that   s all .      preston sighed .     i cured my granny   s chickens of fowl crop .  i had to cut them open to clean up the mess  and then i sewed them up again .  not one of them died .  and then when my mum   s dog got run over by a wagon  i cleaned him up  pushed all the bits back and he ended up right as rain except for the leg i couldn   t save  but i carved him a wooden one  with a leather harness and everything  and he still chases wagons .      tiffany tried not to look doubtful .     cutting into chickens to cure fowl crop hardly ever works     she said .     i know a pig witch who treats chickens when necessary  and she said it never worked for her .         ah  but maybe she didn   t have the knowin    of twister root     said preston cheerfully .     if you mix the juice with a little pennyroyal  they heal really well .  my granny had the knowing of the roots and she passed it on to me .         well     said tiffany     if you can sew up a chicken   s gizzard then you could mend a broken heart .  listen  preston  why don   t you get yourself apprenticed to be a doctor .      they had reached the door to the baron   s study .  preston knocked on it and then opened it for tiffany .     it   s them letters you get to put after your name     he whispered .     they are very expensive letters .  it might not cost money to become a witch  miss  but when you need them letters  oh  don   t you need that money .      roland was standing facing the door when tiffany stepped in  and his mouth was full of spill words  tumbling over themselves not to be said .  he did manage to say     er  miss aching     i mean  tiffany  my fianc  e assures me that we are all the victim of a magical plot aimed at your good self .  i do hope you will forgive any misunderstanding on our part  and i trust that we have not inconvenienced you too much  and may i add that i take some heart from the fact that you were clearly able to escape from our little dungeon .  er         tiffany wanted to shout     roland  do you remember that we first met when i was four years old and you were seven  running around in the dust with only our vests on .  i liked you better when you didn   t talk like some old lawyer with a broomstick stuck up his bum .  you sound as if you are addressing a public meeting .     but instead  she said     did letitia tell you everything .      roland looked sheepish .     i rather suspect that she did not  tiffany  but she was very forthright .  i may go so far as to say that she was emphatic .     tiffany tried not to smile .  he looked like a man who was beginning to understand some of the facts of married life .  he cleared his throat .     she tells me that we have been a victim of some kind of magical disease  which is currently trapped inside a book in keepsake hall .     it certainly sounded like a question  and she wasn   t surprised he was puzzled .      yes  that   s true .         and     apparently  everything is all right now she has taken your head out of a bucket of sand .     he looked truly lost at this point  and tiffany didn   t blame him .      i think things may have got a bit garbled     she said diplomatically .      and she tells me she is going to be a witch .     he looked a little miserable at this point .  tiffany felt sorry for him  but not very much .      well  i think she   s got the basic talent .  it   s up to her how much further she wants to take it .         i don   t know what her mother will say .      tiffany burst out laughing .     well  you can tell the duchess that queen magrat of lancre is a witch .  it   s no secret .  obviously the queening has to come first  but she is one of the best there is when it comes to potions .         really .      said roland .     the king and queen of lancre have graciously accepted an invitation to our wedding .     and tiffany was sure she could see his mind working .  in this strange chess game that was nobility  a real live queen beat just about everybody  which meant that the duchess would have to curtsy until her knees clicked .  she saw the spill words  that would of course be very unfortunate .  amazingly  roland could be careful even with his spill words .  however  he couldn   t stop the little grin .      your father gave me fifteen ankh morpork dollars in real gold .  it was a gift .  do you believe me .      he saw the look in her eye  and said     yes .     immediately .      good     said tiffany .     then find out where the nurse went .      some small part of broomstick might still have been in roland   s bum when he said     do you think my father understood the full worth of what he was giving you .         his mind was as clear as water up until the end  you know that .  you can trust him  just as you can trust me  and you can trust me now when i say to you that i will marry you .      her hand clamped itself over her mouth just too late .  where had that come from .  and he looked as shocked as she felt .   he spoke first  loudly and firmly to drive away the silence .     i didn   t quite hear what you just said  tiffany     i expect all your hard work in recent days has overwhelmed your sensibilities in some way .  i think we would all be a lot happier if we knew that you are having a good rest .  i     love letitia  you know .  she is not very  well  complicated  but i would do anything for her .  when she is happy  that makes me happy .  and generally speaking  i am not very good at happy .     she saw a tear trickle down his face and  unable to stop herself  handed him a reasonably clean handkerchief .  he took it and tried to blow his nose  laugh and cry all at the same time .     and you  tiffany  i am very fond of  really fond of     but it   s as if you have a handkerchief for the whole world .  you are smart .  no  don   t shake your head .  you are smart .  i remember once  when we were younger  you were fascinated by the word    onomatopoeia    .  like making a name or a word from a sound  like cuckoo or hum or      .         jangle .     said tiffany  before she could stop herself .      that   s right  and i remember that you said    humdrum    was the sound that boredom made  because it sounded like a very tired fly buzzing at the closed window of an old attic room on a boiling hot summer   s day .  and i thought  i couldn   t understand that .  it makes no sense to me  and i know you are clever and it makes sense to you .  i think you need a special kind of head to think like that .  and a special kind of clever .  and i haven   t got that kind of head .         what sound does kindness make .     said tiffany .      i know what kindness is  but i can   t imagine it making a noise .  there you go again .  i just don   t have the head that lives in a world where kindness has its own sound .  i have a head that lives in a world where two and two makes four .  it must be very interesting  and i envy you like hell .  but i think i understand letitia .  letitia is uncomplicated  if you see what i mean .      a girl who once exorcized a noisy ghost from the privy as if it was just another chore  tiffany thought .  well  good luck with that one  sir .  but she didn   t say it out loud .  instead  she said     i think you have made a very wise match  roland .     to her surprise  he looked relieved  and went behind his desk again as a soldier might hide behind the battlements .      this afternoon  some of the more distant guests will be arriving here for the funeral tomorrow  and indeed some will be staying on for the wedding .  fortuitously        that was another little piece of broom handle        pastor egg is passing through on the circuit  and has kindly agreed to say a few good words over my father  and he will remain with us as our guest to officiate at the wedding .  he is a member of a modern omnian sect .  my future mother in law approves of the omnians but  regrettably  not of this sect  so that is all a little strained .     he rolled his eyes .     moreover  i understand he is fresh from the city  and as you know  city preachers don   t always do well here .        i would deem it a great favour  tiffany  if you can help in any way to prevent any little difficulties and disturbances  especially those of an occult nature  in the trying days to come .  please .  there are enough stories already going about .      tiffany was still blushing after her outburst .  she nodded and managed to say     look  about what i just said back then  i didn   t        she stopped  because roland had raised a hand .     this is a bewildering time for all of us .  there   s a reason for all the superstitions .  the time around weddings and funerals is fraught with stress for all concerned  except in the case of the funeral  for the chief  as it were  player     he said .     let us just be calm and careful .  i   m very pleased that letitia likes you .  i don   t think she has many friends .  and now  if you   ll excuse me  i have more arrangements to supervise .             tiffany   s own voice still bounced around in her head as she walked out of the room .  why had she said that about marrying .  she   d always thought it was going to be true .  well  when she was a bit younger she had thought it was going to be true  but all that was past  wasn   t it .  yes  it was .  and to come out with something as wet and stupid as that was so embarrassing .   and where was she going now .  well  there were plenty of things to do  there always were .  there was no end to the wanting .  she was halfway across the hall when one of the maids approached her nervously and told her that miss letitia wanted to see her in her room .   the girl was sitting on her bed  twisting a handkerchief     a clean one  tiffany was pleased to see     and looking worried  which was to say more worried than her usual expression  which was that of a hamster that had had its treadmill stopped .      so kind of you to come  tiffany .  can i have a private word .     tiffany looked around .  there was no one else there .     privately     said letitia  and gave the handkerchief another twist .   hasn   t got many friends of her own age  tiffany thought .  i bet she wasn   t allowed to play with the village children .  doesn   t get out much .  getting married in a couple of days .  oh dear .  it wasn   t a very difficult conclusion to reach .  a tortoise with a bad leg could have jumped to it .  and then there was roland .  kidnapped by the queen of the elves  held in her nasty country for ages without growing older  bullied by his aunts  worried sick about his elderly father  finds it necessary to act as if he is twenty years older than he really is .  oh dear .      how can i help you .     she said brightly .   letitia cleared her throat .     after the wedding we will have a honeymoon     she said  her face shading to a delicate pink .     what exactly is supposed to happen .     the last few words were mumbled quickly  tiffany noticed .      do you have any     aunts .     she asked .  aunts were generally good at this sort of thing .  letitia shook her head .     have you tried talking about it with your mother .     tiffany tried  and letitia turned on her a face that was as red as a boiled lobster .      would you talk about this sort of thing with my mother .         i can see the problem .  well  broadly speaking  and i don   t speak exactly as an expert here        but she was .    a witch couldn   t help being some kind of expert as to the ways people came and entered the world  by the time she was twelve the older witches had trusted her to go out to a birth by herself .  besides  she had helped lambs to be born  even when she was quite small .  it came naturally  as nanny ogg said  although not as naturally as you might think .  she remembered mr and mrs hamper  quite a decent couple who had three children in a row before they worked out what was causing it .  ever since then she had tried to have a chat with the village girls of a certain age  just to be on the safe side .   letitia listened like someone who was going to make notes afterwards  and possibly get tested on friday .  she didn   t ask any questions until about halfway through  when she said     are you sure .         yes .  i   m pretty certain     said tiffany .      well  er  it sounds reasonably straightforward .  of course  i suppose boys know all about this sort of thing     why are you laughing .         it   s a matter of opinion     said tiffany .   oh  now i see you .  i see you  you filth  you plague  you noxious abomination .   tiffany looked at letitia   s mirror  which was big and had around it lots of fat  golden cherubs who were clearly catching their death of cold .  there was letitia   s reflection  and there was     faint but visible     the eyeless face of the cunning man .  the outline of the cunning man began to thicken .  tiffany knew that nothing in her face had changed .  she knew it .  i won   t answer him  she thought .  i had almost forgotten all about him .  don   t answer .  don   t let him get a hold on you .   she managed to smile while letitia hauled out from cases and chests what she called her trousseau which  in tiffany   s opinion  contained the world   s entire supply of frilliness .  she tried to focus on it  to let frilliness fill her mind and somehow chase away the words that came pouring from him .  the ones she understood were bad enough  the ones that she didn   t were worse .  despite everything  the creaking  choking voice got through again  you think you have been lucky  witch .  you hope you will be lucky again .  you need to sleep .  i never sleep .  you have to be lucky time after time .  i have to be lucky just once .  just once  and you will     burn .  that last word was soft  almost gentle  after the creaking  coughing  scraping words that came before .  it sounded worse .      you know     said letitia  looking thoughtfully at a garment that tiffany knew she could never afford .     while i am truly looking forward to being the mistress of this castle  i must say that the drainage system here smells dreadful .  in fact  it smells like it has never been cleaned since the world began .  honestly  i could believe that prehistoric monsters have done their business in it .      so she can smell him  tiffany thought .  she is a witch .  a witch who needs training because without it she   s going to be a menace to everybody  not least herself .  letitia was still prattling on     there was no other word for it .  tiffany  still trying to defeat the voice of the cunning man by sheer will  said aloud     why .         oh  because i think the bows look a lot more fetching than buttons     said letitia  who was holding up a nightdress of considerable splendour  another reminder to tiffany that witches never really had any money .   you burned before and so did i .  croaked the voice in her head  but this time you will not take me .  i will take you and your confederacy of evil .  .  .  .  .   tiffany thought she could actually see the exclamation marks .  they shouted for him  even when he spoke softly .  they jumped and slashed at his words .  she could see his contorted face and the little flecks of foam that accompanied the finger waving and shouting     gobs of liquid madness flying through the air behind the mirror .   how lucky for letitia that she couldn   t hear him yet  but her mind was currently full of frills  bells  rice and the prospect of being at the centre of a wedding .  not even the cunning man could burn his way through that .   she managed to say     it   s not going to work for you .     and part of her kept repeating  inside her head  no eyes .  no eyes at all .  two tunnels in his head .      yes  i think you   re right .  possibly the mauve one would look better     said letitia     although i have always been told that eau de nil is really my colour .  by the way  could i make things up to you in some way by having you as my chief bridesmaid .  of course  i   ve already got a load of tiny distant cousins who i understand have been wearing their bridesmaids    dresses for the past two weeks .      tiffany was still staring at nothing  or rather  at two holes into nothing .  at the moment  they were the most important things in her mind  and they were quite bad enough without adding tiny little cousins into the mixture .     i don   t think that witches are bridesmaid material  thank you all the same     she said .   bridesmaids .  a wedding .   tiffany   s heart sank further .  there was no help for it .  she ran out of the room before the creature could learn anything more .  how did it search .  what was it looking for .  had they just given it a clue .  she fled down to the dungeon  which was right now a place of refuge .   there was the book that letitia had given to her .  she opened it and began to read .  she had learned to read fast up in the mountains  when the only books you could get were from the travelling library  and if you were late returning them they charged you an extra penny  an appreciable amount when your standard unit of currency is an old boot .   the book told stories of windows .  not ordinary windows  although some might be .  and behind them     things     monsters  sometimes .  a painting  a page in a book     even a puddle in the right place     could be a window .  she remembered once more the nasty goblin in the old book of fairytales  sometimes it was laughing and at other times it was grinning .  she had always been sure about that .  it wasn   t a big change  but it was still a change .  and you always wondered  what was it like that last time .  did i remember it wrong .   the book rustled under tiffany   s hands like a hungry squirrel waking up in a hollow tree full of nuts .  the author was a wizard  and a long winded one at that  but the book was fascinating even so .  there had been people who walked into a picture  and people who had walked out of one .  windows were a way of getting from one world into another  and anything could be a window and anything could be a world .  she had heard that the sign of a good painting was that the eyes followed you around the room  but according to the book it was quite likely that they might follow you home and upstairs to bed  as well     an idea that she would rather not think about right now .  being a wizard  the author had tried to explain it all with graphs and charts  none of which helped in any way .   the cunning man had run towards her inside a book  and she had slammed it shut before he got out .  she had seen his fingers just as the press had spun down .  but he couldn   t have been squashed inside the book  she thought  because he wasn   t really in the book at all  except in some magical way  and he   s been finding me in other ways too .  how .  right now  those tiresome days of seeing to broken legs  bad stomachs and ingrown toenails suddenly seemed quite attractive .  she   d always told people that was what witchcraft was all about  and that was true  right up until the time something horrible could jump out of nowhere .  that was when a poultice just wouldn   t do the trick .   a piece of straw floated down and landed on the book .     it   s safe for you to come out     said tiffany .     you are here  aren   t you .      and right by her ear a voice said     oh aye  that we are .     they appeared from behind straw bales  spider webs  apple shelves  goats and one another .      aren   t you wee mad arthur .         aye  miss  that is correct .  i have to tell ye  to my embarrassment  that rob anybody is placing a big trust in me because i am a polisman and rob appeared to think  ye ken  that if ye are dealing with bigjobs  a polisman will make them even more afeared .  besides  i can speak bigjob .  rob is spending more time up at the mound right now  ye ken .  an    he doesnae trust yon baron not tae come up there with shovels .         i will see that does not happen     said tiffany firmly .     there has been a misunderstanding .      wee mad arthur did not look convinced .     it is glad i am to hear you say that  miss  and so will the big man be  because i can tell ye that when the first shovel breaks into the mound there willnae be a living man left in yonder castle  and great will be the lamentation of the women  present company excepted .     there was a general murmuring from the other feegles  on the broad theme of slaughter for whoever laid a hand on a feegle mound  and how personally each and every one of them would regret what he would have to do .      it   s yon troosers     said slightly thinner than fat jock jock .     once a man gets a feegle up his troosers  his time of trial and tribulation is only just beginning .         oh aye  it will be a great time o    jumpin    and leapin    up and doon for such as them     said wee jock o    the white head .   tiffany was shocked .     when was the last time feegles fought with bigjobs  then .      after some discussion among the feegles  this was declared to be the battle o    the middens when  according to wee jock o    the white head     there was never such a screaming and rushing about and stamping on the ground  and pitiable sobbing  the like of which was never before heard  along with the coarse tittering of the ladies as the men scrambled to divest themselves of troosers that were suddenly no longer their friends  if ye ken what i   m saying .      tiffany  who had been listening to the tale with an open mouth  had the presence of mind to shut it  and then open it again to say     but have feegles ever killed a human .      this led to a certain amount of deliberate lack of eye contact among the feegles  plus quite a lot of foot shuffling and head scratching  with the usual fallout of insects  hoarded food  interesting stones and other unspeakable items .  in the end  wee mad arthur said     being as i am  miss  a feegle who has only but recently learned that he is not a fairy cobbler  i ha    nae pride tae lose by telling ye that it is true that i have been speaking to my new brothers and learned that  when they lived up in the far mountains  they did have tae fight humans sometimes  when they came a digging for the fairy gold  and a terror err able fighting did take place and  indeed  those bandits as were too stupid to run may have found themselves clever enough to die .     he coughed .     however  in defence of my new brethren i must point out that they always made certain that the odds were fair and just  which is to say one feegle to every ten men .  ye cannae say fairer than that .  and it wasnae their fault that some men just wanted tae commit suicide .      there was a glint in wee mad arthur   s eye that prompted tiffany to ask     how exactly did they commit suicide .      the policeman feegle shrugged his small broad shoulders .     they took a shovel to a feegle mound  miss .  i am a man who knows the law  miss .  i never saw a mound until i met these fine gentlemen  but even so my blood boils  miss  it boils  so it does .  my heart it does thump  my pulse it does race  and my gorge it arises like the breath of some dragon at the very thought of a bright steel shovel slicing through the clay of a feegle mound  cutting and crushing .  i would kill the man that does this  miss .  i would kill him dead  and chase him through the next life to kill him another time  and i would do it again and again  because it would be the sin o    sins  to kill an entire people  and one death wouldnae be enough for recompense .  however  as i am an aforesaid man of the law  i very much hope that the current misunderstanding can be resolved withoot the need for wholesale carnage and bloodletting and screaming and wailing and weeping and people having bits of themselves nailed to trees  such as has never been seen before  ye ken .     wee mad arthur  holding his full sized policeman   s badge like a shield  stared at tiffany with a mixture of shock and defiance .   and tiffany was a witch .     i must tell you something  wee mad arthur     she said     and you must understand what i say .  you have come home  wee mad arthur .      the shield dropped out of his hand .     aye  miss  i ken that now .  a policeman should not say the words i just said .  he should talk about judges and juries and prisons and sentences  and he would say ye cannae take the law intae your own hands .  so i will hand in my badge  indeed  and stay here among my own folk  although i have to say  with better standards o    hygiene .      this got a round of applause from the assembled feegles  although tiffany wasn   t sure that most of them fully understood the concept of hygiene or  for that matter  obeying the law .      you have my word     said tiffany     that the mound will not be touched again .  i will see to it  do you understand .         och  weel     said wee mad arthur tearfully .     that might be all very well  miss  but what will happen behind your back when ye are a flying and a whizzing aboot your verrae important business across the hills .  what will happen then .      all eyes turned to tiffany  including those of the goats .  she didn   t do this kind of thing any more because she knew it was bad manners  but tiffany picked up wee mad arthur bodily and held him at eye level .     i am the hag o    the hills     she said .     and i will vow to you and all other feegles that the home of the feegles will never be threatened with iron again .  it will never be behind my back but will always be in front of my eyes .  and while this is so  no living man will touch it if he wants to remain a living man .  and if i fail the feegles in this  may i be dragged through the seven hells on a broomstick made of nails .      strictly speaking  tiffany admitted to herself  these were pretty much empty threats  but the feegles did not think an oath was an oath if it didn   t have lots of thunder and lightning and boasting and blood in it .  blood  somehow  made it official .  i will see to it that the mound is never touched again  she thought .  there is no way that roland can refuse me now .  and besides  i have a secret weapon  i have the trust and confidence of a young lady who is soon going to be his wife .  no man can be safe in those circumstances .   in the glow of reassurance wee mad arthur said happily     well spoken  mistress  and may i take the opportunity on behalf of my new friends and relatives tae thank ye for explaining all aboot the business of the wedding nuptials the noo .  it was verrae interesting to those of us who have little to do with such things .  some of us was wondering if we could ask questions .      being threatened by a spectral horror was terrible enough right now  but somehow the thought of the nac mac feegle asking questions about the facts of married life among humans was even worse .  there was no point in explaining why she wasn   t going to explain  tiffany simply said    no    in a tone of voice like steel and very carefully put him back down on the ground .  she added     you shouldn   t have been listening .         why not .     said daft wullie .      you just shouldn   t .  i   m not going to explain .  you just shouldn   t .  and now  gentlemen  i   d like a bit of time to myself  if it   s all the same to you .      some of them would follow her  of course  she thought .  they always did .  she went back up to the hall and sat down as close as possible to the huge fire .  even in late summer  the hall was cold .  it was hung with tapestries as insulation from the chill of the stone walls .  they were the usual sort of thing  men in armour waving swords and bows and axes at other men in armour .  given that battle is very fast and noisy  they presumably had to stop fighting every couple of minutes to give the ladies who were making the tapestry a little time to catch up .  tiffany knew the one nearest the fire by heart .  all the kids did .  you learned your history off the tapestries  if there was some old man around to explain what was going on .  but generally  when she was a lot younger  it had been more fun to make up stories about the different knights  like the one who was desperately running to catch up with his horse  and the one who had been thrown by his horse  and  because he had a helmet with a point on it  was now upright head first in the ground  which  even as children  they had recognized was not a good position to be in on the battle field .  they were like old friends  frozen in a war whose name nobody on the chalk could remember .   and     suddenly there was another one  one that had never been there before  running towards tiffany through the battle .  she stared at him  her body demanding that she get some sleep right now  and whatever bits were still working in her brain insisting that she did something .  in the middle of this her hand gripped a log on the edge of the fire and she raised it purposefully towards the tapestry .   the cloth had practically crumbled with age as it was .  it would burn like dry grass .   the figure was walking cautiously now .  she couldn   t see any details yet and didn   t want to .  the knights on the tapestry had been woven in without any perspective  they were as flat as a child   s nursery painting .   but the man in black  who had begun as a distant streak  was getting bigger as he approached and now     she could see the face and the empty eyeholes  which even from here changed colour as he walked past the painted armour of knight after knight  and now he had started running again  getting bigger .  and the smell was oozing towards her again     how much was the tapestry worth .  did she have any right to destroy it .  with that thing stepping out of it .  oh yes  oh yes .   wouldn   t it be nice to be a wizard and to conjure up those knights to fight one last battle .   wouldn   t it be nice to be a witch who wasn   t here .  she raised the crackling log and glared into the holes where the eyes should be .  you had to be a witch to be prepared to stare down a stare that wasn   t there  because somehow you felt that it was sucking your own eyeballs out of your head .   those tunnels in the skull were hypnotic  and now he moved from side to side slowly  like a snake .      please don   t .      she wasn   t expecting that  the voice was urgent but quite friendly     and it belonged to eskarina smith .   the wind was silver and cold .   tiffany  lying on her back  looked up into a white sky  at the edge of her vision  dried grasses shook and rattled in the wind but  curiously  behind this little bit of countryside there was the big fireplace and the battling knights .      it is really quite important that you don   t move     said the same voice behind her .     the place where you are now has been  as we say  cobbled together for this conversation and did not exist until you arrived here  and will cease to exist the moment you leave .  strictly speaking  by the standards of most philosophical disciplines  it cannot be said to have any existence at all .         so it   s a magic place  yes .  like the unreal estate .         very sensible way of putting it     said the voice of eskarina .     those of us who know about it call it the travelling now .  it   s an easy way to talk to you in private  when it closes  you will be exactly where you were and no time will have passed .  do you understand .         no .      eskarina sat down on the grass next to her .     thank goodness for that .  it would be rather disturbing if you did .  you are  you know  an extremely unusual witch .  as far as i can tell  you have a natural talent for making cheese  and as talents go  it is a pretty good talent to have .  the world needs cheese makers .  a good cheese maker is worth her weight in  well  cheese .  so you were not born with a talent for witchcraft .      tiffany opened her mouth to reply before she had any idea what she was going to say  but that is not unusual among human beings .  the first thing to push through the throng of questions was     hang on  i was holding a burning brand .  but now you have brought me here  wherever here is exactly .  what happened .     she looked at the fire .  the flames were frozen .     people will notice me     she said  and then  given the nature of the situation  she added     won   t they .         the answer is no  the reason is complicated .  the travelling now is     tame time .  it   s time that is on your side .  believe me  there are stranger things in the universe .  right now  tiffany  we are truly living on borrowed time .      the flames were still frozen .  tiffany felt that they should be cold  but she could feel the warmth .  and she had time to think too .     and when i go back .         nothing will have changed     said eskarina     except the contents of your head  which are  at the moment  very important .         and you   ve gone to all this trouble to tell me i have no talent for witchcraft .     tiffany said flatly .     that was very kind of you .      eskarina laughed .  it was her young laugh  which seemed strange when you saw the wrinkles on her face .  tiffany had never seen an old person looking so young .     i said you weren   t born with a talent for witchcraft  it didn   t come easily  you worked hard at it because you wanted it .  you forced the world to give it to you  no matter the price  and the price is and will always be  high .  have you heard the saying    the reward you get for digging holes is a bigger shovel    .         yes     said tiffany     i heard granny weatherwax say it once .         she invented it .  people say you don   t find witchcraft  witchcraft finds you .  but you   ve found it  even if at the time you didn   t know what it was you were finding  and you grabbed it by its scrawny neck and made it work for you .         this is all very     interesting     said tiffany     but i have got things i must be doing .         not in the travelling now     said eskarina firmly .     look  the cunning man has found you again .         i think he hides in books and pictures     tiffany volunteered .     and tapestries .     she shuddered .      and mirrors     said eskarina     and puddles  and the glint of light on a piece of broken glass  or the gleam on a knife .  how many ways can you think of .  how frightened are you prepared to be .         i   m going to have to fight him     tiffany said .     i think i knew i would have to .  he doesn   t seem to me to be someone you can run away from .  he   s a bully  isn   t he .  he attacks where he thinks he will win  and so i have to find a way to be stronger than he is .  i think i can work out a way     after all  he is a bit like the hiver .  and that was really quite easy .      eskarina did not shout  she spoke very quietly and in a way that seemed to make more noise than a scream would have done .     will you persist in not recognizing how important this is  tiffany aching the cheese maker .  you have a chance to defeat the cunning man  and if you fail  witchcraft fails     and falls with you .  he will possess your body  your knowledge  your talents and your soul .  and for your own good     and for the good of all     your sister witches will settle their differences and take the pair of you into oblivion before you can do any more harm .  do you understand .  this is important .  you have to help yourself .         the other witches will kill me .     said tiffany  aghast .      of course .  you are a witch and you know what granny weatherwax always says  we do right  we don   t do nice .  it will be you or him  tiffany aching .  the loser will die .  in his case  i regret to say we might see him again in a few centuries  in your case  i don   t propose to guess .         but hold on a moment     said tiffany .     if they are prepared to fight him and me  why don   t we all band together to fight him now .         of course .  would you like them to .  what is it you really want  tiffany aching  here and now .  it   s your choice .  the other witches will not  i am sure  think any the worse of you .     eskarina hesitated for a moment  and then said     well  i expect they will be very kind about it .      the witch who faced the trial and ran away .  thought tiffany .  the witch they were kind to  because they knew she wasn   t good enough .  and if you think you   re not good enough  then you are already no kind of witch .  aloud she said     i   d rather die trying to be a witch  than be the girl they were all kind to .         miss aching  you are showing an almost sinful self assurance and overwhelming pride and certainty  and may i say that i wouldn   t expect anything less of a witch .             the world wobbled a bit and then changed .  eskarina vanished  even as her words were still sinking into tiffany   s mind .  the tapestry was back in front of her again and she was still raising the burning log  but this time she raised it confidently .  she felt as if she was full of air  lifting her up .  the world had gone strange  but at least she knew that fire would burn dry tapestry like tinder the moment it touched it .      i would burn this old sheet in an instant  mister  trust me .  back to where you came from  mister .      to her astonishment the dark figure retreated .  there was a momentary hiss and tiffany felt as if a weight had dropped away  dragging the stench with it .      that was all very interesting .     tiffany spun round and looked into preston   s cheerful grin .     do you know     he said     i was really worried when you went so stiff for a few moments .  i thought you were dead .  when i touched your arm     very respectfully  no hanky panky     it felt like the air on a thundery day .  so i thought  this is witch business  and decided to keep an eye on you  and then you threatened an innocent tapestry with fiery death .      she stared at the boy   s eyes as if they were a mirror .  fire  she thought .  fire killed him once  and he knows it .  he won   t go anywhere near fire .  fire is the secret .  the hare runs into the fire .  hmm .      actually  i quite like fire     said preston .     i don   t think it   s my enemy at all .         what .     said tiffany .      i   m afraid you were speaking just under your breath     said preston .     i   m not going to ask what it was about .  my granny said  don   t meddle in the affairs of witches because they clout you around the ear .      tiffany stared at him and made an instant decision .     can you keep a secret .      preston nodded .     certainly .  i have never told anybody that the sergeant writes poetry  for example .         preston  you have just told me .      preston grinned at her .     ah  but a witch isn   t anybody .  my granny told me that telling your secret to a witch is like whispering to a wall .         well  yes     tiffany began and then paused .     how do you know he writes poetry .         it was hard not to know     said preston .     but  you see  he writes it on pages of the events ledger in the guard house  probably when he   s on night duty .  he carefully tears out the pages  and does it so neatly that you wouldn   t guess  but he presses so hard with his pencil that it   s quite easy to read the impression on the paper underneath .         surely the other men notice .     said tiffany .   preston shook his head  which caused his oversized helmet to spin a little .     oh no  miss  you know them  they think reading is cissy stuff for girls .  anyway  if i get in early i tear out the paper underneath so that they don   t laugh at him .  i have to say  for a self taught man he is a pretty good poet     good grasp of the metaphor .  they are all written to somebody called millie .         that would be his wife     said tiffany .     you must have seen her in the village     more freckles than anyone i   ve ever seen .  she is very sensitive about it .      preston nodded .     that might explain why his latest poem is entitled    what good is the sky without stars    .         you wouldn   t know it from looking at the man  would you .      preston looked thoughtful for a moment .     excuse me  tiffany     he said     but you don   t look well .  in fact  no offence meant  you look absolutely dreadful .  if you were somebody else and took a look at you  you would say that you were very ill indeed .  you don   t look as if you   ve had any sleep .         i had at least an hour   s worth last night .  and a nap the day before .     said tiffany .      really .     said preston  looking stern .     and apart from breakfast this morning  when did you last have a proper meal .      for some reason tiffany still felt full of light inside .     i think i might have had a snack yesterday            oh really .     said preston .     snacks and naps .  that   s not how somebody is supposed to live  it   s how people die .      he was right .  she knew he was .  but that only made things worse .      look  i   m being tracked by a horrible creature who can take over somebody else completely  and it   s up to me to deal with it .      preston looked around with interest .     could it take me over .      poison goes where poison   s welcome  thought tiffany .  thank you for that useful phrase  mrs proust .     no  i don   t think so .  i think you have to be the right kind of person     which is to say  the wrong kind of person .  you know  somebody with a touch of evil .      for the first time  preston looked worried .     i have done a few bad things in my time  i   m sorry to say .      despite her sudden tiredness  tiffany smiled .     what was the worst one .         i once stole a packet of coloured pencils off a market stall .     he looked at her defiantly  as if expecting her to scream or point the finger of scorn .   instead  she shook her head and said     how old were you then .         six .         preston  i don   t think this creature could ever find its way into your head .  quite apart from anything else  it seems pretty crowded and complicated to me .         miss tiffany  you need a rest  a proper rest in a proper bed .  what kind of witch can look after everybody if she   s not sensible enough to look after herself .  quis custodiet ipsos custodes .  that means  who guards the guards  that does     preston went on .     so who watches the witches .  who cares for the people who care for the people .  right now  it looks like it needs to be me .      she gave in .          the fog of the city was as thick as curtains when mrs proust hurried towards the dark  brooding shape of the tanty  but the billows obediently separated as she approached and closed again after her .   the warden was waiting at the main gate  a lantern in his hand .     sorry  missus  but we thought you ought to see this one before it gets all official .  i know witches seem a bit unpopular right now  but we   ve always thought of you as family  if you know what i mean .  everyone remembers your dad .  what a craftsman .  he could hang a man in seven and a quarter seconds .  never been beat .  we shall never see his likes again .     he went solemn .     and may i say  missus  i hope i never see again the like of what you will be seeing now .  it   s got us rattled  and no mistake .  it   s right up your street  i reckon .      mrs proust shook the water droplets off her cloak in the prison office and could smell the fear in the air .  there was the general clanging and distant yelling that you always got when things were going bad in a prison  a prison  by definition  being a lot of people all crammed together and every fear and hatred and worry and dread and rumour all sitting on top of one another  choking for space .  she hung the cloak on a nail by the door and rubbed her hands together .     the lad you sent said something about a breakout .         d wing     said the warder .     macintosh .  you remember .  been in here about a year .         oh yes  i recall     said the witch .     they had to stop the trial because the jury kept throwing up .  very nasty indeed .  but no one has ever escaped from d wing  right .  the window bars are steel .         bent     said the warder flatly .     you   d better come and see .  it   s giving us the heebie jeebies  i don   t mind telling you .         macintosh wasn   t a particularly big man  as i recall     said the witch as they hurried along the dank corridors .      that   s right  mrs proust .  short and nasty  that was him .  due to hang next week too .  tore out bars that a strong man wouldn   t have been able to shift with a crowbar and dropped thirty feet to the ground .  that   s not natural  that   s not right .  but it was the other thing he did     oh my word  it makes me sick thinking about it .      a warder was waiting outside the cell recently vacated by the absent macintosh  but for no reason that mrs proust could recognize  given that the man had definitely gone .  he touched the brim of his hat respectfully when he saw her .      good morning  mrs proust     he said .     may i say it   s an honour to meet the daughter of the finest hangman in history .  fifty one years before the lever  and never a client down .  mr trooper now  decent bloke  but sometimes they bounce a bit and i don   t consider that professional .  and your dad wouldn   t forego a well deserved hanging out of the fear that fires of evil and demons of dread would haunt him afterwards .  you mark my words  he   d go after them and hang them too .  seven and a quarter seconds  what a gentleman .      but mrs proust was staring down at the floor .      terrible thing for a lady to have to see     the warder went on .  almost absentmindedly mrs proust said     witches are not ladies when on business  frank     and then she sniffed the air and swore an oath that made frank   s eyes water .      it makes you wonder what got into him  aye .      mrs proust straightened up .     i don   t have to wonder  my lad     she said grimly .     i know .      the fog piled up against the buildings in its effort to get out of the way of mrs proust as she hurried back to tenth egg street  leaving behind her a mrs proust shaped tunnel in the gloom .   derek was drinking a peaceful mug of cocoa when his mother burst in to the strains  as it were  of a large fart .  he looked up  his brow wrinkling .     did that sound like b flat to you .  it didn   t sound like b flat to me .     he reached into the drawer under the counter for his tuning fork  but his mother rushed past him .      where   s my broomstick .      derek sighed .     in the basement  remember .  when the dwarfs told you last month how much it would cost to repair  you told them they were a bunch of chiselling little lawn ornaments  remember .  anyway  you never use it .         i   ve got to go into the     country     said mrs proust  looking around the crowded shelves in case there was another working broomstick there .   her son stared .     are you sure  mother .  you   ve always said it   s bad for your health .         matter of life or death     mrs proust mumbled .     what about long tall short fat sally .         oh  mother  you really shouldn   t call her that     said derek reproachfully .     she can   t help being allergic to tides .         she   s got a stick  though .  hah .  if it   s not one thing it   s another .  make me some sandwiches  will you .         is this about that girl who was in here last week .     said derek suspiciously .     i don   t think she had much of a sense of humour .      his mother ignored him and rummaged under the counter  coming back with a large leather cosh .  the small traders of tenth egg street worked on narrow margins  and had a very direct approach to shoplifting .     i don   t know  i really don   t     she moaned .     me .  doing good at my time of life .  i must be going soft in the head .  and i   m not even going to get paid .  i don   t know  i really don   t .  next thing you know  i   ll start giving people three wishes  and if i start doing that  derek  i would like you to hit me very hard on the head .     she handed him the cosh .     i   m leaving you in charge .  try to shift some of the rubber chocolate and the humorous fake fried eggs  will you .  tell people they are novelty bookmarks or something .      and with that  mrs proust ran out into the night .  the lanes and alleyways of the city were very dangerous at night  what with muggers  thieves and similar unpleasantnesses .  but they disappeared back into the gloom as she passed .  mrs proust was bad news  and best left undisturbed if you wanted to keep all the bones in your fingers pointing the right way .   the body that was macintosh ran through the night .  it was full of pain .  this didn   t matter to the ghost  it wasn   t his pain .  its sinews sang with agony  but it was not the ghost   s agony .  the fingers bled where they had torn steel bars out of the wall .  but the ghost did not bleed .  it never bled .   it couldn   t remember when it had had a body that was really its own .  bodies had to be fed and had to drink .  that was an annoying feature of the wretched things .  sooner or later they ran out of usefulness .  often  that didn   t matter  there was always somebody     a little mind festering with hatred and envy and resentment that would welcome the ghost inside .  but it had to be careful  and it had to be quick .  but above all it had to be safe .  out here  on the empty roads  another suitable container would be hard to find .  regretfully  it allowed the body to stop and drink from the murky waters of a pond .  it turned out to be full of frogs  but a body had to eat too  didn   t it .      witches always made certain that their hands were scrupulously clean  the rest of the witch had to wait for some time in the busy schedule     or possibly for a thunderstorm .        there was no tradition of holy men on the chalk  but since the hills were between the cities and the mountains  there was generally     in the good weather  at least     a steady procession of priests of one sort or another passing through who would  for a decent meal or a bed for the night  spread some holy words and generally give people   s souls a decent scrubbing .  provided that the priests were clearly of the decent sort  people didn   t worry unduly who their god was  so long as he     or occasionally she and sometimes it     kept the sun and moon spinning properly and didn   t want anything ridiculous or new .  it also helped if the preacher knew a little something about sheep .        if not through actual personal practice .       chapter      the shaking of the sheets    her proper bed in the castle   s black and white chamber was so much better than the dungeon  even though tiffany had missed the soothing burps of the goats .   she dreamed of fire  again .  and she was being watched .  she could feel it  and it wasn   t the goats this time .  she was being watched inside her head .  but it wasn   t bad watching  someone was caring for her .  and in the dream the fire raged  and a dark figure pulled aside the flames as though they were curtains  and there was the hare sitting by the dark figure as if she was a pet .  the hare caught tiffany   s eye and jumped into the fire .  and tiffany knew .   somebody knocked at the door .  tiffany was suddenly awake .     who   s there .      a voice on the other side of the heavy door said     what sound does forgetfulness make .      she hardly had to think .     it   s the sound of the wind in dead grasses on a hot summer   s day .         yes  i think that would about do it     said preston   s voice from the other side of the door .     to get right to the point  miss  there   s a lot of people downstairs  miss .  i think they need their witch .      it was a good day for a funeral  tiffany thought  looking out of the narrow castle window .  it shouldn   t rain on a funeral .  it made people too gloomy .  she tried not to be gloomy at funerals .  people lived  and died  and were remembered .  it happened in the same way that winter followed summer .  it was not a wrong thing .  there were tears  of course  but they were for those who were left  those who had gone on did not need them .   the staff had been up very early  and the long tables had been put out in the hall to make a breakfast for all comers .  that was a tradition .  rich or poor  lord or lady  the funeral breakfast was there for everyone  and out of respect for the old baron  and also out of respect for a good meal  the hall was filling up .  the duchess was there  in a black dress that was more black than any black tiffany had ever seen before .  the dress gleamed .  the black dress of the average witch was usually only theoretically black .  in reality  it was often rather dusty  and quite possibly patched in the vicinity of the knees and somewhat ragged at the hems and  of course  very nearly worn through by frequent washings .  it was what it was  working clothes .  you couldn   t imagine the duchess delivering a baby in that dress     tiffany blinked .  she could imagine the duchess doing just that  if it was an emergency  she would .  she would bully and complain and order people around  but she would do it .  she was that kind of person .   tiffany blinked again .  her head felt crystal clear .  the world seemed understandable but slightly fragile  as if it could be broken  like a mirror ball .      morning  miss .     that was amber  and behind her  both her parents  mr petty looking scrubbed and sheepish and also quite bashful .  he clearly didn   t know what to say .  nor did tiffany .   there was a stir at the main doors  and roland hurried in that direction and came back with king verence of lancre and magrat  his queen .  tiffany had met them before .  you couldn   t help meeting them in lancre  which was a very small kingdom  and even smaller when you took into consideration that granny weatherwax lived there too .   and granny weatherwax was here  right here and now  with you   lying across her shoulders like a scarf  behind the king and queen and just in front of a huge jolly voice that shouted     watcha  tiff .  how   s your belly off for spots .     which meant that a couple of feet below it  but hidden by reasons of size  was nanny ogg  rumoured by some to be cleverer than granny weatherwax  and clever enough at least not to let her find out .   tiffany bowed to them as was the custom .  she thought  they gather  do they .  she smiled at granny weatherwax and said     very pleased to see you here  mistress weatherwax  and a little surprised .      granny stared at her but nanny ogg said     it   s a long bumpy ride down from lancre  and so the two of us thought we   d give magrat and her king a nice ride down .      possibly tiffany was imagining it  but nanny ogg   s explanation sounded like something she had been working on for a little while .  it felt as if she were reciting a script .   but there was no more time to talk .  the arrival of the king had triggered something in the air  and for the first time tiffany saw pastor egg  in a black and white robe .  she adjusted her pointy hat and walked over to him .  he seemed quite glad of the company  which is to say that he gave her a grateful smile .      hah  a witch  i see .         yes  the pointy hat is a bit of a giveaway  isn   t it .     she said .      but not a black dress  i notice      .      tiffany heard the question mark as it went past .     when i am old  i shall wear midnight     she said .      entirely appropriate     said the pastor     but now you wear green  white and blue  the downland colours  i can   t help remarking .      tiffany was impressed .     so  you   re not interested in witchfinding  then .     she felt a bit silly for asking outright  but she was on edge .   pastor egg shook his head .     i can assure you  madam  that the church has not been seriously involved in that sort of thing for hundreds of years .  unfortunately some people have long memories .  indeed  it was only a matter of a few years ago that the famous pastor oats said in his renowned testament from the mountains that the women known as witches embody  in a caring and practical way  the very best ideals of brutha the prophet .  that   s good enough for me .  i hope it is good enough for you .      tiffany gave him her sweetest smile  which wasn   t all that sweet  however hard you tried  she   d never really got the hang of sweet .      it   s important to be clear about these things  don   t you think .      she sniffed  and noticed no odour other than a hint of shaving cream .  even so  she was going to have to be on her guard .   it was a good funeral too  from tiffany   s point of view  a good funeral was one where the main player was very old .  she had been to some     too many     where they were small and wrapped in a shroud .  coffins were barely known on the chalk  and indeed nearly anywhere else .  decent timber was too expensive to be left to rot underground .  a practical white woollen shroud did for most people  it was easy to make  not too expensive  and good for the wool industry .  the baron  however  went to his eternal rest inside a tomb of white marble which  him being a practical man  he had designed  bought and paid for twenty years ago .  there was a white shroud inside it  because marble can be a bit chilly to lie on .   and that was the end of the old baron  except that only tiffany knew where he really was .  he was walking with his father in the stubbles  where they burned the corn stalks and the weeds  a perfect late summer   s day  one never changing perfect moment held in time      she gasped .     the drawing .     even though she   d spoken under her breath  people around her turned to look .  she thought  how selfish of me .  and then thought  surely it will still be there .   as soon as the lid of the stone tomb had been slid into place with a sound that tiffany would always remember  she went and found brian  who was blowing his nose  when he looked up at her he was pink around the eyes .   she took him gently by the arm  trying not to sound urgent .     the room that the baron was living in  is it locked .      he looked shocked .     i should say so .  and the money is in the big safe in the office .  why d   you want to know .         there was something very valuable in there .  a leather folder .  did that get put in the big safe too .      the sergeant shook his head .     believe me  tiff  after the        he hesitated        bit of trouble  i did an inventory of everything in that room .  not a thing went out from there without me seeing it and putting it down in my notebook .  with my pencil     he added  for maximum accuracy .     nothing like a leather folder was taken out  i   m sure of it .         no .  because miss spruce had already taken it     tiffany said .     that wretched nurse .  i didn   t mind about the money  because i never expected the money .  maybe she thought it had deeds in it or something .      tiffany hurried back to the hall and looked around .  roland was the baron now  in every respect .  and it was in respect that people were clustering around him  saying things like     he was a very good man     and    he   d had a good innings     and    at least he didn   t suffer     and all the other things people say after a funeral when they don   t know what to say .   and now tiffany headed purposefully towards the baron  and stopped when a hand landed on her shoulder .  she followed the arm up to the face of nanny ogg  who had managed to obtain the biggest flagon of ale that tiffany had ever seen .  to be precise  she noticed it was a half full flagon of ale .      nice to see something like this done well     said nanny .     never knew the old boy  of course  but he sounds like a decent fellow .  nice to see you  tiff .  managing all right .      tiffany looked into those innocent smiling eyes  and past them to the much sterner face of granny weatherwax  and the brim of her hat .  tiffany bowed .   granny weatherwax cleared her throat with a sound like gravel .     we ain   t here on business  my girl  we just wanted to help the king make a good entrance .         we are not here about the cunning man neither     nanny ogg added cheerfully .  it sounded like a simple and silly giveaway  and tiffany heard a disapproving sniff from granny .  but  generally speaking  when nanny ogg came out with a silly  embarrassing comment by accident  it was because she had thought about it very carefully beforehand .  tiffany knew this  and nanny certainly knew that tiffany knew  and tiffany knew that too .  but it was often the kind of way that witches behaved  and it all worked perfectly if nobody picked up an axe .      i know this is my problem .  i will sort it out     she said .   this was on the face of it a really stupid thing to say .  the senior witches would be very useful to have at her side .  but how would that look .  this was a new steading  and she had to be proud .   you couldn   t say     i have done difficult and dangerous things before     because that was understood .  what did matter was what you did today .  it was a matter of pride .  it was a matter of style .   and it was also a matter of age .  in twenty years    time  perhaps  if she asked for help  people would think  well  even an experienced witch can run up against something really unusual .  and they would help as a matter of course .  but now  if she asked for help  well     people would help .  witches always helped other witches .  but everyone would think  was she really any good .  can   t she last the distance .  is she strong enough for the long haul .  no one would say anything  but everyone would think it .   all this was the thought of a second  and when she blinked  the witches were watching her .      self reliance is a witch   s best friend     said granny weatherwax  looking stern .   nanny ogg nodded in agreement  and added     you can always rely on self reliance  i   ve always said so .     she laughed at tiffany   s expression .     do you think you are the only one to have to deal with the cunning man  love .  granny here had to deal with him when she was your age .  she sent him back to where he came from in very short order  trust me on that .      knowing that it was useless  but attempting it anyway  tiffany turned to granny weatherwax and said     can you give me any tips  mistress weatherwax .      granny  who was already drifting purposefully towards the buffet lunch  stopped for a moment and turned and said     trust yourself .     she walked a few steps further and stood as if lost in thought and added     and don   t lose .      nanny ogg slapped tiffany on the back .     never met the bugger myself  but i hear he is pretty bad .  here  is the blushing bride having a hen night tonight .     the old lady winked and poured the remaining contents of the flagon down her throat .   tiffany tried to think quickly .  nanny ogg got on with everyone .  tiffany had only a vague idea of what a hen night was  but some of mrs proust   s stock gave her a few clues  and if nanny ogg knew about them too  it was a certainty that alcohol was involved .      i don   t think it   s appropriate to have a party like that on a night after a funeral  do you  nanny .  though i think letitia might enjoy a little talk     she added .      she   s your chum  isn   t she .  i would have thought you   d have had a little talk with her yourself .         i did .     tiffany protested .     but i don   t think she believed me .  and you   ve had at least three husbands  nanny .      nanny ogg stared at her for a moment and then said     that   s quite a lot of conversation  i suppose .  all right .  but what about the young man .  when   s his stag night going to be .         ah  i   ve heard of those .  it   s where his friends get him drunk  take him a long way away  tie him to a tree and then     i think a bucket of paint and a brush is involved sometimes  but usually they throw him in the pigsty .  why do you ask .         oh  the stag night is always much more interesting than the hen night     said nanny  a look of mischief in her eye .     has the lucky groom got any chums .         well  there are some nobby lads from other posh families  but the only people he really knows live here in the village .  we all grew up together  you see .  and none of them would dare throw the baron in a pigsty .         what about your young man over there .     nanny gestured towards preston  who was standing nearby .  he always seemed to be standing nearby .      preston .     said tiffany .     i don   t think he knows the baron very well .  and in any case       she stopped and thought  young man .  she turned and looked at nanny  who was standing with her hands behind her back and face turned towards the ceiling with the expression of an angel  although admittedly one who might have met a few demons in her time .  and that was nanny all over .  when it came to affairs of the heart     or indeed  of any other parts     you couldn   t fool nanny ogg .   but he   s not my young man  she insisted to herself .  he   s just a friend .  who is a boy .   preston stepped forward and removed his helmet in front of nanny .     i fear  madam  that it would be against the rules for me as a military man to lay a hand on my commanding officer     he said .     were it not for that  i would do so with alacrity .      nanny nodded appreciatively at the polysyllabic response  and gave tiffany a wink that made her blush to the soles of her boots .  nanny ogg   s grin was now so wide you could fit it onto a pumpkin .     oh dear  oh dear  oh dear     she said .     i can see this place needs a little fun .  thank goodness i   m here .      nanny ogg had a heart of gold  but if you were easily shocked then it was best to stick your fingers in your ears when she said anything .  yet there had to be common sense  didn   t there .     nanny  we   re at a funeral  .      but her tone of voice would never make nanny ogg swerve .     was he a good man .      tiffany hesitated only for a moment .     he grew into goodness .      nanny ogg noticed everything .     oh yes  your granny aching taught him his manners  i believe .  but he died a good man  then .  good .  will he be remembered with fondness .      tiffany tried to ignore the lump in her throat  and managed to say     oh yes  by everybody .         and you saw to it that he died well .  kept the pain away .         nanny  if i say it myself  he had a perfect death .  the only better death would have been not to die .         well done     said nanny .     did he have a favourite song  do you know .         oh yes .  it   s    the larks they sang melodious        said tiffany .      ah  i reckon that   s the one we call    pleasant and delightful    back home .  just follow me  will you  and we   ll soon get them in the right mood .      and with that nanny ogg grabbed a passing waiter by the shoulder  took a full flagon from his tray  jumped up onto a table  as lively as a girl  and shouted for silence in a voice as brisk as a sergeant major .     ladies and gentlemen .  to celebrate the good life and easeful passing of our late friend and baron  i have been asked to sing his favourite song .  do join in with me if you   ve got the breath .      tiffany listened  enthralled .  nanny ogg was a one woman masterclass  or rather mistressclass  in people .  she treated perfect strangers as if she had known them for years  and somehow they acted as if she really had .  dragged along  as it were  by an extremely good singing voice for one old woman with one tooth  perplexed people were raising their voices beyond a mumble by the second line  and by the end of the first verse were harmonizing like a choir  and she had them in her hand .  tiffany wept  and saw through the tears a little boy in his new tweed jacket that smelled of wee  walking with his father under different stars .   and then she saw the glisten of tears on the faces  including the faces of pastor egg and even the duchess .  the echoes were of loss and remembrance  and the hall itself breathed .   i should have learned this  she thought .  i wanted to learn fire  and pain  but i should have learned people .  i should have learned how not to sing like a turkey      the song had finished  and people were looking around sheepishly at one another  but nanny ogg   s boot was already making the table rock .     dance  dance  the shaking of the sheets .  dance  dance  when you hear the piper playing     she sang .   tiffany thought  is this the right song for a funeral .  and then she thought  of course it is .  it   s a wonderful tune and it tells us that one day all of us will die but     and this is the important thing     we are not dead yet .   and now nanny ogg had jumped off the table  grabbed a hold of pastor egg  and as she spun him round  she sang     be assured no preacher can keep death away from any man     and he had the grace to smile and dance with her .   people applauded     not something tiffany would ever have expected at a funeral .  she wished  oh how she wished  to be like nanny ogg who understood things and knew how to hammer silence into laughter .   and then  as the applause died away  a male voice sang     down in the valley  the valley so low  hang your head easy  hear the wind blow        and silence stood aside in the face of the unexpectedly silver voice of the sergeant .   nanny ogg drifted to where tiffany was standing .     well  it looks like i   ve warmed them up .  hear them clearing their throats .  i reckon the pastor will be singing by the end of the evening .  and i could do with another drink .  it   s thirsty work  singing .     there was a wink  then she said to tiffany     human being first  witch second  hard to remember  easy to do .      it was magic  magic had turned a hall full of people who mostly did not know very many of the other people there into human beings who knew they were among other human beings and  right now  that was all that needed to matter .  at which point preston tapped her on the shoulder .  he had a curious kind of worried smile on his face .      sorry  miss  but i   m on duty  worst luck  and i think you ought to know we have three more visitors .         can   t you just show them in .     said tiffany .      i would like to do that  miss  only they are stuck on the roof at the moment .  the sound made by three witches is a lot of swearing  miss .             if there had been swearing  the new arrivals had apparently run out of breath by the time tiffany located the right window and crawled out onto the lead roof of the castle .  there wasn   t very much to hold onto and it was pretty misty  but she carefully made her way out there on her hands and knees and headed towards the grumbling .      are there any witches up here .     she said .   and out of the gloom came the voice of somebody not even trying to keep their temper .     and what in the seven hells would you do if i said no  miss tiffany aching .         mrs proust .  what are you doing here .         holding onto a gargoyle .  get us down right now  my dear  because these are not my stones and mrs happenstance needs the privy .      tiffany crawled a little further  well aware of the sheer drop an inch away from her hand .     preston has gone to fetch a rope .  do you have a broomstick .         a sheep crashed into it     said mrs proust .   tiffany could just make her out now .     you crashed into a sheep in the air .         maybe it was a cow  or something .  what are those things that go snuffle snuffle  .         you ran into a flying hedgehog .         no  as it happened .  we were down low  looking for a bush for mrs happenstance .     there was a sigh in the gloom .     it   s because of her trouble  poor soul .  we   ve stopped at a lot of bushes on the way here  believe me .  and do you know what .  inside every single one of them is something that stings  bites  kicks  screams  howls  squelches  farts enormously  goes all spiky  tries to knock you over or does an enormous pile of poo .  haven   t you people up here heard about porcelain .      tiffany was taken aback .     well  yes  but not in fields .         they would be all the better for it     said mrs proust .     i   ve ruined a decent pair of boots  i have .      there was a clinking noise in the mist  and tiffany was relieved to hear preston say     i have forced open the old trapdoor  ladies  if you would be kind enough to crawl this way .      the trapdoor opened into a bedroom  clearly one that had been slept in last night by a woman .  tiffany bit her lip .     i think this is where the duchess is staying .  please don   t touch anything  she   s bad enough as it is .         duchess .  sounds posh     said mrs proust .     what kind of a duchess  may i ask .      tiffany said     the duchess of keepsake .  you saw her when we had that bit of difficulty in the city .  you know .  at the king   s head .  they   ve got a huge property about thirty miles away .         that   s nice     said mrs proust in a way that suggested that it probably wasn   t going to be very nice but would be very interesting  and probably embarrassing to somebody who wasn   t mrs proust .     i remember her  and i remember thinking when i got back from all that  where have i seen you before  my lady .  do you know anything about her  my dear .         well  her daughter told me that a terrible fire took away her property and her whole family before she married the duke .      mrs proust brightened up  although it was the brightness on the edge of a knife .     oh  really .     she said  her voice all treacle .     just fancy that .  i look forward to meeting the lady again and offering my condolences         tiffany decided that this was a puzzle she had no time to unravel  but there were other things to think about .     er     .     she began  looking at the very tall lady somehow trying to hide behind mrs proust  who turned round and said     oh dear me  where are my manners .  i know  i never had any to start with .  tiffany aching  this is miss cambric  better known as long tall short fat sally .  miss cambric is being trained by old mrs happenstance  who was the one you briefly saw hurrying down the stairs with one aim in mind .  sally suffers terribly from tides  poor thing .  i had to bring them both because sally had the only working broomstick i could find and she wouldn   t leave mrs happenstance behind .  it was the devil  keeping the broomstick trim .  don   t worry  she   ll be back to about five foot six in a few hours .  of course  she   s a martyr to ceilings .  and sally  you   d better get after mrs happenstance right now .      she waved a hand and the younger witch scurried off  looking nervous .  when mrs proust gave orders  they tended to be obeyed .  she turned back to tiffany .     the thing that is after you has got a body now  young lady .  he has stolen the body of a murderer locked up in the tanty .  you know what .  before the bloke got out of the building he killed his canary .  they never kill their canary .  it   s what you don   t do .  you might beat another prisoner over the head with an iron bar in a riot  but you never kill a canary .  that would be evil .      it was a strange way to introduce the subject  but mrs proust didn   t do small talk or  for that matter  reassurance .      i thought something like this would happen     said tiffany .     i knew it would .  what does he look like .         we lost him a couple of times     said mrs proust .     calls of nature  and so on .  he might have broken into a house for better clothes  i couldn   t say .  he won   t care about the body .  he   ll run it until he finds another one or it falls to pieces .  we   ll keep an eye out for him .  and this is your steading .      tiffany sighed     yes .  and now he is chasing me like a wolf after a lamb .         then if you care about people  you must get rid of him quick     said mrs proust .     if a wolf gets hungry enough it will eat anything .  and now  where are your manners  miss aching .  we   re cold and wet  and by the sound of it there is food and drink downstairs  am i right .         oh  i   m sorry  and you   ve come all this way to warn me     said tiffany .   mrs proust waved a hand as if it wasn   t important .     i   m sure long tall short fat sally and mrs happenstance would like some refreshment after our long ride  but i   m just tired     she said .  and then  to tiffany   s horror  she flung herself backwards and landed on the duchess   s bed with only her boots sticking off the end  dripping water .     this duchess     she said     has she been giving you any more grief at all .         well  yes  i   m afraid so     said tiffany .     she doesn   t seem to have any respect for anybody lower than a king  and even then i suspect that   s only a maybe .  she bullies her daughter too     she added  and as an afterthought pointed out     one of your customers  in fact .     and then she told mrs proust everything about letitia and the duchess because mrs proust was the kind of woman you told everything to  and as the story unfolded  mrs proust   s grin grew wider  and tiffany needed no witch skill to suspect that the duchess was going to be in some trouble .      i thought so .  i never forget a face .  have you ever heard of the music hall  my dear .  oh  no .  you wouldn   t have  not out here .  it   s all about comedians and singers and talking dog acts     and  of course  dancing girls .  i think you are getting the picture here  are you not .  not such a bad job for a girl who could shake a handsome leg  especially since after the show all the posh gentlemen would be waiting outside the stage door to take them out for a lovely dinner and so on .     the witch took off her pointy hat and dropped it on the floor beside the bed .     can   t abide broomsticks     she said .     they give me calluses in places where nobody should have calluses .      tiffany was at a loss .  she couldn   t demand that mrs proust get off the bed  it wasn   t her bed .  it wasn   t her castle .  she smiled .  in fact it really wasn   t her problem .  how nice to find a problem that wasn   t yours .      mrs proust     she said     could i persuade you to come downstairs .  there are some other witches down here who i would really like you to meet .     preferably when i   m not in the room  she thought to herself  but i doubt if that would be possible .      hedge witches .     mrs proust sniffed .     although there   s nothing actually wrong with hedge magic     she went on .     i met one once who could run her hands over a privet hedge and three months later it had grown into the shape of two peacocks and an offensively cute little dog holding a privet bone in its mouth  and all this  mark you  without a pair of shears being anywhere near it .         why did she want to do that .     said tiffany  astounded .      i doubt very much that she actually wanted to do it  but someone asked her to do it  and paid good money too and  strictly speaking  topiary is not actually illegal  although i rather suspect that one or two folk are going to be the first up against the hedge when the revolution comes .  hedge witches     that   s what we call country witches in the city .         oh  really     said tiffany innocently .     well  i don   t know what we call city witches in the country  but i am sure that mistress weatherwax will tell you .     she knew she should have felt guilty about this  but it had been a long day  after a long week  and a witch has got to have some fun in her life .   the way downstairs took them past letitia   s room .  tiffany heard voices  and a laugh .  it was nanny ogg   s laugh .  you couldn   t mistake that laugh  it was the kind of laugh that slapped you on the back .  then letitia   s voice said     does that really work .     and nanny said something under her breath that tiffany couldn   t quite hear  but whatever it was  it made letitia almost choke with giggling .  tiffany smiled .  the blushing bride was being instructed by somebody who had probably never blushed in her life  and it seemed quite a happy arrangement .  at least she was not bursting into tears every five minutes .   tiffany led mrs proust down into the hall .  it was amazing to see that all people needed to make them happy was food and drink and other people .  even with nanny ogg no longer chivvying them along  they were filling the place with  well  people being people .  and  standing where she could see very nearly everybody  granny weatherwax .  she was talking to pastor egg .   tiffany drifted up to her carefully  judging from the priest   s face that he wouldn   t mind at all if she intruded .  granny weatherwax could be very forthright on the subject of religion .  she saw him relax as she said     mistress weatherwax  may i introduce to you mrs proust .  from ankh morpork  where she runs a remarkable emporium .     swallowing  tiffany turned to mrs proust and said    may i present to you granny weatherwax .      she stepped back as the two elderly witches looked at one another and then held her breath .  the hall fell silent and neither of them blinked .  and then     surely not     granny weatherwax winked and mrs proust smiled .      very pleased to make your acquaintance     said granny .      how very nice to see you     said mrs proust .   they exchanged a further glance and turned to tiffany aching  who suddenly understood that old  clever witches had been older and cleverer for much longer than her .   granny weatherwax almost laughed when mrs proust said     we don   t need to know one another   s names to recognize one another  but can i suggest  young lady  that you start breathing again .      granny weatherwax lightly and primly took mrs proust   s arm and turned to where nanny ogg was coming down the stairs  followed by letitia  who was blushing in places where people don   t often blush  and said     do come with me  my dear .  you must meet my friend  mrs ogg  who buys quite a lot of your merchandise .      tiffany walked away .  for a brief moment in time  there was nothing for her to do .  she looked down the length of the hall  where people were still gathering in little groups  and saw the duchess by herself .  why did she do it .  why did she walk over to the woman .  maybe  she thought  if you know you are going to be facing a horrible monster  it is as well to get in a little practice .  but to her absolute amazement  the duchess was crying .      can i help in any way .     said tiffany .   she was the immediate subject of a glare  but the tears were still falling .     she   s all i   ve got     said the duchess  looking over at letitia  who was still trailing nanny ogg .     i   m sure roland will be a very considerate husband .  i hope she will think that i have given her a good grounding to get her safely through the world .         i think you   ve definitely taught her many things     said tiffany .   but the duchess was now staring at the witches  and without looking at tiffany she said     i know we   ve had our differences  young lady  but i wonder if you can tell me who that lady is up there  one of your sister witches  talking to the remarkably tall one .      tiffany glanced around for a moment .     oh  that   s mrs proust .  she   s from ankh morpork  you know .  is she an old friend of yours .  she was asking about you  only a little while ago .      the duchess smiled  but it was a strange little smile .  if smiles had a colour  it would have been green .     oh     she said .     that was  er        she paused  swaying a little        very kind of her .     she coughed .     i am so glad that you and my daughter appear to be close chums and i would like to tender you my apologies for any hastiness on my part in recent days .  i would also very much like to tender you and the hard working staff here my apologies for what may have appeared to be high handed behaviour  and i trust you will accept that these stemmed from a mother   s determination to do the very best for her child .     she spoke very carefully  the words coming out like children   s coloured building blocks  and between the blocks     like mortar     were the unspoken words  please  please  don   t tell people i was a dancer in a music hall .  please .      well  of course  we   re all on edge     said tiffany .     least said  soonest mended  as they say .         regrettably     said the duchess     i don   t think i said least .     tiffany noticed that there was a large wine glass in her hand  and it was almost empty .  the duchess watched tiffany for a while and then continued     a wedding almost straight after a funeral  is that right .         some people think that it   s bad luck to move a wedding once it   s planned     said tiffany .      do you believe in luck .     said the duchess .      i believe in not having to believe in luck     said tiffany .     but  your grace  i can tell you in truth that at such times the universe gets a little closer to us .  they are strange times  times of beginnings and endings .  dangerous and powerful .  and we feel it even if we don   t know what it is .  these times are not necessarily good  and not necessarily bad .  in fact  what they are depends on what we are .      the duchess looked down at the empty glass in her hand .     for some reason  i think i should be taking a nap .     she turned to head towards the stairs  nearly missing the first step .   there was a burst of laughter from the other end of the hall .  tiffany followed the duchess  but stopped to tap letitia on the shoulder .      if i was you  i   d go and talk to your mum before she goes upstairs .  i think she   d like to talk to you now .     she bent down and whispered in her ear     but don   t tell her too much about what nanny ogg said .      letitia looked about to object  saw tiffany   s expression  thought better of it and intercepted her mother .   and now  suddenly  granny weatherwax was at tiffany   s side .  after a while  as if addressing the air  granny said     you have a good steading here .  nice people .  and i   ll tell you one thing .  he is near .      tiffany noticed that the other witches     even long tall short fat sally     were now lining up just behind granny weatherwax .  she was the focus of their stares  and when a lot of witches are staring at you  you can feel it like the sun .     is there something you want to say .     said tiffany .     there is  isn   t there .      it wasn   t often  and in fact now tiffany came to think of it  it wasn   t ever that she had seen granny weatherwax look worried .      you are certain that you can best the cunning man  are you not .  i see you don   t wear midnight yet .         when i am old  i shall wear midnight     said tiffany .     it   s a matter of choice .  and granny  i know why you are here .  it is to kill me if i fail  isn   t it .         blast it     granny weatherwax said .     you are a witch  a good witch .  but some of us think that it might be best if we insisted on helping you .         no     said tiffany .     my steading .  my mess .  my problem .         no matter what .     said granny .      definitely .         well  i commend you for your adherence to your position and wish you     no  not luck  but certainty .     there was a susurration among the witches and granny snapped sharply     she has made her decision and that  ladies  is it .         no contest     said nanny ogg with a grin .     i very nearly pity him .  kick him in the    kick him anywhere you can  tiff .         it   s your ground     said mrs proust .     how can a witch do anything but succeed on her own home ground .      granny weatherwax nodded .     if you have let pride get the better of you  then you have already lost  but if you grab pride by the scruff of the neck and ride it like a stallion  then you may have already won .  and now i think it   s time for you to prepare  miss tiffany aching .  do you have a plan for the morning .      tiffany looked into the piercing blue eyes .     yes .  not to lose .         that   s a good plan .      mrs proust shook tiffany with a hand that was prickly with warts and said     by happy accident  my girl  i think i should go and slay a monster myself            you had been a sad little white kitten when tiffany had given her to the old witch .  now she was a queen  far more snobbish than the duchess .  she must have recognized tiffany because she graciously condescended to blink at her and then look away as if bored .  there were never any mice in granny   s cottage these days  you just stared at them until they realized how worthless they were and slunk away .       chapter      burning the king    tiffany knew she wouldn   t go to sleep that night  and didn   t try .  people sat together in little groups  talking  and there was still food and drink on the tables .  possibly because of the drink  the people didn   t actually notice how fast the food and drink were disappearing  but tiffany was certain she could hear faint noises in the beams high above .  of course  witches were proverbially good at stuffing food into their pockets for later  but probably the feegles outdid them by sheer numbers .   tiffany moved aimlessly from group to group  and when the duchess finally left to go upstairs  she didn   t follow her .  she was quite emphatic to herself that she wasn   t following .  she just happened to be going in the same direction .  and  when she darted across the stone floor to reach the door of the duchess   s room  just after it closed behind the woman  she wasn   t doing this in order to eavesdrop .  certainly not .   she was just in time to hear the beginning of an angry scream  and then mrs proust   s voice     why  deirdre parsley .  long time  no  sequins .  can you still high kick a man   s top hat off his head .     and then there was silence .  and tiffany left hurriedly  because the door was very thick and someone would be bound to notice if she stood there any longer with her ear pressed to it .   so she went back down in time to talk to long tall short fat sally and mrs happenstance  who she now realized was blind  which was unfortunate but not     for a witch     too much of a tragedy .  they always had a few extra senses to spare .   and then she went down into the crypt .   there were flowers all around the old baron   s tomb  but not on it because the marble lid was so beautifully made that it would be a shame even to cover it with roses .  on the stone  stonemasons had carved the baron himself  in armour and holding his sword  it was so perfectly done that it looked as if he might  at any moment  get up and walk away .  at the four corners of the slab  candles burned .   tiffany walked to and fro past other dead barons in stone .  here and there was a wife  carved with her hands peacefully folded  it was     strange .  there were no gravestones on the chalk .  stone was too precious .  there were burying grounds  and in the castle somewhere was an ancient book of faded maps that showed where people had been put .  the only common person to have a memorial  who was in most respects an extremely uncommon person  was granny aching  the cast iron wheels and pot bellied stove that were all that remained of her shepherding hut would certainly survive for another hundred years .  it had been good metal  and the endlessly nibbling sheep kept the ground around it as smooth as a tabletop  and besides  the grease from the sheep   s fleeces as they rubbed up against the wheels were as good as oil for keeping the metal as fine as the day it was cast .   in the old days  before a knight became a knight  he would spend a night in his hall with his weapons  praying to whichever gods were listening to give him strength and good wisdom .   she was sure she heard those words spoken  at least in her head if not in her ears .  she turned and looked at the sleeping knights  and wondered if mrs proust was right  and stone had a memory .   and what are my weapons .  she thought .  and the answer came to her instantly  pride .  oh  you hear them say it   s a sin  you hear them say it goes before a fall .  and that can   t be true .  the blacksmith prides himself on a good weld  the carter is proud that his horses are well turned out  gleaming like fresh chestnuts in the sunshine  the shepherd prides himself on keeping the wolf from the flock  the cook prides herself on her cakes .  we pride ourselves on making a good history of our lives  a good story to be told .   and i also have fear     the fear that i will let others down     and because i fear  i will overcome that fear .  i will not disgrace those who have trained me .   and i have trust  even though i am not sure what it is i am trusting .      pride  fear and trust     she said aloud .  and in front of her the four candles streamed fire  as if driven by the wind  and for a moment she was certain  in the rush of light  that the figure of an old witch was melting into the dark stone .     oh  yes     said tiffany .     and i have fire .      and then  not knowing exactly why  she said     when i am old  i shall wear midnight .  but not today .      tiffany held up her lantern and the shadows moved  but one  which looked very much like an old woman in black  faded completely .  and i know why the hare leaps into the fire  and tomorrow     no  today  i am leaping into it too .  she smiled .   when tiffany got back in the hall  the witches were all watching her from the stairs .  tiffany had wondered how granny and mrs proust would get on  given that both of them were as proud as a cat full of sixpences .  but they seemed to be getting on well enough in a talking   about the weather  the manners of young people these days and the scandalous price of cheese sort of way .  but nanny ogg looked unusually worried .  seeing nanny ogg looking worried was worrying .  it was past midnight     technically speaking  the witching hour .  in real life every hour was a witching hour  but nevertheless the way the two hands on the clock stood straight up was slightly eerie .      i hear that the lads came back from their stag night fun     said nanny     but it seems to me they   ve forgotten where they left the groom .  i don   t think he is going to go anywhere  though .  they are pretty certain they took his trousers down and tied him to something .     she coughed .     that   s generally the usual procedure .  technically the best man is supposed to remember where  but they found him and he can   t remember his own name .      the clock in the hall struck midnight  it was never on time .  each strike may as well have hit tiffany   s backbone .   and there  marching towards her  was preston .  and it seemed to tiffany that for quite some time  wherever she had looked  there was preston  looking smart and clean and     somehow     hopeful .      look  preston     she said .     i haven   t got time to explain things  and i   m not certain you would believe them     no  you probably would believe them if i told you them .  i have to go out there to kill that monster before it kills me .         then i will protect you     said preston .     anyway  my commander in chief might be out there somewhere in the pigsty with a sow sniffing his unmentionables .  and i represent the temporal power here .         you .     tiffany snapped .   preston stuck out his chest  although it didn   t go very far .     as a matter of fact  yes  the lads made me officer of the watch so that they could all have a drink  and right now the sergeant is in the kitchen  throwing up in the sink .  he thought he could outdrink mrs ogg .      he saluted .     i   m going out there with you  miss .  and you can   t stop me .  no offence meant  of course .  however by virtue of the power invested in me by the sergeant  in between him throwing up into the sink  i would like to commandeer you and your broomstick to assist me in my search  if that is all right with you .      it was a dreadful question to ask a witch .  on the other hand  it was being asked by preston .     all right then     she said     but do try not to scratch it .  and there is one thing that i have to do first .  do excuse me .     she walked a little way over to the open door of the hall and leaned against the cold stonework .     i know there are feegles listening to me     she said .      oh aye     said a voice about one inch from her ear .      well  i don   t want you to help me tonight .  this is a hag thing  you understand .         oh aye  we seen the big posse of hags .  it   s a big hag night the noo .         i must       tiffany began .  and then an idea struck her .     i have to fight the man with no eyes .  and they are here to see how good a fighter i am .  and so i mustn   t cheat by using feegles .  that   s an important hag rule .  of course  i respect the fact that cheating is an honourable feegle tradition  but hags don   t cheat     she went on  aware that this was a huge lie .     if you help me  they will know  and all the hags will put me to scorn .      and tiffany thought  and if i lose  it will be feegles versus hags  and that   s a battle that the world will remember .  no pressure  eh .   aloud  she said     you understand  right .  this once  just this once  you will do as i tell you and not help me .         aye  we understand ye .  but ye ken that jeannie says we must look out for ye at all times  because ye are our hag o    the hills     said rob .      i   m sorry to say that the kelda is not here     said tiffany     but i am and i have to tell you that if you help me this once i will no longer be your hag o    the hills .  i   m under a geas  ye ken .  it   s a hag geas  and that   s a big geas indeed .     she heard a group groan  and added     i mean it .  the chief hag is granny weatherwax and you know her .     there was another groan .     there you are then     said tiffany .     this time  please  let me do things my way .  is that understood .      there was a pause  and then the voice of rob anybody said     och aye .         very well     said tiffany  and took a deep breath and went to find her broomstick .   taking preston with her didn   t seem such a good idea as they rose above the roofs of the castle .      why didn   t you tell me that you were scared of flying .     she said .      that   s hardly fair     said preston .     this is the first time i   ve ever flown .      when they were at a decent height  tiffany looked at the weather .  there were clouds above the mountains  and the occasional flash of summer lightning .  she could hear the rumble of thunder in the distance .  you were never far from a thunderstorm in the mountains .  the mist had lifted  and the moon was up  it was a perfect night .  and there was a breeze .  she had hoped for this .  and preston had his arms around her waist  she wasn   t sure whether she had hoped for that or not .   they were well down onto the plains at the foot of the chalk now  and even by moonlight tiffany could see dark rectangles where earlier fields had been cleared .  the men were always meticulous about not letting the fires get out of hand  nobody wanted wildfire     there was no telling what that would burn .  the field they reached was the very last one .  they always called it the king .  usually when the king was burned  half the village was waiting to catch any rabbits that fled the flames .  that should have happened today  but everybody had been     otherwise occupied .   the chicken houses and the pigsty were in a field just above it at the top of a bank  and it was said that the king grew such bountiful crops because the men found it much easier to cart the mulch onto the king rather than take it all to the lower fields .   they landed by the pigsties  to the usual ferocious screaming of piglets  who believed that no matter what is actually happening  the world is trying to saw them in half .   she sniffed .  the air smelled of pig  she was sure  absolutely sure  that she would nevertheless smell the ghost if and when he was here .  mucky though they were  the pigs nevertheless had a natural smell  the smell of the ghost  on the other hand  would make a pig smell like violets by comparison .  she shuddered .  the wind was getting up .      are you sure you can kill it .     whispered preston .      i think i can make it kill itself .  and preston  i absolutely forbid you to help me .         i   m sorry     said preston .     temporal power  you understand .  you can   t give me orders  miss aching  if that   s all right by you .         you mean your sense of duty and your obedience to your commander means that you must help me .     she said .      well  yes  miss     said preston     and a few other considerations .         then i really need you  preston  i really do .  i think i could do this myself  but it will make it so much easier if you help me .  what i want you to do is        she was almost certain that the ghost would not be able to over hear  but she lowered her voice anyway  and preston absorbed her words without blinking and simply said     that sounds pretty straightforward  miss .  you can rely on the temporal power .         yuck .  how did i end up here .      something grey and sticky and smelling very much of pig and beer tried to pull itself over the pigsty wall .  tiffany knew it was roland  but only because it was highly improbable that two bridegrooms had been thrown into the pigsty tonight .  and he rose like something nasty from the swamp  dripping     well  just dripping  there was hardly any necessity to go into details .  bits of him splashed off .   he hiccupped .     there appears to be an enormous pig in my bedroom  and it would seem that i have mislaid my trousers     he said  his voice baffled by alcohol .  the young baron peered around  understanding not so much dawning as bursting .     i don   t think this is my bedroom  is it .     he said  and slowly slipped back into the sty .   she smelled the ghost .  over and above the mix of smells coming from the pigsty it stood out like a fox among chickens .  and now the ghost spoke  in a voice of horror and decay .  i can feel you here  witch  and others too .  i do not care about them  but this new body  while not very robust  has     a permanent agenda of its own .  i am strong .  i am coming .  you cannot save everybody .  i doubt if your fiendish flying stick can carry four people .  who will you leave behind .  why not leave them all .  why not leave the tiresome rival  the boy who spurned you  and the persistent young man .  oh  i know how you think  witch .   but i don   t think that way  tiffany thought to herself .  oh  i might have liked to see roland in the pigsty  but people aren   t just people  they are people surrounded by circumstances .   but you aren   t .  you   re not even people any more .   beside her  with a horrible sucking noise  preston pulled roland out of the pigsty  against the protest of the sow .  how lucky for both of them that they couldn   t hear the voice .   she paused .  four people .  the tiresome rival .  but there was only herself  roland and preston  wasn   t there .   she looked towards the far end of the field  in the moon shadow of the castle .  a white figure was running towards them at speed .   it had to be letitia .  nobody around here wore so much billowing white all the time .  tiffany   s mind spun with the algebra of tactics .      preston  off you go .  take the broomstick .      preston nodded and then saluted  with a grin .     at your service  miss .      letitia arrived in a flurry and expensive white slippers .  she stopped dead when she saw roland  who was sober enough to try to  cover  with his hands  what tiffany knew she would always now think of as his passionate parts .  this simply made a squelching noise  since he was thickly encrusted in pig muck .      one of his chums told me they threw him in the pigsty for a laugh .     letitia said indignantly .     and they call themselves his friends .         i think they think that   s what friends are for     said tiffany absentmindedly .  to herself she thought  is this going to work .  have i overlooked something .  have i understood what i should do .  who do i think i   m talking to .  i suppose i   m looking for a sign  just a sign .   there was a rustling noise .  she looked down .  a hare looked up at her and then  without panicking  lost herself in the stubbles .      i   ll take that as a yes  then     said tiffany  and felt panicked herself .  after all  was that an omen  or was it just a hare who was old enough not to run instantly when she saw people .  and it wasn   t good manners  she was sure  to ask for a second sign to tell you if the first sign wasn   t just a coincidence  was it .   at this point  this very point  roland started to sing  possibly because of drink  but also perhaps because letitia was industriously wiping him down while keeping her eyes closed so that  as an unmarried woman  she wouldn   t see anything unseemly or surprising .  and the song that roland sang went     tis pleasant and delightful on the bright summer   s morn  to see the fields and the meadows all covered in corn  and the small birds were singing on every green spray  and the larks they sang melodious  at the dawning of the day        he paused .     my father used to sing that quite a lot when we walked in these fields        he said .  he was at that stage when drunken men started to cry  and the tears left little trails of pink behind as the muck was washed from his cheeks .   but tiffany thought  thank you .  an omen was an omen .  you picked the ones that worked .  and this was the big field  the field where they burned the last of the stubbles .  and the hare runs into the fire .  oh  yes  the omens .  they were always so important .      listen to me  both of you .  i am not going to be argued with by you  because you  roland  are rascally drunk and you  letitia  are a witch        letitia beamed at that point        who is junior to me  and therefore both of you will do what i tell you .  and that way  all of us may get back to the castle alive .      they both stopped and listened  roland swaying gently .      when i shout     tiffany continued     i want you to each grab one of my hands and run .  turn if i turn  stop if i stop  although i doubt very much that i shall want to stop .  above all  don   t be afraid  and trust me .  i   m almost sure i know what i   m doing .     tiffany realized that this wasn   t the best assurance  but they didn   t seem to notice .  she added     and when i say leap  leap as if a devil is behind you  because it will be .      the stink was suddenly unbearable .  the sheer hatred in it seemed to beat on tiffany   s brain .  by the pricking of my thumbs  something wicked this way comes  she thought as she stared into the night time gloom .  by the stinking of my nose  something evil this way goes  she added  to stop herself gibbering as she scanned the distant hedge for movement .   and there was a figure .   there  heavy set  walking towards them down the length of the field .  it moved slowly  but was gathering speed .  there was an awkwardness about it .     when he takes over a body  the owner of the body becomes a part of him too .  no escape  no release .     that   s what eskarina had told her .  nothing good  nothing capable of redemption  could have thoughts that stank like that .  she gripped the hands of the arguing couple and dragged them into a run .  the     creature was between them and the castle .  and was going more slowly than she   d expected .  she risked another look and saw the glint of metal in its hands .  knives .      come on .         these aren   t very good shoes for running in     letitia pointed out .      my head aches     roland supplied as tiffany towed them towards the bottom of the field  ignoring all complaints as dry corn stalks snatched at them  caught hair  scratched legs and stung feet .  they were barely going at a jog .  the creature was following them doggedly .  as soon as they turned to run up towards the castle and safety  it would gain on them      but the creature was having difficulties as well  and tiffany wondered how far you could push a body if you didn   t feel its pain  couldn   t feel the agony of the lungs  the pounding of the heart  the cracking of the bones  the dreadful ache that pushed you to the last gasp and beyond .  mrs proust had whispered to her  eventually  the things that the man macintosh had done  as if saying the words aloud would pollute the air .  against that  how did you rank the crushing of the little songbird .  and yet somehow that lodged in the mind as a crime beyond mercy .   there will be no mercy for a song now silenced .  no redemption for killing hope in the darkness .  i know you .   you are what whispered in petty   s ear before he beat up his daughter .  you are the first blast of the rough music .   you look over the shoulder at the man as he picks up the first stone  and although i think you are part of us all and we will never be rid of you  we can certainly make your life hell .   no mercy .  no redemption .   glancing back  she saw its face looming bigger now and redoubled her efforts to drag the tired and reluctant couple over the rough ground .  she managed a breath to say     look at him .  look at it .  do you want him to catch us .     she heard a brief scream from letitia and a groan of sudden sobriety from her husband to be .  the eyes of the luckless macintosh were bloodshot and wide open  the lips stuck in a frenzied grin .  it tried to take advantage of the sudden narrowed gap but the other two had found fresh strength in their fear and they were almost pulling tiffany along .   and now there was a clear run up the field .  it all depended on preston .  amazingly  tiffany felt confident .  he is trustworthy  she thought  but there was a horrible gurgle behind them .  the ghost was driving its host harder  and she could imagine the swish of a long knife .  timing had to be everything .  preston was trustworthy .  he had understood  hadn   t he .  of course he had .  she could trust preston .   later on  what she remembered most was the silence  broken only by the crackling of the stalks and the heavy breathing of letitia and roland and the horrible wheezing of their pursuer .  in her head the silence was broken by the voice of the cunning man .   you are setting a trap .  filth .  do you think i can be so easily caught again .  little girls who play with fire will get burned  and you will burn  i promise you  oh you will burn .  where then will be the pride of witches .  vessels of iniquity .  handmaidens of uncleanliness .  defilers of all that is holy .   tiffany kept her eyes fixed on the end of the field as tears streamed out .  she couldn   t help it .  it was impossible to keep the vileness out  it drizzled in like poison  seeping into her ears and flowing under her skin .   another swish in the air behind them made all three runners find redoubled strength  but she knew it couldn   t go on .  was that preston she saw in the gloom ahead .  then who was the dark figure beside him  looking like an old witch in a pointy hat .  even as she stared at it  it faded away .   but suddenly fire burst up and tiffany could hear the crackling as it spread like a sunrise across the field towards them  sparks filling the sky with extra stars .  and the wind blew hard and she heard the stinking voice again  you will burn .  you will burn .   and the wind gusted and the flames blew up  and now a wall of fire was racing through the stubbles as fast as the wind itself .  tiffany looked down and the hare was back  running along beside them without any apparent effort  she looked at tiffany  flicked up her legs and ran  ran directly towards the fire now  seriously ran .      run .     tiffany commanded .     the fire will not burn you if you do what i say .  run fast .  run fast .  roland  run to save letitia .  letitia  run to save roland .      the fire was almost on them .  i need the strength  she thought .  i need the power .  and she remembered nanny ogg saying     the world changes .  the world flows .  there   s power there  my girl .      weddings and funerals are a time of power     yes  weddings .  tiffany grasped their two hands even tighter .  and here it came .  a crackling  roaring wall of flame         leap .      and as they leaped  she screamed     leap  knave .  jump  whore .     she felt them lift as the fire reached them .   time hesitated .  a rabbit sped past beneath them  fleeing in terror from the flames .  he will flee  she thought .  he will run from the fire  but the fire will run to him .  and the fire runs much faster than a dying body .   tiffany floated in a ball of yellow flame .  the hare drifted past her  a creature happy in her element .  we are not as fast as you  she thought .  we will get singed .  she looked right and left at the bride and groom  who were staring ahead as if hypnotised  and pulled them towards her .  she understood .  i am going to marry you  roland .  i said i would .   she would make something beautiful out of this fire .      back to the hells you came from  you cunning man     she yelled above the flames .     leap  knave .  jump  whore .     she screamed again .      be married now for ever more .      and this is a wedding  she said to herself .  a fresh start .  and for a few seconds in the world  this is a place of power .  oh yes  a place of power .   they landed  rolling  behind the wall of fire .  tiffany was ready  stamping out embers and kicking the small flames that remained .   preston was suddenly there too  picking up letitia and carrying her out of the ash .  tiffany put an arm round roland  who had had a soft landing  possibly on his head  part of tiffany thought   and followed him .      looks like very minor burns and some frizzled hair     said preston     and as for your old boyfriend  i think his mud is now baked on .  how did you manage it .      tiffany took a deep breath .     the hare jumps through the flames so fast that she barely feels them     she said     and when she lands  she lands on hot ash mostly .  a grass fire burns out quickly under a strong wind .      there was a scream from behind them  and she imagined a lumbering figure trying to outrun the wind driven flames bearing down on it  and failing .  she felt the pain of a creature that had twisted through the world for hundreds of years .      the three of you  stay right here .  do not follow me .  preston  look after them .      tiffany walked across the cooling ash .  i have to see  she thought .  i have to witness .  i have to know what it is that i have done .   the dead man   s clothes were smouldering .  there was no pulse .  he did terrible things to people  she thought  things that made even the prison warders sick .  but what was done to him first .  was he just a much worse version of mr petty .  could he ever have been good .  how do you change the past .  where does evil begin .   she felt the words slide into her mind like a worm  murderer  filth  killer .  and she felt she should apologize to her ears for what they had to hear .  but the voice of the ghost was weak and thin and querulous  sliding backwards into history .   you can   t reach me  she thought .  you are used up .  you are too weak now .  how hard was it  forcing a man to run himself to death .  you can   t get in .  i can feel you trying .  she reached down into the ash and picked up a lump of flint  still warm from the fire   the soil was full of it  the sharpest of stones .  born in the chalk  and so in a way was tiffany .  its smoothness was the touch of a friend .      you never learn  do you .     she said .     you don   t understand that other people think too .  of course you wouldn   t run into the fire  but in your arrogance you never realized that the fire would run to you .      your power is only rumour and lies  she thought .  you bore your way into people when they are uncertain and weak and worried and frightened  and they think their enemy is other people when their enemy is  and always will be  you     the master of lies .  outside  you are fearsome  inside  you are nothing but weakness .   inside  i am flint .   she felt the heat of the whole field  steadied herself and gripped the stone .  how dare you come here  you worm .  how dare you trespass on what is mine .  she felt the flint get hotter in her hand and then melt and flow between her fingers and drip onto the soil as she concentrated .  she had never tried this before and she took a deep breath of air that somehow the flames had cleansed .   and if you come back  cunning man  there will be another witch like me .  there will always be another witch like me  because there are always going to be things like you  because we make space for them .  but right now  on this bleeding piece of earth  i am the witch and you are nothing .  by the blinking of my eyes  something wicked this way dies .   a hiss in her mind faded away and left her alone among her thoughts .      no mercy     she said aloud     no redemption .  you forced a man to kill his harmless songbird  and somehow i think that was the greatest crime of them all .      by the time she had walked back up the field  she had managed to become  once again  the tiffany aching who knew how to make cheese and deal with everyday chores and didn   t squeeze molten rock between her fingers .   the happy but slightly singed couple were beginning to take some notice of things .  letitia sat up .     i feel cooked     she said .     what   s that smell .         sorry  it   s you     said tiffany     and i   m afraid that wonderful lace nightshirt might just about be usable to clean windows from now on .  i   m afraid we didn   t leap as fast as the hare .      letitia looked around .     is roland     is he all right .         right as rain     said preston cheerily .     the wet pig muck really helped .     letitia paused for a moment .     and that     thing .         gone     said tiffany .      are you sure roland is all right .     letitia insisted .   preston grinned .     absolutely tickety boo  miss .  nothing important has been burned away  although it might be a little painful when we take the crusts off .  he   s somewhat baked on  if you get my meaning .     letitia nodded and then turned  slowly  to tiffany .     what was that you said when we were jumping .      tiffany took a deep breath .     i married you .         you  that is to say you  married  which is to say  wedded     us .     said letitia .      yes     said tiffany .     that is to say  certainly .  jumping over the fire together is a very ancient form of marriage .  doesn   t need any priests either  which is a great saving on the catering .      the possible bride weighed this one up .     are you sure .         well  that   s what mrs ogg told me     said tiffany     and i   ve always wanted to try it .      this seemed to meet with letitia   s approval  because she said     mrs ogg is a very knowledgeable lady  i must admit .  she knows a surprising number of things .      tiffany  keeping her face as straight as possible  said     a surprising number of surprising things .         oh  yes     er .     letitia cleared her throat rather hesitantly and followed up    er    with an    um    .      is something wrong .     said tiffany .      that word you used about me while we were jumping .  i think it was a bad word .      tiffany had been expecting this .     well  apparently it   s traditional .     her voice almost as hesitant as letitia   s  she added     and i don   t think roland is a knave  either .  and  of course  words and their usage do change over the years .         i don   t think that one does .     said letitia .      well  it depends on circumstance and context     said tiffany .     but frankly  letitia  a witch will use any tool at hand in an emergency  as you might learn one day .  besides  the way we think about some words does change .  for example  do you know the meaning of the word    buxom    .     she thought to herself  why am i making this small talk .  i know  because it   s an anchor  and reassures me that i am a human being among other humans  and it helps wash the terror out of my soul         yes     said the bride to be .     i   m afraid i   m not  very  um  large in that department .         that would have been a bit unfortunate a couple of hundred years ago because the wedding service in those days required a bride to be buxom towards her husband .         i   d have had to push a cushion down my bodice .         not really  it used to mean kind  understanding and obedient     said tiffany .      oh  i can do those     said letitia .     at least  the first two     she added with a grin .  she cleared her throat .     what is it  apart from getting married  of course     and i am very amused about that     that we have just done .         well     said tiffany .     you have helped me trap one of the worst monsters that has ever fouled the world .      the new bride brightened up .     did we .  well  that   s good     she said .      i   m very glad we did that .  i don   t know how we can repay you for all your help though .         well  clean used linen and old boots are always welcome     said tiffany seriously .     but you don   t have to thank me for being a witch .  i   d much prefer that you thanked my friend preston .  he put himself in real danger for the pair of you .  at least we were together .  he was out here all by himself .         that is  in point of actual fact     said preston     not entirely accurate .  apart from anything else  all my matches were damp  but fortuitously mr daft wullie and his chums were very kind enough to lend me some .  and i   ve been told to tell ye that that was ok  because they was helping me  not ye .  and although there are ladies present  i have to say that they did assist in getting things going quickly by flapping the flames with their kilts .  a sight  i may say  that once seen is never forgotten .         i would very much have liked to have seen it     said letitia politely .      anyway     said tiffany  trying to get the mental picture out of her mind     it might be best to concentrate on the fact that you will be somewhat more acceptably married by pastor egg tomorrow .  and you know something very important about tomorrow .  it   s today .      roland  who was holding his head and groaning  blinked and said     what is .          chapter      a shadow and a whisper    it was  on the whole  a pretty good wedding in tiffany   s opinion  a pretty good wedding .  pastor egg  aware of the unusual number of witches in the audience  kept the religion to a minimum .  the blushing bride walked up the hall  and tiffany saw her blush a little more when she caught sight of nanny ogg  who gave her a cheerful thumbs up as she passed .  and then there was the throwing of the rice  followed of course by the careful sweeping up of the rice  because it was wicked to waste good food .   then there was general cheering and congratulations and  to the surprise of some  a happy  beaming duchess  who chatted merrily  even to the maids  and appeared to have a kind and reassuring word for everybody .  and only tiffany knew why the woman shot occasional nervous glances towards mrs proust .   tiffany left then  to sneak away and help preston in the king field  where he was digging a hole deep enough so that the plough would never find the charred remains that were collected and thrown down it .  they washed their hands with vicious lye soap  because you could never be too careful .  it was not  strictly speaking  a very romantic occasion .      do you think he will ever come back .     said preston as they leaned on their shovels .   tiffany nodded .     the cunning man will  at least .  poison is always welcome somewhere .         what will you do now he   s gone .         oh  you know  all the exciting stuff  somewhere there is always a leg that needs bandaging or a nose that needs blowing .  it   s busy  busy all day long .         it doesn   t sound very exciting .         well  i suppose so     said tiffany     but compared to yesterday that kind of day suddenly seems to be a very good day .     they headed towards the hall  where the wedding breakfast was now being served as lunch .     you are a young man of considerable resourcefulness     tiffany said to preston     and i thank you very much for your help .      preston nodded happily .     thank you very much for that  miss  thank you very much indeed  but with just one little     how can i put it     correction .  you are  after all  sixteen  more or less  and i am seventeen  so i think you will conclude that calling me young man     i will own up to a cheerful and youthful disposition  but i am older than you  my girl .      there was a pause .  then tiffany said carefully     how do you know how old i am .         i asked around     said preston  his eager smile never leaving his face .      why .      tiffany didn   t get an answer because the sergeant came out of the main door with confetti cascading off his helmet .     oh  there you are  miss .  the baron   s been asking after you  and so has the baroness .     he paused to smile and said     nice to have one of them again .     his gaze fell on preston and the sergeant frowned .     lollygagging again  as usual  lance private preston .      preston saluted smartly     you are correct in your surmise  sergeant  you have voiced an absolute truth .     this got preston the puzzled glare he always got from the sergeant  and there was also a disapproving grunt  which meant  one day i   ll work out what it is you are saying  my lad  and then you   ll be in trouble .   weddings can be rather similar to funerals in that  apart from the main players  when it   s all over  people are never quite sure what they should be doing next  which is why they see if there is any wine left .  but letitia was looking radiant  which is compulsory for brides  and the slightly frizzled bits of her hair had been neatly concealed by her brilliant  sparkly tiara .  roland had also scrubbed up quite well  and you had to be quite close to him to smell pig .      about last night        he began nervously .     er  it did happen  didn   t it .  i mean  i remember the pigsty  and we were all running  but        his voice faded away .   tiffany looked at letitia  who mouthed the words     i remember everything .      yes  she really is a witch  tiffany thought .  that   s going to be interesting .   roland coughed .  tiffany smiled .     dear miss aching     he said  and for once tiffany forgave him his    public meeting    voice     i am well aware that i have been party to a miscarriage of natural justice vis    vis your good self .     he stopped to clear his throat again and tiffany thought  i really hope that letitia can wash some of the starch out of him .     with this in mind  i spoke to young preston here  who talked to the kitchen girls in his cheery way and found out where the nurse had gone .  she had spent some of the money  but most of it is here and it is  i am happy to say  yours .      at this point somebody nudged tiffany .   it was preston  who hissed     we   ve found this too .      she looked down  and he pressed a worn leather folder into her hand .  she nodded in grateful thanks and looked at roland .     your father wanted you to have this     she said .     it may be worth more to you than all that money .  i would wait until you are alone before you look at it .      he turned it over in his hands .     what is it .         just a memory     said tiffany .     just a memory .      the sergeant stepped forward then and tipped a heavy leather bag onto the table  among the glasses and flowers .  there was a gasp from the guests .   i   m being watched like hawks by my sister witches  thought tiffany  and i am also being watched by practically everyone i know  and who know me .  i   ve got to do this right .  and i   ve got to do this so that everybody remembers it .      i think you should keep it  sir     she said .  roland looked relieved  but tiffany went on     however  i have a few simple requests on behalf of other people .      letitia nudged her husband in the ribs and he spread out his hands .     this is my wedding day .  how can i refuse any request .         the girl amber petty needs a dowry which  incidentally  would allow her young man to buy his indenture to a master craftsman  and you might not be aware that he sewed the gown that is currently adorning your beautiful young wife .  have you ever seen anything finer .      this got an immediate round of applause  along with whistles from roland   s chums  who whimsically called out things like     which one .  the girl or the dress .     when that was over  tiffany said     and furthermore  sir  and with your indulgence  i would like your pledge that any boy or girl from the chalk with such a similar request will find you obliging .  i think you will agree that i am asking for a lot less than i am returning to you .         tiffany  i believe you are correct     said roland     but i suspect you have more up your sleeve .         how well you know me  sir     said tiffany and roland  just for a moment  went pink .      i want a school  sir .  i want a school here on the chalk .  i   ve been thinking about this for a long time     in fact for longer than i had worked out the name for what i wanted .  there   s an old barn on home farm that isn   t being used right now and i think we could make it quite acceptable in a week or so .         well  the travelling teachers do come through every few months     said the baron .      yes  sir  i know  sir  and they   re useless  sir .  they teach facts  not understanding .  it   s like teaching people about forests by showing them a saw .  i want a proper school  sir  to teach reading and writing  and most of all thinking  sir  so people can find what they   re good at  because someone doing what they really like is always an asset to any country  and too often people never find out until it   s too late .     she deliberately looked away from the sergeant  but her words had caused a susurration around the room  tiffany was glad to hear .  she drowned it out with     there have been times  lately  when i dearly wished that i could change the past .  well  i can   t  but i can change the present  so that when it becomes the past it will turn out to be a past worth having .  and i   d like the boys to learn about girls and i   d like the girls to learn about boys .  learning is about finding out who you are  what you are  where you are and what you are standing on and what you are good at and what   s over the horizon and  well  everything .  it   s about finding the place where you fit .  i found the place where i fit  and i would like everybody else to find theirs .  and may i please propose that preston is the school   s first teacher .  he pretty much knows everything there is to know as it is .      preston bowed low with his helmet off  which got a laugh .   tiffany went on     and his reward for a year   s teaching work for you will be  yes  enough money for him to buy the letters to go after his name so that he can become a doctor .  witches can   t do everything and we could do with a doctor in these parts .     all this got a big cheer  which is what generally happens when people have worked out that they are likely to get something that they won   t have to pay for .  when that had died down  roland looked the sergeant in the eye and said     do you think you can manage without preston   s military prowess  sergeant .      this precipitated another laugh .  that   s good  tiffany thought  laughter helps things slide into the thinking .   sergeant brian tried to look solemn  but he was concealing a smile .     it would be a bit of a blow  sir  but i think we might just about manage  sir .  yes  i think i can say that the departure of lance private preston will enhance the overall efficiency of the squad  sir .      this caused more general applause from people who hadn   t worked it out and laughter from those that did .   the baron clapped his hands together .     well then  miss aching  it would appear that you have got everything you asked for  yes .         actually  sir  i haven   t finished asking yet .  there is one more thing and it won   t cost you anything  so don   t worry about that .     tiffany took a deep breath  and tried to make herself look taller .     i require that you give to the peoples known as the nac mac feegle all the downland above home farm  that it should be theirs for ever in law as well as in justice .  a proper deed can be drawn up  and don   t worry about the cost     i know a toad that will do it for a handful of beetles     and it will say that for their part the feegles will allow all shepherds and sheep untrammelled access to the downs but there will be     and this is important     no sharp metal beyond a knife .  all this will cost you nothing  my lord baron  but what you and your descendants  and i hope you are intending to have descendants       tiffany had to stop there because of the gale of laughter  in which nanny ogg took a large part  and then she continued     my lord baron  i think you will assure yourself of a friendship that will never die .  gain all  lose nothing .      to his credit  roland hardly hesitated  and said     i would be  honoured to present the nac mac feegle with the deeds to their land and i regret  no  i apologize for any misunderstandings between us .  as you say  they deserve their land by right and by justice .      tiffany was impressed by the short speech .  the language was slightly stuffy  but his heart was in the right place  and slightly stuffy language suited the feegles very well .  to her joy there was yet another susurration in the beams high over the castle   s hall .  and the baron  looking a lot more like a real baron now  went on     i only wish that i could tell them this personally right now .      and from the darkness above came one mighty cry of       the wind was silver and cold .  tiffany opened her eyes  with the cheer of the feegles still ringing in her ears .  it was replaced by the rattle of dried grass in the wind .  she tried to sit up but got nowhere  and a voice behind her said     please don   t wriggle  this is very difficult .      tiffany tried to turn her head .     eskarina .         yes .  there is somebody here who wants to talk to you .  you may get up now  i have balanced the nodes .  don   t ask questions  because you would not understand the answers .  you are in the travelling now  again .  now and again  you might say .  i will leave you to your friend     and i am afraid you cannot have much time  for a given value of time .  but i must protect my son         tiffany said     you mean you   ve got       she stopped because a figure was forming in front of tiffany and became a witch  a classic witch with the black dress  black boots     rather nice ones  tiffany noted     and  of course  the pointy hat .  she had a necklace too .  on the chain was a golden hare .   the woman herself was old  but it was hard to say how old .  she stood proudly  like granny weatherwax  but like nanny ogg she seemed to suggest that old age  or something  wasn   t really being taken seriously .   but tiffany concentrated on the necklace .  people wore jewellery to show you something .  it always had a meaning  if you concentrated .      all right  all right     she said     i have just one question  i   m not here to bury you  am i .         my word  you are quick     said the woman .     you have immediately devised a remarkably interesting narrative and instantly guessed who i am .     she laughed .  the voice was younger than her face .     no  tiffany .  interestingly macabre though your suggestion is  the answer is no .  i remember granny weatherwax telling me that when you get right down to it  the world is all about stories  and tiffany aching is extremely good at endings .         i am .         oh yes .  classic endings to a romantic story are a wedding or a legacy  and you have been the engineer for one of each .  well done .         you are me  right .     said tiffany .     that   s what the    you have to help yourself    business was about  yes .      the older tiffany grinned  and tiffany could not help noticing that it was a very nice grin .     as a matter of fact  i only interfered in a few small ways .  like  for example  making certain the wind really did blow very hard for you     although  as i recall  a certain colony of little men added their own special excitement to the venture .  i   m never quite certain if my memory is good or bad .  that   s time travel for you .         you can travel in time .         with some help from our friend eskarina .  and only as a shadow and a whisper .  it   s a bit like the don   t see me thing that i     that we     you have to persuade time not to take any notice .         but why did you want to talk to me .     said tiffany .      well  the infuriating answer is that i remembered that i did     said old tiffany .     sorry  that   s time travel again .  but i think i wanted to tell you that it all works out  more or less .  it all falls into place .  you   ve taken the first step .         there   s a second step .     said tiffany .      no  there   s another first step .  every step is a first step if it   s a step in the right direction .         but hold on     said tiffany .     won   t i be you one day .  and then will i talk to me now  as it were .         yes  but the you that you talk to won   t exactly be you .  i   m very sorry about this  but i am having to talk about time travel in a language that can   t really account for it .  but in short  tiffany  according to the elasticated string theory  throughout the rest of time  somewhere an old tiffany will be talking to a young tiffany  and the fascinating thing is that every time they do they will be a little bit different .  when you meet your younger self  you will tell her what you think she needs to know .         but i have got a question     said tiffany .     and it   s one i want to know the answer to .         well  do be quick     said old tiffany     the elasticated string thingy  or whatever it is that eskarina uses  does not allow us very much time .         well     said tiffany     can you at least tell me .  do i ever get    .      old tiffany faded  smiling into nothingness  but tiffany heard one word .  it sounded like     listen .      and then she was in the hall again  as if she   d never left it at all  and people were cheering and there seemed to be feegles everywhere .  and preston was by her side .  it was as if ice had suddenly melted .  but when she got her balance back  and stopped asking herself what had just happened  had really happened  tiffany looked for the other witches  and saw that they were talking amongst themselves  like judges adding up a score .   the huddle broke up  and they came towards her purposefully  led by granny weatherwax .  when they reached her they bowed and raised their hats  which is a mark of respect in the craft .   granny weatherwax looked at her sternly .     i see you have burned your hand  tiffany .      tiffany looked down .     i didn   t notice     she said .     can i ask you now  granny .  would you all have killed me .     she saw the expressions of the other witches change .   granny weatherwax looked around and paused for a moment .      let us say  young woman  we would have done our best not to .  but all in all  tiffany  it seems to us that you   ve done a woman   s job today .  the place where we looks for witches is at the centre of things .  well  we looks around here and we see that you is so central that this steading spins on you .  you are your own mistress  nevertheless  and if you don   t start training somebody  that will be a waste .  we leave this steading in the best of hands .      the witches clapped  and some of the other guests joined in  even though they did not understand what those few sentences had meant .  what they did recognize  however  was that these were mostly elderly  experienced  important and scary witches .  and they were paying their respect to tiffany aching  one of them  their witch .  and she was a very important witch  and so the chalk had to be a very important place .  of course  they had known that all along but it was nice to have it acknowledged .  they stood a little straighter and felt proud .   mrs proust removed her hat again  and said     please don   t be afraid to come back to the city again  miss aching .  i think i can promise you a thirty per cent discount on all boffo products  except for perishables or consumables  an offer not to be sneezed at .      the group of witches raised their hats in unison again and walked back into the crowd .      you know all that just now was organizing people   s lives for them     said preston behind her  but as she spun round he backed away laughing and added     but in a good way .  you are the witch  tiffany .  you are the witch .      and people drank a toast and there was more food  and more dancing and laughter and friendship and tiredness  and at midnight tiffany aching lay alone on her broomstick high above the chalk hills and looked up at the universe  and then down on the bit of it that belonged to her .  she was the witch  floating high over everything but  it must be said  with the leather strap carefully buckled .   the stick rose and fell gently as warm breezes took it and as tiredness and darkness took her  she stretched out her arms to the dark and  just for a moment  as the world turned  tiffany aching wore midnight .   she didn   t come down until the sun was crusting the horizon with light .  and she woke up to birdsong .  all across the chalk the larks were rising as they did every morning in a symphony of liquid sound .  they did indeed sing melodious .  they streamed up past the stick  paying it no attention at all  and tiffany listened  entranced  until the last bird had got lost in the brilliant sky .   she landed  made breakfast for an old lady who was bed bound  fed her cat  and went to see how trivial boxer   s   broken leg was doing .  she was stopped halfway there by the neighbour of old miss swivel  who had apparently become suddenly unable to walk overnight  but tiffany was fortunately able to point out that she had regrettably put both feet through one knicker leg .   then she went down into the castle to see what else needed doing .  after all  she was the witch .      mr and mrs boxer had been slightly more educated than was good for them  and thought that    trivial    was a good name for their third child .       epilogue   midnight by day    it was the scouring fair again  the same noisy hurdy gurdy  the bobbing for frogs  the fortune telling  the laughter  the pick pockets  though never of a witch   s pocket   but this year  by common consent  no cheese rolling .  tiffany walked through it all  nodding at people she knew  which was everybody  and generally enjoying the sunshine .  had it been a year .  so much had happened  it all swam together  like the sounds of the fair .      good afternoon  miss .      and there was amber  with her boy     with her husband         nearly didn   t recognize you  miss     said amber cheerfully     what with you not having your pointy hat on  if you see what i mean .         i thought i   d just be tiffany aching today     said tiffany .     it is a holiday after all .         but you are still the witch .         oh yes  i   m still the witch  but i   m not necessarily the hat .      amber   s husband laughed .     i know what you mean  miss .  sometimes i swear that people think i   m a pair of hands .     tiffany looked him up and down .  they had met properly when she had married him to amber  of course  and she had been impressed  he was what they called a steady lad and as sharp as his needles .  he would go far  and take amber with him .  and after amber finished her training under the kelda  who knows where she would take him .   amber hung on his arm as if it was an oak .     my william done a little present for you  miss     she said .     go on  william  show her .      the young man proffered the package he had been carrying  and cleared his throat .     i don   t know if you keep up with the fashions  miss  but they are doing wonderful fabrics now down in the big city  so when amber suggested this to me i thought of them .  but it also has to be washable  for a start  with perhaps a split skirt for the broomstick and leg of mutton sleeves  which are all the go this season  and with buttons tight at the wrists to keep them out of the way  and pockets on the inside and styled to be hardly noticeable .  i hope it fits  miss .  i   m good at measuring without a tape .  it   s a knack .      amber bounced up and down at his side .     put it on  miss .  go on  miss .  put it on .         what .  in front of all these people .     said tiffany  embarrassed and intrigued at the same time .   amber was not to be denied .     there   s the mother and baby tent  miss .  no men in there  miss  no fear .  they   d be afraid that they would have to burp somebody  miss .      tiffany gave in .  the package had a rich feel to it  it felt soft  like a glove .  mothers and babies watched her as she slid into the dress and she heard the envious sighs that interspersed burps .   amber  on fire with enthusiasm  pushed her way in through the flap  and gasped .      oh  miss  oh  miss  it does suit you so .  oh  miss .  if only you could see yourself  miss .  do come and show william  miss  he   ll be as proud as a king .  oh  miss .      you couldn   t disappoint amber .  you just couldn   t .  it would be like  well  kicking a puppy .   tiffany felt different without the hat .  lighter  perhaps .  and william gasped and said     i wish my master was here  miss aching  because you are a masterpiece .  i just wish you could see yourself     miss .      and just for a moment  because people shouldn   t get too suspicious  tiffany stood outside herself and watched herself twirl the beautiful dress as black as a cat full of sixpences  and she thought  i shall wear midnight  and i will be good at it      she hurried back to her body and shyly thanked the young tailor .     it   s wonderful  william  and i will happily fly over to show your master .  the cuffs are wonderful .      amber was jumping up and down again .     we   d better hurry if we   re going to see the tug of war  miss     it   s feegles versus humans .  it   s going to be fun .      and in fact  they could hear the roar of the feegles warming up  though they had made a slight alteration to their traditional chant     nae king  nae quin  nae laird .  one baron     and underrr mutually ag rreeeed arrr angement  ye ken .         you go on ahead     said tiffany .     i   m waiting for somebody .     amber paused for a moment .     don   t wait too long  miss  don   t wait too long .      tiffany walked slowly in the wonderful dress  wondering if she would dare wear it every day and     hands came past her ears and covered her eyes .   a voice behind her said     a nosegay for the pretty lady .  you never know  it might help you find your beau .      she spun round .     preston .      they talked as they strolled away from the noise  and tiffany listened to news about the bright young lad that preston had trained to take over as the school   s new teacher  and about exams and doctors and the lady sybil free hospital who had     and this was the really important part     just taken on one new apprentice  this being preston  possibly because since he could talk the hind leg off a donkey  he might have a talent for surgery .      i don   t reckon i   ll get many holidays     he said .     you don   t get many when you   re an apprentice and i shall have to sleep under the autoclave every night and look after all the saws and scalpels  but i know all the bones by heart .         well  it   s not too far by broomstick  after all     said tiffany .   preston   s expression changed as he reached into his pocket and pulled out something wrapped in fine tissue  which he handed to her without saying a word .   tiffany unwrapped it  knowing     absolutely knowing     that it would be the golden hare .  there was no possibility in the world that it wouldn   t have been .  she tried to find the words  but preston always had an adequate supply .   he said     miss tiffany  the witch     would you be so good as to tell me  what is the sound of love .      tiffany looked at his face .  the noise from the tug of war was silenced .  the birds stopped singing .  in the grass  the grasshoppers stopped rubbing their legs together and looked up .  the earth moved slightly as even the chalk giant  perhaps  strained to hear  and the silence flowed over the world until all there was was preston  who was always there .   and tiffany said     listen .          a feegle glossary   adjusted for those of a delicate disposition     a work in progress by miss

them out of real things      when i was a small boy  just after the last ice age  we lived in a cottage that tiffany aching would recognize  we had cold water  no electricity  and took a bath once a week  because the tin bath had to be brought in from its nail  which was outside on the back of the kitchen wall  and it took a long time to fill it  when all my mother had to heat water with was one kettle .  then i  as the youngest  had the first bath  followed by mum and then dad  and finally the dog if dad thought it was getting a bit niffy .   there were old men in the village who had been born in the jurassic period and looked  to me  all the same  with flat caps and serious trousers held up with very thick leather belts .  one of them was called mr allen  who wouldn   t drink water from a tap because  he said     it   s got neither taste nor smell .     he drank water from the roof of his house  which fed a rain barrel .   presumably he drank more than rainwater  because he had a nose that looked like two strawberries that had crashed into one another .     mr allen used to sit out in the sun in front of his cottage on an old kitchen chair  watching the world go by  and we kids used to watch his nose  in case it exploded .  one day i was chatting to him  and out of the blue he said to me     you seen stubbles burning  boy .      i certainly had  not near our home  but when we drove down to the coast on holiday  though sometimes the smoke from the burning stubbles was so thick that it looked like a fog .  the stubbles were what was left in the ground after most of the corn stems had been cut .  the burning was said to be good for getting rid of pests and diseases  but the process meant lots of small birds and animals were burned .  the practice has long since been banned  for that very reason .   one day  when the harvest wagon went down our lane  mr allen said to me     you ever seen a hare  boy .      i said     yes  of course .      if you haven   t seen a hare  then imagine a rabbit crossed with a greyhound  one that can leap magnificently .   mr allen said     the hare ain   t afraid of fire .  she stares it down  and jumps over it  and lands safe on the other side .      i must have been about six or seven years old  but i remembered it  because mr allen died not long afterwards .  then when i was much older  i found in a second hand bookshop a book called the leaping hare written by george ewart evans and david thomson  and i learned things that i would not have dared to make up .   mr evans  who died in       spoke     during his long life     to the men who worked on the land  not from the cab of a tractor  but with horses  and they saw the wildlife around them .  i suspect that maybe they had put a little bit of a shine on the things they told him  but everything is all the better for a little bit of shine  and i have not hesitated to polish up the legend of the hare for you .  if it is not the truth  then it is what the truth ought to be .   i dedicate this book to mr evans  a wonderful man who helped many of us of us to learn about the depths of history over which we float .  it is important that we know where we come from  because if you do not know where you come from  then you don   t know where you are  and if you don   t know where you are  then you don   t know where you   re going .  and if you don   t know where you   re going  you   re probably going wrong .   terry pratchett  wiltshire     may          my dad told me it   s called    drinker   s nose     but he was probably wrong  as the condition  i   m told  is a type of adult acne  called rhinophyma  but i suspect that this is too much information  .
