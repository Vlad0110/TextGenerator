johnny and the dead     terry pratchett      contents      author   s note      one  johnny never knew for certain why he started seeing the         two  johnny raised the subject of the cemetery after tea .       three  there was the alderman  and william stickers  and an old         four  it was later that morning .       five  johnny went home .  he didn   t dare go back to the         six  the pals swung up the road  keeping perfectly in step .       seven  the frank w .  arnold civic center meeting room was about half         eight  there is a night that never comes to an end .          nine     this fuss over the cemetery   s certainly breathed a bit of         ten  bigmac bounded over the rubble  an enraged skinhead skeleton .       eleven  as tommy atkins had once said  things aren   t necessarily over         about the author      other books by terry pratchett      credits      cover      copyright      about the publisher      author   s note     i   ve bent history a little bit .  there really were such things as pals    battalions  just as described here  and they really were a horribly innocent device for wiping out a whole generation of young men from one particular area with one cannon shell .  but the practice died out by the summer of       when the first battle of the somme took place .  nineteen thousand british soldiers died on the first day of the battle .      thomas atkins    really was the name used on documents in the british army in the way that people would now use    a . n .  other     and    tommy atkins    did become a nickname for the british soldier .   there were certainly a number of real tommy atkinses in the war .  this book is dedicated to them   wherever they are .       one     johnny never knew for certain why he started seeing the dead .   the alderman said it was probably because he was too lazy not to .   most people   s minds don   t let them see things that might upset them  he said .  the alderman said he should know if anyone did  because he   d spent his whole life               not seeing things .   wobbler johnson  who was technically johnny   s best friend  said it was because he was nuts .   but yo less  who read medical books  said it was probably because he couldn   t focus his mind like normal people .  normal people just ignored almost everything that was going on around them  so that they could concentrate on important things like  well  getting up  going to the lavatory  and getting on with their lives .  whereas johnny just opened his eyes in the morning and the whole universe hit him in the face .   wobbler said this sounded like    nuts    to him .   whatever it was called  what it meant was this  johnny saw things other people didn   t .   like the dead people hanging around in the cemetery .   the alderman   at least the old alderman   was a bit snobby about most of the rest of the dead  even about mr .  vicenti  who had a huge black marble grave with angels and a photograph of mr .  vicenti               looking not at all dead behind a little window .  the alderman said mr .  vicenti had been a capo di monte in the mafia .  mr .  vicenti told johnny that  on the contrary  he had spent his entire life being a wholesale novelty salesman  amateur escapologist  and children   s entertainer  which in a number of important respects was as exactly like not being in the mafia as it was possible to get .   but all this was later .  after he   d gotten to know the dead a lot better .  after the raising of the ghost of the ford capri .       johnny really discovered the cemetery after he   d started living at granddad   s .  this was phase three of trying times  after the shouting  which had been bad  and the being sensible about things  which had been worse  people are better at shouting  .  now his dad was getting a new job somewhere on the other side of the country .  there was a vague feeling that it might all work out  now that people had stopped trying to be sensible .  on the whole  he tried not to think about it .   he   d started using the path along the canal instead of going home on the bus  and had found that if you climbed over the place where the wall had fallen down  and then went around behind the crematorium  you could cut off half the journey .   the graves went right up to the canal   s edge .   it was one of those old cemeteries you got owls and foxes in and sometimes  in the sunday papers  people going on about our victorian heritage  although they didn   t go on about this one because it was the wrong kind of heritage  being too far from london .   wobbler said it was spooky and sometimes went home the long way  but johnny was disappointed that it wasn   t spookier .  once you sort of put out of your mind what it was   once you forgot about all the skeletons underground  grinning away in the dark   it was quite friendly .  birds sang .  all the traffic sounded a long way off .  it was peaceful .   he   d had to check a few things  though .  some of the older graves had big stone boxes on top of them  and in the wilder parts these had cracked and even fallen open .  he   d had a look inside  just in case .   it had been sort of disappointing to find nothing there .   and then there were the mausoleums .  these were much bigger and had doors in them  like little houses .  they looked a bit like garden sheds with extra angels .  the angels were generally more lifelike than you   d expect  especially one near the entrance who looked as though he   d just remembered that he should have gone to the toilet before he left heaven .   the two boys walked through the cemetery now  kicking up the drifts of fallen leaves .      it   s halloween next week     said wobbler .     i   m having a party .  you have to come as something horrible .  don   t bother to find a disguise .         thanks     said johnny .      you notice how there   s a lot more halloween stuff in the shops these days .     said wobbler .      it   s because of bonfire night     said johnny .     too many people were blowing themselves up with fireworks  so they invented halloween  where you just wear masks and stuff .         mrs .  nugent says all that sort of thing is tampering with the occult     said wobbler .  mrs .  nugent was the johnsons    next door neighbor  and known to be unreasonable on subjects like madonna played at full volume at three a . m .      probably it is     said johnny .      she says witches are abroad on halloween     said wobbler .      what .     johnny   s forehead wrinkled .     like   marjorca and places .         suppose so     said wobbler .      makes   sense  i suppose .  they probably get special out of season bargains  being old ladies     said johnny .     my aunt can go anywhere on the buses for almost nothing  and she   s not even a witch .         don   t see why mrs .  nugent is worried  then     said wobbler .     it ought to be a lot safer around here  with all the witches on vacation .      they passed a very ornate mausoleum  which even had little stained glass windows .  it was hard to imagine who   d want to see in  but then  it was even harder to imagine who   d want to look out .      shouldn   t like to be on the same plane as    em     said wobbler  who   d been thinking hard .     just think  p   raps you can only afford to go on vacation in the autumn  and you get on the plane  and there   s all these old witches going abroad .         singing    here we go  here we go  here we go    .     said johnny .     but i bet you   d get really good service in the hotel .         yeah .         funny  really     said johnny .      what .         i saw a thing in a book once     said johnny     about these people in mexico or somewhere  where they all go down to the cemetery for a big fiesta at halloween every year .  like they don   t see why people should be left out of things just because they   re dead .         yuck .  a picnic .  in the actual cemetery .         yes .         reckon you   d get green glowing hands pushing up through the earth and swiping the sandwiches .         don   t think so .  anyway   they don   t eat sandwiches in mexico .  they eat tort   something .         tortoises .         yeah .         i bet     said wobbler  looking around     i bet   i bet you wouldn   t dare knock on one of those doors .  i bet you   d hear dead people lurchin    about inside .         why do they lurch .      wobbler thought about this .      they always lurch     he said .     dunno why .  i   ve seen them in videos .  and they can push their way through walls .         why .     said johnny .      why what .         why push their way through walls .  i mean   living people can   t do that .  why should dead people do it .      wobbler   s mother was very easygoing in the matter of videos .  according to him  he was allowed to watch ones that even people aged a hundred had to watch with their parents .      don   t know     he said .     they   re usually very angry about something .         being dead  you mean .         probably     said wobbler .     it can   t be much of a life .      johnny thought about this that evening  after meeting the alderman .  the only dead people he had known had been mr .  page  who   d died in the hospital of something  and his great grandmother  who   d been ninety six and had just generally died .  neither of them had been particularly angry people .  his great grandmother had been a bit confused about things  but never angry .  he   d visited her in sunshine acres  where she watched a lot of television and waited for the next meal to turn up .  and mr .  page had walked around quietly  the only man on the street still at home in the middle of the day .   they didn   t seem the sort of people who would get up after being dead just to dance with michael jackson like in that old movie .  and the only thing his great grand mother would have pushed her way through walls for would be a television that she could watch without having to fight fifteen other old ladies for the remote control .   it seemed to johnny that a lot of people were getting things all wrong .  he said this to wobbler .  wobbler disagreed .      it   s prob   ly all different from a dead point of view     he said .   now they were walking along west avenue .  the cemetery was laid out like a town  with streets .  they weren   t named very originally   north drive and south walk joined west avenue  for example  at a little graveled area with seats in it .  a kind of city center .  but the silence of the big victorian mausoleums made the place look as though it was having the longest early closing day in the world .      my dad says this is all going to be built on     said wobbler .     he said the council sold it to some big company for just fivepence because it was costing so much to keep it going .         what  all of it .     said johnny .      that   s what he said     said wobbler .  even he looked a bit uncertain .     he said it was a scandal .         even the bit with the poplar trees .         all of it     said wobbler .     it   s going to be offices or something .      johnny looked at the cemetery .  it was the only open space for miles .      i   d have given them at least a pound     he said .      yes  but you wouldn   t have been able to build things on it     said wobbler .     that   s the important thing .         i wouldn   t want to build anything on it .  i   d have given them a pound just to leave it as it is .         yes     said wobbler  the voice of reason     but people have got to work somewhere .  we need jobs .         i bet the people here won   t be very happy about it     said johnny .     if they knew .         i think they get moved somewhere else     said wobbler .     it   s got to be something like that .  otherwise you   d never dare dig your garden .      johnny looked up at the nearest tomb .  it was one of the ones that looked like a shed built of marble .  bronze lettering over the door said     alderman thomas bowler               pro bono publico    there was a stone carving of   presumably   the alderman himself  looking seriously into the distance as if he  too  was wondering what pro bono publico meant .      i bet he   d be pretty angry     said johnny .   he hesitated for a moment  then walked up the couple of broken steps to the metal door and knocked on it .  he never did know why he   d done that .      here  you mustn   t .     hissed wobbler .     supposing he comes lurchin    out .  anyway     he said  lowering his voice even more     it   s wrong to try to talk to the dead .  it can lead to satanic practices  it said on television .         don   t see why     said johnny .   he knocked again .   and the door opened .   alderman thomas bowler blinked in the sunlight and then glared at johnny .      yes .     he said .   johnny turned and ran for it .   wobbler caught up to him halfway along north drive .  wobbler wasn   t normally the athletic type  and his speed would have surprised quite a lot of people who knew him .      what happened .  what happened .     he panted .      didn   t you see .     said johnny .      i didn   t see anything .         the door opened .         it never .         it did .      wobbler slowed down .      no  it didn   t     he muttered .     no one of    em can open .  i   ve looked at    em .  they   ve all got padlocks on .         to keep people out or keep people in .     asked johnny .   a look of panic crossed wobbler   s face .  since he had a big face  this took some time .  he started to run again .      you   re just trying to get a rise out of me .     he yelled .     i   m not going to hang around practicing being satanic .  i   m going home .      he turned the corner into east way and sprinted toward the main gate .   johnny slowed down .   he thought  padlocks .   it was true  actually .  he   d noticed it in the past .   all the mausoleums had locks on them  to stop vandals from getting in .   and yet   and yet     if he shut his eyes  he could see alderman thomas bowler .  not one of the lurchin    dead from out of wobbler   s videos  but a huge fat man in a fur trimmed robe and a gold chain and a hat with corners .   he stopped running and then  slowly  walked back the way he had come .   there was a padlock on the door of the alderman   s tomb .  it had a rusty look .   it was the talking to wobbler that did it  johnny decided .  it had given him silly ideas .   he knocked again  anyway .      yes .     said alderman thomas bowler .      er   hah   sorry           what do you want .         are you dead .      the alderman raised his eyes to the bronze letters over the door .      see what it says up there .     he said .      er           nineteen hundred and six  it says .  it was a very good funeral  i understand .  i didn   t attend  myself .     the alderman gave this some thought .     rather  i did  but not in any position where i could observe events .  i believe the vicar gave a very moving sermon .  what was it you were wanting .         er       johnny looked around desperately .     what   er   what does pro bono publico mean .         for the public good     said the alderman .      oh .  well   thank you .     johnny backed away .     thank you very much .         was that all .         er   yes .      the alderman nodded sadly .     i didn   t think it   d be anything important     he said .     i haven   t had a visitor since nineteen twenty three .  and then they   d got the name wrong .  they weren   t even relatives .  and they were american .  oh  well .  good bye  then .      johnny hesitated .  i could turn around now  he thought  and go home .   and if i turn around  i   ll never find out what happens next .  i   ll go away and i   ll never know why it happened now and what would have happened next .  i   ll go away and grow up and get a job and get married and have children and become a granddad and retire and take up bowling and go into sunshine acres and watch daytime television until i die  and i   ll never know .   and he thought  perhaps i did .  perhaps that all happened and then  just when i was dying  some kind of angel turned up and said would you like a wish .  and i said  yes  i   d like to know what would have happened if i hadn   t run away  and the angel said  okay  you can go back .  and here i am  back again .  i can   t let myself down .   the world waited .   johnny took a step forward .      you   re dead  right .     he said slowly .      oh  yes .  it   s one of those things one is pretty certain about .         you don   t look dead .  i mean  i thought   you know   coffins and things           oh  there   s all that     said the alderman airily     and then there   s this  too .         you   re a ghost .     johnny was rather relieved .  he could come to terms with a ghost .      i should hope i   ve got more pride than that     said the alderman .      my friend wobbler   ll be really amazed to meet you     said johnny .  a thought crossed his mind .     you   re no good at dancing  are you .     he said .      i used to be able to waltz quite well     said the alderman .      i meant   sort of   like this     said johnny .  he gave the best impression he could remember of michael jackson dancing .     sort of with your feet     he said apologetically .      that looks grand     said alderman tom bowler .      yes  and you have to have a glittery glove on one hand           that   s important  is it .         yes  and you have to say    ow .            i should think anyone would  dancing like that     said the alderman .      no  i mean like    oooowwwwwwweeeeeah .     with        johnny stopped .  he realized that he was getting a bit carried away .      but look     he said  stopping at the end of a groove in the gravel .     i don   t see how you can be dead and walking and talking at the same time    .         that   s probably all because of relativity     said the alderman .  he moonwalked stiffly across the path .     like this  was it .  ouch .         a bit     said johnny kindly .     um .  what do you mean about relativity .         einstein explains all that quite well     said the alderman .      what  albert einstein .     said johnny .      who .         he was a famous scientist .  he   invented the speed of light and things .         did he .  i meant solomon einstein .  he was a famous taxidermist in cable street .  stuffing dead animals  you know .  i think he invented some kind of machine for making glass eyes .  got knocked down by a motorcar in nineteen thirty two .  but a very keen thinker  all the same .         i never knew that     said johnny .  he looked around .   it was getting darker .      i think i   d better be getting home     he said  and began to back away .      i think i   m getting the hang of this     said the alderman  moonwalking back across the path .      i   ll   er   i   ll see you again .  perhaps     said johnny .      drop by any time you like     said the alderman  as johnny walked away as quickly yet politely as possible .     i   m always in .      always in     he added .     that   s something you learn to be good at  when you   re dead .  er .  eeeeeeyooooowh  was it .          two     johnny raised the subject of the cemetery after tea .      it   s disgusting  what the council are doing     said his grandfather .      but the cemetery costs a lot to keep up     said his mother .     no one visits most of the graves now  except old mrs .  tachyon  and she   s crazy .         not visiting graves has nothing to do with it  girl .  anyway  there   s history in there .         alderman thomas bowler     said johnny .      never heard of him .  i was referring     said his grandfather     to william stickers .  there was very nearly a monument to him .  there would have been a monument to him .  everyone around here donated money  only someone ran off with it .  and i   d given sixpence .         was he famous .         nearly famous .  nearly famous .  you   ve heard of karl marx .         he invented communism  didn   t he .     said johnny .      right .  well  william stickers didn   t .  but he   d have been karl marx if karl marx hadn   t beaten him to it .  tell you what   tomorrow i   ll show you .          it was tomorrow .   it was raining softly out of a dark gray sky .   granddad and johnny stood in front of a large gravestone that read     william stickers               workers of the world unit       a great man     said granddad .  he had taken his cap off .      what was the world unit .     said johnny .      it should have been unite     said granddad .     they ran out of money before they did the    e .     it was a scandal .  he was a hero of the working class .  he would have fought in the spanish civil war  except he got on the wrong boat and ended up in liverpool .      johnny looked around .      um     he said .     what sort of a man was he .         a hero of the proletariat  like i said .         i mean  what did he look like .     said johnny .     was he quite big with a huge black beard and gold rimmed spectacles .         that   s right .  seen pictures  have you .         no     said johnny .     not exactly .      granddad put his cap back on .      i   m going down to the shops     he said .     want to come .         no  thanks .  er   i   m going around to wobbler   s house .         righto .      granddad wandered off toward the main gate .   johnny took a deep breath .      hello     he said .      it was a scandal  them not giving me the    e        said william stickers .   he stopped leaning against his memorial .      what   s your name  comrade .         john maxwell     said johnny .      i knew you could see me     said william stickers .     i could see you looking right at me while the old man was talking .         i could tell you were you     said johnny .     you look   um   thinner .      he wanted to say  not thin like in thick .  just   not all there .  transparent .   he said     um .     and then he said     i don   t understand this .  you are dead  right .  some kind of   ghost .         ghost .     said dead william stickers angrily .      well   spirit  then .         there   s no such thing .  a relic of an outmoded belief system .         um  only   you   re talking to me           it   s a perfectly understandable scientific phenomenon     said william stickers .     never let superstition get in the way of rational thought  boy .  it   s time for mankind to put old cultural shibboleths aside and step into the bright socialist dawn .  what year is it .         nineteen ninety three     said johnny .      ah .  and have the downtrodden masses risen up to overthrow the capitalist oppressors in the glorious name of communism .         um .  sorry .     johnny hesitated  and then a few vague memories slid into place .     you mean like   russia and stuff .  when they shot the tsar .  there was something on television about that .         oh  i know that .  that was just the start .  what   s been happening since nineteen forty nine .  i expect the global revolution is well established  yes .  no one tells us anything in here .         well   there   s been a lot of revolutions  i think     said johnny .     all over the place           capital .         um .     it occurred to johnny that people doing quite a lot of the more recent revolutions had said they were overthrowing communist oppressors  but william stickers looked so eager  he didn   t quite know how to say this .     tell you what   can you read a newspaper if i bring you one .         of course .  but it   s hard to turn the pages .         um .  are there a lot of you in here .         hah .  most of them don   t bother .  they just aren   t prepared to make the effort .         can you   you know   walk around .  you could get into things for free .      william stickers looked slightly panicky .      it   s hard to go far     he mumbled .     it   s not really allowed .         i read in a book once that ghosts can   t move much     said johnny .      ghost .  i   m just   dead .     he waved a transparent finger in the air .     hah .  but they   re not getting me that way     he snapped .     just because it turns out that i   m still   here after i   m dead  doesn   t mean i   m prepared to believe in the whole stupid nonsense  you know .  oh  no .  logical  rational thought  boy .  and don   t forget the newspaper .      william stickers faded away a bit at a time .  the last thing to go was the finger  still demonstrating its total disbelief in life after death .   johnny waited around a bit  but no other dead people seemed to be ready to make an appearance .   he felt he was being watched in some way that had nothing to do with eyes .  it wasn   t exactly creepy  but it was uncomfortable .  you didn   t dare scratch your bottom or pick your nose .   for the first time  he really began to notice the cemetery .  it had a leftover look  really .   behind it there was the canal  which wasn   t used anymore  except as a rubbish dump  old prams and busted televisions and erupting settees lined its banks like monsters from the garbage age .  then on one side there was the crematorium and its garden of remembrance  which was all right in a gravel pathed  keep off the grass sort of way .  in front was cemetery road  which had once had houses on the other side of it  now there was the back wall of the bonanza carpet  save            .  .   warehouse .  there was still an old phone booth and a letter box  which suggested that once upon a time this had been a place that people thought of as home .  but now it was just a road you cut through to get to the bypass from the industrial estate .   on the fourth side was nothing much except a waste land of fallen brick and one tall chimney   all that remained of the blackbury rubber boot company .      if it   s a boot  it   s a blackbury    had been one of the most famously stupid slogans in the world .    johnny vaguely remembered there   d been some thing in the papers .  people had been protesting about something   but then  they always were .  there was always so much news going on  you never had time to find out anything important .   he walked round to the old factory site .  bulldozers were parked around it now  although they were all empty .  there was a wire fence that had been broken down here and there despite the notices about guard dogs on patrol .  perhaps the guard dogs had broken out .   and there was a big sign  showing the office building that was going to be built on the site .  it was beautiful .  there were fountains in front of it  and quite old trees carefully placed here and there  and neat people standing chatting outside it .  and the sky above it was a glorious blue  which was pretty unusual for blackbury  where most of the time the sky was that odd  soapy color you   d get if you lived in a tupperware box .   johnny stared at it for some time  while the rain fell in the real world and the blue sky glittered on the sign .   it was pretty obvious that the building was going to take up more room than the site of the old boot factory .   the words above the picture said     an exciting development for united amalgamated consolidated holdings  forward to the future .      johnny didn   t feel very excited  but he did feel that    forward to the future    was even dumber than    if it   s a boot  it   s a blackbury .          before school the next day he swiped the newspaper and tucked it out of sight behind william stickers   s grave .   he felt more silly than afraid .  he wished he could talk to someone about it .   he didn   t have anyone to talk to .  but he did have three people to talk with .   there were various gangs and alliances in the school  such as the sporty group  and the bright kids  and the computer club nerds .   and then there was johnny  and wobbler  and bigmac  who said he was the last of the well hard skin heads but was actually a skinny kid with short hair and flat feet and asthma who had difficulty even walking in doc martens  and there was yo less  who was technically black .   but at least they listened  during break  on the bit of wall between the school kitchen and the library .  it was where they normally hung out   or at least  hung around .      ghosts     said yo less  when he   d finished .      no oo     said johnny uncertainly .     they don   t like being called ghosts .  it upsets them  for some reason .  they   re just   dead .  i suppose it   s like not calling people handicapped or backward .         politically incorrect     said yo less .     i read about that .         you mean they want to be called      wobbler paused for thought      post senior citizens .         breathily challenged     said yo less .      vertically disadvantaged     said wobbler .      what .  you mean they   re short .     said yo less .      buried     said wobbler .      how about zombies .     said bigmac .      no  you   ve got to have a body to be a zombie     said yo less .     you   re not really dead  you just get fed this secret voodoo mixture of fish and roots and you turn into a zombie .         wow .  what mixture .         i don   t know .  how should i know .  just some kind of fish and some kind of root .         i bet it   s a real adventure getting fish and chips in voodoo country     said wobbler .      well  you ought to know about voodoo     said bigmac .      why .     said yo less .         cause you   re west indian  right .         do you know all about druids .         no .         there you are  then .         i    spect your mum knows about it  though     said bigmac .      shouldn   t think so .  my mum spends more time in church than the pope     said yo less .     my mum spends more time in church than god .         you   re not taking this seriously     said johnny severely .     i really saw them .         it might be something wrong with your eyes     said yo less .     perhaps there   s a           i saw this old film once  about a man with x ray eyes     said bigmac .     he could use    em to see right through things .         women   s clothes and stuff .     enquired wobbler .      there wasn   t much of that     said bigmac .   they discussed this waste of a useful talent .      i don   t see through anything     said johnny eventually .     i just see people who aren   t ther   i mean  people other people don   t see .         my uncle used to see things other people couldn   t see     said wobbler .     especially on a saturday night .         don   t be stupid .  i   m trying to be serious .         yeah  but once you said you   d seen a loch ness monster in your goldfish pond     said bigmac .      all right  but           probably just a plesiosaur     said yo less .     just some old dinosaur that ought to   ve been extinct seventy million years ago .  nothing special at all .         yes  but           and then there was the lost city of the incas     said wobbler .      well  i found it  didn   t i .         yes  but it wasn   t that lost     said yo less .     behind tesco   s isn   t exactly lost .      bigmac sighed .      you   re all weird     he said .      all right     said johnny .     you all come down there after school  right .         well       wobbler began  and shifted uneasily .      not scared  are you .     said johnny .  he knew that was unfair  but he was annoyed .     you ran away before     he said     when the alderman came out .         i never saw no alderman     said wobbler .     anyway  i wasn   t scared .  i ran away to get a rise out of you .         you certainly had me fooled     said johnny .      me .  scared .  i watched night of the killer zombies three times   with freeze frame     said wobbler .      all right  then .  you come .  all three of you come .  after school .         after cobbers     said bigmac .      look  this is a lot more important than           yes  but today janine is going to tell mick that doraleen took ron   s surfboard        johnny hesitated .      all right  then     he said .     after cobbers .         and then i promised to help my brother load up his van     said bigmac .     well  not exactly promised   he said he   d rip my arms off if i didn   t .         and i   ve got to do some geography homework     said yo less .      we haven   t got any     said johnny .      no  but i thought if i did an extra essay on rainforests  i could pull up my grade average     said yo less .   there was nothing odd about this  if you were used to yo less .  yo less wore the school uniform .  except that it wasn   t really the school uniform .  well  all right  technically it was the school uniform  because everyone got these bits of paper at the start of every year saying what the school uniform was  but no one ever wore it much  except for yo less  and so if hardly anyone else was wearing it  wobbler said  how could it be a uniform .  whereas  said wobbler  since at any one time nearly everyone was wearing jeans and a t shirt  then really jeans and a t shirt were the real school uniform and yo less should be sent home for not wearing it .      tell you what     said johnny .     let   s meet up later  then .  six o   clock .  we can meet at bigmac   s place .  that   s right near the cemetery  anyway .         but it   ll be getting dark     said wobbler .      well .     said johnny .     you   re not scared  are you .         me .  scared .  huh .  me .  scared .  me .  scared .          if you had to be somewhere frightening when it got dark  johnny thought  the joshua n   clement block rated a lot higher on the aaargh scale than any cemetery .  at least the dead didn   t mug you .   it was originally going to be the sir alec douglas home block  and then it became the harold wilson block  and then finally the new council named it the joshua che n   clement block after a famous freedom fighter  who then became president of his country  and who was now being an ex freedom fighter and ex president somewhere in switzerland while some of his countrymen tried to find him and ask him questions like  what happened to the two hundred million dollars we thought we had  and how come your wife owned seven hundred hats .   the block had been described in      as    an overwhelming and dynamic relationship of voids and solids  majestic in its uncompromising simplicity .      often the blackbury guardian had pictures of people complaining about the damp  or the cold  or the way the windows fell out in high winds  it was always windy around the block  even on a calm day everywhere else   or the way gangs roamed its dank passageways and pushed shopping carts off the roof into the great lost shopping cart graveyard .  the elevators hadn   t worked properly since      .  they lurked in the basement  too scared to go anywhere else .   the passages and walkways     an excitingly brutal brushed concrete finish     had two smells  depending on whether or not the council   s ninja caretaker had been around in his van .  the other one was disinfectant .   no one liked the joshua n   clement block .  there were two schools of thought about what should be done with it .  the people who lived there thought everyone should be taken out and then the block should be blown up  and the people who lived near the block just wanted it blown up .   the odd thing was that although the block was cramped and fourteen stories high  it had been built in the middle of a huge area of what was theoretically grass     environmental open space      but which was now the home of the common potato chip packet and hardy perennial burned out car .      horrible place     said wobbler .      people   ve got to live somewhere     said yo less .      reckon the man who designed it lives here .     said johnny .      shouldn   t think so .         i   m not going too near bigmac   s brother     said wobbler .     he   s a nutter .  he   s got tattoos and everything .  and everyone knows he steals stuff .  videos and things .  out of factories .  and he killed bigmac   s hamster when he was little .  and he chucks his stuff out of the window when he   s angry .  and if clint   s been let out        clint was bigmac   s brother   s dog  which had reputedly been banned from the rottweiler pit bull terrier crossbreed club for being too nasty .      poor old bigmac     said johnny .     no wonder he   s always sending off for martial arts stuff .         i reckon he wants to join the army so   s he can bring his gun home one weekend     said yo less .   wobbler looked up apprehensively at the huge towering bulk of the block .      huh .  bringing his tank home   d be more like it     he said .   bigmac   s brother   s van was parked in what had been designed as the washing drying area .  both of the doors and the front fender were different colors .  clint was in the front seat  chained to the steering wheel .  the van was the one vehicle that could be left unlocked anywhere near joshua n   clement .      weird  really     said johnny .     when you think about it  i mean .         what is .     said yo less .      well  there   s a huge cemetery for dead people  and all the living people are crammed up in that thing     said johnny .     i mean  it sounds like someone got something wrong        bigmac emerged from the block  carrying a stack of cardboard boxes .  he nodded hopelessly at johnny  and put the boxes in the back of the van .      yo  duds     he said .      where   s your brother .         he   s upstairs .  come on  let   s go .         before he comes down  you mean     said wobbler .      shut up .          the breeze moved in the poplar trees  and whispered around the antique urns and broken stones .      i don   t know as this is right     said wobbler  when the four of them had gathered by the gate .      there   s crosses all over the place     said yo less .      yes  but i   m an atheist     said wobbler .      then you shouldn   t believe in ghosts           post living citizens     bigmac corrected him .      bigmac .     said johnny .      yeah .         what   re you holding behind your back .         nothing .      wobbler craned to see .      it   s a bit of sharpened wood     he reported .     and a hammer .         bigmac .         well  you never know           leave them here .         oh  all right .         anyway  it   s not stakes for ghosts .  that   s for vampires     said yo less .      oh  thank you     said wobbler .      look  this is just the cemetery     said johnny .     it   s got bylaws and things .  it   s not transylvania .  there   s just dead people here .  that doesn   t make it scary  does it .  dead people are people who were living once .  you wouldn   t be so worked up if there were living people buried here  would you .      they set off along north drive .   it was amazing how sounds died away in the cemetery .  there was only a set of overgrown iron railings and some unpruned trees between them and the road  but noises were suddenly cut right down  as if they were being heard through a blanket .  instead  silence seemed to pour in   pour up  johnny thought   like breathable water .  it hissed .  in the cemetery  silence made a noise .   the gravel crunched underfoot .  some of the more recent graves had a raised area in front of them that someone had thought would be a good idea to cover with little green stones .  now  tiny rockery plants were flourishing .   a crow cawed in one of the trees  unless it was a rook .  it didn   t really break the silence .  it just underlined it .      peaceful  isn   t it     said yo less .      quiet as the grave     said bigmac .     ha  ha .         a lot of people come for walks here     said johnny .     i mean  the park   s miles away  and all there is there is grass .  but this place has got tons of bushes and plants and trees and  and           environment     said yo less .      and probably some ecology as well     said johnny .      hey  look at this grave     said wobbler .   they looked .  it had a huge raised archway made of carved black marble  and a lot of angels wound around it  and a madonna  and a faded photograph in a little glass window under the name  antonio vicenti               .  it looked like a kind of rolls royce of a grave .      yeah .  dead impressive     said bigmac .      why bother with such a big stone arch .     said yo less .      it   s just showing off     said yo less .     there   s probably a sticker on the back saying    my other grave is a porch .            yo less .     said johnny .      actually  i think that was very funny     said mr .  vicenti .     he is a very funny boy .      johnny turned  very slowly .   there was a man in black clothes leaning on the grave .  he had neat black hair  plastered down  and a carnation in his buttonhole  and a slightly gray look  as if the light wasn   t quite right .      oh     said johnny .     hello .         and what is the joke  exactly .     said mr .  vicenti  in a solemn voice .  he stood very politely with his hands clasped in front of him  like an old fashioned shop assistant .      well  you can get these stickers for cars  you see  and they say    my other car is a porsche        said johnny .     it   s not a very good joke     he added quickly .      a porsche is a kind of car .     said dead mr .  vicenti .      yes .  sorry .  i didn   t think he should joke about things like that .         back in the old country i used to do magical entertainment for kiddies     said mr .  vicenti .     with doves and similar items .  on saturdays .  at parties .  the great vicenti and ethel .  i like to laugh .         the old country .     said johnny .      the alive country .      the three boys were watching johnny carefully .      you don   t fool us     said wobbler .     there   s   there   s no one there .         and i did escapology  too     said mr .  vicenti  absentmindedly pulling an egg from yo less   s ear .      you   re just talking to the air     said yo less .      escapology .     said johnny .  here we go again  he thought .  the dead always want to talk about themselves    .      what .     said bigmac .      escaping from things .     mr .  vicenti cracked the egg .  the ghost of a dove flew away  and vanished as it reached the trees .     sacks and chains and handcuffs and so on .  like the great houdini .  only in a semiprofessional way  of course .  my greatest trick involved getting out of a locked sack underwater while wearing twenty feet of chain and three pairs of handcuffs .         gosh  how often did you do that .     said johnny .      nearly once     said mr .  vicenti .      come on     said wobbler .     joke   s over .  no one   s taken in .  come on .  time   s getting on .         shut up   this is interesting     said johnny .   he was aware of a rustling noise around him  like someone walking very slowly through dead leaves .      and you   re john maxwell     said mr .  vicenti .     the alderman told us about you .         us .      the rustling grew louder .   johnny turned .      he   s not joking     said yo less .     look at his face .      i mustn   t be frightened  johnny told himself .   i mustn   t be frightened .   why should i be frightened .  these are just   post life citizens .  a few years ago they were mowing lawns and putting up christmas decorations and being grandparents and things .  they   re nothing to be frightened of .   the sun was well behind the poplar trees .  there was a bit of mist on the ground .   and walking slowly toward him  through its coils  were the dead .       three     there was the alderman  and william stickers  and an old woman in a long dress and a hat covered in fruit  and some small children running on ahead  and dozens  hundreds of others .  they didn   t lurch .  they didn   t ooze any green .  they just looked gray  and very slightly out of focus .   you notice things when you   re terrified .  little details grow bigger .   he realized there were differences among the dead .  mr .  vicenti had looked almost   well  alive .  william stickers was slightly more colorless .  the alderman was definitely transparent around the edges .  but many of the others  in victorian clothes and odd assortments of coats and breeches from earlier ages  were almost completely without color and almost without substance  so they were little more than shaped air  but air that walked .   it wasn   t that they had faded .  it was just that they were farther away  in some strange direction that had nothing much to do with the normal three .   wobbler and the other two were still staring at him .      johnny .  you all right .     said wobbler .   johnny remembered a piece about overpopulation in a school geography book .  for everyone who was alive today  it said  there were twenty historical people  all the way back to when people had only just become people .   or  to put it another way  behind every living person were twenty dead ones .   quite a lot of them were behind wobbler .  johnny didn   t feel it would be a good idea to point this out  though .      it   s gone all cold     said bigmac .      we ought to be getting back     said wobbler  his voice shaking .     i ought to be doing my homework .      which showed he was frightened .  it   d take zombies to make wobbler prefer to do homework .      you can   t see them  can you .     said johnny .     they   re all around us  but you can   t see them .         the living can   t generally see the dead     said mr .  vicenti .     it   s for their own good  i expect .      the three boys had drawn closer together .      come on  stop mucking about     said bigmac .      huh     said wobbler .     he   s just trying to spook us .  huh .  like dead man   s hand at parties .  huh .  well  it   s not working .  i   m off home .  come on  you lot .      he turned and walked a few steps .      hang on     said yo less .     there   s something odd        he looked around at the empty cemetery .  the rook had flown away  unless it was a crow .      something odd     he mumbled .      look     said johnny .     they   re here .  they   re all around us .         i   ll tell my mum on you .     said wobbler .     this is practicing bein    satanic again .         john maxwell .     boomed the alderman .     we must talk to you .         that   s right .     shouted william stickers .     this is important .         what about .     said johnny .  he was balancing on his fear  and he felt oddly calm .  the funny thing was  when you were on top of your fear  you were a little bit taller .      this .     said william stickers  waving the newspaper .   wobbler gasped .  there was a rolled up newspaper floating in the air .      poltergeist activity .     he said .  he waved a shaking finger at johnny .     you get that around adolescents .  i read something in a magazine .  saucepans flying through the air and stuff .  his head   ll spin around in a minute .         what is the fat boy talking about .     said the alderman .      and what is dead man   s hand .     said mr .  vicenti .      there   s probably a scientific explanation     said yo less  as the newspaper fluttered through the air .      what .     said bigmac .      i   m trying to think of one .         it   s holding itself open .      william stickers opened the paper .      it   s probably just a freak wind .     said yo less  backing away .      i can   t feel any wind .         that   s why it   s freaky .         what are you going to do about this .     the alderman demanded .      excuse me  but this dead man   s hand .  what is it .         will everyone shut up .     said johnny .   even the dead obeyed .      right     he said  settling down a bit .     um .  look  um  you lot  these   people   want to talk to us .  me  anyway        yo less  wobbler  and bigmac were staring intently at the newspaper .  it hung  motionless  more than three feet above the ground .      are they   the breath impaired .     asked wobbler .      don   t be an idiot .  that sounds like asthma     said yo less .     come on .  if you mean it  say it .  come right out with it .  are they       he looked around at the darkening landscape  and hesitated .     er   post senior citizens .         are they lurching .     asked wobbler .  now he and the other two were so close that they looked like one very wide person with six legs .      you didn   t tell us about this     said the alderman .      this what .     said johnny .      in the newspaper .  well  it is called a newspaper .  but it has pictures of women in the altogether .  which may well be seen by respectable married women and young children .      william stickers was  with great effort  holding the paper open at the entertainment section .  johnny craned to read it .  there was a rather poor photo of a couple of girls at blackbury swimming pool and leisure center .      they   ve got swimsuits on     he said .      swimsuits .  but i can see almost all of their legs .     the alderman roared .      nothing wrong with that at all     snapped the elderly woman in the huge fruity hat .     healthy bodies enjoying calisthenics in the god given sunlight .  and very practical clothing  i may say .         practical  madam .  i dread to think for what .      mr .  vicenti leaned toward johnny .      the lady in the hat is mrs .  sylvia liberty     he whispered .     died nineteen fourteen .  tireless suffragette .         suffragette .     said johnny .      don   t they teach you that sort of thing now .  they campaigned for votes for women .  they used to chain themselves to railings and chuck eggs at policemen and throw themselves under the prince of wales   s horse on derby days .         wow .         but mrs .  liberty got the instructions wrong and threw herself under the prince of wales .         what .         killed outright     said mr .  vicenti .  he clicked his disapproval .     he was a very heavy man  i believe .         when you two have ceased this bourgeois arguing     shouted william stickers     perhaps we can get back to important matters .     he rustled the paper .  wobbler blinked .      it says in this newspaper     said william stickers     that the cemetery is going to be closed .  going to be built on .  do you know about it .         um .  yes .  yes .  um .  didn   t you know .         was anyone supposed to tell us .         what   re they saying .     said bigmac .      they   re annoyed about the cemetery being sold .  there   s a story in the paper .         hurry up .     said william stickers .     i can   t hold it much longer    .      the newspaper sagged .  then it fell through his hands and landed on the path .      not as alive as i was     he said .      definitely a freak whirlwind     said yo less .     i   ve heard about them .  nothing supernat           this is our home     boomed the alderman .     what will happen to us  young man .         just a minute     said johnny .     hold on .  yo less .         yes .         they want to know what happens to people in graveyards if they get built on .         the   dead want to know that .         yes     said the alderman and johnny at the same time .      i bet michael jackson didn   t do this     said bigmac .     he           i saw this film     gabbled wobbler     where these houses were built on an old graveyard and someone dug a swimming pool and all these skeletons came out and tried to strangle people           why .     said the alderman .      he wants to know why     said johnny .      search me     said wobbler .      i think     said yo less uncertainly     that the   coffins  and all that  get dug up and put somewhere else .  i think there   s special places .         i   m not standing for that .     said dead mrs .  sylvia liberty .     i paid five pounds  seven shillings  and sixpence for my plot .  i remember the document distinctly .  last resting place  it said .  it didn   t say after eighty years you   ll be dug up and moved just so the living can build   what did it say .         modern purpose designed offices     said william stickers .     whatever they are .         i think it means they were designed on purpose     said johnny .      and how shameful to be sold for fivepence .     said dead mrs .  liberty .      that   s the living for you     said william stickers .     no thought for the downtrodden masses .         well  you see     said johnny wretchedly     the council says it costs too much to keep up and the land was worth           and what   s this here about blackbury municipal authority .     said the alderman .     what happened to blackbury city council .         i don   t know     said johnny .     i   ve never heard of it .  look  it   s not my fault .  i like this place  too .  i told wobbler i didn   t like what   s happening .         so what are you going to do about it .     asked the alderman .   johnny backed away but came up against mr .  vicenti   s rolls royce of a grave .      oh  no     he said .     not me .  it   s not up to me .         i don   t see why not     said dead mrs .  sylvia liberty .     after all  you can see and hear us .         no one else takes any notice     said mr .  vicenti .      we   ve been trying all day     said the alderman .      people walking their dogs .  hah .  they just hurry away     said william stickers .      not even old mrs .  tachyon     said mr .  vicenti .      and she   s mad     said the alderman .     poor soul .         so there   s only you     said william stickers .     so you must go and tell this municipal whateveritis that we aren   t   going   to   move .         they won   t listen to me .  i   m twelve .  i can   t even vote .         yes  but we can     said the alderman .      can we .     said mr .  vicenti .   the dead clustered around him  like an american football team .      we   re still over twenty one  aren   t we .  i mean  technically .         yes  but we   re dead     said mr .  vicenti  in a reasonable tone of voice .      you can vote at eighteen now     said johnny .      no wonder people have no respect     said the alderman .     i said the rot   d set in if they gave the vote to women        mrs .  liberty glared at him .      anyway  you can   t use a dead person   s vote     said william stickers .     it   s called personation .  i stood as revolutionary solidarity fraternal workers    party candidate .  i know about this sort of thing .         i   m not proposing to let anyone use my vote     said the alderman .     i want to use it myself .  no law against that .         good point .         i served this city faithfully for more than fifty years     said the alderman .     i do not see why i should lose my vote just because i   m dead .  democracy .  that   s the point .         people   s democracy     said william stickers .   the dead fell silent .      well       said johnny miserably .     i   ll see what i can do .         good man     said the alderman .     and we   d also like a paper delivered every day .         no  no .     mr .  vicenti shook his head .     it   s so hard to turn the pages .         well  we must know what is happening     said mrs .  liberty .     there   s no telling what the living are getting up to out there while our backs are turned .         i   ll   think of something     said johnny .     something better than newspapers .         right     said william stickers .     and then you get along to these council people and tell them           tell them we   re not going to take this lying down .     shouted the alderman .      yes  right     said johnny .   and the dead faded .  again there was the sensation of traveling  as if the dead people were going back into a different world    .      have they gone .     said wobbler .      not that they were here     said yo less  the scientific thinker .      they were here  and they   ve gone     said johnny .      it definitely felt a bit weird     said bigmac .     very cold .         let   s get out of here     said johnny .     i need to think .  they want me to stop this place being built on .         how .      johnny led the way quickly toward the gates .      huh .  they   ve left it up to me .         we   ll help     said yo less promptly .      will we .     said wobbler .     i mean  johnny   s okay  but   i mean   it   s meddlin    with the occult .  and your mum   ll go ballistic .         yes  but if it   s true  then it   s helping christian souls     said yo less .     that   s all right .  they are christian souls  aren   t they .         i think there   s a jewish part of the cemetery     said johnny .      that   s all right .  jewish is the same as christian     said bigmac .      not exactly     said yo less very carefully .     but similar .         yeah  but       said wobbler awkwardly .     i mean   dead people and that    .  i mean   he can see    em  so it   s up to him   i mean           we all supported bigmac when he was in juvenile court  didn   t we .     said yo less .      you said he was going to get hung     said wobbler .     and i spent all morning doing that    free the blackbury one    poster .         it was a political crime     said bigmac .      you stole the minister of education   s car when he was opening the school     said yo less .      it wasn   t stealing .  i meant to give it back     said bigmac .      you drove it into a wall .  you couldn   t even give it back on a shovel .         oh  so it was my fault the brakes were faulty .  i could have got badly hurt  right .  i notice no one worried about that .  it was basically his fault  leaving cars around with crummy locks and bad brakes           i bet he doesn   t have to repair his own brakes .         it   s society   s fault  then           anyway     said yo less     we were behind you that time  right .         wouldn   t like to have been in front of him     said wobbler .      and we were right behind wobbler when he got into trouble for complaining to the record shop about the messages from god he heard when he played pat boone records backward           you said you heard it too     said wobbler .     hey  you said you heard it .         only after you told me what it was     said yo less .     before you told me what i was listening for  it just sounded like someone going ayip ayeep mwerpayeep .          they shouldn   t do that sort of thing on records     said wobbler defensively .     gettin    at impressionable minds .         the point i   m making     said yo less     is that you   ve got to help your friends  right .     he turned to johnny .     now  personally  i think you   re very nearly totally disturbed and suffering from psychosomatica and hearing voices and seeing delusions     he said     and probably ought to be locked up in one of those white jackets with the stylish long sleeves .  but that doesn   t matter     cause we   re friends .         i   m touched     said johnny .      probably     said wobbler     but we don   t care  do we  guys .          his mother was out  at her second job .  granddad was watching video whoopsy .      granddad .         yes .         how famous was william stickers .         very famous .  very famous man     said the old man  without looking around .      i can   t find him in the encyclopedia .         very famous man  was william stickers .  haha .  look  the man   s just fallen off his bicycle .  right into the bush .      johnny took down the volume l min and was silent for a few minutes .  granddad had a complete set of huge encyclopedias .  no one really knew why .  somewhere in      or something  granddad had said to himself    get educated     and had bought the massive books on the installment plan .  he   d never opened them .  he   d just built a bookcase for them .  granddad was superstitious about books .  he thought that if you had enough of them around  education leaked out  like radioactivity .      how about mrs .  sylvia liberty .         who   s she .         she was a suffragette  i think .  votes for women and things .         never heard of her .         she   s not in here under    liberty    or    suffragette .            never heard of her .  whoa  look here  the cat   s fallen in the pond .         all right   how about mr .  antonio vicenti .         what .  old tony vicenti .  what   s he up to now .         was he famous for anything .      for a moment  granddad   s eyes left the tv screen and focused on the past instead .      he ran a joke shop in alma street where the multistory parking garage is now .  you could buy stink bombs and itching powder .  and he used to do conjuring tricks at kids    parties when your mum was a girl .         was he a famous man .         all the kids knew him .  only children   s entertainer in these parts  see .  they all knew his tricks .  they used to shout out     it   s in your pocket .     and things like that .  alma street .  and paradise street  that was there  too .  and balaclava terrace .  that   s where i was born .  number twelve  balaclava terrace .  all under the garage now .  oh  dear   he   s going to fall off that building    .         so he wasn   t really famous .  not like really famous .         all the kids knew him .  prisoner of war in germany  he was .  but he escaped .  and he married   ethel plover  that   s right .  never had any kids .  used to do conjuring tricks and escaping from things .  always escaping from things  he was .         he wore a carnation pinned to his coat     said johnny .      that   s right .  every day .  never saw him without one .  always very smart  he was .  he used to be a conjuror .  haven   t seen him around for years .         granddad .         it   s all changed around here now .  i hardly see anywhere i recognize when i go into town these days .  someone told me they   ve pulled down the old boot factory .         you know that little transistor radio .     said johnny .      what little transistor radio .         the one you   ve got .         what about it .         you said it   s too fiddly and not loud enough .         that   s right .         can i have it .         i thought you   d got one of those ghettoblowers .         this is   for some friends .     johnny hesitated .  he was by nature an honest person  because apart from anything else  lying was always too complicated .      they   re quite old     he added .     and a bit shut in .         oh  all right .  you   ll have to put some new batteries in   the old ones have gone all wonky .         i   ve got some batteries .         you don   t get proper wireless anymore .  we used to get oscillation when i was a boy .  you never get it now .  hehe .  there he goes   look  right through the ice .          johnny went down to the cemetery before breakfast .  the gates had been locked  but since there were holes all along the walls  this didn   t make a lot of difference .   he   d bought a plastic bag for the radio and had sorted out some new batteries  after scraping out the chemical porridge that was all that was left of the old ones .   the cemetery was deserted .  there wasn   t a soul there  living or dead .  but there was the silence  the big empty silence .  if ears could make a noise  they   d sound like that silence .   johnny tried to fill it .      um     he said .     anyone there .      a fox leaped up from behind one of the stones and scurried away into the undergrowth .      hello .  it   s me .      the absence of the dead was scarier than seeing them in the flesh   or at least  not in the flesh .      i brought this radio .  it   s probably easier for you than newspapers .  um .  i looked up radio in the encyclopedia and most of you ought to know what it is .  um .  you twiddle the knobs and radio comes out .  um .  so i   ll just tuck it down behind mr .  vicenti   s slab  all right .  then you can find out what   s going on .      he coughed .      i   i did some thinking last night  and   and i thought maybe if people knew about all the   famous   people here  they   d be bound to leave it alone .  i know it   s not a very good idea     he said hopelessly     but it   s the best i could come up with .  i   m going to make a list of names .  if you don   t mind .      he   d hoped mr .  vicenti would be about .  he quite liked him .  perhaps it was because he hadn   t been dead as long as the others .  he seemed friendlier .  less stiff .   johnny walked from gravestone to gravestone  noting down names .  some of the older stones were quite ornate  with fat cherubs on them .  but one had a pair of football boots carved on it .  he made a special note of the name     stanley    wrong way    roundway               the last whistle    he nearly missed the one under the trees .  it had a flat stone in the grass  without even one of the ugly flower vases  and all it declared was that this was the last resting place of eric grimm               .  no    just resting     no    deeply missed     not even    died     although probably he had .  johnny wrote the name down  anyway .   mr .  grimm waited until after johnny had gone before he emerged and glared after him .       four     it was later that morning .   there was a new library in the civic center .  it was so new  it didn   t even have librarians .  it had assistant information officers .  and it had computers .  wobbler was banned from the computers because of an incident involving a library terminal  the telephone connection to the main computer  another telephone line to the computer at east slate air base ten miles away  another telephone line to a much bigger computer under a mountain somewhere in america  and almost world war three .   at least that   s what wobbler said .  the assistant information officers said it was because he got chocolate in the keyboard .   but he was allowed to use the microfiche readers .  they couldn   t think of a good reason to stop him .      what   re we looking for  anyway .     said bigmac .      nearly everyone who died here used to get buried in that cemetery     said johnny .     so if we can find someone famous who lived here  and then we can find them in the cemetery  then it   s a famous place .  there   s a cemetery in london with karl marx in it .  it   s famous for him being dead in it .         karl marx .     said bigmac .     what was he famous for .         you   re ignorant  you are     said wobbler .     he was the one who played the harp .         no  karl was the one who usedta talka lika dis     said yo less .      actually  he was the one with the cigar     said wobbler .      that   s a very old joke     said johnny severely .     the marx brothers .  ha  ha .  look  i   ve got the old newspaper files .  the blackbury guardian .  they go back nearly a hundred years .  all we   ve got to do is look at the front pages .  that   s where famous people   d be .         and the back pages     said bigmac .      why the back pages .         sports .  famous footballers and that .         yeah  right .  hadn   t thought of that .  all right  then .  let   s get started           yeah  but       said bigmac .      what .     said johnny .      so this karl marx  then     said bigmac .     what films was he in .      johnny sighed .     listen  he wasn   t in any films .  he was   he led the russian revolution .         no he didn   t     said wobbler .     he just wrote a book called  oh  something like it   s about time there was a revolution  and the russians just followed the instructions .  the actual leaders were a lot of people with names ending in ski .         like stalin     said yo less .      right .         stalin means man of steel     said yo less .     i read where he didn   t like his real name  so he changed it .  it   s man of steel in english .         what was his real name .         his secret identity  you mean     said yo less .      what are you talking about now .     said bigmac .      no  i get it .  man of steel .  yo less means he could leap kremlins in a single bound     said johnny .      don   t see why not     said wobbler .     i always thought it was unfair  the way the americans got superman .  they   ve got all the superheroes .  i don   t see why we couldn   t have had superman around here .      they thought about it .  wobbler then spoke for them all .     mind you     he said     around here he would have had trouble even being clark kent .      they disappeared under the hoods .      what did you say the alderman was called .     asked wobbler after a while .      alderman thomas bowler     said johnny .     why .         it says he got the council to build a memorial horse trough in the square in nineteen hundred and five     said wobbler .     it came in useful very quickly  too  it says here .         why .         well   it says here  the next day the first motorcar ever to arrive in blackbury crashed into it and caught fire .  they used the water to put the fire out .  says here the council praised alderman bowler for his forward thinking .      they looked at the microfilm viewer .      what   s a horse trough .     said bigmac .      it   s that big stone trough thing that   s outside loggitt and burnett   s building society     said johnny .     the one that   s been filled with soil for a tasteful display of dead flowers and beer cans .  they used to put water in those things for coach horses to drink out of .         but if cars were just coming in     said bigmac slowly     then building things for horses to drink out of was a bit           yes     said johnny .     i know .  come on .  let   s keep going .             wheeesssh   we built this city on   ssshshhh   on the phone right now   wheeesshhh   that was at number two   ssshwupwup   told a meeting in kiev   wsswssshsss   prime minister   shsss   today   shhssss   scaramouche  can you   shsssss     the tuning knob of the little radio behind mr .  vicenti   s grave turned back and forth very slowly  as if it was being moved with great effort .  occasionally it would stop on a program  then move again .      ssshhhwwwss   and the next caller   shhwwsss   babylon     and around it  for quite some distance  the air was cold .       in the library  the boys read on .  silence surrounded them .  the assistant information officers grew worried  and one of them went to find the cleaning fluid and the bent paper clip for getting chocolate out of keyboards .      let   s face it     said wobbler eventually     this is a town where famous people don   t come from .  it   s famous for it .         it says here     said yo less from his viewer     that addison vincent fletcher of alma terrace invented a form of telephone in nineteen twenty two .         oh  great     said wobbler .     telephones had been invented years before that .         it says he said this one was better .         oh  yes     said wobbler .  he dialed an imaginary number .     hello  is that   who invented the real telephone  anyone .         thomas edison     said yo less .      sir humphrey telephone     said bigmac .      alexander graham bell     said johnny .     sir humphrey telephone .         hello  mr .  bell     said wobbler  speaking into an imaginary mouthpiece .     you know that telephone you invented years ago .  well  mine   s better .  and i   m just off to discover america .  yes  i know christopher columbus discovered it first  but i   m discovering it better .         it makes sense     said bigmac .     if you   re going to discover somewhere  you might as well wait until there   s proper hotels and stuff .         when did columbus discover america  anyway .     said wobbler .      fourteen ninety two     said johnny .     there   s a rhyme  in fourteen hundred and ninety two  columbus sailed the ocean blue .      wobbler and bigmac looked at him .      actually  he could have got there in fourteen ninety one     said yo less  without looking up     but he had to sail around a bit because no one could think up a rhyme for    one .            it could have been sir humphrey telephone     said bigmac .     stuff gets named after inventors .         they didn   t name the telephone after bell     said wobbler .      they named the bell after bell  though     said bigmac .     telephone bells .  proves my point .         telephones haven   t had bells on for years     said wobbler .      that     said yo less     is due to the famous invention by fred buzzer .         i think it   s impossible for anyone famous to come from here     said wobbler     because everyone around here is insane .         got one     said bigmac  turning the microfiche knob .      who .  which one .         the footballer .  stanley    wrong way    roundway .  he played for the blackbury wanderers .  there   s his obituary here .  amost half a page .         any good .         says he scored a record number of goals .         sounds good     said wobbler .      own goals .         what .         greatest number of own goals in the history of any sport  it says .  it says he kept getting overexcited and losing his sense of direction .         oh .         but he was a good footballer  it says .  apart from that .  not exactly a hall of fame  though           here  look at this     said yo less .   they clustered around his viewer .  he   d found an ancient group photograph of about thirty soldiers  all beaming at the camera .      well .     said wobbler .      this is from nineteen sixteen     said yo less .     they   re all going off to war .         which one .     said wobbler .      the first one  you nerd .  world war one .         i always wondered why they numbered it     said bigmac .     like they expected to have a few more .  you know .  like buy two  get one free .         says here     yo less squinted      it   s the blackbury old pals battalion .  they   re just going off to fight .  they all joined up at the same time    .      johnny stared .  he could hear people   s voices  and the background noises of the library .  but the picture looked as if it was at the bottom of a dark  square tunnel .  and he was falling down it .   things outside the picture were inky and slow .  the picture was the center of the world .   johnny looked at the grinning faces  the terrible haircuts  the jug handle ears  the thumbs all up .   even today nearly everyone in the blackbury guardian had their photo taken with their thumb up  unless they   d won super bingo  in which case they were shown doing what the photographer thought was a high kick .  the newspaper   s one photographer was known as jeremy the thumb .   the people in the picture didn   t look much older than bigmac .  well  a couple of them did .  there was a sergeant with a mustache like a scrubbing brush  and an officer in jodhpurs  but the rest of them looked like a school photo .   and now he was coming back from wherever he   d been .  the picture dropped away again  became just an oblong on a page on a screen .  he blinked .   there was a feeling  like        like on an airplane when it   s about to land  and his ears went    pop .     but it was happening with his brain  instead .      anyone know what the somme is .     said yo less .      no .         that   s where they went  anyway .  some place in france .         any of them win any medals .     said johnny  struggling back into the real world .     that   d be famous .  if there   s someone in the cemetery with a lot of medals .      yo less spun the wheels of the viewer .      i   ll look ahead a few issues     he said .     there   s bound to be something if   hey   look at this    .      they all tried to get under the hood at once .  silence came back as they realized what he   d found .   i knew it was important  johnny thought .  what   s happening to me .      wow     said wobbler .     i mean   all those names   everyone killed in this big battle        without saying anything  johnny ducked into the other reader and wound it backward until he found the cheery photograph .      are they listed in alphabetical order .     he said .      yes     said yo less .      i   ll read out the names under the photo  then .  um   armitage  k   atkins  t           yes   no       said yo less .      sergeant atterbury  f           yes .         hey  there   s three from canal street     said wobbler .     that   s where my gran lives .         blazer   constantine   fraser   frobisher           yes   yes   yes   yes        they went on to the end of the caption .      they all died     said johnny eventually .     four weeks after the picture was taken .  all of them .         except for atkins  t .      said yo less .     it says here what a pals    battalion was .  it says people all from one town or even one street could all join the army together if they wanted  and all get sent to   the same place .         i wonder if they all got there .     said yo less .     eventually     he added .      that   s dreadful     said bigmac .      it probably sounded like a good idea at the time .  sort of   jolly .         yes  but   four weeks       said bigmac .     i mean           you   re always saying you can   t wait to join the army     said wobbler .     you said you were sorry the gulf war was over .  and all the legs of your bed are off the ground because of all them copies of guns and ammo underneath it .         well   yeah   war  yeah     said bigmac .     proper fighting  with m  s and stuff .  not just all going off grinning and getting shot .         they all marched off together because they were friends  and got killed     said yo less .   they stared at the little square of light with the names on it  and the long  long line of cheery thumbs .      except for atkins  t .      said johnny .     i wonder what happened to him .         it was nineteen sixteen     said yo less .     if he   s still alive  he   ll be dead .         any of them on your list .     asked wobbler .   johnny checked .      no oo     he said  eventually .     there   s one or two people with the same name but the wrong initial .  everyone around here used to get buried up there .         perhaps he came back from the war and moved away somewhere else     said yo less .      it   d be a bit lonely around here  after all     said bigmac .   they looked at him .      sorry     he said .      i   m fed up with this     said wobbler  pushing his chair back .     it   s not real .  there   s no one special in there .     it   s just people .  and it   s creepy .  come on   let   s go down to the mall .         i   ve found out what happens to dead bodies when old graveyards are built on     said yo less  as they stepped out into the tupperware daylight .     my mum knows .  they get taken to some kind of storage place called a necropolis .  that   s latin for city of the dead .         yuck     said wobbler .      sounds like where superman lives     said bigmac .     necropolis .     said wobbler  zooming his hands through the air .     by day  mild mannered corpse   by night   duh duh duhduh dah   zombieman .      johnny remembered the grinning young faces  not much older than wobbler .      wobbler     he said     if you make another joke like that           what .            well   just don   t .  right .  i mean it .             ssshhhh   mean  yo  youknowhati   msayin    .    sipsipsip   told the government that   sswwwsss   fact the whales enjoy being hunted  bob  and   whh   wwwhhhhh     click .      so that   s wireless telegraphy  is it .  hah .  so much for countess alice radioni .         i was an ovalteenie when i was a little boy .  that was during the war .  the one against the germans .  did i ever tell you .  we used to sing along with the people on the wireless     we are the ov       what .  who was countess alice radioni .         which war against the germans .         what .  how many have we had .         two so far .         now  come on .  radioni .  it was marconi who invented the radio .         hah .  and do you know who he stole the idea from .         who cares who invented the wretched thing .  will you listen to what the living are doing .         plotting to steal our cemetery  that is what they are doing .         yes  but   i didn   t know that all this was going on  did you .  all this music and   the things they were talking about .  who is shakespeare   s sister and why is she singing on the wireless .  what is a batman .  and they said the last prime minister was a woman .  that can   t be possible .  women can   t even vote .         yes  they can .         hurrah .         well  they couldn   t in my time .         there   s so much we don   t know .         so why don   t we find out .      the dead fell silent   or rather  more silent than usual .      how .         the man on the wireless said you can ring the wireless station on the telephone to discuss problems that affect us all today .  a phone ing program  he said .         well .         there   s a phone booth out in the street .         yes  but   that   s   outside           not far outside .         yes  but           the little boy stood in front of us and talked to us .  and he was so frightened .  and we can   t walk six feet .      the speaker was mr .  vicenti .  he looked through the crumbling railings to the street outside with the eye of a man who   d spent much of his life escaping .      but this is our place .  this is where we belong .         it   s only a few steps    .          it wasn   t really much of a mall .  but it was all there was to hang out in .   johnny had seen films of american shopping malls .  they must have different sorts of people in america  he   d thought .  they all looked cool  all the girls were beautiful  and the place wasn   t crowded with little kamikaze grandmothers .  or mothers with seven children .  or blackbury united football fans walking ten abreast singing the famous football song     urrrurrruh .      clap clapclap  .  you couldn   t hang out properly in a place like that .  all you could do was hang on .   the four of them hung on in the burger bar .  yo less carefully read the pamphlet about how no rainforests were chopped down to make beefburgers .  bigmac had his favorite megajumbo fries with fifteen packets of relish .      wonder if i could get a job here     said wobbler .      no chance     said bigmac .     the manager   d take one look at you and see where the profits would go .         you saying i   m fat .     said wobbler .      gravitationally challenged     said yo less  without looking up .      enhanced     said bigmac .   wobbler   s lips moved as he tried these out .     i   d rather be fat     he said .     can i finish up your onion rings .         anyway  there   s loads of people who want jobs here     said bigmac .     you have to have a degree .         what  just to make burgers .         no other jobs around     said bigmac .     they   re shutting all the factories around here .  nothing to do .  no one   s making anything anymore .         someone   s making something     said wobbler .     what about all the stuff in the shops .         that   s all made in taiwanaland or somewhere .  hah .  what sort of future are we going to have  eh .  that   s right  eh .  johnny .         what .         you   ve just been staring at nothing the whole time  you know that .         yeah  what   s happened .     said wobbler .     some dead people come in for takeout .         no     said johnny .      what   re you thinking about  then .         thumbs     said johnny  still staring at the wall .      what .         what .     said johnny  waking up .      what about thumbs .         oh   nothing .         my mother said last night that there   s a lot of people angry about the cemetery being sold     said yo less .     everyone   s moaning about it .  and pastor william says anyone who builds on there will be cursed unto the seventh generation .         yes  but he always says that kind of thing     said wobbler .     anyway  united amalgamated consolidated holdings probably don   t worry about that sort of thing .  they   ve probably got a vice president in charge of being cursed .         and he probably gets his secretary to deal with it     said bigmac .      it won   t stop anything  anyway     said yo less .     there   s bulldozers just the other side of the fence .         anyone know what does united amalgamated consolidated holdings do .     said wobbler .      it said in the paper that they   re a multinational information retrieval and enhancement facility     said yo less .     it said on the news it   ll provide three hundred jobs .         for all the people who used to work at the old rubber boot factory .     said bigmac .   yo less shrugged .     that   s how it goes     he said .     you all right  johnny .         what .         you okay .  you   re staring at the wall .         what .  oh .  yeah .  i   m okay .         he   s upset about the dead soldiers     said wobbler .   yo less leaned across the table .      look   that   s all in the past  right .  it   s just gone .  it   s a shame they died but   well   they   d be dead anyway  wouldn   t they .  it   s just history .  it has nothing to do with   well  with now .          mrs .  ivy witherslade was talking to her sister in the phone booth on cemetery road when someone knocked impatiently on the glass  and that was odd  because there was no one there .  but she felt very cold and suddenly uneasy  as though she was walking on someone   s grave .  she stopped telling her sister about her legs and what the doctor said about them  and went home quickly .   if johnny had been there  he would have heard what happened next .  but he wasn   t  so everyone else would have just heard the wind  and perhaps  just perhaps  the faintest of arguments      you should know  mr .  fletcher .  you invented it .         actually  that was alexander graham bell  mrs .  liberty .  i just improved upon it .         well   make it work .  let me speak to the man on the wireless machine .         was it really alexander graham bell .         yes  alderman .         i thought it was sir humphrey telephone .      the telephone stayed on its hook  but there were a few electric crackles and pops from somewhere in the machinery .      i think i have mastered the intricacies  mrs .  liberty           let me do the talking .  the people   s voice must be heard .      frost was forming on the inside of the telephone booth .      certainly not .  you are a bolshevik .         what did sir humphrey telephone invent  then .         mr .  fletcher .  be so good as to expedite the electric communication .          when there wasn   t the burger bar to hang out in  and when they weren   t allowed in j  j software because of whatever wobbler   s latest crime was  there was only the fountain area with the sad  dying trees in it or the groovy sounds record store  which was pretty much like any record store would be if it was called groovy sounds .   anyway  yo less wanted to buy a tape for his collection .      famous british brass bands     said wobbler  looking over his shoulder .      yes  but this is a good one     said yo less .     it   s got the old blackbury rubber boot factory band playing    the floral dance .     very famous piece .         you   re just basically not black  are you .     said wobbler .     i   m going to report you to the rastafarians .         you like reggae and blues     said yo less .      that   s different .      johnny listlessly shuffled through the tapes .   and froze .   there was a voice he recognized .  it was crackly with static  but it sounded a lot like mrs .  sylvia liberty  and it was coming over the radio .   the radio was on the counter  tuned to wonderful radio blackbury   s mike mikes radio show  which was as excellent and totally bodacious as two hours of phone ins and traffic reports from the blackbury bypass could be .   this time it was different .  the phone in had been about the council   s proposal to knock down the old fish market  which was going to happen no matter what anyone said  but it was a good subject for people to moan about .      well  what i say is hello .  hello .  this is mrs .  sylvia liberty speaking on the electric telephone .  hello .  not to be allowed  er  in my opinion  er  it is totally hello .   click   fizz   crackle  i demand to be heard this instant .  the fish market is of no importance whatsoever .  er   er   and        in his little studio on top of the blackbury and slate insurance society  mike mikes stared at his engineer  who stared at his switchboard .  there was no way of cutting off the intrusive voice .  it was coming in on all telephone lines at once .      er  hi     he said .     the caller on   er   all the lines           here  someone   s you listen to me  young man .  and don   t cut me off to start playing any more of your phonograph cylinders .  crossed line here  mike  i do you realize that innocent citizens are being evicted  click   garble   whirr   fizz  many years of valued service to the community  wheeeowwwwwh   crackle  merely because of an accident of birth  fizzle   whipwhip whip   crackle  you listen to young johnn  snap   fizz     the people   s shroud is deepest black  wheeeyooowwww   pop  we   re coming back   stop that this minute  william  you are nothing but a bolshevik agit        but no one heard the rest of the sentence because the engineer had pulled all the plugs and hit the switchboard with a hammer .   johnny and his friends had gathered around the radio .      you get some real loonies on these phone ins     said wobbler .     you ever listen to mad jim   s late night explosion .         he   s not mad     said yo less .     he just says he is .  and all he does is play old records and go    yeah .     and    yowzahyowzah .     a lot .  that   s not mad .  that   s just pathetic .         yes     said wobbler .      yes     said bigmac .      yes     said yo less .   they all looked at johnny .  they all looked like people with something on their minds .      ahem     said wobbler .      er     said bigmac .      that was them  was it .     said yo less .      yes     said johnny .     it was them .         it didn   t sound like normal radio .  how can they use the phone .         i don   t know .  i suppose some of them knew how to use the phone when they were alive .  and maybe being dead   s a bit like   electricity or something .         they nearly said your name     said wobbler .      yes .         who was that one singing .         i think it was william stickers .  he   s a bit of a communist .         i didn   t think there were any communists left these days     said yo less .      there aren   t .  and he   s one of them .         you know  any minute now rod serling is going to come walking in here with a big book     said bigmac .     you know .  like in the twilight zone .         how come they know what   s on the radio .     said yo less .      i lent them granddad   s transistor .         you know what i think .     said yo less .     i think you   ve started something .         that   s what i think  too .         nah .     said wobbler .     come on .  voices on the radio .  i mean .  that   s just mucking about .  could be anything .  kids ringing up and messing about .  oh  come on .  ghosts don   t phone up radio stations .         i saw this film once where they came out of the telephone     said bigmac  winner of the all blackbury mr .  tactful championship .      just you shut up .  i don   t believe you .          it was very  very chilly inside the phone box .      i must say  electricity is very easy to master when you   re dead .         what are you doing  mr .  fletcher .         very easy indeed .  who shall we talk to next .         we must speak to the town hall .         but it is a saturday  mrs .  liberty .  there will be no one there .         then try to find young johnny .  i don   t know what he means about trying to find famous people buried in the cemetery .  we   re here  after all .         i   ll keep trying .  it   s amazingly easy to understand .         where   s mr .  stickers gone .         he   s trying to listen to radio moscow  whatever that is .  on the wireless telegraphy apparatus .         i say  this is rather invigorating  you know .  i   ve never been out of the cemetery before .         yes .  it   s a new lease on life .         you can escape from almost anything     said mr .  vicenti .   there was a faint cough .  they looked around .  mr .  grimm was watching them through the railings .   the dead seemed to sober up .  they always became more serious in front of mr .  grimm .   they shuffled their spectral feet .      you   re outside     said mr .  grimm .     you know that   s wrong .         only a little way  eric     said the alderman .     that can   t do any harm .  it   s for the good of the           it   s wrong .         we don   t have to listen to him     said mr .  vicenti .      you   ll get into terrible trouble     said mr .  grimm .      no we won   t     said mr .  vicenti .      it   s dabbling with the known     said mr .  grimm .     you   ll get into dreadful trouble and it won   t be my fault .  you are bad people .      he turned  and walked back to his grave .      dial the number     said mr .  vicenti .  the others seemed to wake up .      you know     said mrs .  liberty     he may have a point           forget about mr .  grimm     said mr .  vicenti .  he opened his hands .  a white dove shot out of his sleeve and perched on the phone booth  blinking .     dial the number  mr .  fletcher .             hello  directory inquiries  what name please .         he   s called johnny maxwell and he lives in blackbury .         i   m afraid that is not sufficient information           that   s all we        listen  i can see how it works  there   s a connection      how many of us are there in here .    can i try  please .    this is a lot better than those s  ances .    the operator rubbed her headset .  for some reason  her ear had gone cold .      ow .      she ripped the headset off .   the operator on her right leaned over .      what   s up  dawn .         it went   it felt        they looked at the switchboard .  lights were coming on everywhere  and it was beginning to be covered in frost .   the point is        that all through history there have been people who couldn   t invent things because the rest of the world wasn   t ready .  leonardo da vinci didn   t have the motors or materials to make his helicopter .  sir george cayley invented the internal combustion engine before anyone else had invented gasoline .     and in his life addison vincent fletcher had spent long hours with motors and relays and glowing valves and bits of wire  pursuing a dream the world didn   t even have a name for yet .   in his phone booth  dead mr .  fletcher laughed .  it had a name now .  he knew exactly what a computer was when he saw one .       five     johnny went home .  he didn   t dare go back to the cemetery .   it was saturday evening .  he   d forgotten about the visit .      you   ve got to come     said his mother .     you know she likes to see you .         no she doesn   t     said johnny .     she forgets who i am .  she calls me peter .  i mean  that   s my dad   s name .  and the place smells of old ladies .  anyway  why doesn   t granddad ever come .  she   s his wife .         he says he likes to remember her as she was     said his mother .     besides  it   s markie and mo   s saturday spectacular .  you know he doesn   t like to miss it .         oh   all right .         we don   t have to stay long .          about ten minutes after johnny had gone  the phone rang .  granddad dealt with it in his normal way  which was to shout    phone .     while not taking his eyes off the screen .  but it went on ringing .  eventually  grumbling and losing the remote control down the side of the cushion  where it wouldn   t be found for two days  he got up and shuffled out into the hall .      yes .  he   s not here .  gone out .  who .  well  i   ll   is it .  never .  still doing the conjuring tricks  are you .  haven   t seen you about the town much lately .  no .  right .  that   s right .  i don   t get out much myself these days .  how are you  yourself .  dead .  i see .  but you   ve got out to use the telephone .  it   s wonderful  what they can do with science .  you sound a long way off .  right .  you are a long way off .  i remember that trick you used to do with the handcuffs and the chains and   well  nearly did .  yes .  yes .  right .  i   ll tell him .  nice to hear from you .  good bye .      he went back and settled down in front of the tv again .   after a few minutes a small worried frown crossed his face .  he got up and went and glared at the telephone for a while .       it wasn   t that sunshine acres was a bad place .  as far as johnny could see  it was clean enough and the staff seemed okay .  there were bright murals on the walls and a big tank of goldfish in the tv room .   but it was more gloomy than the cemetery .  it was the way everyone shuffled around quietly  and sat waiting at the table for the next meal hours before it was due  because there wasn   t anything else to do .  it was as if life had stopped and being dead hadn   t started  so all there was to do was hang around .   his grandmother spent a lot of time watching tv in the main lounge  or watching her begonias in her room .  at least  his grandmother   s body did .   he was never certain where her mind was  except that it was often far away and long ago .   after a while he got even more depressed at the conversation between his mother and his grandmother  which was exactly the same as the one last week and the week before that  and did what he always did  which was wander out into the corridor .   he mooched toward the door that led out into the garden  staring vaguely at nothing .   they never told you about this ghost stuff at school .  sometimes the world was so weird  you didn   t know where to start  and social studies and general math weren   t a lot of help .   why didn   t this sort of thing happen to anyone else .  it wasn   t as if he went looking for it .  he just tried to keep his head down  just tried to be someone at the back of the crowd .  but somehow everything was more complicated than it was for anyone else .   the thing was     mr .  t .  atkins .   he probably wouldn   t have noticed it  except that the name was in the back of his mind .   it was written on a little curling piece of paper stuck in a frame on one of the doors .   he stared at it .   it filled the whole world  just for a second or two .   well  there could be lots of atkinses    .   he   d never find out unless he knocked  though   would he .         open the door  will you  love .  m   hands are full .      there was a large black woman behind him  her arms full of sheets .  johnny nodded mutely and turned the handle .   the room was more or less bare .  there was certainly no one else there .      i see you come up here every week to see your gran     said the nurse  dumping the sheets on the bare bed .     you   re a good boy to come see her .         uh .  yes .         what was it you were wanting .         uh .  i thought i   d   you know   drop in to have a chat with mr .  atkins .  uh .     inspiration seized him .     i   m doing a project at school .  about the blackbury pals .      a project .  you could get away with anything if you said you were doing a project .      who were they then  dear .         oh   some soldiers .  mr .  atkins was one of them  i think .  uh   where    .         well  he passed away yesterday  dear .  nearly ninety seven  i think he was .  did you know him .         not   really .         he was here for years .  he was a nice old man .  he used to say that when he died  the war   d be over .  it was his joke .  he used to show us his old army pay book .     tommy atkins     he   d say .     i   m the one  i   m the boy  when i   m gone it   s all over .     he used to laugh about that .         what did he mean .         don   t know  dear .  i just used to smile .  you know how it is .      the nurse smoothed out the new sheets and pulled a cardboard box from under the bed .      this was his stuff     she said .  she gave him an odd look .     i expect it   s all right for you to see .  no one ever visited him  except a man from the british legion regular as clockwork every christmas  god bless them .  they   ve asked for his medals  you know .  but i expect it   s all right for you to have a look .  if it   s a project .      johnny peered into the box while the nurse bustled around the room .   there were a few odds and ends   a pipe  a tobacco tin  a huge old penknife .  there was a scrapbook full of sepia postcards of flowers and fields of cabbages and simpering french ladies dressed in what someone must once have thought was a very daring way .  yellowing newspaper cuttings were stuck between the pages .  and there was a small wooden box lined with toilet paper and containing several medals .   and there was a photograph of the blackbury pals  just like the one in the old newspaper .   johnny lifted it out very carefully and turned it over .  it crackled .   someone had written  in violet ink  a long time ago  the words  old comrades .  .  .  we   re the boys  kaiser bill .  if you know a better    ole  go to it .  .   and there were thirty signatures underneath .   beside twenty nine of the signatures  in pencil  someone had made a small cross .      they all signed it     he said quietly .     he must have got a copy from the paper  and they all signed it .         what was that  dear .         this photo .         oh  yes .  he showed it to me once .  that was him in the war  you know .      johnny turned it over again and found atkins  t .  he looked a bit like bigmac  with jug handle ears and a secondhand haircut .  he was grinning .  they all were .  all the same kind of grin .      he used to talk about them a lot     said the nurse .      yes .         his funeral   s on monday .  at the crem .  one of us always goes  you know .  well  you have to  don   t you .  it   s only right .          he dreamed  on saturday night     he dreamed of rod serling walking along blackbury high street  but as he was trying to speak impressively to the camera  bigmac  yo less  and wobbler started to peer over his shoulder and say things like     what   s this book about  then .     and    turn over the page  i   ve read this bit    .      he dreamed of thumbs     and woke up and stared at the ceiling .  he still hadn   t replaced the bits of string that held up the plastic model of the space shuttle .  it was forever doing a nosedive .   he was pretty sure other kids didn   t have lives like this .  it just kept on happening .  just when he thought he   d got a grip on the world  and saw how it all worked  it sprang something new on him  and what he thought was the whole thing  ticking away nicely  turned out to be just some kind of joke .   his granddad had mumbled a very odd message when johnny had arrived home .  as far as he could understand  wobbler or someone had been making odd phone calls .  his granddad had also muttered something about conjuring tricks .   he looked at his clock radio .  it said      .  there was no chance of going back to sleep .  he tried radio blackbury .         yowzahyowzahyowzah .  and the next caller on uncle mad jim   s bodaaacious problem corner iiisss        johnny froze .  he had a feeling        william stickers  mad jim .         hi  bill .  you sound a bit depressed  to me .         it   s worse than that .  i   m dead  jim .         wow .  i can see that could be a real downer  bill .  care to tell us about it .         you sound very understanding  comrade .  well        of course he   s understanding  thought johnny as he struggled into his dressing gown .  everyone phones up mad jim in the middle of the night .  last week he talked for twenty minutes to a lady who thought she was a roll of wallpaper .  you sound totally sane compared to most of them .   he snatched up his walkman and switched on its radio so that he could go on listening as he ran down the stairs and out into the night .         and now i just heard there isn   t even any soviet union anymore .  what happened .         seems to me you haven   t been keeping up with current events  bill .         i thought i explained about that    .      oh  sure .  you said .  you   ve been dead .  but you   re alive again  right .     mad jim   s voice had that little chuckle in it that it always got when he   d found a real dingdong on the line and could picture all his insomniac listeners turning up the volume .      no .  still dead .  it   s not something you get better from  jim .  now        johnny pattered around the corner and sped along john lennon avenue .   mad jim was saying  in his special dealing withloonies velvet voice     so tell us all out here in the land of the living  bill   what   s it like  being dead .         like .  like .  it is extremely dull .         i   m sure everyone out there would like to know  bill   are there angels .      johnny groaned as he turned the corner into eden road .      angels .  certainly not .      johnny scurried past the silent houses and dodged between the bollards into woodville road .      oh  dear     said mad jim in his headset .     i hope there aren   t any naughty men with pitchforks  then .         what on earth are you blathering about  man .  there   s just me and old tom bowler and sylvia liberty and all the rest of them        johnny lost the thread of things when a sticking out piece of laurel hedge knocked his earphones off .  when he managed to put them back on  it turned out that william stickers had been invited to request a record .      don   t think i know    the red flag     bill .  who   s it by .         it   s    the internationale    .  the song of the downtrodden masses .         doesn   t fire a neuron  bill .  but for you and all the other dead people out there everywhere  tonight      the change in mad jim   s tone suggested that william stickers had been cut off      and we   re all dead sooner or later  ain   t that the truth  here   s one from the vaults by michael jackson      thriller .         the streetlamp by the phone booth was alight .   and the little pool of light was all there was to see  unless you were johnny    .   the dead had spilled out onto the road .  they   d managed to drag the radio with them .  quite a few of them were watching the alderman .      this is how you have to do it  apparently     he said  moonwalking backward across the frosty street .     johnny showed me .         it is certainly a very interesting syncopated rhythm     said mrs .  liberty .     like this  you say .      the ghostly wax cherries on her hat bounced up and down as she twirled .      that   s right .  and apparently you spin around with your arms out and shout    ow .        said the alderman  demonstrating .   oh no  thought johnny  hurrying toward them .  on top of everything else  michael jackson   s going to sue me        get down and   what was it the man on the wireless said .     said the alderman .      boogey  i believe .      they weren   t actually very good at it  but they made up for being eighty years behind the times by sheer enthusiasm .   in fact  it was a party .   johnny stuck his hands on his hips .      you shouldn   t be doing this .         why not .     said a dancing dead .      it   s the middle of the night .         well .  we don   t sleep .         i mean  what would your   your descendants think if they could see you acting like this .         serve them right for not visiting us .         we   re making carpets .     shouted mrs .  liberty .      cutting a rung     corrected one of the dead .      a rug     said the alderman  slowing down a bit .     a rug .  cutting a rug .  that   s what mr .  benbow  who died in nineteen thirty one  says it is called .  getting down and boogeying .         it   s been like this all evening     said mr .  vicenti .  he was sitting on the pavement .  in fact  he was sitting about a foot above the pavement .     we   ve found some very interesting stations .  what exactly is a dj .         a disk jockey     said johnny  giving up and sitting down .     he plays the disks and stuff .         is it some kind of punishment .         quite a lot of people like to do it .         how very strange .  they are not mentally ill  or anything .      the song finished .  the dancers stopped twirling  but slowly and with great reluctance .   mrs .  liberty pushed her hat back .  it had tipped over her eyes .      that was extremely enjoyable     she said .     mr .  fletcher .  be so good as to instruct the man on the wireless to play something more .      interested despite himself  johnny padded over to the phone booth .  mr .  fletcher was actually kneeling down with his hands inside the telephone .  a couple of other dead people were watching him .  one of them was william stickers  who didn   t look very happy .  the other was an old man with a mass of white hair in that dandelion clock style known as mad scientist afro .      oh  it   s you     said william stickers .     call this a world  do you .         me .     said johnny .     i don   t call it anything .         was that man on the radio making fun of me  do you think .         oh  no     said johnny  crossing his fingers .      mr .  sticker iz annoyed because he telephoned moscow     said the white haired man .     they said they   ve had enough revolutions to be going on viz  but vould like some soap .         they   re nothing but dirty capitalists .     said william stickers .      but at least they want to be clean capitalists     said mr .  fletcher .     where shall we try next .         don   t you have to put money in .     said johnny .   mr .  fletcher laughed .      i don   t sink ve   ve met     said the white haired man  extending a slightly transparent hand .     solomon einstein               .         like albert einstein .     said johnny .      he vas my distant cousin     said solomon einstein .      relatively speaking .  ha ha .      johnny got the impression mr .  einstein had said that line a million times and still wasn   t tired of it .      who   re you ringing up .     said johnny .      we   re just having a look at the world     said mr .  fletcher .     what are those things that go around and around in the sky .         i don   t know .  frisbees .         mr .  vicenti just remembers them .  they go around and around the world .         oh .  you mean satellites .         whee .         but how do you know how to           i can   t explain .  things are a lot simpler  i think .  i can see it all laid out .         all of what .         all the cables  all the   the satellites   not having a body makes them a lot easier to use  too .         what do you mean .         for one thing  you don   t have to stay in one place .         but i thought you        mr .  fletcher vanished .  he reappeared a few seconds later .      amazing things     he said .     my word  but we shall have fun .         i don   t underst           johnny .      it was mr .  vicenti .   someone living had managed to get through to mad jim .  the dead  with much laughter  were trying to dance to a country and western number .      what   s going on .     said johnny .     you said you couldn   t leave the cemetery .         no one has explained this to you .  they do not teach you in schools .         well  we don   t get lessons in dealing with ghos   sorry .  sorry .  with dead people  i mean .         we   re not ghosts  johnny .  a ghost is a very sad thing .  oh  dear .  it   s hard to explain things to the living .  i was alive once  and i know what i   m talking about .      dead mr .  vicenti looked at johnny   s blank face .     we   re   something else     he said .     but now that you see us and hear us  you   re making us free .  you   re giving us what we don   t have .         what   s that .         i can   t explain .  but while you   re thinking of us  we   re free .         my head doesn   t have to spin around and around  does it .         that sounds like a good trick .  can you make it do that .         no .         then it won   t .         only i   m a bit worried i   m dabblin    with the occult .      it seemed silly to say it  to mr .  vicenti in his pin stripe trousers and little black tie and fresh ghostly carnation every day .  or mrs .  liberty .  or the big bearded shape of william stickers  who would have been karl marx if karl marx hadn   t been karl marx first .      dear me  i hope you   re not dabbling with the occult     said mr .  vicenti .     father kearny               wouldn   t like that at all .         who   s father kearny .         a few moments ago he was dancing with mrs .  liberty .  oh dear .  we do mix things up  don   t we .         send him away .      johnny turned .   one of the dead was still in the cemetery .  he was standing right up against the railings  clasping them like a prisoner might hold the bars of his cell .  he didn   t look a lot different from mr .  vicenti  except that he had a pair of glasses .  it was amazing that they weren   t melting  he had the strongest stare johnny had ever seen .  he seemed to be glaring at johnny   s left ear .      who   s that .     he said .      mr .  grimm     said mr .  vicenti without looking around .      oh  yes .  i couldn   t find anything about him in the paper .         i   m not surprised     said mr .  vicenti in a low and level voice .     in those days  there were things they didn   t put in .         you go away  boy .  you   re meddling with things you don   t understand     said mr .  grimm .     you   re imperiling your immortal soul .  and theirs .  you go away  you bad boy .      johnny stared .  then he looked back at the street  at the dancers and the scientists around the telephone booth .  a bit farther along there was stanley roundway  in shorts that came down to his knees  showing a group of somewhat older dead how to play football .  he had    l    and    r    stenciled on his football boots .   mr .  vicenti was staring straight ahead .      um       said johnny .      i can   t help you there     said mr .  vicenti .     that sort of thing is up to you .      he must have walked home .  he didn   t really remember .  but he woke up in bed .       johnny wondered what the dead did on sundays .  blackbury on sundays went through some sort of boredom barrier and out the other side .   most people did what people traditionally do on sundays  which was dress up neatly and get in the car and go for family worship at the megasupersaver garden center  just outside the town .  there was a kind of tide of potted plants that were brought back to get killed off by the central heating in time for next week   s visit .   and the mall was locked up .  there wasn   t even anywhere to hang around .      the point about being dead in this town     said wobbler  as they mooched along the towpath     is that it   s probably hard to tell the difference .         did anyone hear the radio last night .     said johnny .   no one had .  he felt a bit relieved .      when i grow up     said wobbler     i   m going to be out of here like a shot .  just you watch .  that   s what this place is .  it   s a place to come from .  it   s not a place to stay .         where   re you going to go  then .     said johnny .      there   s a huge big world out there .     said wobbler .     mountains .  america .  australia .  tons of places .         you told me the other day you   d probably get a job working at your uncle   s place     said bigmac .      yes   well   i mean  all those places   ll be there  won   t they  for when i get time to go     said wobbler .      i thought you were going to be a big man in computers     said yo less .      i could be .  i could be .  if i wanted .         if there   s a miracle and you pass math and english  you mean     said bigmac .      i   m just more practically gifted     said wobbler .      you mean you just press keys until something happens .         well .  often things do happen .         i   m going to join the army     said bigmac .     the marines .         huh .  the flat feet and the asthma will be a big help there  then     said wobbler .     i can just see they   ll want you to limp out and wheeze on terrorists .         i   m pretty certain i want to get a law degree and a medical degree     said yo less  to keep the peace .      that   s good .  that way they won   t be able to sue you if you chop the wrong bits off     said bigmac .   no one really lost their temper .  this was all part of hanging around .      what about you .     said wobbler .     what do you want to be .         dunno     said johnny .      didn   t you go to the careers evening last week .      johnny nodded .  it had been full of great futures .  there was a great future in retail marketing .  there was a great future in wholesale distribution .  there was a great future in the armed forces  a l t h o u g h probably not for bigmac  who   d been allowed to hold a machine gun and had dropped it on his foot .  but johnny couldn   t find a great future with any future in it .     what i want to be     he said     is something they haven   t got a name for yet .         oh  yeah .     said wobbler .     like  in two years    time someone   s going to invent the vurglesplat  and when they start looking around for vurglesplat operators  you   re going to be first in line  right .      they went through the cemetery .  the others  without saying anything  bunched up slightly .  but there were no dead people around .      you can   t just hang around waiting for great futures   that   s the point     johnny murmured .      hey     said yo less in a dismally jolly voice     my mum says why don   t you guys come to church tonight .         it won   t work     said wobbler after a while .     you say that every week .         she says it   d be good for you .  especially simon .         simon .     said wobbler .      me     said bigmac .      she says you need looking after     said yo less .      i didn   t know you were called simon     said wobbler .   bigmac sighed .  he had    blackbury skins    on his t shirt  a suede haircut  great big boots  great big suspenders  and love and hat in ink on his knuckles    but for some reason yo less   s mum thought he needed a proper home .  bigmac lived in dread that bazza and skazz  the only other skins in blackbury  would find out and confiscate his official suspenders .      she said you   re all growing up heathens     said yo less .      well  i   m going to a funeral at the crem tomorrow     said johnny .     that   s almost church .         anyone important .     said wobbler .      i   m not sure     said johnny .       johnny was amazed that so many people had come to thomas atkins   s funeral  but that was because they   d really come to the one before it .  all there was for atkins   s was himself and a stiff looking old man in a blazer from the british legion and the nurse from sunshine acres .  and the vicar  who did his best but had never met tommy atkins so had to put together his sermon out of a sort of kit of proper things to say .  and then some recorded organ music .  and that was it .   the chapel smelled of new wood and floor polish .   the three others kept looking at johnny in an embarrassed way  as if they felt he shouldn   t be there but didn   t know exactly how to put it .   he heard a faint sound behind him  just as the recorded music started up .   he turned around  and there were the dead  seated in rows .  the alderman had taken his hat off and was sitting stiffly at attention .  even william stickers had tried to look respectable .  solomon einstein   s hair stood out like a halo .   the nurse was talking to the man in the blazer .  johnny leaned back so that he could speak to mr .  fletcher .      why are you here .     he whispered .      it   s allowed     said mr .  fletcher .     we used to go to all the funerals in the cemetery .  help them settle in .  make them welcome .  it   s always a bit of a shock .         oh .         and   seeing as you were here   we thought we   d see if we could make it .  mr .  vicenti said it was worth a try .  we   re getting better at it .      the nurse handed tommy atkins   s box to the british legion man and walked out  waving at johnny uncertainly as she went past .  and then the vicar ushered the man through another door  giving johnny another funny look .   outside  the october sun was shining weakly  but it was managing to shine .  johnny went outside and waited .   eventually the man came out  holding two boxes this time .      uh     said johnny  standing up .     um .         yes  lad .  the lady from the home said you   re doing a project for school .      doing a project .  it was amazing .  if saddam hussein had said he was doing a school project  he   d have found life a lot easier    .      um  yes .  uh .  can i ask you some stuff .         of course  yes .     the man sat down heavily on one of the benches .  he walked with a limp and sat with one leg stretched out straight in front of him .  johnny was surprised to see that he was probably as old as granddad  but he had that dried out  suntanned look of a man who keeps himself fit and is probably still going to be captain of the bowling club when he   s eighty .      well   when mr .  atkins said       johnny began .     i mean  he used to say that he was    the one .     i know about the blackbury pals .  i know they all got killed except him .  but i don   t think that   s what he meant    .         you know about the pals  do you .  how .         read it in an old newspaper .         oh .  but you don   t know about tommy atkins .         well  yes  he           no  i mean tommy atkins .  i meant  why he was so proud of the name .  what the name meant .         i don   t understand that     said johnny .      what do they teach you in school these days .      johnny didn   t answer .  he could tell it wasn   t really a question .      you see   in the great war  the first world war   when a new recruit joined the army  he had to fill in his pay book  yes .  you know .  name and address and that sort of thing .  and to help them do it  the army did a kind of guide to how to fill it in  and on the guide  where it said name  they put  thomas atkins .  it was just a name .  just to show them that   s where their name should be .  like  john smith .  but it   well  it became a sort of joke .  tommy atkins came to mean the average soldier           like the man in the street .         yes   very much like that .  it was a nickname for a soldier  i do know that .  tommy atkins   the british tommy .         so   in a way   all soldiers were tommy atkins .         yes .  i suppose you could put it like that .  of course  that   s a rather fanciful way of           but he was a real person .  he smoked a pipe and everything .         well  i suppose the army used it because they thought it was a common sort of name .  so there was bound to be a real tommy atkins somewhere .  i know he was very proud of his name .  i do know that .         was he the last man alive who fought in the war .         oh  no .  good heavens  no .  but he was the last one from around here  that   s for certain .  the last of the pals .      johnny felt a change in the air .      he was a strange old boy .  i used to go and see him every year at        there was a noise that might be made if a handful of silence was stretched thin and then plucked  like a guitar string .   johnny looked around .  now there were three people sitting on the bench .   tommy atkins had his peaked hat on his knees .  the uniform didn   t really fit .  he was still an old man  so his skinny neck stuck out of his collar like a tortoise   s .  he had an old fashioned sort of face   one designed to wear a cloth cap and work in the rubber boot factory .  he saw johnny staring at him  and winked  and gave him the thumbs up sign .  then he went back to gazing intently at the road leading into the parking lot .   behind johnny the dead filed quietly out of the building  the older ones coming through the wall  the younger ones still using the door out of habit .  they didn   t say anything .  they just stood and looked expectantly toward the main road .   where  marching through the cars  were the blackbury pals .       six     the pals swung up the road  keeping perfectly in step .   none of them were old .  they all looked like their photograph .   but then  tommy atkins didn   t look old anymore .  it was a young man who got to his feet  marched out into the parking lot  turned  and saluted johnny and the dead .   then  as the pals strode past  he stepped neatly into the gap they   d left for him .  all thirty men wheeled about and marched away .   the dead streamed after them .  they appeared to walk slowly while at the same time moving very fast  so that  in a few seconds  the parking lot was empty even of its ghosts .      he   s going back to france     said johnny .  suddenly he felt quite cheerful  even though he could feel the tears running down his face .   the british legion man  who had been talking  stopped .      what .     he said .      tommy atkins .  he   s going back .         how did you know that .      johnny realized he   d been talking aloud .      uh        the british legion man relaxed .      i expect the lady from the home told you  did she .  he mentioned it in his will .  would you like a handkerchief .         uh .  no .  i   m all right     said johnny .     yes .  she told me .         yes  we   re taking him back this week .  he gave us a map reference .  very precise  too .     the man patted the second box he   d been given  which  johnny suddenly realized  probably contained all that was left in this world of atkins  t .   apart from a few medals and some faded photographs .      what will you have to do .     he said .      just scatter his ashes .  we   ll have a little ceremony .         where   the pals died .         that   s right .  he was always talking about them  i do know that .         sir .      the man looked up .      yes .         my name   s john maxwell .  what   s yours .         atterbury .  ronald atterbury .      he extended a hand .  they shook hands  solemnly .      are you arthur maxwell   s grandson .  he used to work for me at the boot factory .         yes .  sir .         yes .      johnny knew what the answer was going to be .  he could feel it looming ahead of him .  but you had to ask the question  so that the answer could exist .  he took a deep breath .      are you related to sergeant atterbury .  he was one of the pals .         he was my father .         oh .         i never saw him .  he married my mother before he went off to the war .  there was a lot of that sort of thing .  there always is .  excuse me  young man  but shouldn   t you be in school .         no     said johnny .      really .         i should be here .  i   m absolutely sure about that     said johnny .     but i   d better be getting to school  anyway .  thanks for talking to me .         i hope you haven   t missed any important lessons .         history .         that   s very important .         can i ask you one more question .         yes .         tommy atkins   s medals .  were they for anything special .         they were campaign medals .  soldiers got them  really  for just staying alive .  and for being there .  he went all the way through the war  you know .  right to the end .  didn   t even get wounded .      johnny walked back down the drive barely noticing the world around him .  something important had happened  and he alone of all the living had seen it  and it was right .   getting medals for being there was right  too .  sometimes being there was all you could do .   he looked back when he reached the road .  mr .  atterbury was still sitting on the bench with the two boxes beside him  staring at the trees as if he   d never seen them before .  just staring  as if he could see right through them  all the way to france .   johnny hesitated and then started back .      no     said mr .  vicenti  right behind him .   he   d been waiting by the bus shelter .  haunting it  almost .      i was only going to           yes  you were     said mr .  vicenti .     and what would you say .  that you   d seen them .  what good would that do .  perhaps he   s seeing them too  inside his head .         well           it wouldn   t work .         but if i           if you did something like that a few hundred years ago  you   d probably be hanged for witchcraft .  last century they   d have locked you up .  i don   t know what they   d do now .      johnny relaxed a little .  the urge to run back up the driveway had faded .      put me on television  i expect     he said  walking along the road .      well  we don   t want that     said mr .  vicenti .  he walked too  although his feet didn   t always meet the ground .      it   s just that if i could make people see that           maybe     said mr .  vicenti .     but making people see anything is a long  hard job   excuse me    .      he jerked his shoulder a bit  like a man trying to find a difficult itch  and then pulled a pair of doves from inside his jacket .      they breed in there  i   m sure     he said  watching them fly away and disappear .     what are you going to do now .         school .  and don   t say it   s very important .         i said nothing .      they reached the entrance to the cemetery .  johnny could just see the big sign on the old factory site next door  its blue sky glowing against the dustier blue gray of the real sky .      they   ll start taking us out the day after tomorrow     said mr .  vicenti .      i   m sorry .  like i said  i wish there was something i could do .         you may have done it already .      johnny sighed .      if i ask you what you mean  you   ll say it   s hard to explain  right .         i think so .  come .  you might enjoy this .      there wasn   t even a dead soul in the cemetery .  even the rook had gone  unless it was a crow .   but there was a lot of noise coming from the canal .       the dead were swimming .  well  some of them were .  mrs .  liberty was .  she was wearing a long swimming costume that reached from neck to knees  but she still kept her hat on .   the alderman had stripped off his long robe and chain  and was sitting on the canal bank in his shirt sleeves and some suspenders that could have moored a ship .  johnny wondered how the dead changed clothes  or felt the heat  but he supposed it was all habit .  if you thought your shirt was off  there it was   off .   as for swimming   there was no splash when they dived  just the faintest of shimmers  that spread out like ripples and vanished very quickly .  and when they surfaced  they didn   t look wet .  it dawned on johnny that when a ghost  he had to use that word in his head  jumped into the water  the ghost didn   t get wet  the water got ghostly .   not all of them were having fun  though .  at least not the usual sort .  mr .  fletcher and solomon einstein and a few others were clustered around one of the dumped televisions .      what are they doing .     said johnny .      trying to make it work     said mr .  vicenti .   johnny laughed .  the screen had been smashed .  rain had dripped into the case for years .  there was even grass growing out of it .      that   ll never       he began .   there was a crackle .  a picture formed in the air  on a screen that wasn   t there anymore .   mr .  fletcher stood up and solemnly shook solomon einstein   s hand .      another successful marriage of advanced theoretics and practical know how  mr .  einstein .         a shtep in the right direction  mr .  fletcher .      johnny stared at the flickering images .  the picture was in beautiful color .   enlightenment dawned .      it   s the ghost of the television .     he said .      vot a clever boy .     said solomon einstein .      but with improvements     said mr .  fletcher .   johnny peered inside the case .  it was full of old leaves and stained  twisted metal .  but over the top of it  shimmering gently  was the pearly outline of the ghost of the machine  purring away without electricity .  at least  apparently without electricity .  who knew where the electricity went when the light was switched off .      oh  wow .      he stood up and pointed to the scummy green surface of the canal .      somewhere down there there   s an old ford capri     he said .     wobbler said he saw some men dump it in there once .         i shall see to it directly     said mr .  fletcher .     the internal combustion engine certainly could do with some improvements .         but   look   machines aren   t alive  so how can they have ghosts .         but zey have existence     said einstein .     from moment to moment .  zo  we find the right moment  yes .         sounds a bit occult     said johnny .      no .  it is physics .  it is beyond physics .  it is      he waved both hands excitedly      meta physics .  from the greek meta  meaning    beyond     and physika  meaning   er           physics     said mr .  vicenti .      exactly .         nothing ever finishes .  nothing   s ever really over .      it was johnny who said that .  he was surprised at himself .      correct .  are you a physicist .         me .     said johnny .     i don   t know anything about science .         marvelous .  ideal qualification .     said einstein .      what .         ignorance is very important .  it is an absolutely essential step in the learning process .      mr .  fletcher twiddled the ghost of a tuning knob .      well  we   re all right now     he said  watching a program in what sounded like spanish .     over here  everyone .         how very interesting     said mrs .  liberty  dressing herself in the blink of an eye .     miniature cinematography .      when johnny left  they were all in front of the busted television  arguing over what to watch    .   except for mr .  grimm .  he stood a little apart  hands folded obediently  watching them .      there will be trouble because of this     he said .     this is disobedience .  meddling with the physical .      he had a small mustache as well as glasses  and in daylight johnny saw that the lenses were those thick ones that seem to hide the person   s eyes .      there   ll be trouble     he said again .     and it will be your fault  john maxwell .  you   re getting them excited .  is this any way for the dead to behave .      two invisible eyes followed him .      mr .  grimm .     said johnny .      yes .         who are you .         that   s none of your business .         no  but it   s just that everyone else always talks about           i happen to believe in decency .  i believe life should be taken seriously .  there is a proper way to conduct oneself .  i certainly don   t intend to indulge in this foolish behavior .         i didn   t mean to        mr .  grimm turned around and walked stiffly to his little stone under the trees .  he sat down with his arms folded and glared at johnny .      no good will come of it     he said .       he said he   d been to see a specialist .  that was always a good one .  teachers generally didn   t ask any more questions .   at break  wobbler had news .      my mum said there   s going to be a big meeting about it in the civic center tonight  with television there and everything .         it won   t do any good     said yo less .     it   s been going on for ages .  it   s too late .  there   s been all kinds of inquiries and stuff .         i asked my mum about building things on old graveyards  and she says they have to get a vicar in to desecrate the site first     said wobbler .     that should be worth seeing .         it   s de consecrate     said yo less .     desecrate is all to do with sacrificing goats and things .      wobbler looked wistful .      i suppose there   s no chance           none .         i   m going to go tonight     said johnny .     and you lot ought to come .         it won   t do any good     said yo less .      yes it will     said johnny .      look  the place has still been sold     said yo less .     i know you   re sort of wound up about it  but it   s all over .         going will still do some good .     he knew it  in the same way he   d known the pals were important .  not for reasons .  just because it was .      will there be any   freak winds .     said bigmac .      how do i know .  shouldn   t think so .  they   re all watching television .      the other three exchanged glances .      the dead are watching television .     said wobbler .      that   s right .  and i know you   re all trying to think of funny things to say .  just don   t say them .  they   re watching television .  they   ve made an old tv set work .         well  i suppose it passes the time     said wobbler .      i don   t think they experience time like we do     said johnny .   yo less slid down off the wall .      talking of time     he said     i   m not sure tomorrow would be a good time to go hanging around cemeteries .         why not .     said bigmac .      you know what day it is .         tuesday     said johnny .      halloween     said wobbler .     you   re all coming to my party  remember .         whoops     said bigmac .          the principle is astonishingly simple     said mr .  fletcher .     a tiny point of light .  that   s all it is .  whizzing backward and forward inside a glass bottle .  basically it   s a thermionic valve .  much easier to control than sound waves           excuse me     said mrs .  liberty .     when you stand in front of the screen  you make the picture go blurred .         sorry .     mr .  fletcher went back and sat down .     what   s happening now .      the dead were ranged in rows  fascinated .      mr .  mckenzie has told dawn that janine can   t go to doraleen   s party     said william stickers  without taking his eyes off the screen .      i must say     said the alderman     i thought australia was a bit different .  more kangaroos and fewer young women in unsuitable clothing .         i   m quite happy with the young women     said william stickers .      mr .  stickers .  for shame .  you   re dead .         but i have a very good memory  mrs .  liberty .         oh .  is it over .     said solomon einstein  as the credits rolled up the screen and the cobbers theme music rolled over the canal .     but there iss the mystery of who took the money from mick   s coat .         the man in the television just said there will be another performance tomorrow     said mrs .  liberty .     we must be sure not to miss it .         it is getting dark     said mr .  vicenti from the back of the group .     time we were getting back .      the dead looked across at the cemetery .      if we want to go  that is     he added .  he was smiling faintly .   the dead were silent .  then the alderman said     well  i   m blowed if i   m going back in there .         thomas bowler .     snapped mrs .  liberty .      well  if a man can   t swear when he   s dead  it   s a poor state of affairs .  blowed  blowed  blowed .  and damn     said the alderman .     i mean  look  will you .  there   s radio and television and all sorts .  there   s things going on .  i don   t see why we should go back in there .  it   s dull .  no way .         no way .      william stickers nudged mrs .  liberty .     that   s australian for    certainly not        he whispered .      but staying where we   re put is proper     said mrs .  liberty .     we have to stay where we   ve been put           ahem .      it was mr .  grimm .  the dead looked at their feet .      i entirely agree     he said .      oh .  hello  eric     said the alderman coldly .   eric grimm folded his hands on his chest and beamed at them .  this worried even the dead .  the thickness of his glasses somehow made his eyes get lost  so all that was on the other side of them was pinkness .      will you listen to what you are saying .     he said .     you   re dead .  act your age .  it   s over .     he waved a finger .     you know what will happen if you leave .  you know what will happen if you   re too long away .  it   s dreadful to think about  isn   t it .  you   re letting this idiot child get you all upset .      the dead tried not to meet his gaze .  when you were dead  there were some things that you knew  in the same way that when you were alive you knew about breathing .  it was that a day would come .  and you had to be prepared .  there   d be a final sunrise  and you had to face it  and be ready .   a final sunrise .  the day of judgment .  it could be any day .  you had to be ready .      not gallivanting off aping your juniors     said mr .  grimm  who seemed to read their thoughts .     we   re dead .  so we wait here  like decent people .  not go dabbling in the ordinary .      the dead shuffled their feet .      well  i   ve waited eighty years     said the alderman at last .     if it happens tonight  it happens .  i   m going to go and have a look around .  anyone else coming .         yes .  me     said william stickers  standing up .      anyone else .      about half the dead stood up .  a few more looked around and decided to join them .  there was something about mr .  grimm that made you want to be on the other side .      you will get lost .     warned mr .  grimm .     something will go wrong  you know .  and then you   ll be wandering around forever  and you   ll   forget .         i   ve got descendants out there     said the alderman .      we   ve all got descendants     said mrs .  liberty .     and we know what the rules are .  and so do you .     she looked embarrassed .   there were rules .  you were never told them  any more than you were told that things dropped when you let go of them .  they were just there .   but the alderman was unbudgeable in a sullen kind of way .      at least i   m going to have a look around .  check out my old haunts     he muttered .      haunts .     said william stickers .      check out .     said mrs .  liberty .      that   s modern talk for       william stickers began .      i   m sure i don   t want to know .     mrs .  liberty stood up .     the very idea .         there   s a world out there  and we helped to make it  and now i want to find out what it   s like     said the alderman sulkily .      besides     said mr .  vicenti     if we stick together  no one will forget who they are  and we   ll all go farther .      mrs .  liberty shook her head .      well  if you insist on going  then i suppose someone with some sense should accompany you     she said .   the dead marched off in  as it were  a body  down the canal path and toward the town center .  that left only mr .  einstein and mr .  fletcher  still sitting happily beside their television .      what   s got into them .     said mr .  fletcher .     they   re acting almost alive .         it is disgusting     said mr .  grimm  but somehow in a triumphant tone of voice  as if seeing people acting badly was very satisfying .      solomon here says that space is a delusion     said mr .  fletcher .     therefore  it is impossible to go anywhere .  or to be anywhere  either .      einstein spat on his hands and tried to smooth down his hair .      on ze other hand       he said     there vas a nice little pub in cable street .         you wouldn   t get a drink  solly     said mr .  fletcher .     they don   t serve spirits .         i used to like it in there     said einstein wistfully .     after a hard day stuffing foxes  it vass nice to relax of an evenink .         you did say space was a delusion     said mr .  fletcher .     anyway  i thought we were going to do some more work on the television .  you said there was no theoretical reason why we shouldn   t be able to make           i zink     said mr .  einstein carefully     i would like to fool myself a little .      and then there was only mr .  grimm .   he turned back  still smiling in a glassy kind of way  and settled down and waited for them to return .       seven     the frank w .  arnold civic center meeting room was about half full .   it smelled of chlorine from the swimming pool  and of dust  and floor polish  and wooden chairs .  occasionally people would wander in thinking the meeting was the agm of the bowling club  and then try to wander out again  pushing on the bar on the door marked    pull    and then glaring at it as if only an idiot would put    pull    on a door you pulled .  the speakers spent a lot of the time asking people at the back if they could hear  and then holding the microphone too close to the loudspeakers  and then someone tried to make the pa system work properly  and blew a fuse  and went to find the caretaker  pushing on the door for a while like a hamster trying to find the way out of its treadmill .   in fact  it was like every other public meeting johnny had ever attended .  probably on jupiter seven legged aliens had meetings in icy halls smelling of chlorine  he thought  with the microphones howling  and creatures frantically ing at doors clearly marked  there were one or two of his teachers in the audience .  that was amazing .  you never really thought of them doing anything after school .  you never knew about people  like you never knew how deep a pond was because all you saw was the top .  and he recognized one or two people he   d seen in the cemetery walking their dogs or just sitting on the seats .  they looked out of place .   there were a couple of people from united amalgamated consolidated holdings  and a man from the council planning office  and the chairman of blackbury municipal authority  who looked a lot like mrs .  liberty and turned out to be a miss liberty .   johnny wondered if mrs .  liberty was her great grandmother or something  but it would be hard to ask  you couldn   t very well say     hey  you look like this dead lady  are you related .       they didn   t look out of place .  they looked as though they were used to platforms .   johnny found he couldn   t listen to them properly .  the pock pock from the squash court on the other side of the wall punctuated the sentences like a rain of periods  and the rattling of the door bar was a semicolon .         better .  future .  for the young  people of our city        most of the people in the audience were middle aged .  they listened to all the speakers very intently .         assure the good .  people  of blackbury  that .  we .  at united amalgamated consolidated  holdings value .  public .  opinion most highly  and have no intention .  of        words poured out .  he could feel them filling up the hall .   and afterward   he told himself  in the privacy of his own head   afterward  the day after tomorrow  the cemetery would be shut  no matter what anyone said .  it   d vanish into the past just like the old boot factory .  and then the past would be rolled up and tucked away in old newspapers  just like the pals .  unless someone did something .   life was difficult enough already .  let someone else say something .         not even a particularly fine example .  of edwardian funereal sculpture .  with        the words would fill up the hall until they were higher than people   s heads .  they were smooth  soothing words .  soon they   d close over the top of all the trilbies and woolly hats  and everyone would be sitting there like sea anemones .   they   d come here with things to say  even if they didn   t know how to say them .   the thing was to keep your head down .   but if you did keep your head down  you   d drown in other people   s words .         fully taken into .  account  at every stage of the planning process        johnny stood up  because it was that or drowning .  he felt his head break through the tide of words  and he breathed in .  and then out .      excuse me  please .     he said .       the white swan in cable street  known for years as the dirty duck  was a traditional english pub  with a space invaders video machine that shakespeare himself might have played .  it was crowded  and noisy with electronic explosions and the jukebox .   in one corner  wedged between the video quiz game and the wall  in a black felt hat  nursing half a pint of guinness  was mad old mrs .  tachyon .   mad is a word used about people who   ve either got no senses or several more than most other people .   mrs .  tachyon was the only one who noticed the drop in temperature .  she looked up and grinned a one toothed grin .   the patch of chilly air drifted across the crowded room until it came up against the jukebox .  frost steamed off it for a second .   the tune changed .         roses are blooming in picardy        said mrs .  tachyon happily .     yes .      she watched carefully as people clustered around the machine and started to thump it .  then they pulled the plug  which made no difference .   the barmaid screamed and dropped a tray of drinks when the game machine exploded and caught fire .   then the lights went out .   a minute or two later  mrs .  tachyon was left in the dark  listening to the barman cursing somewhere in a back room as fuses kept blowing .   it was quite pleasant  sitting in the warm glow of the melted machinery .   from the wreckage on the floor  the ghosts of two pints of beer detached themselves and floated across to the table .      cheers .     said mrs .  tachyon .       the chairman of the council looked over her glasses .      questions at the end  please .      johnny wavered .  but if he sat down  the words would close over his head again .      when is the end  please .     he said .   johnny felt everyone looking at him .   the chairman glanced at the other speakers .  she had a habit  johnny noticed  of closing her eyes when she started a sentence and opening them suddenly at the end  so that they   d leap out and surprise you .      when  close  we   ve fully .  discussed .  the situation .  and then i will call for  open .   questions .      johnny decided to swim for the shore .      but i   ll have to leave before the end     he said .     i have to be in bed by ten .      there was a general murmur of approval from the audience .  it was clear that most of them approved of the idea of anyone under thirty being in bed by ten .  it was almost true  anyway .  he was generally in his room around ten  although there was no telling when the lights actually went off .      let the lad ask his question     said a voice from near the front .      he   s doing a project     said another voice .  johnny recognized mr .  atterbury  sitting bolt upright .      oh   very well .  what was it  young man .         um .     johnny felt them all looking at him .     well  the thing is   the thing i want to know is   is there anything that anyone can say here  tonight  that   s going to make any difference .         that  close  hardly seems an appropriate sort of  open .   question     said the chairman severely .      seems damned good to me     said mr .  atterbury .     why doesn   t the man from united amalgamated consolidated holdings answer the boy .  just a simple answer would do .      the united man gave johnny a frank  open smile .      we shall  of course  take all views very deeply into consideration     he said .     and           but there   s a sign up saying that you   re going to build anyway     said johnny .     only i don   t think many people want the old cemetery built on .  so you   ll take the sign down  will you .         we have in fact bought the           you paid fivepence     said johnny .     i   ll give you a pound .      people started to laugh .      i   ve got a question too     said yo less  standing up .   the chairman  who had her mouth open  hesitated .  yo less was beaming at her  defying her to tell him to sit down .      we   ll take the question from the other young man  the one in the shirt   no  not you  the       she began .      the black one     said yo less helpfully .     why did the council sell the cemetery in the first place .      the chairman brightened up at this one .      i  close  think we have covered that very fully  open .       she said .     the cost of upkeep        bigmac nudged johnny  pointed at a sheet of figures everyone had been given  and whispered in his ear .      but i don   t see how there   s much upkeep in a cemetery     said yo less .     sending someone in once or twice a year to cut the brambles down doesn   t sound like much of a cost to me .         we   d do it for nothing     said johnny .      would we .     whispered wobbler  who liked fresh air to be something that happened to other people  preferably a long way off .   people were turning around in their seats .   the chairman gave a loud sigh  to make it clear that johnny was being just too stupid but that she was putting up with him nevertheless .      the fact  young man  as i have explained time and again  is that it is simply too expensive to maintain a cemetery that is        as he listened  red with embarrassment  johnny remembered about the chance to have another go .  he could just put up with it and shut up  and forever after he   d wonder what would have happened  and then when he died that angel   although  as things were going at the moment  angels were in short supply even after you were dead   would say  hey  would you have liked to have found out what happened .  and he   d say yes  really  and the angel would send him back and maybe this was     he pulled himself together .      no     he said     it isn   t simply too expensive .      the woman stopped in mid sentence .      how dare you interrupt me .     she snapped .   johnny plowed on .     it says in your papers here that the cemetery makes a loss .  but a cemetery can   t make a loss .  it   s not like a business or something .  it just is .  my friend bigmac here says what you   re calling a loss is just the value of the land for building offices .  it   s the rates and taxes you   d get from united amalgamated consolidated holdings .  but the dead can   t pay taxes  so they   re not worth anything .      the man from united amalgamated consolidated holdings opened his mouth to say something  but the chairman stopped him .      a democratically elected council       she began .      i   d like to raise a few points concerning that     said mr .  atterbury .     there are certain things about this sale that i should like to see more clearly explained in a democratic way .         i   ve had a good look around the cemetery     said johnny  plunging on .     i   ve been   doing a project .  i   ve walked around it a lot .  it   s full of stuff .  it doesn   t matter that no one in there is really famous .  they were famous here .  they lived and got on with things and died .  they were people .  it   s wrong to think that the past is something that   s just gone .  it   s still there .  it   s just that you   ve gone past .  if you drive through a town  it   s still there in the rearview mirror .  time is a road  but it doesn   t roll up behind you .  things aren   t over just because they   re past .  do you see that .          people told one another that it was getting chilly for the time of year .  little points of coldness drifted around the town .   screen k at the blackbury odeon was showing a twenty four hour  nonstop halloween special  but people kept coming out .  it was too cold in there  they said .  and it was creepy .  armpit  the manager  who was one of wobbler   s mortal enemies  and who looked like two men in one dinner jacket  said it was supposed to be creepy .  they said not that creepy .  there were voices that you didn   t exactly hear  and they   well  you kept getting the impression that people were sitting right beh   well  let   s go and get a burger .  somewhere brightly lit .   pretty soon there was hardly anyone in there at all except mrs .  tachyon  who   d bought a ticket because it was somewhere in the warm  and spent most of the time asleep .      elm street .  elm street .  wasn   t there an elm street down by beech lane .         i don   t think it was this one .  i don   t remember this sort of thing going on .      she didn   t mind the voices at all .      freddie .  now that   s a nice name .      they were company  in a way .      and that   s a nice sweater .      and a lot of people had left popcorn and things behind in their hurry to get out .      but i don   t think that   s very nice .      the next film was ghostbusters  which was followed by wednesday of the living dead .   it seemed to mrs .  tachyon that the voices  which didn   t exist anyway  had gone very quiet .       everyone was staring at johnny now .      and   and     said johnny        if we forget about them  we   re just a lot of people living in   in buildings .  we need them to tell us who we are .  they built this city .  they did all the crazy human things that turn a lot of buildings into a place for people .  it   s wrong to throw all that away .      the chairman shuffled the papers in front of her .      nevertheless  close   we have to deal with the  open .   present day     she said brusquely .     the dead are no longer here  and i am afraid they do not vote .         you   re wrong .  they are here and they have got a vote     said johnny .     i   ve been working it out .  in my head .  it   s called tradition .  and they outvote us twenty to one .      everyone went quiet .  nearly as quiet as the unseen audience in screen k .   then mr .  atterbury started to clap .  someone else joined in   johnny saw it was the nurse from sunshine acres .  pretty soon everyone was clapping  in a polite yet firm way .   mr .  atterbury stood up again .      mr .  atterbury  sit down     said the chairman .     i am running this meeting  you know .         i am afraid this does not appear to be the case     said mr .  atterbury .     i   m standing up and i   m going to speak .  the boy is right .  too much has been taken away  i do know that .  you dug up the high street .  it had a lot of small shops .  people lived there .  now it   s all walkways and plastic signs  and people are afraid of it at night .  afraid of the town where they live .  i   d be ashamed of that  if i was you .  and we had a coat of arms for the town  up on the town hall .  now we   ve got some kind of plastic logo thing .  and you took the old allotment gardens and built the neil armstrong shopping mall  and all the little shops went out of business .  and they were beautiful  those allotments .         they were a mess .         oh  yes .  a beautiful mess .  homemade greenhouses made of old window frames nailed together .  old men sitting out in front of their sheds in old chairs .  vegetables and dogs and children all over the place .  i don   t know where all those people went   do you .  and then you knocked down a lot of houses and built the big tower block where no one wants to live and named it after a crook .         i didn   t even live here in those days     said the chairman .     besides  it   s generally agreed that the joshua n   clement block was a   misplaced idea .         a bad idea  you mean .         yes  if you must put it like that .         so mistakes can be made  can they .         nevertheless  the plain fact is that we have to build for the future           i   m very glad to hear you say that  madam chairman  because i   m sure you   ll agree that the most successful buildings have got very deep foundations .      there was another round of applause .  the people on the platform looked at one another .      i feel i have no alternative but to close the meeting     said the chairman stiffly .     this was supposed to be an informative occasion .         i think it has been     said mr .  atterbury .      but you can   t close the meeting     said johnny .      indeed  i can .         you can   t     said johnny     because this is a public hall  and we   re all public  and no one   s done anything wrong .         then we shall leave  and there will really be no point in the meeting .     said the chairman .  she swept up her papers and stalked across the platform  down the steps  and across the hall .  the rest of the platform party  with one or two helpless glances at the audience  followed her .   she led the way to the door .   johnny offered up a silent prayer .   someone  somewhere  heard it .   she pushed when she should have pulled .  the rattling was the only noise  and it grew frantic as she began to lose her temper .  finally  one of the men from united amalgamated consolidated holdings yanked the bar and the door jolted open .   johnny risked looking behind him .  he couldn   t see anyone who looked dead .   a week ago that would have sounded really odd .   it didn   t sound much better now .      i thought i felt a draft     he said .     just now .         they   ve left the windows open at the back     said yo less .   they   re not here  johnny thought .  i   m going to have to do this by myself .  oh  well        are we going to get into trouble .     said wobbler .     this was supposed to be a public meeting .         well  we   re public  aren   t we .     said johnny .      are we .         why not .      everyone sat for a while looking at the empty platform .  then mr .  atterbury got up and limped up the steps .      shall we have a meeting .     he said .       cold air swirled out of the cinema .      well  that was an education .         some of those tricks must have been done with mirrors  if you want my opinion .         what shall we do now .         we should be getting back .         back where .         back to the cemetery  of course .         madam  the night is young .         that   s right .  we   ve only just started enjoying ourselves .         yes .  anyway  you   re a long time dead  that   s what i always say .         i want to get out there and enjoy life .  i never enjoyed it much when i was alive .         thomas bowler .  that   s no way for a respectable man to behave .      the crowd lining up outside the burger bar drew closer together as the chilly wind drove past .      thomas bowler .  do you know   i never really enjoyed being thomas bowler .          the audience in the frank w .  arnold civic center looked a bit sheepish  like a class after the teacher has stormed out .  democracy works very well only if people are told how to do it .   someone raised a hand .      can we actually stop it happening .     she asked .     it all sounded very   official .         officially  i don   t think we can     said mr .  atterbury .     there was a proper sale .  united amalgamated consolidated holdings could get unpleasant .         there   s plenty of other sites     said someone else .     there   s the old jam works in slate road  and all that area where the old railroad yard used to be .         and we could give them their money back .         we could give them double their money back     said johnny .   there was more laughter at this .      it seems to me     said mr .  atterbury     that a company like united amalgamated consolidated holdings has to take notice of people .  the boot factory never took any notice of people  i do know that .  it didn   t have to .  it made boots .  that was all there was to it .  but no one   s quite certain about what uach does  so they have to be nice about it .     he rubbed his chin .     big companies like that don   t like fuss .  and they don   t like being laughed at .  if there was another site   and if they thought we were serious   and if we threaten to offer them  yes  double their money back           and then we ought to do something about the high street     said someone .      and get some decent playgrounds and things again  instead of all these amenities all over the place .         and blow up joshua n   clement and get some proper houses built           yo .     said bigmac .      hear hear     said yo less .   mr .  atterbury waved his hands calmly .      one thing at a time     he said .     let   s rebuild blackbury first .  we can see about jerusalem tomorrow .         and we ought to find a name for ourselves .         the blackbury preservation society .         sounds like something you put in a jar .         all right  the blackbury conservation society .         still sounds like jam to me .         the blackbury pals     said johnny .   mr .  atterbury hesitated .      it   s a good name     he said eventually  while lots of people in the hall started asking one another who the blackbury pals were .     but   no .  not now .  but they were officially the blackbury volunteers .  that   s a good name .         but that doesn   t say what we   re going to do  does it .         if we start off not knowing what we   re going to do  we could do anything     said johnny .     einstein said that     he added proudly .      what  albert einstein .     said yo less .      no  solomon einstein     said mr .  atterbury .     hah .  know about him too  do you .         er   yes .         i remember him .  he used to keep a taxidermist and fishing tackle shop in cable street when i was a lad .  he was always saying that sort of thing .  a bit of a philosopher  was solomon einstein .         and all he did was stuff things .     said yo less .      and think     said johnny .      well  that kind of cogitation runs in the family  you might say     said mr .  atterbury .     besides  you   ve got a lot of time for abstract thought when you   ve got your hand stuck up a dead badger .         yes  you certainly wouldn   t want to think about what you were doing     said wobbler .      blackbury volunteers it is  then     said mr .  atterbury .       frost formed on the receiver of the public phone in the white swan .      ready  mr .  einstein .         let   s go  mr .  fletcher .      the telephone clicked and was silent .  the air warmed up again .   thirty seconds later the air grew cold in the little wooden hut twenty miles away that housed the controls of blackbury university   s radio telescope .      it works .         of course .  of all the forces in the universe  the hardest to overcome is the force of habit .  gravity is easy peasy by comparison .         when did you think of that .         it came to me ven i was working on a particularly large trout .         really .  well   let   s see what we can do    .      mr .  fletcher looked around the little room .  it was currently occupied only by adrian    nozzer    miller  who   d wanted to be an astronomer because he thought it was all to do with staying up late looking through telescopes  and hadn   t bargained on it being basically about adding columns of figures in a little shed in the middle of a windy field .   the figures the telescope was producing were all that was left of an exploding star twenty million years ago .  a billion small rubbery things on two planets who had been getting on with life in a quiet sort of way had been totally destroyed  but they were certainly helping adrian get his ph . d .   and who knows  they might have thought it all worthwhile if anyone had asked them .   he looked up as the telescope motors ground into action .  lights flickered on the control panel .   he stared at the main switches and then reached out for them .  they were so cold they hurt .      ow .      the big dish turned toward the moon  which was just over blackbury .   there was a clattering from the printer beside him  and the endless stream of paper it was producing now read                                                 heregoesnothingggg                  wellimback                  mr .  fletcher had just bounced off the moon .      vot was it like .         i didn   t have time to see much  but i don   t think i   d like to live there .  it worked  though .  the sky   s the limit  mr .  einstein .         exactly  mr .  fletcher .  by the vay  where did that young man go .         i think he had to rush off somewhere .         oh .  well   we should go and tell the others  don   t you think .          it was a quiet night in blackbury   s central police station .  sergeant comely had time to sit back and watch the little lights on the radio .   he   d never really been happy about the radio  even when he was younger .  it was the bane of his life .  he suffered from education  and he   d never been able to remember all that    foxtrot tango piper    business   at least when he was  e . g .   pelting down the street at   a . m .  in pursuit of miscreants .  he   d end up sending messages about    photograph teapot psychological .     it had definitely blighted his promotion chances .   he especially hated the radio on nights like this  when he was in charge .  he hadn   t joined the police to be good at technology .   then the phones started to ring .  there was the manager of the odeon .  sergeant comely couldn   t quite make out what he was saying .      yes  yes  all right  halloween spectacular     he said .     what do you mean  it   s all gone cold .  what do you want me to do .  arrest a theater for being cold .  i   m a police officer  not a central heating specialist .  i don   t repair video machines  either .      the phone rang again as soon as he put it down  but this time one of the young constables answered it .      it   s someone from the university     he said  putting his hand over the mouthpiece .     he says a strange alien force has invaded the radio telescope .  you know  that big satellite dish thing over toward slate .      sergeant comely sighed .     can you get a description .     he said .      i saw a film about this  sarge     said another policeman .     these aliens landed and replaced everyone in the town with giant vegetables .         really .  around here it   d be days before anyone noticed     said the sergeant .   the constable put the phone down .      he just said it was like a strange alien force     he said .     very cold  too .         oh  a cold strange alien force     said sergeant comely .      and it was invisible  too .         right .  would he recognize it if he didn   t see it again .      the young policemen looked puzzled .  i   m too good for this  the sergeant thought .      all right     he said .     so we know the following .  strange invisible aliens have invaded blackbury .  they dropped in at the dirty duck  where they blew up the space invaders machine  which makes sense .  and then they went to the pictures .  well  that makes sense too .  it   s probably years before new films get as far as alfred centuri        the phone rang again .  the constable answered it .      and what  we ask ourselves  is their next course of action .         it   s the manager of pizza surprise  sarge     said the constable .     he says           right .     said the sergeant .     that   s right .  they drop in for a number three with extra pepperoni .  it probably looks like a friend of theirs .         wouldn   t do any harm to go and chat with him     said the constable .  it had been a long time since dinner .     you know  just to show a bit of           i   ll go     said sergeant comely  picking up his hat .     but if i come back as a giant cucumber  there   s going to be trouble .         no anchovies on mine  sarge     said the constable  as sergeant comely stepped out into the night .   there was something strange in the air .  sergeant comely had lived in blackbury all his life  and it had never felt like this .  there was an electrical tingle to things  and the air tasted of tin .   it suddenly struck him .   what if it was real .  just because they made silly films about aliens and things didn   t actually mean  did it  that it couldn   t ever happen .  he watched them on late night television .  they always picked small towns to land near .   he shook his head .  nah     william stickers walked through him .      you know  you really shouldn   t have done that  william     said the alderman  as sergeant comely hurried away .      he   s nothing but a symbol of the oppression of the proletariat     said william stickers .      you   ve got to have policemen     said mrs .  liberty .     otherwise people would simply do as they liked .         well  we can   t have that  can we .     said mr .  vicenti .       the alderman looked around at the brightly lit street as they strolled along it .  there weren   t many living people around  but there were quite a lot of dead ones  looking in shop windows or  in the case of some of the older ones  looking at shop windows and wondering what they were .      i certainly don   t remember all these shopkeepers from my time     he said .     they must have moved in recently .  mr .  boots and mr .  mothercare and mr .  spudjulicay .         whom .     said mrs .  liberty .   the alderman pointed to the sign on the other side of the street .      spud u like     said mr .  vicenti .     hmm .         is that how you pronounce it .     said the alderman .     i thought perhaps he was french .  my word .  and electric light all over the place .  and no horse   manure in the streets at all .         really .     snapped mrs .  liberty .     please remember you are in company with a lady .         that   s why he said manure     said william stickers happily .      and the food .     said the alderman .     hindoo and chinese .  chicken from kentucky .  and what did you say the stuff was that the clothes are made of .         plastic  i think     said mr .  vicenti .      very colorful and long lasting     said mrs .  liberty .     and many of the girls wear bloomers  too .  extremely practical and emancipated .         and many of them are extremely handsome     said william stickers .      and everyone   s taller and i haven   t seen anyone on crutches     said the alderman .      it wasn   t always like this     said mr .  vicenti .     the nineteen thirties were rather gloomy .         yes  but now       the alderman spread his arms and turned around .     shops full of cinematography televisions .  bright colors everywhere .  tall people with their own teeth .  an age of miracles and wonders .         the people don   t look very happy     said mr .  vicenti .      that   s just a trick of the light     said the alderman .       it was almost midnight .  the dead met in the abandoned arcades of the shopping mall .  the grilles were up and locked  but that doesn   t matter when you   re dead .      well  that was fun     said the alderman .      i have to agree     said mrs .  sylvia liberty .     i haven   t enjoyed myself so much since i was alive .  it   s a shame we have to go back .      the alderman crossed his arms .      go back .     he said .      now  then  thomas     said mrs .  liberty  but in a rather softer voice than she   d used earlier that evening     i don   t want to sound like eric grimm  but you know the rules .  we have to return .  a day will come .         i   m not going back .  i   ve really enjoyed myself .  i   m not going back .         me neither     said william stickers .     down with tyranny .         we must be ready for judgment day     said mrs .  liberty .     you never can tell .  it could be tomorrow .  supposing it happened  and we missed it .         hah .     said william stickers .      more than eighty years i   ve been sitting there     said alderman bowler .     you know  i wasn   t expecting that .  i thought things went dark for a moment and then there was a man handing out harps .         for shame .         well  isn   t that what you expected .     he demanded .      not me     said william stickers .     belief in the survival of what is laughably called the soul after death is a primitive superstition which has no place in a dynamic socialist society .      they looked at him .      you don   t think     said solomon einstein carefully     that it is worth reconsidering your opinions in the light of experiental evidence .         don   t think you can get around me just because you   re accidentally right .  just because i happen to find myself still   basically here     said william stickers     does not invalidate the general theory .      mrs .  liberty banged her phantom umbrella on the floor .      i won   t say it hasn   t been enjoyable     she said     but the rules are that we must be back in our places at dawn .   supposing we stayed away too long and forgot who we were .  supposing tomorrow was judgment day .      thomas bowler sighed .      well  supposing it is .     he said .     you know what i   d say .  i   d say  i did the best i could for eighty four years .  and no one ever told me that afterward i   d still be this fat old man who gets out of breath .  why do i get out of breath .  i don   t breathe .  i passed away  and next thing i knew i was sitting in a marble hut like a man waiting an extremely long time for an appointment with the doctor .  for nearly ninety years .  i   d say  you call this justice .  why are we waiting .  a day will come .  we all   arrive knowing it  but no one says when .  just when i was beginning to enjoy life     he said .     i wish this night would never end .      mr .  fletcher nudged solomon einstein .      shall we tell them .     he said .      tell us what .     said william stickers .      vell  you see       einstein began .      times have changed     said mr .  fletcher .     all that stuff about being home at dawn and not hearing the cock crow and stuff like that .  that was all very well once upon a time  when people thought the earth was flat .  but no one believes that now           er       one of the dead raised a hand .      oh  yes     said mr .  fletcher .     thank you  mr .  ronald newton                former chairman of the blackbury flat earth society .  i know you have views .  but the point i   m trying to make is              dawn is a place as well as a time     said einstein  spreading his hands .      what on earth do you mean .     said mrs .  liberty .      on earth  and around earth     said einstein  getting excited .     one night and one day  forever chasing one another .         there is a night that never comes to an end     said mr .  fletcher .     all you need is speed           relatively speaking     said einstein .       eight     there is a night that never comes to an end    .   the clock of the world turns under its own shadow .  midnight is a moving place  hurtling around the planet at a thousand miles an hour like a dark knife  cutting slices of daily bread off the endless loaf of time .   time passes everywhere .  but days and nights are little local things that happen only to people who stay in one place .  if you go fast enough  you can overtake the clock    .      how many of us are in this phone booth .     asked mr .  fletcher .      seventy three     said the alderman .      very well .  where shall we go .  iceland .  it   s not even midnight yet in iceland .         can we have fun in iceland .     asked the alderman .      how do you feel about fish .         can   t abide fish .         not iceland  then .  i believe it   s very hard to have fun in iceland without fish being involved in some way .  well  now   it   ll be early evening in new york .         america .     said mrs .  liberty .     won   t we get scalped .         good grief  no .     said william stickers  who was a bit more up to date about the world .      probably not     said mr .  fletcher  who had been watching the news lately and was even more up to date than william stickers .      look  we   re dead     said the alderman .     what else have we got to worry about .         now  this may strike you as an unusual means of travel     said mr .  fletcher  as something in the telephone began to click     but all you have to do  really  is follow me .  incidentally  is stanley roundway here .      the footballer raised his hand .      we   re going west  stanley .  for once in your death  try to get the directions right .  and now        one by one  they vanished .       johnny lay in bed  watching the stricken shuttle turning gently in the moonlight .   it had been quite busy after the meeting .  someone from the blackbury guardian had talked to him  and then mid midlands tv had filmed him  and people had shaken his hand  and he hadn   t got home until nearly eleven .   there hadn   t been any trouble over that  at least .  his mum hadn   t come in yet  and granddad was watching a program about bicycle racing in germany .   he kept thinking about the pals .  they   d come all the way from france .  yet the dead in the cemetery were so frightened of moving .  but they were all the same type of people  really .  there had to be a reason for that .   the dead in the cemetery just hung around .  why .  the pals had marched from france because it was the right thing to do .  you didn   t have to stay where you were put .          new york  new york .         why did they name it twice .         well  they are americans .  i suppose they wanted to be sure .         the lights are extremely plentiful .  what   s that .         the statue of liberty .         looks a bit like you  sylvia .         saucy .         is everyone keeping a look out for those ghost breakers .         i think that was just cinematography  william .         how long to morning .         hours  yet .  follow me  everyone .  let   s get a better view .      no one ever did work out why all the elevators in the empire state building went up and down all by themselves for almost an hour    .       october the   st dawned foggy .  johnny wondered about having a one day illness in preparation for what he suspected was going to be a busy evening  but decided to go to school instead .  they always felt happier if you dropped in sometimes .   he went via the cemetery .   there wasn   t a living soul .  he hated it when it was like this .  it was like the bits in the film when you were waiting for the aliens to jump out .   somehow  they were always more dreadful than the bits with the fangs in them .   then he found mr .  grimm .  anyone else walking along the towpath would have just seen the busted set .  but johnny saw the little man in his neat suit  watching the ghost of the television .      ah  boy     he said .     you have been causing trouble  have you .     he pointed to the screen .   johnny gasped .  there was mr .  atterbury  very calmly talking to a lady on a sofa .  there was also one of the people from united amalgamated consolidated holdings .  and he was having some difficulty  was the consolidated man .  he   d come along with some prepared things to say and he was having problems getting his mind around the idea that they weren   t working anymore .   mr .  grimm turned up the volume control .         at every stage  fully sensitive to public opinion in this matter  i can assure you  but there is no doubt that we entered into a proper and legal contract with the relevant authority .         but the blackbury volunteers say too much was decided behind closed doors     said the lady  who looked as though she was enjoying herself .     they say things were never fully discussed and that no one listened to the local people .         of course  this is not the fault of united amalgamated consolidated holdings     said mr .  atterbury  smiling benevolently .     they have an enviable record of civic service and cooperation with the public .  i think what we have here is a mistake rather than any near criminal activity  and we in the volunteers would be more than happy to assist them in any constructive way and  indeed  possibly even compensate them .      probably no one else but johnny and the consolidated man noticed mr .  atterbury take a tenpence piece out of his pocket .  he turned it over and over in his fingers .  the man from the company watched it like a mouse might watch a cat .   he   s going to offer him double his money back  johnny thought .  right there on television .   he didn   t .  he just kept turning the coin over and over  so that the man could see it .      that seems a very diplomatic offer     said the interviewer .     tell me  mr   er           a spokesman     said the consolidated man .  he looked quite ill .  there was a glint as light flashed off the coin .      tell me  mr .  spokesman   what is it that united amalgamated consolidated holdings actually does .      mr .  atterbury would probably have been a good man in the spanish inquisition  johnny told himself .   mr .  grimm turned the sound down again .      where   s everyone else .     said johnny .      haven   t come back     said mr .  grimm  with horrible satisfaction .     their graves haven   t been slept in .  that   s what happens when people don   t listen .  and do you know what   s going to happen to them .         no .         they   re going to fade away .  oh  yes .  you   ve put ideas in their heads .  they think they can go gadding about .  but people who go gadding about and not staying where they   re put   they don   t come back .  and that   s an end to it .  it could be judgment day tomorrow  and they won   t be here .  hah .  serves them right .      there was something about mr .  grimm that made johnny want to hit him  except that it wouldn   t work anyway and  besides  hitting him would be like hitting mud .  you   d get dirtier for doing it .      i don   t know where they   ve gone     he said     but i don   t think anything bad   s happened to them .         think what you like     said mr .  grimm  turning back to the television .      did you know it   s halloween .     said johnny .      is it .     said mr .  grimm  watching an ad for chocolate .     i shall have to be careful tonight  then .      when johnny reached the bridge  he looked back .  mr .  grimm was still there  all alone .       the dead rode a radio signal over wyoming    .   they were already changing .  they were still recognizable  but only when they thought about it .      you see  i told you it was possible     said the person who was occasionally mr .  fletcher .     we don   t need wires .      they ran into an electric storm high over the rocky mountains .  that was fun .   and then they surfed down the radio waves to california .      what time is it .         midnight .          johnny was a sort of hero in school .  the blackbury guardian had a front page story headed  council slammed in cemetery sale rumpus .  the guardian often used words like    slammed    and    rumpus     you wondered how the editor talked at home .   johnny was in the story with his name spelled wrong  and there was a quote that ran     war hero arthur atterbury  president of the newly formed    blackbury volunteers     told the guardian     there are young people in this town with more sense of history in their little fingers than some adults have in their entire committee bound bodies .     this is thought to be a reference to councilwoman miss ethel liberty  who was not available for comment last night .      even one or two of the teachers mentioned it  it was unusual for people from the school to appear in the paper except very close to headlines like two fined after joyride escapade .   even the history teacher asked him about the blackbury pals .  and then johnny found himself telling the class about the alderman and william stickers and mrs .  sylvia liberty  although he said he   d got the information out of the library .  one of the girls said she was definitely going to do a project on mrs .  liberty  champion of women   s rights  and wobbler said  yes  champion of women   s right to get things wrong  and that started a good argument that lasted until the end of the lesson .   even the headmaster took an interest   probably out of aforesaid relief that johnny wasn   t involved in one of those youth gang fined for shoplifting stories .  johnny had to find his way to his office .  the recommended method was to tie one end of a piece of string to somewhere you knew and get your friends to come and look for you if you were away more than two days .  he got a short speech about    social awareness    and was out again a minute later .   he met the other three in the lunch break .      come on     he said .      where to .         the cemetery .  i think something   s gone wrong .         i haven   t had my lunch yet     said wobbler .     it   s very important for me to have regular meals .  otherwise my stomach acid plays up .         oh  shut up .          by the time they raced one another across the heart of australia  they didn   t even need the radio .   the dawn dragged its slow way across the pacific after them  but they were running free .      do we ever need to stop .         no .         i always wanted to see the world before i died .         well  then  it was just a matter of timing .         what time is it .         midnight .          the cemetery wasn   t empty now .  there were a couple of photographers there  for one thing  including one from a sunday newspaper .  there was a film crew from mid midlands television .  and the dog walking people had been joined by others  just walking around and looking .   in a neglected corner mrs .  tachyon was industriously polishing a gravestone .      never seen so many people here     said johnny .  he added     at least  ones who   re breathing .      yo less wandered over from where he   d been talking to a couple of enthusiastic people in woolly bobble hats  who were peering through the huge thicket behind mrs .  liberty   s grave .      they say we   ve not only got environment and ecology  but some habitat as well     he said .     they think they   ve seen a rare scandinavian thrush .         yeah  full of life  this place     said bigmac .   a council truck had driven a little way up the towpath .  some men in weatherproof jackets were harvesting the old mattresses .  the zombie television had already gone .  mr .  grimm was nowhere to be seen  even by johnny .   and a police car was parked just outside the gates .  sergeant comely was working on the general assumption that where you got lots of people gathered together  something illegal was bound to happen sooner or later .   the cemetery was alive .      they   ve gone     said johnny .     i can feel them   not here .      the other three found that  quite by accident  they   d all moved closer together .   a rare scandinavian thrush  unless it was a rook  cawed in the elms .      gone where .     said wobbler .      i don   t know .         i knew it .  i knew it .     said wobbler .     his eyes   ll start to glow any minute  you watch .  you   ve let    em out .  there   ll be lurchin    goin    on before this day   s over  you wait and see .         mr .  grimm said that if they   re away too long  they   they forget who they were       said johnny uncertainly .      see .  see .     said wobbler .     you laughed at me .  maybe they   re okay when they   re remembering who they were  but once they forget           night of the killer zombies .     said bigmac .      we   ve been through all that     said johnny .     they   re not zombies .         yeah  but maybe they   ve been eating voodoo fish and chips     said bigmac .      they   re just not here .         then where are they .         i don   t know .         and it   s halloween  too     moaned wobbler .   johnny walked over to the fence around the old boot works .  there were quite a few cars parked there .  he could see the tall  thin figure of mr .  atterbury  talking to a group of men in gray suits .      i wanted to tell them     he said .     i mean  we might win .  now .  people are here .  there   s tv and everything .  last week it looked hopeless and now there   s just a chance  and last night i wanted to tell them and now they   ve gone .  and this was their home .         perhaps all these people have frightened them away     said yo less .      day of the living     said bigmac .      i should have had my lunch .     said wobbler .     my stomach   s definitely playing up .         they   re probably waiting under your bed     said bigmac .      i   m not scared     said wobbler .     i   ve just got a stomach upset .         we ought to be getting back     said yo less .     i   ve got to do a project on projects .         what .     said johnny .      it   s for math     said yo less .     how many people in the school are doing projects .  that kind of stuff .  statistics .         i   m going to look for them     said johnny .      you   ll get into trouble when they do the roll .         i   ll say i   ve been doing something   social .  that   ll probably work .  anyone coming with me .      wobbler looked at his feet  or where his feet would be if wobbler wasn   t in the way .      what about you  bigmac .  you   ve got your everlasting note  haven   t you .         yeah  but it   s going a bit yellow now    .      no one knew when it had been written .  rumor had it that it had been handed down through the generations in bigmac   s family .  it was in three pieces .  but it generally worked .  although bigmac kept tropical fish and generally out of trouble  there was something about the way he looked and the way he lived in the joshua n   clement block that saw to it no teacher ever questioned the note  which excused him from doing everything .      anyway  they could be anywhere     he said .     anyway  i can   t look for    em  can i .  anyway  they   re probably just inside your head .         you heard them on the radio .         i heard voices .  that   s what radio   s for  innit .      it occurred to johnny  not for the first time  that the human mind  of which each of his friends was in possession of one almost standard sample  was like a compass .  no matter how much you shook it up  no matter what happened to it  sooner or later it   d go on pointing the same way .  if nine foot tall green martians landed on the shopping mall  bought some greeting cards and a bag of sugar cookies  and then took off again  within a day or two people would believe it never happened .      not even mr .  grimm   s here  and he   s always here     said johnny .   he looked at mr .  vicenti   s ornate grave .  some people were taking photographs of it .      always here     he said .      he   s gone weird again     said wobbler .      you all go back     said johnny quietly .     i just thought of something .      they all looked around .  their brains don   t believe in the dead  johnny thought  but they keep getting outvoted by all the rest of them .      i   m okay     said johnny .     you go on back .  i   ll see you at wobbler   s party tonight  all right .         remember not to bring any   you know   friends     said wobbler  as the three of them left .   johnny wandered down north drive .   he   d never tried to talk to the dead .  he   d said things when he knew they were listening  and sometimes they   d been clearly visible  but apart from that first time  when he   d knocked on the door of the alderman   s mausoleum for a joke        will you look at this .      one of the people who   d been examining the grave had picked up the radio  which had been lodged behind a tuft of grass .      honestly  people have no respect .         does it work .      it didn   t .  a couple of days of damp grass had done for the batteries .      no .         give it to the men dumping the rubbish on the truck  then .         i   ll do it     said johnny .   he hurried off with it  keeping a lookout  trying to find one dead person among the living .      ah  johnny .      it was mr .  atterbury  leaning over the wall of the old boot works .     exciting day  isn   t it .  you started something  eh .         didn   t mean to     said johnny automatically .  things were generally his fault .      it could go either way     said mr .  atterbury .     the old railway site isn   t so good  but   things look promising  i do know that .  people have woken up .         that   s true .  a lot of people .         united consolidated don   t like fuss .  the district auditor is here  and a man from the development commission .  it could go very well .         good .  um .         yes .         i saw you on television     said johnny .     you called united consolidated public spirited and cooperative .         well  they might be .  if they   ve got no choice .  they   re a bit shifty  but we might win through .  it   s amazing what you can do with a kind word .         oh .  right .  well  then   i   ve got to go and find someone  if you don   t mind    .      there was no sign of mr .  grimm anywhere .  or any of the others .  johnny hung around for hours  with the birdwatchers and the people from the blackbury wildlife trust  who   d found a fox   s den behind william stickers   s memorial  and some japanese tourists .  no one quite knew why the japanese tourists were there  but mrs .  liberty   s grave was getting very well photographed .   eventually  though  even japanese tourists run out of film .  they took one last shot of themselves in front of william stickers   s monument and headed back toward their bus .   the cemetery emptied .  the sun began to set over the carpet warehouse .   mrs .  tachyon went past with her loaded shopping cart to wherever it was she spent her nights .   the cars left the old boot works  and only the bulldozers were left  like prehistoric monsters surprised by a sudden cold snap .   johnny sidled up to the forlorn little stone under the trees .      i know you   re here     he whispered .     you can   t leave like the others .  you have to stay .  because you   re a ghost .  a real ghost .  you   re still here  mr .  grimm .  you   re not just hanging around like the rest of them .  you   re haunting .      there was no sound .      what did you do .  were you a murderer or something .      there was still no sound .  in fact  there was even more silence than before .      sorry about the television     said johnny nervously .   more silence  so heavy and deep  it could have stuffed mattresses .   he walked away  as fast as he dared .       nine        this fuss over the cemetery   s certainly breathed a bit of life into this town     said his mother .     go and give your granddad his tray  will you .  and tell him about it .  you know he takes an interest .      granddad was watching the news in hindi .  he didn   t want to .  but the thingy for controlling the set had got lost  and everyone had forgotten how to change channels without it .      brought you your tray  granddad .         right .         you know the old cemetery .  where you showed me william stickers   s grave .         right .         well  maybe it won   t be built on now .  there was a meeting last night .         right .         i spoke up at the meeting .         right .         so it might be all right .         right .      johnny sighed .  he went back into the kitchen .      can i have an old sheet  mum .         what on earth for .         wobbler   s halloween party .  i can   t think of anything else .         there   s the one i used as a dust cover  if you   re going to cut holes in it .         thanks  mum .         it   s pink .         aaaaooow  mum .         it   s practically washed out .  no one   ll notice .     it also  as it turned out  had the remains of some flowers embroidered on one end .  johnny did his best with a pair of scissors .   he   d promised he   d go .  but he went the long way around  with the sheet in a bag  just in case the dead had come back and might see him .  and there was mr .  grimm to think about now .   after he   d been gone a few minutes  the tv started showing the news in english  which looked less interesting than the hindi news .   granddad watched it for a while and then sat up .     hey  girl  it says they   re trying to save the old cemetery .         yes  dad .         it looked like our johnny on the stage there .         yes  dad .         no one tells me anything around here .  what   s this .         chicken  dad .         right .          they were somewhere in the high plateaus of asia  where once camel trains had traded silk across five thousand miles and now madmen with guns shot one another in the various names of god .      how far to morning .         nearly there    .         what .      the dead slowed down in a mountain pass full of driving snow .      we owe the boy something .  he took an interest .  he remembered us .         zat   s absolutely correct .  conservation of energy .  besides  he   ll be worrying .         yes  but   if we go back now   we   ll become like we were  won   t we .  i can feel the weight of that gravestone now .         sylvia liberty .  you said we shouldn   t leave .         i   ve changed my mind  william .         yes .  i spent half my life being frightened of dying  and now that i   m dead  i   m going to stop being frightened     said the alderman .     besides   i   m remembering things    .      there was a murmur from the rest of the dead .      i zink ve all are     said solomon einstein .     all ze zings ve forgot ven ve vere alive           that   s the trouble with life     said the alderman .     it takes up your whole time .  i mean  i won   t say it wasn   t fun .  bits of it .  quite a lot of it  really .  in its own way .  but it wasn   t what you   d call living .            we don   t have to be frightened of the morning     said mr .  vicenti .     we don   t have to be frightened of anything .          a skeleton opened the door .      it   s me  johnny .         it   s me  bigmac .  what   re you  a gay ghost .         it   s not that pink .         the flowers are good .         come on  let me in  it   s freezing out here .         can you float and mince at the same time .         bigmac .         come on  then .      somehow  it looked as if wobbler hadn   t really put his heart into the decorations .  there were a few streamers and some rubber spiders around the place  and a bowl of the dreadful punch you always get in these circumstances  the one with the brownish bits of orange in it  and bowls full of nibbles with names like curly wigglies .  and a zucchini that looked as though it had walked into a combine harvester .      it was s   posed to be a jack o    lantern     wobbler kept telling everyone     but i couldn   t find a pumpkin .         met hannibal lecter in a dark alley  did it .     said yo less .      the plastic bats are good  aren   t they .     said wobbler .     they cost fifty pence each .  have some more punch .      there were other people there too  although in the semidarkness it was hard to make out who they thought they were .  there was someone with a lot of stitches and a bolt through his neck  but that was only nodj  who looked like that anyway .  there were a bunch from wobbler   s computer group  who could get drunk on non alcoholic alcohol and would then stagger around saying things like    i   m totally mad .     there were a couple of girls wobbler vaguely knew .  it was that sort of party .  you just knew someone would put something in the punch  and everyone would talk about school  and one of the girls    dads   d turn up at eleven o   clock and hang around looking determined and put a damper on things  as if they weren   t soaking wet already .      we could play a game     said bigmac .      not dead man   s hand     said wobbler .     not after last year .  you   re supposed to pass around grapes and stuff  not just anything you find in the fridge .         it wasn   t what it was     said one of the girls .     it was what he said it was .         all right     said johnny to yo less     i   ve been trying to work it out .  who are you .      yo less had covered half his face with white make up .  he wasn   t wearing a shirt  just his ordinary undershirt  but he   d found a piece of fake leopard skin pattern material which he   d draped over his shoulders .  and he had a black hat .      baron samedi  the voodoo god     said yo less .     i got the idea out of james bond .         that   s racial stereotyping     someone said .      no  it   s not     said yo less .     not if i   m doing it .         i   m pretty sure baron samedi didn   t wear a bowler hat     said johnny .     i   m pretty sure it was a top hat .  a bowler hat makes you look a bit like you   re going to an office somewhere .         i can   t help it   it was all i could get .         maybe he   s baron samedi  the voodoo god of accountants     said wobbler .   for a moment johnny thought of mr .  grimm  his face was all one color  but he looked like a voodoo god of accountants if ever there was one .      in the film he was all mixed up with tarot cards and stuff     said bigmac .      not really     said johnny  waking up .     tarot cards are european occult .  voodoo is african occult .         don   t be stupid  it   s american     said wobbler .      no  american occult is elvis presley not being dead and that sort of thing     said yo less .     voodoo is basically west african with a bit of christian influence .  i looked it up .         i   ve got some ordinary cards     said wobbler .      no messing around with cards     said baron yo less severely .     my mum   d go ballistic .         what about the thing with the letters and glasses .         the postman .         you know what i mean .         no .  that could lead to dark forces taking over     said baron yo less .     it   s as bad as ouija boards .      someone put on a tape and started to dance .  johnny stared into his glass of horrible punch .  there was an orange seed floating in it .   cards and boards  he thought .  and the dead .  that   s not dark forces .  making a fuss about cards and heavy metal and going on about dungeons and dragons stuff because it   s got demon gods in it is like guarding the door when it is really coming up through the floorboards .  real dark forces   aren   t dark .  they   re sort of gray  like mr .  grimm .  they take all the color out of life  they take a town like blackbury and turn it into frightened streets and plastic signs and bright new futures and towers where no one wants to live and no one really does live .  the dead seem more alive than us .  and everyone becomes gray and turns into numbers and then  somewhere  someone starts to do arithmetic    .   the demon god yoth ziggurat might want to chop your soul up into little pieces  but at least he doesn   t tell you that you haven   t got one .   and at least you   ve got half a chance of finding a magic sword .   he kept thinking about mr .  grimm .  even the dead kept away from him .   he woke up to hear wobbler say     we could go trick or treating .         my mother says that   s no better than begging     said yo less .      hah  it   s worse than that around joshua n   clement     said bigmac .     it   s called     give us a buck or kiss your tires night night .            we could do it around here     said wobbler .     or we could go down the mall .         that   ll just be full of kids in costume running around screaming .         a few more won   t hurt  then     said johnny .      all right  then  everybody     wobbler said .     come on    .          in fact neil armstrong mall was full of all the other people who   d run out of ideas at halloween parties .  they wandered around in groups looking at one another   s clothes and talking  which was pretty much what people did normally in any case  except that tonight the mall looked like transylvania on late shopping night .   zombies lurched under the sodium lights .  witches walked around in groups and giggled at the boys .  grinning pumpkins bobbed on the escalators .  vampires gibbered among the sad indoor trees  and kept fumbling their false fangs back in .  mrs .  tachyon rummaged for cans in the litter bins .   johnny   s pink ghost outfit caused a lot of interest .      seen any dead around lately .     said baron yo less  when wobbler and bigmac had gone off to buy some snacks .      hundreds     said johnny .      you know what i mean .         no .  not them .  i   m worried something may have happened to them .         they   re dead .  if they exist  that is     said yo less .     it   s not as though they could get run over or something .  if you   ve saved their cemetery for them  they probably just aren   t bothering to talk to you anymore .  that   s probably what it is .  i think           anyone want a raspberry snake .     said wobbler  rustling a large paper bag .     the skulls are good  too .         i   m going home     said johnny .     there   s something wrong  and i don   t know what it is .      a ten year old bride of dracula flapped past .      i   ve got to admit this isn   t big fun     said wobbler .     tell you what   there   s night of the vampire nerds on tv .  we could go and watch that .         what about everyone else .     said bigmac .  the rest of the party had drifted off .      oh  well  they know where i live     said wobbler philosophically  as a blood streaked ghoul went by eating an ice cream .      i don   t believe in vampire nerds     said bigmac  as they stepped into the night air .  it was a lot colder now  and the mist was coming back .      oh  i dunno     said wobbler .     it   s the sort we   d have around here .         they   d suck fruit juice     said yo less .      their mum   d make them go to bed late     said bigmac  but they had to think about that .      why are we going this way .     said wobbler .     this isn   t the way back .         it   s foggy  too     said bigmac .      it   s just the mist off the canal     said johnny .   wobbler stopped .      oh  no     he said .      it   s quicker this way     said johnny .      oh  yes .  quicker .  oh  yes .  because i   m gonna run .         don   t be stupid .         it   s halloween .         so what .  you   re dressed up as dracula   what   re you worried about .         i   m not going past there tonight .         it   s no different than going past during the day .         all right  it   s the same  but i   m different .         scared .     said bigmac .      what .  me .  scared .  huh .  me .  i   m not scared .         actually  it is a bit risky     said baron yo less .      yes  risky     said wobbler hurriedly .      i mean  you never know     said yo less .      never know     wobbler echoed .      look  it   s a street in our town .  there   s lights and a phone booth and everything     said johnny .     i just   i won   t be happy until i   ve checked  okay .  anyway  there   s four of us  after all .         that just means something bad can happen four times     said wobbler .   but they   d been walking as they talked  now the little light in the phone booth loomed in the fog like a blurred star .   the other three went quiet .  the fog hushed all sounds .   johnny listened .  there wasn   t even that blotting paper silence that the dead made .      see .     he whispered .     i said        someone coughed  a long way off .  all four boys suddenly tried to occupy the same spot .      dead people don   t cough .     hissed johnny .      then someone   s in the cemetery .     said yo less .      body snatchers .     said wobbler .      i   ve read about this in the papers .     whispered wobbler .     people digging up graves for satanic rites .         shut up .     said johnny .  they sagged .     sounded to me like it came from the old boot factory     he said .      but it   s the middle of the night     said yo less .   they crept forward .  there was a dim shape pulled onto the pavement where the streetlights barely shone .      it   s a van     said johnny .     there .  count dracula never drove a van .      bigmac tried to grin .     unless he was a vanpire        there was a metallic clink somewhere in the fog .      wobbler .     said johnny  in what he hoped was a calm voice .      yes .         you said you were going to run .  go around to mr .  atterbury   s house right now and tell him to come here .         what .  by myself .         you   ll run faster if you   re by yourself .         right .      wobbler gave them a frightened look and vanished .      what  exactly  are we doing .     asked yo less  as the other two peered into the fog .   there was no mistaking the noise this time .  it was wrapped about with fog  but it was definitely the sound of a big diesel engine starting up .      someone   s swiping a bulldozer .     said bigmac .      i wish that   s what they were doing     said johnny     but i don   t think they are .  come on  will you .         listen  if someone   s driving a bulldozer without lights in the fog  i   m not hanging around .     said yo less .   lights came on  fifty yards away .  they didn   t show much .  they just lit up two cones of fog .      is that better .     said johnny .      no .      the lights ground forward .  the machine was bumping toward the cemetery railings .  old buddleia bushes and dead stinging nettles smashed under the treads  and there was a clang as the blade hit the low wall .   johnny ran alongside the machine and shouted     oi .      the engine stopped .      run away .     hissed johnny to yo less .     go on .  tell someone what   s happening .      a man unfolded himself from the cab and jumped down .  he advanced toward the boys  waving a finger .      you kids     he said     are in real trouble .      johnny backed away  and someone grabbed his shoulders .      you heard the man     said a voice by his ear .     it   s your fault  this .  so you   d better not have seen anything  right .  because we know where you live   oh  no you don   t .     a hand shot out and grabbed yo less as he tried to back away .      know what i think .     said the man who had been driving the bulldozer .     i think it   s lucky we happened to be passing and found    em messing around  eh .  shame they   d driven it right through the place already  eh .  kids today  eh .      a half brick sailed past johnny   s face and hit the man beside him on the shoulder .      what the           i   ll smash your      head in .  i   ll smash your      head in .      bigmac emerged from the fog .  he looked terrifying .  he reached beside him  yanked a railing from the broken wall  and started to whirl it round his head as he advanced .      you what .  you what .  you what .  i   m bonkers  me .      then he started to run forward .      aaaaaaarrrrrr        and it dawned on all four people at once that he wasn   t going to stop .       ten     bigmac bounded over the rubble  an enraged skinhead skeleton .      get him .         you get him .      the railing smacked into the side of the bulldozer  and bigmac leaped .   even fighting mad  he was still bigmac  and the driver was a large man .  but what bigmac had going for him was that he was  just for a few seconds  unstoppable .  if the man had managed to get one good punch in  that would have been it  but there seemed to be too many arms and legs in the way  and also bigmac was trying to bite his ear .   even so     but a pair of headlights appeared near the gate and started to bounce up and down in a way that suggested a car being driven at high speed across rough ground .   the man holding johnny let go and vanished into the fog .  the other one thumped bigmac hard in the stomach and followed him .   the car skidded to a halt  and a fat vampire leaped out  shouting    make my night  make my night .      mr .  atterbury unfolded himself a little more sedately from the driver   s seat .      it   s all right  they   re gone     said johnny .     we   ll never find them in this fog .      there was the sound of an engine starting somewhere in the distance  and then wheels skidded out onto the unseen road .      but i got the number .     shouted wobbler  hopping from foot to foot .     i din   t have a pen  so i huffed on the window and wrote it in the huff .         they were going to drive the bulldozer into the cemetery .     said yo less .      right in the huff  look .         dear me  i expect a bit more than this of united consolidated     said mr .  atterbury .     hadn   t we better see to your friend .      bigmac was kneeling on the ground  making small    oof  oof    noises .      i   ll have to keep huffing on it to keep them there  mind .         you all right  bigmac .      they knelt down beside him .  he was wheezing with his asthma .      i   i really frightened him   yeah .     he managed .      right  right     said johnny .     come on  we   ll give you a hand up    .         i jus    saw them there           how do you feel .         jus    winded .         hang on  i   ve got to go and huff on it again           help him into the car .            s all right           i   ll drive him to the hospital  just in case .         no .      bigmac pushed them away and rose unsteadily to his feet .         m all right     he said .     tough as old boots  me .      red and blue lights bloomed in the fog and a police siren dee dah ed once or twice and then stopped out of embarrassment .      ah     said mr .  atterbury .     i rather think my wife got a bit excited about things and phoned the police .  er   bigmac  isn   t it .  would you recognize those men if you saw them again .         sure .  one of    em   s got teethmarks in his ear .     bigmac suddenly had the hunted look of one who has never quite seen eye to eye with the constabulary .     but i ain   t going in any police station .  no way .      mr .  atterbury straightened up as the police car crunched to a halt .      i think it might be a good idea if i do most of the talking     he said when sergeant comely stepped out into the night .     ah  ray     he said .     glad you could drop by .  can i have a word .      the boys stood in a huddle  watching as the men walked over to the bulldozer and then inspected the remains of the wall .      we   re going to be in trouble     said bigmac .     old comely   s probably going to do me for ear biting .  or stealing the bulldozer .  you wait .      wobbler tapped johnny on the shoulder .      you knew something was going to happen     he said .      yes .  don   t know how .      they watched the policemen peer into mr .  atterbury   s car for a moment .      he   s reading my huff     said wobbler .     that was lateral thinking  that was .      then comely went back to the police car .  they heard him speaking into the radio .      no .  i say again .  that   s h for hirsute  w for wagner   wagner .  wagner .  no .  w as in westphalia  a for aardvark        mr .  atterbury appeared from the direction of the bulldozer  waving a pair of pliers .      i don   t think it   s going to move again tonight     he said .      what   s going to happen .     said johnny .      not sure .  we can probably trace the van .  i think i   ve persuaded sergeant comely that we ought to deal with this quietly  for now .  he   ll take statements from you  though .  that might be enough .         were they from united consolidated .      the old man shrugged .      perhaps someone thought everything might be a lot simpler if the cemetery wasn   t worth saving     he said .     perhaps a couple of likely lads were slipped a handful of cash to do   er   a halloween prank        there was a burst of noise from the police radio .      we   ve stopped a van on the east slate road     the sergeant called out .     sounds like our lads .         well done  said pc plonk     said yo less  in a hollow voice .     you have captured the whole gang .  good work  fumbling four .  and they all went home for tea and cakes .         it would help if you   d come along to the police station  bigmac     said mr .  atterbury .      no way .         i   ll come along with you .  and one of your friends could come  too .         it   d really help     said johnny .      i   ll go with you     said yo less .      and then     said mr .  atterbury     i   m going to take considerable pleasure in ringing up the chairman of united consolidated .  considerable pleasure .          it was ten minutes later .  bigmac had gone to the police station  accompanied by yo less and mr .  atterbury and an assurance that he wasn   t going to be asked any questions about certain other minor matters relating to things like cars not being where the owners had expected them to be  and other things of that nature .   the sodium lights of blackbury glowed in the fog  which was thinning out a bit now .  they made the darkness beyond the carpet warehouse a lot deeper and much darker .      well  that   s it  then     said wobbler .     game over .  let   s go home .      the fog was being torn apart by the wind .  it was even possible to see the moon through the flying streamers .      come on     he repeated .      it   s still not right     said johnny .     it can   t end like this .         best ending     said wobbler .     just like yo less said .  nasty men foiled .  kids save the day .  everyone gets a bun .      the abandoned bulldozer seemed a lot bigger in this pale light .   the air had a fizz to it .      something   s going to happen     said johnny  running toward the cemetery .      now  look           come on .         no .  not in there .      johnny turned around .      and you   re pretending to be a vampire .         but           come on  the railings have been knocked down .         but it   s nearly midnight .  and there   s dead people in there .         well .  we   re all dead  sooner or later .         yeah  but me  i   d like it to be later  thank you .      johnny could feel it all around him   a squashed feel to things  like the air gets before a thunderstorm .  it cracked off the buckled gravestones and tingled on the dusty shrubberies .   the fog was pouring away now  as if it was trying to escape from something .  the moon shone out of a damp blue black sky casting darker shadows on the ground .   north drive and east way   they were still there  but they didn   t look the same now .  they belonged somewhere else   somewhere where people didn   t take the roads of the dead and give them the names of the streets of the living        wobbler .     said johnny  without looking around .      yeah .         you there .         yeah .         thanks .      he could feel something lifting off him  like a heavy blanket .  he was amazed his feet still touched the ground .   he ran along north drive  to the little area where all the dead roads met .   there was someone already there .   she spun around with her arms out and her eyes blissfully shut  the gravel crunching under her feet  the moonlight glinting off her ancient hat .  all alone  twirling and twirling  mrs .  tachyon danced in the night .   not all alone     the air sparkled .  glowing lines  blue as electricity  thin as smoke  poured out of the clear sky .  where they touched the fingers of the dancing woman  they stretched out and broke  then re formed .   they crawled over the grass .  they whirred through the air .  the whole cemetery was alive with pale blue comets .   alive     mrs .  tachyon   s feet were off the ground .   johnny looked at his own fingers .  there was a blue glow crackling over his right hand  like saint elmo   s fire .  it sparkled as he waved it toward the stars and felt his feet leave the gravel path .      ooowwwwwah .      the lights spun him around and let him drift gently back down .      who are you .      a line of fire screamed across the night and then exploded .  sparks flew out and traced lines in the air  which took on  as though it was outlined in neon  a familiar shape .      well  until tonight     it said  blue fire sizzling in his beard     i thought i was william stickers .  watch this .      blue glows arched over the gravestones again and clustered around the dark bulk of the bulldozer  flowing across it so that it glowed .   the engine started .   there was a clash of gears .   it moved forward .  the railings clanged and cart wheeled away .  the brick wall crumbled .   lights orbited around the bulldozer as it plowed onward .      hey .  stop .      metal groaned .  the engine note dropped to a dull  insistent throbbing .   the lights turned to look at johnny .  he could feel their attention .      what are you doing .      a light burst into a glittering diagram of the alderman .      isn   t this what people wanted .     he said .     we don   t need it anymore .  so if anyone   s going to do it  it should be us .  that   s only right .         but you said this was your place .     said johnny .   mrs .  sylvia liberty outlined herself in the air .      we have left nothing there     she said     of any importance .         force of habit     said william stickers     is what has subjugated the working man for too long .  i was right about that  anyway .         the disgusting bolshevik  although he needs a shave  is quite correct     said mrs .  liberty .  and then she laughed .     it seems to me we   ve spent far too long moping around because of what we   re not  without any consideration of what we might be .         chronologically gifted     said mr .  einstein  crackling into existence .      dimensionally advantaged     said mr .  fletcher  sparkling like a flashbulb .      bodily unencumbered     said the alderman .      into overtime     said stanley roundway .      enhanced     said mr .  vicenti .      we had to find it out     said mr .  fletcher .     you have to find it out .  you have to forget who you were .  that   s the first step .  and stop being frightened of old ghosts .  then you   ve got room to find out what you are .  what you can be .         so we   re off     said the alderman .      where to .         we don   t know .  it is going to be very interesting to find out     said solomon einstein .      but   but   we   ve saved the cemetery .     said johnny .     we had a meeting .  and bigmac   and i spoke up and   there   s been things on the television and people have really been talking about this place .  no one   s going to build anything on it .  there   s been birdwatchers here and everything .  turn the machine off .  we   ve saved the cemetery .         but we don   t need it anymore     said the alderman .      we do .      the dead looked at him .      we do     johnny repeated .     we   need it to be there .      the diesel engine chugged .  the machine vibrated .  the dead  if that   s what they still were  seemed to be thinking .   then solomon einstein nodded .      this iss of course very true     he said in his excited squeaky voice .     it all balances  you see .  the living have to remember  the dead have to forget .  conservation of energy .      the bulldozer   s engine stuttered into silence .   mr .  vicenti held up a hand .  it glowed like a firework .      we came back to say good bye .  and thank you     he said .      i hardly did anything .         you listened .  you tried .  you were there .  you can get medals just for being there .  people forget the people who were just there .         yes .  i know .         but now   we must be somewhere else .         no   don   t go yet     said johnny .     i have to ask you        mr .  vicenti turned .      yes .         um           yes .         are there   angels involved .  you know .  or   devils and things .  a lot of people would like to know .         oh  no .  i don   t think so .  that sort of thing   no .  that   s for the living .  no .      the alderman rubbed his spectral hands .     i rather think it   s going to be a lot more interesting than that .      the dead were walking away  some of them fading back into shining smoke as they moved .   some were heading for the canal .  there was a boat there .  it looked vaguely like a gondola .  a dark figure stood at one end  leaning on a pole that vanished into the water .      this is my lift     said william stickers .      it looks a bit   spooky .  no offense meant     said johnny .      well  i thought i   d give it a try .  if i don   t like it  i   ll go somewhere else     said william stickers  stepping aboard .     off we go  comrade .      right  said the ferryman .   the boat moved away from the bank .  the canal was only a few yards wide  but the boat seemed to be drifting off a long  long way    .   voices came back over the waters .      you know  an outboard motor on this and it   d go like a bird .      i like it the way it is  mr .  stickers .      what   s the pay like .      shocking .      i wouldn   t stand for it  if i was you           i   m not sure where he   s going     said the alderman     but he   s certainly going to reorganize things when he gets there .  bit of a traditional thinker  our william .      there was a click and hum from farther along the bank .  einstein and fletcher were sitting proudly in some sort of   well  it looked partly like an electronic circuit diagram  and partly like a machine  and partly like mathematics would look if it was solid .  it glowed and fizzled .      good  isn   t it .     said mr .  fletcher .     you   ve heard of a train of thought .         this is a flight of the imagination     said solomon einstein .      we   re going to have a good look at some things .         that   s right .  starting with everything .      mr .  fletcher thumped the machine happily .      right .  the sky   s the limit  mr .  einstein .         not even that  mr .  fletcher .      the lines grew bright  drew together  became more like a diagram .  and vanished .  just before they vanished  though  they seemed to be accelerating .   and then there were three .      did i see them waving .     said mrs .  liberty .      and particling  i shouldn   t wonder     said the alderman .     come  sylvia .  i feel a more down to earth mode of transport would be suitable for us .      he took her hand .  they ignored johnny and stepped onto the black waters of the canal .   and sank  slowly  leaving a pearly sheen on the water that gradually faded away .   then there was the sound of a motor starting up .   out of the water  transparent as a bubble  the spirit of the dead ford capri rose gently toward the sky .   the alderman wound down an invisible window .      mrs .  liberty thinks we ought to tell you something     he said .     but   it   s hard to explain  you know .         what is .     said johnny .      by the way  why are you wearing a pink sheet .         um           i expect it   s not important .         yes .         well       the car turned slowly  johnny could see the moon through it .     you know those games where this ball runs up and bounces around and ends up in a slot at the bottom .         pinball machines .         is that what they   re called now .         i think so .         oh .  right .     the alderman nodded .     well   when you   re bouncing around from pin to pin  it is probably very difficult to know that outside the game there   s a room and outside the room there   s a town and outside the town there   s a country and outside the country there   s a world and outside the world there   s a billion trillion stars and that   s only the start of it   but it   s there  d   you see .  once you know about it  you can stop worrying about the slot at the bottom .  and you might bounce around a good deal longer .         i   ll   try to remember it .         good man .  well  we   d better be going    .      ghostly gears went crunch .  the car juddered .      drat the thing .  ah   be seeing you        it rose gently  turned toward the east  and sped away and up    .   and then there was one .      well  i think i might as well be off     said mr .  vicenti .  he produced a top hat and an old fashioned walking cane out of thin air .      why are you all leaving .     said johnny .      oh  yes .  it   s judgment day     said mr .  vicenti .     we decided .         i thought that was chariots and things .         i think you   ll have to use your own judgment on that one .  no point in waiting for what you   ve already got .  it   s different for everybody  you see .  enjoy looking after the cemetery .  they   re places for the living  after all .      mr .  vicenti pulled on a pair of white gloves and pressed an invisible elevator button .  he began to rise .  white feathers cascaded out of his sleeves .      dear me     he said  and opened his jacket .     go on  away with you .  all of you .  shoo .      half a dozen ghostly pigeons untangled themselves and rocketed off into the dawn .      there .  that proves it .  you can escape from anything  eventually     he called down .  johnny just managed to hear him add        although i will admit that three sets of manacles  twenty feet of chain  and a canvas sack can present a considerable amount of difficulty in certain circumstances    .      the light glinted off his hat .   and then there was   one .   johnny turned around .   mr .  grimm was standing neatly in the middle of the path  with his neat hands neatly folded .  darkness surrounded him like a fog .  he was watching the sky .  johnny had never seen such an expression    .   he remembered the time  many years ago  when bigmac had had a party and hadn   t invited him .  he   d said afterward     well  of course not .  i knew you   d come  you didn   t have to be asked  you didn   t need to be asked  you could just have turned up .     but everyone else was going to go  and was talking about going  and he   d felt like a pit had opened up in his life .  that sort of thing was pretty awful when you were seven .   it looked much  much worse when you were dead .   mr .  grimm saw johnny staring at him .      huh     he said  pulling himself together .     they   ll be sorry .         i   m going to find out about you  mr .  grimm     said johnny .      nothing to find out     snapped the ghost .   johnny walked through him .  there was a chilly moment  and then mr .  grimm was gone .   and then there were none .   real night flowed back in .  the sounds of the town  the distant hum of the traffic  filled the space taken up by the silence .   johnny walked back along the gravel path .      wobbler .     he whispered .     wobbler .      he found him crouched behind a gravestone with his eyes shut .      come on     said johnny .      look  i           everything   s okay .         it was fireworks  right .     said wobbler .  his count dracula make up was streaked and smudged  and he   d lost his fangs .     someone was letting some fireworks off  yes .         that   s right .         of course  i wasn   t scared .         no .         but those things can be dangerous    .         oh  that   s right .      they turned as a rattling sound started up behind them .  mrs .  tachyon appeared  pushing her shopping cart  the wheels bounced and skidded on the gravel .   she ignored both of them .  they stepped aside hurriedly as the cart  one wheel squeaking  vanished into the gloom .   then they walked home through the morning mists .       eleven     as tommy atkins had once said  things aren   t necessarily over just because they   ve stopped .   there was bigmac  for a start .  yo less had gone home with him  and bigmac   s brother had been waiting up and had started on at him and bigmac had looked at him strangely for a few seconds and then hit him so hard that he knocked him out .  yo less said  with awe in his voice  that it   d been so hard that the word    tah    was printed in pen on the brother   s chin .  and then he   d growled at clint and the dog had hidden under the sofa .  so yo less had to get his mother out of bed to bring her car around to carry bigmac   s suitcase  three tropical fish tanks  and two hundred copies of guns and ammo back to her spare room .   and there was the generous donation to the blackbury volunteers by united amalgamated consolidated holdings .  as mr .  atterbury said  it   s amazing what you can do with a kind word  provided you   ve also got a big stick .   the cemetery was already looking more lived in .  there were endless arguments among the volunteers who wanted it to be habitat and the ones who wanted it to be ecology and a middle group who just wanted it to be clean and tidy  but at least it was wanted  which seemed to johnny to be the most important thing .   it took johnny a week to find what he wanted  and when he found it  he took it along to the cemetery after school  when no one was about .  there was frost on the ground .      mr .  grimm .      he found him by the canal  sitting staring at the water .      mr .  grimm .         go away .  you   re dangerous .         i thought you   d be a bit   lonely .  so i bought you this .      he opened the bag .      mr .  atterbury helped     he said .     he phoned around to some of his friends who   ve got electrical shops .  it   s been repaired .  it   ll work until the batteries die  and then i thought maybe it   d work on ghost batteries .         what is it .         a very small television     said johnny .     i thought i could put it right in a bush or somewhere and no one   ll know it   s there except you .         what are you doing this for .     said mr .  grimm suspiciously .      because i looked you up in the newspaper .  may the twenty first  nineteen twenty seven .  there wasn   t very much .  just the bit about them finding   you in the canal  and the coroner   s inquest .         oh .  poking around  eh .  and what do you think you know about anything .         nothing .         i don   t have to explain .         is that why you couldn   t leave with the others .         what .  i can leave whenever i like     said the ghost of mr .  grimm very quickly .     if i   m staying here  it   s because i want to be here .  i know my place .  i know how to do the right thing .  i could leave whenever i want .  but i   ve got more pride than that .  people like you don   t understand that .  you don   t take life seriously .      it hadn   t been a long report in the paper .  mr .  vicenti was right .  in those days  some things didn   t get a lot of reporting .  mr .  grimm had been a respectable citizen  keeping his head down  a man at the back of the crowd  and then his business had failed and there   d been some other trouble involving money  and then there   d been the canal .  mr .  grimm had taken life very seriously  starting with his own .   people didn   t talk much about that sort of thing in those days .  suicide was against the law .  johnny had wondered why .  it meant that if you missed  or the gas ran out  or the rope broke  you could get locked up in prison to show you that life was really very jolly and thoroughly worth living .   mr .  grimm sat with his hands clasped around his knees .   johnny realized that he could think of nothing to say  so he said nothing .   instead  he wedged the little pocket television deep in a bush  where no one  not even the keenest bird watcher  would find it .      can you turn it on with your mind .     he said .      who says i shall want to .      the picture came on  and there was the faint tinkly sound of the familiar signature tune .      let   s see     said johnny .     you   ve missed a week    .  mrs .  swede has just found but janine didn   t go to the party    .  mr .  hatt has fired jason from the shop because he thinks he took the money   and           i see .         so   i   ll be off  then  shall i .         right .      johnny backed away .      i   m sure the hours   ll just fly by .         right .         so   cheerio  then .         right .         mr .  grimm .     johnny wanted to say  you can leave anytime you want .  but there seemed to be no point .      right .      johnny watched for a while  and then turned and walked away .  the other three were waiting for him by the phone booth .      was he there .     said yo less .      yes .         what   s he doing now .         watching television     said johnny .      i expect ghosts do that a lot     said wobbler .         spect so .         you all right .         just thinking about the difference between heaven and hell .         that doesn   t sound like    all right    to me .      johnny blinked .  and looked around at the world .  it was  not to put too fine a point on it  wonderful .  which wasn   t the same as nice .  it wasn   t even the same as good .  but it was full of   stuff .  you   d never get to the end of it .  it was always springing new things on you    .      yeah     he said .     all right .  what shall we do now .          about the
