about david  lucky  starr and his battles against malefactors within the solar system .  each of the six took place in a different region of the system  and in each case i made use of the astronomical facts   as they were then known .   now  a quarter century later  fawcett is bringing out the novels in new editions  but what a quarter century it has been .  more has been learned about the worlds of our solar system hi this last quarter century than in all the thousands of years that went before .   lucky starr and the rings of saturn was written in       but in       a french astronomer  audouin dollfus  discovered a tenth satellite of saturn  one that was closer to the planet than any of the others         miles closer to saturn than mimas is .  this new satellite has been named janus .   if i were writing the book today  i would certainly mention that satellite and i might have used it instead of mimas .   moreover  it was not until      that astronomers discovered that saturn was not the only ringed planet .  uranus  it turns out  also has rings .  they are very thin rings and very faint ones   but they re there .  i     would surely have mentioned that in this book if i were writing it today .   i hope my gentle readers enjoy the book anyway  as an adventure story  but please don t forget that the advance of science can outdate even the most conscientious science fiction writer and that my astronomical descriptions are no longer accurate in all respects .   isaac asimov     the invaders  the sun was a brilliant diamond in the sky  just large enough to the naked eye to be made out as something more than a star  as a tiny white hot pea sized globe .   out here in the vastness of space  near the second largest planet of the solar system  the sun gave out only one per cent of the light it cast on man s home planet .  it was still  however  the brightest object in the sky  as four thousand full moons would be .   lucky starr gazed thoughtfully at the visiplate which centered the image of the distant sun .  john bigman jones watched with him  an odd contrast to lucky s tall and rangy figure .  when john bigman jones stretched himself to his full height  he stood five foot two exactly .  but the little man did not measure himself in inches and he allowed people to call him by his middle name only  bigman .   bigman said   you know  lucky  it s nearly nine hundred million miles away .  the sun  i mean .  i ve never been out this far .    the third man in the cabin  councilman ben wes silewsky  grinned over his shoulder from his place at the controls .  he was another large man  though not as tall as lucky  and his shock of yellow hair topped      a face that had grown space brown in the service of the council of science .   he said   what s the matter  bigman .  scared way out here .    bigman squawked   sands of mars  wess  you get your hands off those controls and say that again .    he had dodged around lucky and was making for the councilman  when lucky s hands came down on bigman s shoulders and lifted him bodily .  big man s legs still pumped  as though carrying him toward wess at a charge  but lucky put his mars born friend back in his original position .    stay put  bigman .     but  lucky  you heard him .  this long cobber  thinks there s more to a man just because there s  more of him .  if that wess is six feet tall  that just  means there s an extra foot of flab     all right  bigman   said lucky .   and  wess  let s save the humor for the sirians .    he spoke quietly to both  but there was no questioning his authority .   bigman cleared his throat and said   where s mars .     on the other side of the sun from us .     wouldn t you know   said the little fellow disgustedly .  then  brightening   but hold on  lucky  we re a hundred million miles below the plane of the ecliptic .  we ought to be able to see mars below the sun  peeking out from behind  sort of .     uh huh  we should .  actually  it s a degree or so away from the sun  but that s close enough for it to be drowned out in the glare .  you can make out earth  though  i think .        bigman allowed a look of haughty disgust to cross his face .   who in space wants to see earth .  there isn t anything there but people  mostly groundhogs who ve never even been a hundred miles off the surface .  i wouldn t look at it if that were all there was in the sky to look at .  you let wess look at it that s his speed .    he walked moodily away from the visiplate .   wess said   hey  lucky  how about getting saturn on and taking a good look at it from this angle .  come on  i ve been promising myself a treat .     i don t know   said lucky   that the sight of saturn these days is exactly what you might call a treat .    he said it lightly  but for a moment silence fell uneasily within the confined pilot room of the shooting starr .   all three felt the change in atmosphere .  saturn meant danger .  saturn had taken on a new face of doom to the peoples of the terrestrial federation .  to six billion people on earth  to additional millions on mars  the moon  and venus  to scientific stations on mercury  ceres  and the outer moons of jupiter  saturn had become something newly and unexpectedly deadly .   lucky was the first to shrug off that moment of depression  and  obedient to the touch of his fingers  the sensitive electronic scanners set into the hull of the shooting starr rotated smoothly on their universal gimbals .  as that happened  the field of vision in the visiplate shifted .   the stars marched across the visiplate in steady      procession  and bigman said with a curl of hatred in his upper lip   any of those things sirius  lucky .     no   said lucky   we re working through the southern celestial hemisphere and sirius is in the northern .  would you like to see canopus .     no   said bigman .   why should i .     i just thought you might be interested .  it s the second brightest star and you could pretend it was sirius .   lucky smiled slightly .  it always amused him that the patriotic bigman should be so annoyed because sirius  home star of the great enemies of the solar system  though themselves descendants of earth men   was the brightest star in earth s heavens .   bigman said   very funny .  come on  lucky  let s see saturn  and then when we get back to earth you can get on some comedy show and panic everybody .    the stars kept their smooth motion  then slowed and stopped .  lucky said   there it is   unmagnified  too .    wess locked the controls and twirled in the pilot s seat so that he might see also .   it was a half moon in appearance  somewhat bulging into more than half  just large enough to be seen as such  bright with a soft yellow light that was dimmer in the center than along the edges .    how far away are we .   bigman asked in astonishment .   lucky said   about a hundred million miles  i think .     something s wrong   bigman said .   where are the rings .  i ve been counting on a good look .    the shooting starr was high above the south pole of       saturn .  from that position it should see the rings broad on .   lucky said   the rings are blurred into the globe of the planet  bigman  because of the distance .  suppose we magnify the image and take a closer look .    the spot of light that was saturn expanded and stretched in every direction  growing .  and the half moon that it had seemed to be broke up into three segments .   there was still a central globe  half mooned .  around it  however  touching the globe at no point  was a circularly curved ribbon of light  divided into two unequal halves by a dark line .  as the ribbon curved about saturn and entered its shadow  it was cut off in darkness .    yes  sir  bigman   said wess  lecturing   saturn itself is only seventy eight thousand miles in diameter .  at a hundred million miles  it would just be a dot of light  but count in the rings and there are nearly two hundred thousand miles of reflecting surface from one end to the other .     i know all that   said bigman indignantly .    and what s more   continued wess  unheeding   at a hundred million miles  the seven thousand mile break between saturn s surface and the innermost portion of the rings just couldn t be seen  let alone the twenty five hundred mile break that divides the rings in two .  that black line is called cassini s division  you know  bigman .     i said i know   roared bigman .   listen  lucky  that cobber is trying to make out i didn t go to school .  maybe i didn t get much schooling  but there      isn t anything he has to tell me about space .  say the word  lucky  say you ll let him stop hiding behind you and i ll squash him like a bug .    lucky said   you can make out titan .    at once bigman and wess said in chorus   where .     right there .   titan showed as a tiny half moon about the size  under current magnification  that saturn and its ring system had appeared to be without magnification .  it was near the edge of the visiplate .   titan was the only sizable moon in the sarurnian system .  but it wasn t its size that made wess stare at it with curiosity and bigman with hate .   it was  instead  that the three were almost certain that titan was the only world in the solar system populated by men who did not acknowledge the over lordship of earth .  suddenly and unexpectedly it had been revealed as a world of the enemy .   it brought the danger suddenly closer .   when do we get inside the saturnian system  lucky .    lucky said   there s no real definition as to what is the saturnian system  bigman .  most people consider a world s system to include all the space out to the distance where the farthermost body is moving under the gravitational influence of that world .  if that s so  we re still outside the saturnian system .     the sirians say  though   began wess .    to sun center with the sirian cobbers .   roared bigman  slapping his high boots in anger .   who cares what they say .   he slapped his boots again as though every sirian in the system were under the force of his blows .  his boots were the most truly martian thing about him .  their raucous coloring  orange and      black in a curving checkerboard design  was the loud proclamation that their owner had been born and bred among the martian farms and domed cities .   lucky blanked out the visiplate .  the detectors on the ship s hulls retracted  leaving the ship s outer skin smooth  gleaming  and unbroken except for the bulge that ringed the stern and held the shooting starr s agrav  attachment .   lucky said   we can t allow ourselves the luxury of the who cares what they say attitude  bigman .  at the moment the sirians have the upper hand .  maybe we ll get them out of the solar system eventually  but right now the only thing we can do is to play it their way for the while .    bigman muttered rebelliously   we re in our own system .     sure  but sirius is occupying this part of it and  pending an interstellar conference  there isn t anything earth can do about it  unless it s willing to start a war .    there was nothing to be said to that .  wess returned to his controls  and the shooting starr  with minimum expenditure of thrust  making use of saturn s gravity to the maximum  continued to sink rapidly toward the polar regions of the planet .   down  down  deeper into the grip of what was now a sirian world  its space swarming with sirian ships some fifty trillion miles from then  home planet and only seven hundred million miles from earth .  in one giant step sirius had covered    .     per cent of the distance between itself and earth and established a military base on earth s very doorstep .     lucky starr and the moons of jupiter       if sirius were allowed to remain there  then in one sudden moment earth would sink to the status of second class power at sirius s mercy .  and the interstellar political situation was such that for the moment all of earth s giant military establishment  all of her mighty ships and weapons were helpless to deal with the situation .   only three men in one small ship  on their own initiative and unauthorized by earth  were left to try  by skill and craft  to reverse the situation  knowing that if they were caught they could be executed out of hand as spies   in their own solar system by invaders of that solar system   and that earth could not do a solitary thing to save them .      pursuit  as little as a month ago there had been no thought of the danger  no barest notion  until it exploded in the face of earth s government .  steadily and methodically the council of science had been cleaning up the nest of robot spies that had riddled earth and its possessions and whose power had been broken by lucky starr on the snows of io .    it had been a grim job and  in a way  a frightening one  for the espionage had been thorough and efficient and  moreover  had come within an ace of succeeding and damaging earth desperately .   then  at the moment when the situation seemed completely in the clear at last  a crack appeared in the healing structure  and hector conway  chief councilman  awakened lucky in the small hours one night .  he showed signs of hurried dressing  and his fine white hair was in rumpled disarray .   lucky  blinking sleep out of his eyes  offered coffee and said in amazement   great galaxy  uncle hector   lucky had called him that since his early orphaned days  when conway and augustus henree    lucky starr and the moons of jupiter .           had been his guardians    are the visiphone circuits out .     i dared not trust the visiphone  my boy .  we re in a dreadful mess .     in what way .   lucky asked the question quietly  but he removed the upper half of his pajamas and began washing .   bigman came in  stretching and yawning .   hey  what s all this mars forsaken noise about .   recognizing the chief councilman  he snapped into wakeful ness .   trouble  sir .     we ve let agent x slip through our fingers .     agent x .  the mysterious sirian .   lucky s eyes narrowed a bit .   the last i heard of him  the council had decided he didn t exist .     that was before the robot spy business turned up .   he s been clever  lucky  darned clever .  it takes a  clever spy to convince the council he doesn t exist .   i should have put you on his track  but there always  seemed something else you had to do .  anyway         yes .     you know how all this robot spy business showed there must be a central clearing agency for the information being gathered and that it pointed to a position on earth itself as the location of the agency .  that got us on the trail of agent x all over again  and one of the strong possibilities for that role was a man named jack dorrance at acme air products right here in international city .     i hadn t known this .     there were many other candidates for the job .  but then dorrance took a private ship off earth and blasted right through an emergency block .  it was a stroke      .   of luck we had a councilman at port center who took the right action at once and followed .  once the report of the ship s block blasting reached us  it took only minutes to find that of all the suspects only dorrance was out of surveillance check .  he d gotten past us .  a few other matters fit in then and   anyway  he s agent x .  we re sure of it now .     very well  then  uncle hector .  where s the harm .  he s gone .     we know one more thing now .  he s taken a personal capsule with him  and we have no doubt that that capsule contains information he has managed to collect from the spy network over the federation  and  presumably  has not yet had time to deliver to his sirian bosses .  space knows exactly what he has  but there must be enough there to blow our security to pieces if it gets into sirian hands .     you say he was followed .  he has been brought back .     no .   the harassed chief councilman turned pettish .   would i be here if he had been .    lucky asked suddenly   is the ship he took equipped to make the jump .     no   cried the ruddy faced chief councilman  and he smoothed his silvered thatch of hair as though it had risen in horror at the very thought of the jump .   lucky drew a deep breath of relief too .  the jump was  of course  the leap through hyperspace  a movement that carried a ship outside ordinary space and brought it back again into a point in space many light years away  all in an instant .   in such a ship agent x would  very likely  get away .   conway said   he worked solo  his getaway was      solo .  that was part of the reason he slipped through our fingers .  and the ship he took was an interplanetary cruiser designed for one man operation .     and ships equipped with hyperspatials don t come designed for one man operation .  not yet  anyway .  but  uncle hector  if he s taken an interplanetary cruiser  then i suppose that s all he needs .    lucky had finished washing and was dressing himself rapidly .  he turned to bigman suddenly .   and how about you .  snap into your clothes  bigman .    bigman  who was sitting on the edge of the couch  virtually turned a somersault getting off it .   lucky said   probably  waiting for him somewhere in space  is a sirian manned ship that is equipped with hyperspatials .     right .  and he s got a fast ship  and with his start  and speed  we may not catch him or even get within  weapons range .  and that leaves     the shooting starr .  i m ahead of you  uncle hector .  i ll be on the shooter in an hour  and bigman with me  assuming he can drag his clothes on .  just get me the present location and course of the pursuing ships and the identifying data on agent x s ship and we ll be on our way .     good .   conway s harried face smoothed out a bit .   and  david    he used lucky s real name  as he always did in moments of emotion    you will be careful .     did you ask that of the personnel on the other ten ships too  uncle hector .   lucky asked  but his voice was soft and affectionate .   bigman had one hip boot pulled up now and the other in his hand .  he patted the small holster on the       velvety inner surface of the free boot .   are we on our way  lucky .   the light of action glowed in his eyes  and his puckish little face was wrinkled in a fierce grin .    we re on our way   said lucky  reaching out to tousle bigman s sandy hair .   we ve been rusting on earth for how long .  six weeks .  well  that s long enough .     and how   agreed bigman joyfully  and pulled on the other boot  they were out past the orbit of mars before they made satisfactory sub etheric contact with the pursuing ships  using the tightest scrambling .   it was councilman ben wessilewsky on the t . s . s .  harpoon who answered .   he shouted   lucky .  are you joining us .  swell .   his face grinned out of the visiplate and he winked .   got room to squash bigman s ugly puss into a corner of your screen .  or isn t he with you .     i m with him   howled bigman as he plunged between lucky and the transmitter .   think councilman conway would let this big lunk go anywhere without me to keep an eye on him so s he doesn t trip over his big feet .    lucky picked bigman up and tucked him  squawking  under one arm .  he said   seems to be a noisy connection  wess .  what s the position of the ship we re after .    wess  sobering  gave it .  he said   the ship s the net of space .  it s privately owned  with a legitimate record of manufacture and sale .  agent x must have bought it under a dummy name and prepared for emergency a long time ago .  it s a sweet ship and it s      been accelerating ever since it took off .  we re falling behind .     what s its power capacity .     we ve thought of that .  we ve checked the manufacturer s record of the craft  and at the rate he s expending power  he can t go much farther without either cutting motors or sacrificing maneuverability once he reaches destination .  wre counting on driving him into that exact hole .     presumably  though  he may have had the sense to rev up the ship s power capacity .     probably   said wess   but even so he can t keep this up forever .  the thing i worry about is the possibility that he might evade our mass detectors by asteroid skipping .  if he can get the breaks in the asteroid belt  we may lose him .    lucky knew that trick .  place an asteroid between yourself and a pursuer  and the pursuer s mass detectors locate the asteroid rather than the ship .  when a second asteroid comes within reach  the ship shifts from one to the other  leaving the pursuer with his instrument still fastened on the first rock .   lucky said   he s moving too fast to make the maneuver .  he d have to decelerate for half a day .     it would take a miracle   agreed wess frankly   but it took a miracle to put us on his trail  and so i almost expect another miracle to cancel the first .     what was the first miracle .  the chief said something about an emergency block .     that s right .   wess told the story crisply  and it didn t take long .  dorrance  or agent x  wess called him by either name   had slipped surveillance by using an instrument that distorted the spy beam into useless        ness .   the instrument had been located  but its workings were fused and it could not even be determined if it was of sirian manufacture .   he reached his getaway ship  the net of space  without trouble .  he was ready to take off with this proton micro reactor activated  his motor and controls checked  clear space above   and then a limping freight ship  meteor struck and unable to radio ahead  had appeared in the stratosphere  signaling desperately for a clear field .   the emergency block was flashed .  all ships in port were held fast .  any ship in the process of take off  unless it was already in actual motion  had to abandon take off procedure .   the net of space ought to have abandoned take off  but it did not .  lucky starr could well understand what the feelings of agent x aboard must have been .  the hottest item in the solar system was in his possession  and every second counted .  now that he had made his actual move he could not rely on too long a time before the council would be on his heels .  if he abandoned take off it would mean an untold delay while a riddled ship limped down and ambulances slowly emptied it .  then  when the field was cleared again  it would mean reactivation of the micro reactor and another controls check .  he could not afford the delay .   so his jet blasted and up he went .   and still agent x might have escaped .  the alarm sounded  the port police put out wild messages to the net of space  but it was councilman wessilewsky  serving a routine hitch at port center  who took proper action .  he had played his part in the search for agent x  and a ship that blasted off against an emergency block somehow smelled wildly of just enough      desperation to mean agent x .  it was the wildest possible guess  but he acted .   with the authority of the council of science behind him  which superseded all other authority except that contained in a direct order from the president of the terrestrial federation  he ordered ships into space  contacted council headquarters  and then boarded the t . s . s .  harpoon to guide the pursuit .  he had already been in space for hours before the council as a whole caught up with events .  but then the message came through that he was indeed pursuing agent x and that other ships would be joining him .   lucky listened gravely and said   it was a chance that paid off  wess .  and the right thing to do .  good work .    wess grinned .  councilmen traditionally avoided publicity and the trappings of fame  but the approval of one s fellows in the council was something greatly to be desired .   lucky said   i m moving on .  have one of your ships maintain mass contact with me .    he broke visual contact  and his strong  finely formed hands closed almost caressingly on his ship s controls   his shooting starr  which in so many ways was the sweetest vessel in space .   the shooting starr had the most powerful proton micro reactors that could be inserted into a ship of its size  reactors almost powerful enough to accelerate a battle cruiser at fleet regulation pace  reactors almost powerful enough to manage the jump through hyper space .  the ship had an ion drive that cut out most of the apparent effects of acceleration by acting simul        taneously on all atoms aboard ship  including those that made up the living bodies of lucky and bigman .  it even had an agrav  recently developed and still experimental  which enabled it to maneuver freely in the intense gravitational fields of the major planets .   and now the shooting starr s mighty motors hummed smoothly into a higher pitch  just heard  and lucky felt the slight pressure of such backward drag as was not completely compensated for by the ion drive .  the ship bounded outward into the far reaches of the solar system  faster  faster  still faster .  .  .  .   and still agent x maintained his lead  and the shooting starr gained too slowly .  with the main body of the asteroid belt far behind  lucky said   it looks bad  bigman .    bigman looked surprised .   well get him  lucky .     it s where he s heading .  i was sure it would be a sirian mother ship waiting to pick him up and make the jump homeward .  but such a ship would be either way out of the plane of the ecliptic or it would be hidden in the asteroid belt .  either way  it could count on not being detected .  but agent x stays in the ecliptic and heads beyond the asteroids .     maybe he s just trying to shake us before he heads for the ship .     maybe   said lucky   and maybe the sirians have a base on the outer planets .     come on  lucky .   the small martian cackled his derision .   right under our noses .     it s hard to see under our noses sometimes .  his course is aimed right at saturn .    bigman checked the ship s computers  which were      keeping constant tab on the other s course .  he said   look  lucky  the cobber is still on a ballistic course .  he hasn t touched his motors in twenty million miles .  maybe he s out of power .     and maybe he s saving his power for maneuvers in the saturnian system .  there ll be a heavy gravitational drag there .  at least i hope he s saving power .  great galaxy  i hope he is .   lucky s lean  handsome face was grave now and his lips were pressed together tightly .   bigman looked at him with astonishment .   sands of mars  lucky  why .     because if there is a sirian base in saturn s system  we ll need agent x to lead us to that base .  saturn has one tremendous satellite  eight sizeable ones  and dozens of splinter worlds .  it would help to know exactly where it was .    bigman frowned .   the cobber wouldn t be dumb enough to lead us there .     or maybe to let us catch him .   .   .   .  bigman  calculate his course forward to the point of intersection with saturn s orbit .    bigman did so .  it was a routine moment of work for the computer .   lucky said   and how about saturn s position at the moment of intersection .  how far will saturn be from agent x s ship .    there was the short pause necessary for getting the elements of saturn s orbit from the ephemeris  and then bigman punched it in .  a few seconds of calculation and bigman suddenly rose to his feet in alarm .   lucky .  sands of mars .    lucky did not need to ask the details .  he said    i m     .   thinking that agent x may have decided on the one way to keep from leading us to the sirian base .  if he continues on ballistic course exactly as he is now  he will strike saturn itself   and sure death .       death in the rings  there came to be no possible doubt about it as the hours passed .  even the pursuing guard ships  far behind the shooting starr  too far off to get completely accurate fixes on their mass detectors  were perturbed .   councilman wessilewsky contacted lucky starr .   space  lucky   he said   where s he going .     saturn itself  it seems   said lucky .    do you suppose a ship might be waiting for him on saturn .  i know it has thousands of miles of atmosphere with million ton pressures  and without agrav  motors they couldn t lucky .  do you suppose they  have agrav motors and forcefield bubbles .     i think he may be simply crashing to keep us from catching him .    wess said dryly   if he s all that anxious to die  why doesn t he turn and fight  force us to destroy him and maybe take one or two of us with him .     i know   said lucky   or why not short circuit his motors  leaving saturn a hundred million miles off course .  in fact  it bothers me that he should be attracting attention to saturn this way .   he fell into a thoughtful silence .           wess broke in .   well  then  can you cut him off  lucky .  space knows we re too far away .    bigman shouted from his place at the control panel   sands of mars  wess  if we rev up enough ion beam to catch him  well be moving too fast to maneuver him away from saturn .     do something .     space  there s an intelligent order   said bigman .   real helpful .   do something  .    lucky said   just keep on the move  wess .  i ll do something .    he broke contact and turned to bigman .   has he answered our signals at all  bigman .     not one word .     forget that for now and concentrate on tapping his communication beam .     i don t think he s using one  lucky .     he may at the last minute .  he ll have to take a chance then if he has anything to say at all .  meanwhile we re going for him .     how .     missile .  just a small pea shot .    it was his turn to bend over the computer .  while the net of space moved in an unpowered orbit  it required no great computation to direct a pellet at the proper moment and velocity to strike the fleeing ship .   lucky readied the pellet .  it was not designed to explode .  it didn t have to .  it was only a quarter of an inch in diameter  but the energy of the proton micro pile would hurl it outward at five hundred miles a second .  nothing in space would diminish that velocity  and the pellet would pass through the hull of the net of space as though it were butter .        lucky did not expect it would  however .  the pellet would be large enough to be picked up on its quarry s mass detectors .  the net of space would automatically correct course to avoid the pellet  and that would throw it off the direct course to saturn .  the time lost by agent x in computing the new course and correcting it back to the old one might yet allow the shooting starr to come close enough to make use of a magnetic grapple .   it all added up to a slim chance  perhaps vanishingly slim  but there seemed no other possible course of action .  lucky touched a contact .  the pellet sped out in a soundless flash  and the ship s mass detector needles jumped  then quieted rapidly  as the pellet receded .   lucky sat back .  it would take two hours for the pellet to make  or almost make  contact .  it occurred to him that agent x might be completely out of power  that the automatic procedures might direct a course change which could not be followed through  that the pellet would penetrate  blow up the ship  perhaps  and in any case leave its course unchanged and still marked for saturn .   he dismissed the idea almost at once .  it would be incredible to suppose that agent x would run out of the last bit of power at the moment his ship took on the precise collision course .  it was infinitely more likely that some power was left him .   the hours of waiting were deadly .  even hector gonway  far back on earth  grew impatient with the periodic bulletins and made direct contact on the sub ether .        but where in the saturnian system do you suppose the base might be .   he asked worriedly .    if there is one   said lucky cautiously   if what agent x is doing is not a tremendous effort to mislead us  i would say the most obvious choice is titan .  it s saturn s one really large satellite  with three times the mass of our own moon and over twice the surface area .  if the sirians have holed up underground  trying to dredge all of titan for them would take a long time .     it s hard to believe that they would have dared do this .  it s virtually an act of war .     maybe so  uncle hector  but it wasn t so long ago they tried to establish a base on ganymede .     bigman called out sharply   lucky  he s moving .    lucky looked up in surprise .   who s moving .     the net of space .  the sirian cobber .    lucky said hastily   i ll get in touch with you later  uncle hector   and broke contact .  he said   but he can t be moving  bigman .  he can t possibly have detected the pellet yet .     look and see for yourself  lucky .  i tell you he s moving .    lucky  in one stride  was at the mass detectors of the shooting starr .  for a long time now it had had a fix on the fleeing quarry .  it had been adjusted for the ship s unpowered motion through space  and the blob that represented the detectable mass had been a small bright star mark on the screen .   but now the mark was drifting .  it was a short line .   lucky s voice was softly intense .   great galaxy  of course .  now it makes sense .  how could i think his    lucky starr and the pirates of the asteroids .        first duty would be merely to avoid capture .  big   man   sure  lucky .  what .   the little martian was ready for anything .    we re being outmaneuvered .  we ve got to destroy him now even if it means crashing into saturn ourselves .   for the first time since the ion beam jets had been placed aboard the shooting starr the year before  lucky added the emergency thrusts to the main drive .  the ship reeled as every last atom of power it carried was turned into a giant thrust backward that all but burned it out .   bigman struggled for breath .   but what s it all about  lucky .     it s not saturn he s headed for  bigman .  he was just making use of the full power of its gravitational field to help him keep ahead of us .  now he s cutting around the planet to get into orbit .  it s the rings he s headed for .  saturn s rings .   the young councilman s face was drawn with tension .   keep after that communication beam  bigman .  he ll have to talk now .  now or never .    bigman bent over his wave analyzer with a quickening heartbeat  though for the life of him he could not understand why the thought of saturn s rings should so disturb lucky .   the shooting starr s pellet came nowhere near its mark  not within fifty thousand miles .  but now it was the shooting starr itself that was a pellet  striving for junction  and it  too  would miss .   lucky groaned .   we ll never make it .  there s not enough room left to make it .    saturn was a giant in the sky now  with its rings a      thin gash across its face .  saturn s yellow globe was almost at the full as the shooting starr burned toward it from the direction of the sun .   and bigman suddenly exploded   why  the dirty cobber .  he s melting into the rings  lucky .  now i see what got you about the rings .    he worked furiously at the mass detector  but it was hopeless .  as a portion of the rings came into focus  each of the countless solid masses that composed them formed its own star mark on the screen .  the screen turned pure white and the net of space was gone .   lucky shook his head .   that s not an insoluble problem .  we re close enough to get a visual fix now .  it s something else that i m sure is coming .    lucky  pale and engrossed  had the visiplate under maximum telescopic enlargement .  the net of space was a tiny metal cylinder obscured but not hidden by the material of the rings .  the individual particles in the rings were no larger than coarse gravel and were only sparkles as they caught and threw back the light of the distant sun .   bigman said   lucky .  i ve got his communications beam .  .  .  .  no  no  wait now .  .  .  .  yes  i have it .    there was a wavering voice crackling in the control room now  obscured and distorted .  bigman s deft fingers worked at the unscrambler   . trying to fit it better and ever better with the unknown characteristics of the sirian scrambling system .   the words would die out  then come back .  there was silence except for the faint hum of the recorder taking down permanently whatever came through .     .   .   .  not  .   .   .  wor  .   .   .  hither  .   .   .    quite a pause while bigman fought frantically with his detectors .           .  .  .  on trail and  .  .  .  couldn t shake  .   .   .  done for and i must transmit  .  .  .  rn s rings in normal orb  .   .   .  dy launch  .   .   .  sties of or  .  .  .  follow  .   .  .  co ordinate read thus .  .  .    it broke off altogether at that precise point  the voice  the static  everything .   bigman yelled   sands of mars  something s blown .     nothing here   said lucky .   it s the net of space   he had seen it happen two seconds after transmission ceased .  transmission through the sub ether was at virtually infinite velocity .  the light that he saw through the visiplate traveled at only         miles a second .   it took two seconds for the sight of it to reach lucky .  he saw the rear end of the net of space glow a cherry red  then open and spatter into a flower of melting metal .   bigman caught the tail end of it  and he and lucky watched wordlessly until radiation cooled the spectacle .   lucky shook his head .   that close to the rings  even though you re outside the main body of them  space has more than its share of speeding material .  maybe he had no further power to run the ship out of the way of one of those bits .  or maybe two pieces converged at him from slightly different directions .  in any case  he was a brave man and clever enemy .     i don t get it  lucky .  what was he doing .     don t you see even now .  while it was important for him not to fall into our hands  it wasn t enough for him to die .  i should have seen that earlier myself .  his most important task was to get the stolen information in his possession to sirius .  he didn t dare risk the      sub ether for reeling off what may have been thousands of words of information   with ships in pursuit and possibly tapping his beam .  he had to restrict his message to the briefest essentials and see to it that the capsule was placed bodily in the grip of the sirians .     how could he do that .     what we caught of his message contains the syllable  orb    probably for  orbit    and  dy launch   meaning  already launched .    bigman caught at lucky s arms  his small fingers pinching tightly on the other s sinewy wrists .   he launched the capsule into the rings  is that it  lucky .  it ll be a piece of gravel along with a zillion other pieces  like   a pebble on the moon   or a water drop in an ocean .     or   said lucky   like a piece of gravel in saturn s rings  which is worst of all .  of course he was destroyed before he could give the co ordinates of the orbit he had chosen for the capsule  so the sirians and we start even  and we had better make the most of that without delay .     start looking .  now .     now .  if he was ready to give the co ordinates  knowing i was hot after him  he must also have known the sirians were close by .   .  .  .  contact the ships  bigman  and give them the news .    bigman turned to the transmitter but never touched it .  the reception button was glowing with intercepted radio waves .  radio .  ordinary etheric communication .  obviously someone was close by  certainly within the saturnian system   and someone  moreover  felt not the least desire for secrecy  since a radio beam  un        like sub etheric communication  was childishly simple to tap .   lucky s eyes narrowed .   let s receive  bigman .    the voice came through with that trace of accent  that broadening of vowels and sharpening of consonants .  it was a sirian voice .   it said      fy yourselves before we are forced to place a grapple on you and take you into custody .  you have fourteen minutes to acknowledge reception .   there was a minute s pause .   by authority of the central body  you are ordered to identify yourself before we are forced to place a grapple on you and take you into custody .  you have thirteen minutes to acknowledge reception .    lucky said coldly   reception acknowledged .  this is the shooting starr of the terrestrial federation  orbiting peacefully in the spatial volume of the terrestrial federation .  no authority other than that of the federation exists in these spaces .    there was a second or two of silence  radio waves travel with only the speed of light  and the voice retorted   the authority of the terrestrial federation is not recognized on a world colonized by the sirian peoples .     which world is that .   asked lucky .    the uninhabited saturnian system has been taken possession of in the name of our government under the interstellar law that awards any uninhabited world to those who colonize it .     not any uninhabited world .  any uninhabited stellar system .    there was no answer .  the voice said stolidly        you are now within the saturnian system and you are requested to leave forthwith .  any delay in acceleration outward will result in our taking you into custody .  any further ships of the terrestrial federation entering our territory will be taken into custody without additional warning .  your acceleration out of the saturnian system must begin within eight minutes or we will take action .    bigman  his face twisted with unholy glee  whispered   let s go in and get them  lucky .  let s show them the old shooter can fight .    but lucky paid no attention .  he said into the transmitter   your remark is noted .  we do not accept sirian authority  but we choose  of our own will  to leave and will now do so .   he snapped off contact .   bigman was appalled .   sands of mars  lucky .  are we going to run from a bunch of sirians .  are we going to leave that capsule in saturn s rings for the sirians to pick up .    lucky said   right now  bigman  we have to .   his head was bent and his face was pale and strained  but there was something in his eyes that was not quite that of a man backing down .  anything but that .      between jupiter and saturn  the ranking officer in the pursuing squadron  not counting councilman wessilewsky  of course  was captain myron bernold .  he was a four striper  still under fifty  and with the physique of a man ten years younger .  his hair was graying  but his eyebrows were still their original black and his beard showed blue about his shaven chin .   he stared at the much younger lucky starr with undisguised scorn .   and you backed away .    the shooting starr  having headed inward toward the sun again  had met the ships of the squadron approximately halfway between the orbits of jupiter and saturn .  lucky had boarded the flagship .   he said now quietly   i did what was necessary to be done .     when the enemy had invaded our home system  retreat can never be necessary .  you might have been blown out of space  but you would have had time to warn us and we would have been there to take over .     with how much power left in your micro pile units  captain .    the captain flushed .   nor would it matter if we          got blasted out of space .  that couldn t have been done before we had  in our rum  alerted home base .     and started a war .     they ve started the war .  the sirians .   .  .  .  it is now my intention to move on to saturn and attack .    lucky s own rangy figure stiffened .  he was taller than the captain  and his cool glance did not waver .   as full councilman of the council of science  captain  i outrank you and you know it .  i will give no orders to attack .  the orders i give you are to return to earth .     i would sooner   the captain was visibly  struggling with his temper .  his fists clenched .  he said in a strangled voice   may i ask the reason for the order  sir .   he emphasized the syllable of respect with heavy irony .   if  sir  you would be so good as to explain the excellent reason you no doubt have  sir .  my own reasoning is based on a small tradition that the fleet happens to have .  a tradition  sir  that the fleet does not retreat  sir .    lucky said   if you want my reasons  captain  sit down and i ll give them to you .  and don t tell me the fleet does not retreat .  retreat is a part of the maneuver of war  and a commanding officer who would rather have his ships destroyed than retreat has no business in command .  i think it s only your anger that s speaking .  now  captain  are we ready to start a war .     i tell you they have already started .  they have invaded the terrestrial federation .     not exactly .  they ve occupied an unoccupied world .  the trouble is  captain  that the jump through hyperspace has made travel to the stars so simple that       earthmen have colonized the planets of other stars long before ever colonizing the remoter portions of our own solar system .     terrestrials have landed on titan .  in the  year     i know about the flight of james francis hogg .  he landed on oberon in the uranian system also .  but that was just exploration  not colonization .  the saturnian system was left empty  and an unoccupied world belongs to the first group that colonizes it .     if   said the captain heavily   that unoccupied planet or planetary system is part of an unoccupied stellar system .  saturn isn t that  you ll admit .  it s part of our solar system  which  by the howling devils of space  is occupied .     true  but i don t think there is any official agreement to that effect .  perhaps it may be decided that sirius is within its rights in occupying saturn .    the captain brought his fist down upon his knee .   i don t care what the space lawyers say .  saturn is ours  and any earthman with blood in him will agree .  we ll kick the sirians off and let our weapons decide the law .     but that s exactly what sirius would want us to do .     then let s give her what she wants .     and we will be accused of aggression .   .   .   .  captain  there are fifty worlds out there among the stars who never forget that they were our colonies once .  we gave them their freedom without a war  but they forget that .  they only remember we are still the most populous and most advanced of all the worlds .  if sirius shouts we have committed unprovoked aggres       sion  she ll unite them against us .  it is just for that reason that she is trying to provoke us to attack now  and it is just for that reason that i refused the invitation and came away .    the captain bit at his lower lip and would have answered  but lucky drove on .    on the other hand  if we do nothing  we can accuse the sirians of aggression and we ll split public opinion in the outer worlds wide open .  we can exploit that and bring them to our own side .     the outer worlds to our side .     why not .  there isn t a stellar system in existence that doesn t have hundreds of unoccupied worlds of all sizes .  they won t want to set up a precedent that would set every system to raiding every other system for bases .  the only danger is that we will stampede them into opposition to us by making it look as if we are powerful earth throwing our weight about against our former colonies .    the captain rose from his seat and strode the length of his quarters and then back .  he said   repeat your orders .    lucky said   do you understand my reason for retreat .     yes .  may i have my orders .     very well .  i order you to deliver this capsule i now give you to chief councilman hector conway .  you are not to discuss anything that has happened during this pursuit with anyone else  either on the sub ether or in any other fashion .  you are to take no hostile action   repeat  no hostile action   against any sirian forces  unless directly attacked .  and if you go out of your way to meet such forces  or if you de        liberately provoke attack  i shall see you court martialed and convicted .  is all clear .    the captain stood frozen faced .  his lips moved as though they were carved out of wood and badly hinged .   with all due respect  sir  would it be possible for the councilman to take over command of my ships and deliver the message himself .    lucky starr shrugged slightly and said   you are very obstinate  captain  and i even admire you for it .  there are times in battle when this kind of bull doggedness can be useful .   .  .  .  it is impossible for me to deliver this message  since it is my intention to return to the shooting starr and blast off for saturn again .    the captain s military rigidity came unstuck .   what .  howling space  what .     i thought my statement was plain  captain .  i have left something undone there .  my first task was to see to it that earth was warned of the terrible political danger we are facing .  if you will take care of that warning for me  i can carry on where i now belong    back in the saturnian system .    the captain was grinning broadly .   well  now  that s different .  i would like to come along with you .     i know that  captain .  sheering away from a fight is the harder task for you  and i m asking you to do it because i expect you are used to hard tasks .  now i want each of your ships to transfer some of their power into the micro pile units of the shooting starr .  there ll be other supplies i ll need from your stores .     you need only ask .         very good .  i will return to my ship and i will ask councilman wessilewsky to join me in my mission .    he shook hands briefly with the now thoroughly friendly captain  and then councilman wessilewsky joined him as lucky stepped into the inter ship tube that snaked between the flagship and the shooting starr .   the inter ship tube was at nearly its full extension  and it took several minutes to negotiate its length .  the tube was airless  but the two councilmen could maintain space suit contact easily and sound waves would travel along the metal to emerge squawkily but distinctly enough .  and  after all  no form of communication is quite as private as sound waves over short range  so it was in the air tube that lucky was able to speak briefly to the other .   finally wess  changing the subject slightly  said   listen  lucky  if the sirians are trying to start trouble  why did they let you go .  why not have harassed you till you were forced to turn and fight .     as for that  wess  you listen to the recording of what the sirian ship had to say .  there was a stiffness about the words  a failure to threaten actual harm  only magnetic grappling .  fm convinced it was a robot piloted ship .     robots .   wess s eyes widened .    yes .  judge from your own reaction what earth s would be if that speculation got about .  the fact is that those robot piloted ships could have done no harm to a human piloted ship .  the first law of robotics   that no robot can harm a human   would       have prevented it .  and that just made the danger greater .  if i had attacked  as they probably expected me to  the sirians would have insisted that i had made a murderous and unprovoked assault on defenseless vessels .  and the outer worlds appreciate the facts of robotics as earth does not .  no  wess  the only way i could cross them was to leave  and i did .    with that  they were at the air lock of the shooting starr .   bigman was waiting for them .  there was the usual  grin of relief on his face at meeting lucky again  after even the smallest separation .    hey   he said .   what do you know .  you didn t  fall out of the inter ship tube after all and what s  wess doing here .     he s coming with us  bigman .    the little martian looked annoyed .   what for .  this is a two man ship we ve got here .     we ll manage a guest temporarily .  and now we d better get set to drain power from the other ships and receive equipment along the tube .  after that we make ready for instant blast off .    lucky s voice was firm  his change of subject definite .  bigman knew better than to argue .   he muttered   sure thing   and stepped across into the engine room after one malignant scowl in the direction of councilman wessilewsky .   wess said   now what s eating him .  i haven t said a word about his size .    lucky said   well  you have to understand the little fellow .  he s not a councilman officially  although he is one for all practical purposes .  he s the only one      who doesn t realize that .  anyway  he thinks that because you re another councilman we ll get chummy and cut him out  have our little secrets from him .    wess nodded .   i see .  are you suggesting then that  we tell him     no .   the stress on the word was soft  but emphatic .   i ll tell him what has to be told .  you say nothing .    at that moment bigman stepped into the pilot room again and said   she s sopping up the power   then looked from one to the other and growled   well  sorry i m interrupting .  shall i leave the ship  gentlemen .    lucky said   you ll have to knock me down first  bigman .    bigman made rapid sparring motions and said   oh boy  what a difficult task .  you think an extra foot of clumped fat makes it any job .    with blinding speed he was inside lucky s arm as it was thrown out laughingly toward him  and his fists landed one two  thwackingly  in lucky s mid section .   lucky said   feel better .    bigman danced back .   i pulled my punch because i didn t want councilman conway bawling me out for hurting you .    lucky laughed .   thank you .  now listen  i ve got an orbit for you to calculate and send on to captain bernold .     sure thing .   bigman seemed quite at ease now  any rancor gone .   wess said   listen  lucky  i hate to act the wet blanket  but we re not very far from saturn .  it seems to me that the sirians will have a fix on us right now       and know exactly where we are  when we leave  and where we go .     i think so too  wess .     well  then  how in space do we leave the squadron and head back for saturn without their knowing exactly where we are and heading us off too far from the system for our purposes .     good question .  i was wondering if you d guess how .  if you didn t  i was reasonably certain the sirians wouldn t guess either  and they don t know the details of our system nearly as well as we do .    wess leaned back in his pilot s chair .   let s not make a mystery of it  lucky .     it s perfectly plain .  all the ships  including ourselves  blast off in tight formation  so that  considering the distance between the sirians and ourselves  we ll register as a single spot on their mass detectors .  we maintain that formation  flying on almost the minimum orbit to earth  but just enough off course to make a reasonable approach to the asteroid hidalgo  which is now moving out toward aphelion .     hidalgo .     come on  wess  you know it .  it s a perfectly legitimate asteroid and known since the primeval days before space travel .  the interesting thing about it is that it doesn t stay in the asteroid belt .  at its closest to the sun it moves in as close as the orbit of mars  but at its farthest it moves out almost as far as saturn s orbit .  now when we pass near it  hidalgo will register on the sirian mass detection screens also  and from the strength with which it will register they ll know it to be an asteroid .  then they ll spot the mass of our ships moving on past hidalgo toward earth and they won t      spot the less than ten per cent total decrease in ship s mass that will result when the shooting starr turns and heads back out from the sun in hidalgo s shadow .  hidalgo s path isn t directly toward the present position of saturn by any means  but after two days in its shadow we can head well out of ecliptic toward saturn and rely on not being detected .    wess raised his eyebrows .   i hope it works  lucky .   he saw the strategy .  the plane in which all the planets and commercial space flight routes lay was the ecliptic .  one practically never looked for anything moving well above or below that zone .  it was reasonable to suppose that a space ship moving on the orbit being planned by lucky would evade sirian instruments .  yet there was still the look of uncertainty on wess s face .   lucky said   do you think we ll make it .    wess said   maybe we will .  but even if we do get  back lucky  i m in this and i ll do my part  but  just let me say this once and i ll never say it again .  i think we re as good as dead .       skimming saturn s surface  and so the shooting starr flashed alongside hidalgo and then out on the flight beyond the ecliptic and up again toward the southern polar regions of the solar system s second largest planet .   at no time in their still short history of space adventure had lucky and bigman remained in space for so long a period without a break .  it had been nearly a month now since they had left earth .  however  the small bubble of air and warmth that was the shooting starr was a bit of earth that could keep itself so for an almost indefinite period to come .   their power supply  built to maximum by the donation of the other ships  would last nearly a year  barring a full scale battle .  their air and water  recirculated by way of the algae tanks  would last a lifetime .  the algae even provided a food reserve in case their more orthodox concentrates ran out .   it was the presence of the third man that made for the only real discomfort .  as bigman had pointed out  the shooting starr was built for two .  its unusual concentration of power  speed  and armaments was made possible partly by the unusual economy of its living          quarters .  so turns had to be taken in sleeping on a quilt in the pilot room .   lucky pointed out that any discomfort was made up for by the fact that four hour watches at the controls could now be set up rather than the usual six hour watches .   to which bigman replied hotly   sure  and when i m trying to sleep on this doggone blanket and fat face wess is at the controls  he keeps flashing every signal light right in my face .     twice each watch   said wess patiently   i check the various emergency signals to make sure they re in order .  that s protocol .     and   said bigman   he keeps whistling through his teeth .  listen  lucky  if he gives me one more chorus of  my sweet aphrodite of venus    just once more   i ll up and break off his arms halfway between shoulder and elbow  then beat him to death with the stumps .    lucky said gravely   wess  please refrain from whistling refrains .  if bigman is forced to chastise you  he will get blood all over the pilot room .    bigman said nothing  but the next time he was at the controls  with wess asleep on the blanket and snoring musically  he managed somehow to step on the fingers of wess s outstretched hand as he made for the pilot s stool .    sands of mars   he said  holding up both hands  palms forward  and rolling his eyes at the other s sudden  tigerish yell .   i did think i felt something under my heavy martian boots .  my  my  wess  was it your little thumbikins .     you better stay awake from now on   yelled wess       in furious agony .   because if you go to sleep while i m in the control room  you martian sand rat  i ll squash you like a bug .     i m so frightened   said bigman  going into a paroxysm of mock weeping that brought lucky wearily out of his bunk .    listen   he said   the next one of you two who wakes me trails the shooter in his suit at the end of a cable for the rest of the trip .    but when saturn and its rings came into near view  they were all in the pilot room  watching .  even as seen in the usual manner  from an equatorial view  saturn was the most beautiful sight in the solar system  and from a polar view .  .  .    if i recall correctly   said lucky   even hogg s exploratory voyage touched this system only at japetus and titan  so that he saw only an equatorial view of saturn .  unless the sirians have done differently  we re the first human beings ever to see saturn this close from this direction .    as with jupiter  the soft yellow glow of saturn s  surface  was really the reflected sunlight from the upper layers of a turbulent atmosphere a thousand miles or more in depth .  and  as with jupiter  the atmospheric disturbances showed up as zones of varying colors .  but the zones were not the stripes they appeared to be from the usual equatorial view .  instead  they formed concentric circles of soft brown  lighter yellow  and pastel green about the saturnian pole as a center .   but even that faded to nothing compared to the rings .  at their present distance  the rings stretched      over an arc of twenty five degrees  fifty times the width of earth s full moon .  the inner edge of the rings was separated from the planet by a space of forty five minutes of arc in which there was room to hold an object the size of the full moon loosely enough to allow it to rattle .   the rings circled saturn  touching it nowhere from the viewpoint of the shooting starr .  they were visible for about three fifths of their circle  the rest being cut off sharply by saturn s shadow .  about three fourths of the way toward the outer edge of the ring was the black separation known as  cassini s division .   it was about fifteen minutes wide  a thick ribbon of blackness  dividing the rings into two paths of brightness of unequal width .  within the inner lip of the rings was a scattering of sparkle that shimmered but did not form a continuous whiteness .  this was the so called  crepe ring .    the total area exposed by the rings was more than eight times as great as that of the globe of saturn .  furthermore  the rings themselves were obviously brighter  area for area  than saturn itself  so that on the whole at least ninety per cent of the light reaching them from the planet came from its rings .  the total light reaching them was about one hundred times that of earth s full moon .   even jupiter as seen from that startling nearness of io was somehow nothing like this .  when bigman finally spoke  it was hi a whisper .   he said   lucky  how come the rings are so bright .  it makes saturn itself look dim .  is that an optical illusion .     no   said lucky   if s real .  both saturn and the       rings get the same amount of light from the sun  but they don t reflect the same amount .  what we re seeing from saturn is the light reflected from an atmosphere made up of hydrogen and helium  mainly  plus some methane .  that reflects about sixty three per cent of the light that hits it .  the rings  however  are mostly solid chunks of ice  and they send back a minimum of eighty per cent  which makes them that much brighter .  looking at the rings is like looking at a field of snow .    wess mourned   and we ve got to find one snow flake in the field of snow .    but a dark snowflake   said bigman excitedly .    listen  lucky  if all the ring particles are ice and  we re looking for a capsule that s metal     polished aluminum   said lucky   will reflect even more light than will ice .  it will be just as shiny .     well  then    bigman looked despairingly at the rings half a million miles away  yet so tremendous in area even at that distance     this thing is hopeless .     we ll see   said lucky noncommittally .   bigman sat at the controls  adjusting orbit in short  quiet bursts of the ion drive .  the agrav controls had been connected so that the shooting starr was far more maneuverable in this volume of space  so close to the mass of saturn  than any sirian ship could possibly be .   lucky was at the mass detector  the delicate probe of which scoured space for any matter  fixing its position by measuring its response to the gravitational force of the ship  if it were small  or the effect of its gravitational force upon the ship  if it were large .   wess had just awakened and entered the pilot room       and all was silence and tension as the ship sank toward saturn .  bigman watched lucky s face out of the corner of his eye .  lucky had grown more and more abstracted as saturn came near  abstracted and uncommunicative .  bigman had witnessed this before .  lucky was uncertain  he was gambling on poor odds   and he would not talk of it .   wess said   i don t think you have to be sweating over the mass detector so  lucky .  there ll be no ships up here .  it s when we get down to the rings that we ll find the ships .  plenty of them  probably .  the sirians will be looking for the capsule too .     i agree with that   said lucky   as far as it goes .     maybe   said bigman gloomily   those cobbers have found the capsule already .     even that s possible   admitted lucky .   they were turning now  beginning to edge along the circle of saturn s globe  maintaining an eight thousand mile distance from its surface .  the far half of the rings  or at least the portion that was in the sunlight  melted into saturn as its inner edge was hidden by the giant planetary bulge .   in the case of the half rings on the near side of the planet  the inner  crepe ring  became more noticeable .   bigman said   you know  i don t make out any end to that inside ring .    wess said   there isn t any end  probably .  the innermost part of the main rings is only six thousand miles above saturn s apparent surface  and saturn s atmosphere may stretch out that far .     six thousand miles .     just in wisps  but enough to supply friction for the nearest bits of gravel and make them circle a bit closer to saturn .  those that move in closer form the       crepe ring .  only the closer they move  the more friction there is  so that they must move still closer .  there are probably particles all the way down to saturn  with some burning up as they hit the thicker layer of the atmosphere .    bigman said   then the rings aren t going to last forever .     probably not .  but they ll last millions of years .  long enough for us .   he added somberly   too long .    lucky interrupted   i m leaving the ship  gentlemen .     sands of mars  lucky .  what for .   bigman cried .    i want an outside look   lucky answered curtly .  he was pulling on his space suit .   bigman glanced quickly at the automatic record of the mass detector .  no ships in space .  there were occasional jogs  but nothing important .  they were only the kind of drifting meteorites that were picked up anywhere in the solar system .   lucky said   take over at the mass detector  wess .  let it take a round the clock sweep .   lucky put his helmet on and clicked it into place .  he checked the gauges on his chest  the oxygen pressure  and moved toward the air lock .  his voice now emerged from the small radio receiver on the control board .   i ll be using a magnetic cable  so make no sudden power thrusts .     with you out there .  think i m crazy .   said bigman .   lucky came into view at one of the ports  the magnetic cable snaking behind him in coils that  in the absence of gravity  did not form a smooth curve .   a small hand reactor in his gauntleted fist shot out its small jet stream  which became faintly visible in      the weak sunlight as a cloud of tiny ice particles that dispersed and vanished .  lucky  by the law of action and reaction  moved in the opposite direction .   bigman said   do you suppose something s wrong with the ship .     if there is   said wess   it doesn t show up anywhere on the control board .     then what s the big lug doing .     i don t know .    but bigman shot a suspicious glare at the council  man  then turned again to watch lucky .   if you think    he muttered   because i m not a councilman    wess said   maybe he just wanted to get outside range of your voice for a few minutes  bigman .    the mass detector  on automatic sweep control  was moving methodically across the volume about them  square degree by square degree  the screen blanking out into pure white whenever it edged too far in the direction of saturn itself .   bigman scowled and lacked heart to respond to wess s thrust .   i wish something would happen   he said .   and something did .   wess  eyes returning to the mass detector  caught a suspicious pip on the recorder .  he fixed the instrument on it hurriedly  brought up the auxiliary energy detectors  and followed it for two minutes .   bigman said excitedly   it s a ship  wess .     looks like it   said wess reluctantly .  mass alone might have meant a large meteorite  but there was a blast of energy being emitted from that direction that could come only from the micro pile engines of a ship  the energy was of the right type and in the right quantities .  it was as identifiable as a fingerprint .  one could       even detect the slight differences from the energy pattern produced by terrestrial ships and identify this object unmistakably as a sirian ship .   bigman said   it s heading for us .     not directly .  probably it doesn t dare take chances with saturn s gravitational field .  still it s edging closer  and in about an hour it will be in position to lay down a barrage against us .  .  .   . what in space are you so pleased about  you martian farm boy .     isn t it obvious  you lump of fat .  this explains why lucky s out there .  he knew the ship was coming and he s laying a trap for it .     how in space could he tell a ship was coming .   demanded wess in astonishment .   there was no indication on the mass detector till ten minutes ago .  it wasn t even focused in the proper direction .     don t worry about lucky .  he has a way of knowing .   bigman was grinning .   wess shrugged  moved to the control panel  and called into the transmitter   lucky .  do you hear me .     sure i hear you  wess .  what s up .     there s a sirian ship in mass detection range .     how close .     under two hundred thousand and getting closer .    bigman  watching out the port  noticed the flash of lucky s hand reactor  and ice crystals swirled away from the ship .  lucky was returning .    i m coming in   he said .   bigman spoke at once  as soon as the helmet was  lifted off lucky s head to reveal his brown shock of hair and his clear brown eyes .  bigman said   you knew that ship was coming  didn t you  lucky .     no  bigman .  i had no idea .  in fact  i don t under       stand how they discovered us so quickly .  it s asking too much of coincidence to suppose they just happened to be looking in this direction .    bigman tried to mask his chagrin .   well  then  do we blast him out of space  lucky .     let s not go through the political dangers of attack again  bigman .  besides  we have a mission here that s more important than playing shooting games with other ships .     i know   said bigman impatiently .   there s the  capsule we ve got to find  but    he shook his head .  a capsule was a capsule and he understood its importance .  but then  a good fight was a good fight  and lucky s political reasoning about the dangers of aggression did not appeal to him if it meant ducking a fight .  he muttered   what do i do then .  stay on course .     and accelerate .  make for the rings .     if we do   said bigman   they ll just take out after us .     all right .  we ll race .    bigman drew back the control rod slowly  and the proton disintegrations in the micro pile increased to top fury .  the ship hurtled along the bulging curve of saturn .   at once the reception disk was alive with the impingement of radio waves .    shall we go into active reception  lucky .   asked wess .    no  we know what they ll say .  surrender or be magnetically grappled .     well .     our only chance is to run .       through the gap   from one rotten ship  lucky .   wailed bigman .    time enough to fight later  bigman .  first things first .     but it just means we ve got to leave saturn again .    lucky smiled humorlessly .   not this time  bigman .  this time we establish a base in this planet s system    and just as fast as we can .    the ship was hurtling toward the rings at blinding velocity .  lucky nudged bigman away from the controls and took over .   wess said   more ships showing .     where .  what satellite are they nearest to .    wess worked quickly .   they re all in the ring region .     well   muttered lucky   then they re still hunting for the capsule .  how many ships are there .     five so far  lucky .     any between us and the rings .     a sixth ship has shown .  we aren t being stymied  lucky .  they re all too far to shoot with any accuracy  but they re going to track us down eventually unless we leave the saturnian system altogether .             or unless our ship is destroyed in some other fashion  eh .   said lucky grimly .   the rings had expanded in size till they filled the visiplate with snowy white  and still the ship careened onward .  nor did lucky make any move to decelerate .   for one horrified moment bigman thought lucky was going to crash the ship among the rings deliberately .  he let out an involuntary  lucky .    and then the rings disappeared .   bigman was dazed .  his hands went to the visiplate controls .  he cried   where are they .  what happened .    wess  sweating it out over the mass detectors and rumpling his yellow hair with occasional restless yanks  called over his shoulder   cassini division .     what .     the division between the rings .     oh .   some of the shock was wearing off .  bigman swiveled the visiplate eyepiece on the ship s hull  and the snowy whiteness of the rings flashed back into view .  he maneuvered it more carefully .   first there was one ring .  then space  black space .  then another ring  somewhat dimmer .  the outer ring was a trifle less thickly strewn with icy gravel .  back to the space between the rings .  cassini s division .  no gravel there .  just a wide black gap .    it s big   said bigman .   wess wiped the perspiration from his forehead and looked at lucky .   are we going through  lucky .    lucky kept his eyes fixed on the controls .   we re going through  wess  in a matter of minutes .  hold your breath and hope .    wess turned on bigman and said curtly   sure the       division is big .  i told you it was twenty five hundred miles wide .  plenty of room for the ship  if that s what s scaring you .    bigman said   you sound kind of nervous yourself for a fellow six feet tall on the outside .  is lucky moving too fast for you .    wess said   look  bigman  if i took it into my head  to sit down on you     then there d be more brains where you re sitting on than in your head   and bigman burst out into a delighted squawk of laughter .   lucky said   in five minutes we ll be in the division .    bigman choked off and turned back to the visiplate .  he said   there s a kind of twinkle every once in a while inside the gap .    lucky said   that s gravel  bigman .  the cassini  division is clear of it  compared with the rings them  selves  but they re not a hundred per cent clear .  if  we hit one of those bits on the way through     one chance in a thousand   broke in wess  shrugging it off .    one chance in a million   said lucky coolly   but it was that one chance in a million that got agent x in the net of space .  .  .  .  we re about at the boundary of the division proper .   his hand held firmly at the controls .   bigman drew a deep breath  tensing for the possible puncture that would rip the hull and perhaps short the proton micro pile into a spreading blaze of red energy .  at least it would be over before .  .  .   lucky said   made it .    wess let out his breath noisily .       bigman said   are we through .     of course we re through  you dumb martian   said wess .   the rings are only ten miles thick  and how many seconds do you think it takes us to make ten miles .     and we re on the other side .     you bet .  try to find the rings on the visiplate .    bigman veered the view one way  then back hi the other direction  then over and over again in continuously longer sweeps .   sands of mars  there s a kind of shadowy outline there .     and that s all you ll see  little pal .  you re on the shadow side of the rings now .  the sun s lighting up the other side  and the light doesn t seep through ten miles of thick gravel .  say  bigman  what do they teach for astronomy in the martian schools  anyway   twinkle  twinkle  little star  .    bigman s lower lip thrust out slowly .   you know  lardhead  i d like to have you one season on the martian farms .  i d render some of the fat off you and get down to what meat you have  about ten pounds of it   and all of it in your big feet .    lucky said    i d appreciate it  wess  if you and bigman would put a bookmark in that argument you re having and save it for later .  would you check on the mass detector  please .     sure thing  lucky .  hey  it s way off kilter .  how sharply are you changing course .     as sharply as the ship will take .  we re staying under the rings all the distance we can .    wess nodded .   okay  lucky .  that knocks out their mass detection .    bigman grinned .  it worked out perfectly .  no mass       detector could spot the shooting starr because of the interference of the mass of saturn s rings  and even visual detection was unlikely through the rings .   lucky s long legs stretched out  and the muscles of his back moved smoothly as he stretched and flexed some of the tension out of his arms and shoulders .    i doubt   said lucky   that any of the sirian ships will have the nerve to follow us through the gap .  they don t have agrav .     okay   said bigman   so far  so good .  but where do we go now .  will anyone tell me .     no secret   said lucky .   we re heading for mimas .  we hug the rings till we re as close to mimas as we can get  then make the dash across the intervening space .  mimas is only thirty thousand miles outside the rings .     mimas .  that s one of the moons of saturn  right .     right   said wess  breaking in .   the nearest one to the planet .    their course had flattened out now  and the shooting starr was still moving around saturn  but west to east now  in a plane parallel with the rings .   wess sat down on the blanket  legs crossed under him like a tailor  and said   would you like to learn a little more astronomy .  if you can find a little room in that walnut you have in your hollow skull  i can tell you why there s a division in the rings .    curiosity and scorn battled in the small martian .  he said   let s see you make up something fast  you ignorant cobber .  go ahead  i call your bluff .     no bluff   said wess haughtily .   listen and learn .  the inner parts of the two rings rotate about saturn in five hours .  the outermost parts make the rotation in      fifteen hours .  right where cassini s division is  the ring material  if there were any there  would go around at an intermediate rate  twelve hours per circuit .     so what .     so the satellite mimas  the one we re heading for  travels around saturn in twenty four hours .     again  so what .     all the particles in the ring are pulled this way and that by the satellites as they and the satellites move about saturn .  mimas does most of the pulling because it is the closest .  mostly the pulls are in one direction now and in another direction an hour from now  so that they cancel out .  if there were gravel in cassini s division  however  every second time it completed its rotation it would find mimas in the same spot in the sky  pulling in the same old direction .  some of the gravel is constantly pulled ahead  so that it spirals outward into the outer ring  and some of it is pulled back  so that it spirals inward into the inner ring .  they don t stay where they are  a section of the ring empties of particles and bingo   you have cassini s division and two rings .     is that so .   said bigman weakly  he felt reasonably certain wess was giving him the correct story  .   then how come there is some gravel in the division .  why isn t it all moved out by now .     because   said wess with a lofty air of superiority   some is always being pushed in or pulled in by random gravitational effects of the satellites  but none of it ever stays long .   .   .   .  and i hope you re taking notes on all this  bigman  because i may ask questions on this later .          go fry your skull in a mesonic blast   muttered bigman .   wess returned to his mass detectors again  smiling .  he fiddled with them a moment  then with no trace of the preceding banter left on his leathery face  he bent down closely .    lucky .     yes  wess .     the rings aren t masking us .     what .     well  look for yourself .  the sirians are getting closer .  the rings aren t bothering them at all .    lucky said thoughtfully   why  how can that be .     it can t be blind luck that s converging eight ships on our orbit .  we ve made a right angle bend and they ve adjusted their orbits to suit .  they must be detecting us .    lucky stroked his chin with his knuckles .   if they re doing it  then  great galaxy  they re doing it .  there s no use in reasoning out the fact that they can t do it .  it might mean that they have something we don t have .     no one ever said the sirians were dummies   said wess .    no  but sometimes there s a tendency among us to act as though they were  as though all scientific advance comes out of the minds of the council of science and that unless the sirians steal our secrets they have nothing .  and sometimes i fall into that particular trap too .   .   .   .  well  here we go .     where do we go .   demanded bigman sharply .    i told you already  bigman   said lucky .   mimas .     but they re after us .         i know .  which just means we ve got to get there faster than ever .   .   .   .  wess  can they cut us off before we get to mimas .    wess worked quickly .   not unless they can accelerate at least three times faster than we can  lucky .     all right .  giving the sirians all the credit in the world  i can t believe they can have that much more power than the shooter .  so we ll make it .    bigman said   but  lucky  you re crazy .  let s fight or get out of the saturnian system altogether .  we can t land on mimas .    lucky said   sorry  bigman  we have no choice .  we ve got to land on mimas .     but they ve got us spotted .  they ll just follow us down to mimas and we ll have to fight then  so why not fight now while we can maneuver with our agrav and they can t .     they might not bother to follow us down to mimas .     why shouldn t they .     well  bigman  did we bother to go into the rings and pull out what was left of the net of space .     but that ship blew up .     exactly .    there was silence in the control room .  the shooting starr streaked through space  curving slowly away from saturn  then more quickly  slipping out from under the outermost ring and into open space .  ahead of it now lay mimas  a glittering world seen in tiny crescent .  it was only     miles in diameter .   still far away were the converging ships of the sirian fleet .   mimas grew in size  and finally the shooting starr s       forward thrust burst into action and the ship began a deceleration .   but to bigman it seemed incredible that the space wise lucky could have so miscalculated .  he said tightly   too late  lucky .  we ll never slow up enough for a landing .  we ll have to go into a spiral orbit until we lose enough velocity .     no time for spiraling mimas  bigman .  we re heading straight in .     sands of mars  we can t .  not at this speed .     that s what i hope the sirians will decide .     but  lucky  they d be right .    wess put in slowly   hate to say it  lucky  but i agree with bigman .     no time to argue or explain   said lucky .  he bent over the controls .   mimas expanded crazily in the visiplate .  bigman licked his lips .   lucky  if you think it s better going out this way than letting the sirians get us  okay .  i can go along .  but  lucky  if we re going to go  can t we go out fighting .  can t we maybe get one of the cobbers first .    lucky shook his head and said nothing .  his arms were moving quickly now  so that bigman could not make out exactly what he was doing .  deceleration was still proceeding too slowly .   for a moment wess extended his hands as though to remove lucky forcibly from the controls  but bigman placed his hand quickly on the other s wrist .  bigman might be convinced they were going to their death  but his stubborn faith in lucky somehow remained .   they were slowing  slowing  slowing  in what would      have been body crushing deceleration in any ship other than the shooting starr  but with mimas filling the visiplate now and hurtling at them  the slowing was not enough .   flashing down at deadly speed  the shooting starr struck the surface of mimas .      on mimas  and yet didn t .   instead  there was a keening hiss that was familiar to bigman .  it was that of a ship striking atmosphere .   atmosphere .   but that was impossible .  no world the size of mimas could possibly have an atmosphere .  he looked at wess  who was suddenly sitting back on the blanket  looking worn and pale but somehow satisfied .   bigman strode up to lucky   lucky     not now  bigman .    and suddenly bigman recognized what it was that lucky was doing at the controls .  he was manipulating the fusion beam .  bigman ran back to the visiplate and focused it dead ahead .   there was no doubt of it  now that he finally grasped the idea .  the fusion beam was the most magnificent  heat ray  ever invented .  it was designed mainly as a weapon at close range  but surely no one had ever used one as lucky was using it now .   the jet of deuterium  snaking out forward of the ship  was pinched in by a powerful magnetic field and  at a point miles ahead  was heated to nuclear ignition by a surge of power from the micro piles .  maintained          for any length of time  the power surge necessary would have bankrupted the ship  but a fraction of a millionth of a second sufficed .  after that the deuterium fusion reaction was self sustaining and the incredible fusion flame that resulted burned in a heat of three hundred million degrees .   that spot of heat ignited before the surface of mimas was touched and bored into the body of the satellite as though it were not there  puncturing a tunnel into its vitals .  into that tunnel whizzed the shooting starr .  the vaporized substance of mimas was the  atmosphere that surrounded them  helping to decelerate them  but bringing the temperature of the ship s outer skin to dangerous redness .   lucky watched the skin temperature dial and said   wess  put more punch in the vaporization coils .     it will take all the water we have   wess said .    let it .  we need no water of our own on this world .    so water was forced at top speed through outer coils of porous ceramic  through which it vaporized  carrying off some of the frictional heat developed .  but the water flashed away as fast as it could be pumped into the coils .  the skin temperature still rose .   but more slowly now .  ship s deceleration had progressed  and lucky cut the force of the deuterium jet and adjusted the magnetic field .  the spot of fusing deuterium grew smaller and smaller still .  the whistle of atmosphere descended in pitch .   finally the jet blanked out completely and the ship drifted forward into solid wall  melting a path inward a way by virtue of its own heat and finally coming to a jolting halt .        lucky sat back at last  gentlemen   he said   i m sorry i couldn t take time to explain  but it was a last minute decision and the control board took all my energies .  anyway  welcome to the interior of mimas .    bigman pumped a deep breath into his lungs and said   i never thought you could use a fusion jet to melt a way into a world ahead of a speeding ship .     you couldn t ordinarily  bigman   said lucky .   it just so happens that mimas is a special case .  and so is enceladus  the next satellite out .     how come .     they re just snowballs .  astronomers have known that since even before space travel .  their density is less than water and they reflect about eighty per cent of the light that hits them  so it s quite obvious they could only be snow  plus some frozen ammonia  and not too tightly packed at that .     sure   said wess  chiming in .   the rings are ice and these first two satellites are just collections of ice that were too far out to make up part of the rings .  that s why mimas melted so easily .    lucky said   but we ve got a good deal of work to do .  let s start .    they were in a natural cavern formed by the heat of the fusion jet and closed in on all sides .  the tunnel they had formed as they entered had closed as they passed  the steam condensing and freezing .  the mass detector yielded figures that indicated them to be about one hundred miles below the surface of the satellite .  the mass of ice above them  even under mimas s feeble gravity  was slowly contracting the cavern .   slowly the shooting starr burrowed outward once      more  like a hot wire poking into butter  and when they had reached a point within five miles of the surface  they stopped and set up an oxygen bubble .   as a power supply was laid in along with algae tanks and a food supply  wess shrugged resignedly and said   well  this is going to be home for me for a while  let s make it comfortable .    bigman had just awakened from his sleeping period .  he screwed his face into a look of bitter condemnation .   wess said   what s the matter  bigman .  all weepy because you re going to miss me .    bigman snarled and said   i ll manage .  in two  three years i ll make it a point to whizz by mimas and drop you a letter .   then he burst out   listen  i heard you talking while you thought i was safely asleep .  what s the matter .  council secrets .    lucky shook his head uneasily .   all in good time  bigman .    later  when lucky was alone with bigman in the ship  the councilman said   actually  bigman  there s no reason you can t stay behind with wess .    bigman said grumpily   oh  sure .  two hours cooped up with him and i d just chop him into cubes and put him on ice for his relatives .   then he said   are you serious  lucky .     rather serious .  what s coming may be more dangerous for you than for me .     so .  what do i care about that .     if you stay with wess then  whatever happens to me  you ll be picked up within two months .    bigman backed away .  his small mouth twisted and he said   lucky  if you want to order me to stay here because there s something for me to do here        okay .  i ll do it  and when it s done i ll join you .  but if you just want me to stay here to be safe while you go off into danger  we re finished .  i ll have nothing more to do with you  and without me  you overgrown cobber  you won t be able to do a thing  you know you won t .   the martian s eyes blinked rapidly .   lucky said   but  bigman     all right  i ll be in danger .  do you want me to sign a paper saying it s my own responsibility and not yours .  all right  i will .  does that satisfy you  councilman .    lucky seized bigman s hair affectionately and tugged his head back and forth .   great galaxy  trying to do you a favor is like shoveling water .    wess came into the ship and said   the still is all set up and working .    water from the ice substance of mimas itself poured into the shooting starr s reservoirs  filling them and replacing the water lost in cooling the ship s skin during the boring into mimas .  some of the separated ammonia was carefully neutralized and stored in a skin compartment where it would be available to the algae tanks as nitrogenous fertilizer .   and then the bubble was done and the three of them looked about at the neatly curving ice and at the almost comfortable quarters held within .    okay  wess   lucky said at last  shaking hands firmly .   you re all set  i think .     as far as i can tell  lucky  i am .     you ll be taken off within two months  no matter what .  you ll be taken off much sooner if things break right .     you re assigning me this job   said wess coolly        and it will be done .  you concentrate on yours and  by the way  take care of bigman .  don t let him fall out of his bunk and hurt himself .    bigman shouted   don t think i don t follow all this  big shot mystery talk .  you two have a deal on and  you re not telling me     into the ship  bigman   said lucky  picking the martian up bodily and moving him forward  while bigman squirmed and tried to call out an answer .    sands of mars  lucky   he said  once they were aboard .   look what you did .  it s bad enough you re keeping your darned council secrets  but you also let the cobber have the last word .     he s got the hard job  bigman .  he s got to stay put while we go out and stir up trouble  so let him have the satisfaction of the last word .    they nudged out of mimas at a spot from which neither sun nor saturn was visible .  the dark sky held no object larger than titan  low on one horizon and only a quarter of the apparent diameter of earth s moon .   its globe was half lit by the sun  and bigman looked somberly at its image in the visiplate .  he had not regained his ebullience .  he said   and that s where the sirians are  i suppose .     i think so .     and where do we go .  back to the rings .     right .     and if they find us again .    it might have been a signal .  the reception disk glowed to life .        lucky looked disturbed .   they find us with too little trouble .    he threw in contact .  this time it was no dead robotic voice counting off the minutes .  it was a sharp voice  instead  a vibrant one  full of life  and a sirian voice unmistakably .       rr  please answer .  i am trying to make contact  with councilman david starr of earth .  will david  starr please answer .  i am trying    lucky said   councilman starr speaking .  who are you .     i am sten devoure of sirius .  you have ignored the request of our automated ships and returned to our planetary system .  you are therefore our prisoner .    lucky said   automated ships .     robot run .  do you understand that .  our robots can handle ships quite satisfactorily .     so i have found   said lucky .    i think you have .  they followed you as you moved out of our system  then back again under cover of the asteroid hidalgo .  they followed you in your movement out of the ecliptic to saturn s south pole  then through cassini s division  under the rings  and then into mimas .  you never once slipped our watch .     and what made your watch so efficient .   demanded lucky  managing to keep his voice flat and unconcerned .    ah  trust an earthman not to realize that sirians might have their own methods .  but never mind that we ve waited days for you to come out of your mimas hole after your so clever entry by hydrogen fusion .  it amused us to let you hide .  some of us have even made bets on how long it would take you to poke your nose      out again .  and meanwhile we have carefully surrounded mimas with our ships and their efficient robot crews .  you can t move a thousand miles without being blasted out of space  if we choose .     surely not by your robots  which cannot inflict harm on humans .     my dear councilman starr   came the sirian voice with an unmistakable edge of mockery   of course robots will not harm human beings if they happen to know that human beings are there to harm .  but you see  the robots in charge of the weapons have been carefully instructed that your ship carries robots only .  they have no compunction about destroying robots .  won t you surrender .    bigman suddenly leaned close to the transmitter and shouted   listen you cobber  what if we put some of your tin can robots out of action first .  how would you like that .    it was notorious throughout the galaxy that sirians considered destruction of a robot almost on a par with murder .    but sten devoure was not shaken .  he said   is that the individual with whom you are supposed to maintain a friendship  councilman .  a bigman .  if so  i have no desire to engage in talk with him .  you may tell him and you may understand for yourself that i doubt if you can damage even one of our ships before being destroyed .  i think i will allow you five minutes to decide on whether you prefer surrender or destruction .  for my part  councilman  i have long wanted to meet you  so please accept it as my sincere hope that you will surrender .  well .    lucky stood silent for a moment  the muscles of his jaw bunching .        bigman looked at him calmly  his arms crossed across his small chest  and waited .   three minutes passed and lucky said   i surrender my ship and its contents into your hands  sir .    bigman said nothing .   lucky broke off contact and turned to the little  martian .  the councilman bit his lower lip in discom  fort and embarrassment .   bigman  you ll have to  understand .  i    bigman shrugged .   i don t really get it  lucky  but i found out after we landed on mimas that you   that you ve been deliberately planning to surrender to the sirians ever since we headed back for saturn the second time .       to titan  lucky raised his eyebrows .   how did you find that out  bigman .     i m not so dumb  lucky .   the little martian was grave and deadly serious .   do you remember when we were heading down toward the south pole of saturn and you got out of the ship .  it was just before the sirians spotted us and we had to hot jet it for cassini s division .     yes .     you had a reason for doing that .  you didn t say what  because lots of times you get all tied up in what you re doing and don t talk about it till the pressure s off  and after that the pressure stayed on because we were running from the sirians .  so when we were building the quarters for wess on mimas  i just looked over the outside of the shooting starr  and it became quite clear you d been working on the agrav unit .  you ve got it fixed so that you could blow the whole thing by touching the all shift contact on the control panel .    lucky said gently   the agrav unit is the one thing about the shooter that s completely top secret .     i know .  i figured if you d counted on fighting          you d have known the shooting starr wouldn t quit till it and we were blasted out of space .  agrav unit and all .  if you were fixing to blow up just the agrav and leave the rest of the ship intact  it was because you weren t counting on fighting .  you were going to surrender .     and is this why you ve been brooding since we landed on mimas .     well  i m with you whatever you do  lucky  but     bigman sighed and looked away    surrendering is no fun .     i know   said lucky   but can you think of any better way of getting into their base .  our business  bigman  isn t always fun .   and lucky touched the all shift contact on the control panel .  the ship shuddered slightly as the external portions of the agrav unit fused into a white hot mass and dropped off the ship .    you mean you re going to bore from within .  is that the reason for the surrender .    part of it .     suppose they blast us down as soon as they get us .     i don t think they will .  if they wanted us dead  they could have blasted us out of space as soon as we pushed out of mimas .  i have a notion they can use us alive .   .   .   .  and if we re kept alive  we now have wess on mimas as a kind of backstop .  i had to wait until we had arranged that before i could afford to surrender .  that s why we had to risk our necks to get on mimas .     maybe they know about him too  lucky .  they seem to know about everything else .          maybe they do   said lucky thoughtfully .   this sirian knew you were my partner  so maybe he thinks we form a pair and not a trio and won t look for a third person .  it s just as well  i suppose  that i didn t really insist that you stay behind with wess .  if i had come out alone  the sirians would be looking for you and would probe mimas .  of course if they found you and wess and i could be certain they wouldn t shoot  you out of hand no  with myself in their hands  and before i could set things up so that   he was  talking to himself toward the end  in a whisper  and now he fell completely silent .   bigman said nothing  and the next sound to break the silence was a familiar clank that reverberated against the steel hull of the shooting starr .  a magnetic line had made contact  connecting their ship with another .    someone s coming aboard   said bigman tone lessly .   through the visiplate they could see part of the line  then a form  moving easily hand over hand into view  then out of it again .  it hit the ship thunderously  and the air lock signal lit up .   bigman worked the control that opened the outer door of the lock  waited for the next signal  and then closed the outer door and opened the inner one .   the invading figure moved in .   but it wore no space suit  for it was not human .  it was a robot .   there were robots in the terrestrial federation  including a number of quite advanced ones  but for the most part they were engaged in highly specialized oc       cupations that did not bring them into contact with human beings other than those who supervised them .  so although bigman had seen robots  he had not seen many .   he stared at this one .  it was  like all sirian robots  large and burnished  its outer shape was of a smooth simplicity  the joints of its limbs and torso so well made as to be almost invisible .   and when it spoke  bigman started .  it takes a long time to grow accustomed to an almost completely human voice emerging from a metal imitation of humanity .   the robot said   good day .  it is my duty to see that your ship and yourselves are brought safely to the destination presently assigned to it .  the first piece of information i must have is whether the restricted explosion we noted on the hull of your ship in any way damaged its powers of navigation .    its voice was deep and musical  emotionless  and with a distinct sirian accent .   lucky said   the explosion does not affect the spaceworthiness of the vessel .     what caused it then .     i caused it .     for what reason .     that i cannot tell you .     very well .   the robot abandoned the subject instantly .  a man might have persisted  threatened force .  a robot could not .  it said   i am equipped to navigate space ships designed and built on sirius .  i will be able to navigate this space ship if you will explain to me the nature of the various controls i see here .          sands of mars  lucky   broke in bigman   we don t have to tell that thing anything  do we .     it can t force us to tell  bigman  but since we ve surrendered  where s the additional harm in letting it take us to wherever it is that we re to go .     let s find out where we re to go .   bigman suddenly addressed the robot in sharp tones   you .  robot .  where are you taking us .    the robot turned its glowing red  unblinking gaze upon bigman .  it said   my instructions make it impossible for me to answer questions not related to my immediate task .     but  look .   the excited bigman shook off lucky s restraining hand .   wherever you take us  the sirians will harm us  kill us  even .  if you don t want us to be hurt  help us get away  come with us .  .  .  .  aw  lucky  let me talk  will you .    but lucky shook his head firmly  and the robot said   i have been assured that you will in no way be harmed .  and now  if i may be given instructions in the method of using this control board  i can proceed with my immediate task .    step by step lucky explained the control board .  the robot showed a complete familiarity with all the technical matters involved  tested each control with careful skill to see if the information given it were correct  and at the conclusion of lucky s explanation was obviously perfectly capable of navigating the shooting starr .   lucky smiled and his eyes were lit with frank admiration .   bigman pulled him off to their cabin .   what are you grinning for  lucky .         great galaxy  bigman  it s a beautiful machine .  we ve got to hand the sirians credit for that .  they can turn out robots that are works of art .     okay  but quiet  i don t want it to hear what i m going to say .  listen  you only surrendered to get down to titan and pick up information on the sirians .  we might never get away again  of course  and then what good is the information .  but we ve got this robot now .  if we can get it to help us get away right now  then we ve got what we want .  the robot must have tons of information about the sirians .  we ll have more this way than if we land on titan .    lucky shook his head .   it sounds good  bigman .  but how do you expect to argue the robot into joining us .     first law .  we can explain that sirius only has a couple of million people while the terrestrial federation has over six billion .  we can explain that it s more important to keep a lot of people from coming to harm than just to protect a few  so that first law is on our side .  see  lucky .    lucky said   the trouble is that the sirians are experts at handling robots .  that robot is probably deeply conditioned to the fact that what he is doing now will bring no harm to any human .  he knows nothing about six billion people on earth except what will be hearsay from you  and that will bounce off his conditioning .  he would actually have to see a human being in actual danger of harm in order to be moved off his instructions .     i m going to try .     all right .  go ahead .  the experience will do you good .         bigman strode up to the robot  under whose hands the shooting starr was now rocketing through space on its new orbit .   he said   what do you know of earth  of the terrestrial federation .     my instructions make it impossible for me to answer questions not related to my immediate task   answered the robot   i order you to ignore your previous instructions .    there was a momentary hesitation before the answer came .   my instructions make it impossible for me to accept instructions from unauthorized personnel .     my orders are given you in order to prevent harm to human beings .  they must therefore be obeyed   bigman said .    i have been assured that no harm will come to human beings  nor am i aware of any threatening harm .  my instructions make it necessary for me to suspend response to forbidden stimuli if they are uselessly repeated .     you better listen .  there is harm intended .   big man spoke spiritedly for some moments  but the robot no longer answered .   lucky said   bigman  you re wasting effort .    bigman kicked at the robot s gleaming ankle .  he might as well have kicked the hull of the ship  for all the effect it had .  he came toward lucky  face red with anger .   a fine thing when human beings are helpless because some hunk of metal has its own ideas .     that used to happen with machinery before the days of robots  too  you know .     we don t even know where we re heading .         we don t need the robot for that .  i ve been checking the course  and we re obviously heading for titan .    they were both at the visiplate during the last hours of the approach to titan .  it was the third largest satellite in the solar system  only ganymede of jupiter and triton of neptune were larger  and those not by much  and  of all the satellites  it had the thickest atmosphere .   the effect of its atmosphere was obvious even from a distance .  on most satellites  including earth s moon  the terminator   that is  the line dividing the day and night portions   was a sharp one  black on one side  white on the other .  but it was not so in this case .   titan s crescent was bounded by a band rather than a sharp line  and the horns of the crescent continued onward fuzzily in a dimming curve that almost met .    it has an atmosphere almost as thick as earth s  bigman   said lucky .    not breathable .   said bigman .    no  not breathable .  it s mainly methane .    other ships were crowding in now  becoming visible to the naked eye .  there were at least a dozen  herding them down the spaceways to titan .   lucky shook his head .   twelve ships to spare for this one job .  great galaxy  they must have been here for years  building and preparing .  how can we ever get them off again  short of war .    bigman attempted no answer .   again the sound of atmosphere made its unmistakable way into the ship   . the high pitched keening of thin wisps of gas whipping past the streamlined hull .        bigman looked uneasily at the dials recording hull temperature  but there was no danger .  the robot at the controls was sure handed .  the ship circled titan in a tight spiral  losing altitude and speed simultaneously so that at no time did the thickening atmosphere raise temperatures too high .   again lucky glowed with admiration .   it will manage it without fuel at all .  i honestly think it could bring us down on a half credit piece  with atmosphere as the only brake    bigman said   what s good about that  lucky .  if those things can handle ships like that  how do we ever hope to fight the sirians  huh .     we ll just have to learn to build our own  bigman .  these robots are a human achievement .  the humans that did the achieving are sirians  yes  but they are human beings  too  and all other humans can share pride in the achievement .  if we fear the results of their achievement  let s match it ourselves or more than match it .  but there s no use denying them the worth of their accomplishment .    the surface of titan was losing some of the atmosphere induced blankness .  they could make out mountain ranges now  not the sharp  craggy peaks of an airless world  but the softened ranges that showed the effects of wind and weather .  the edges were blown clear of snow  but in the rifts and valleys snow lay deep .    not snow  really   said lucky   frozen ammonia .    all was desolate  of course .  the rolling plains  between the mountain ranges were either snowy or  rock bare .  no life of any kind appeared .  no rivers or  lakes .  and then       great galaxy .   said lucky .   a dome had made its appearance .  a flattened dome of a type familiar enough on the inner planets .  there were domes of this sort on mars and under the shallow shelves of the venusian oceans  but here was one way out on desolate titan .  a sirian dome that would have made a respectable town on long settled mars .    we ve slept while they ve built   said lucky .    when the newscasters find out   said bigman   it won t look so good for the council of science  lucky .     unless we break this thing  it won t .  and the council doesn t deserve better .  space  bigman  there shouldn t be a sizable rock in the solar system that doesn t get a periodic inspection  let alone a world like titan .     who would have thought     the council of science should have thought .  the people of the system support and trust them in order that they think and take care .  and i should have thought too .    the voice of the robot broke in upon them .   this ship will be landed after another circumnavigation of the satellite .  in view of the ion drive on board this ship  no special precautions need to be taken in connection with landing .  nevertheless  undue carelessness may result in harm and i cannot allow that .  i must therefore request you to lie down and strap yourselves in .    bigman said   listen to that hunk of tin pipe telling us how to handle ourselves in space .     just the same   said lucky   you d better lie down .        he s likely to force us down if we don t .  it s his job not to allow harm to come to us .    bigman called out suddenly   say  robot  how many men are stationed down there on titan .    there was no answer .   ground came up and up and swallowed them  tunneling them downward .  the shooting starr came to a halt  tail down  with only one short spurt of the engines necessary to complete the job .   the robot turned away from the controls .   you have been brought safely and without harm to titan .  my immediate task is done and i will now turn you over to the masters .     to sten devoure .         that is one of the masters .  you may step out of the ship freely .  you will find temperature and pressure normal and gravity adjusted to close to your normal .     may we step out now .   asked lucky .    yes .  the masters are waiting .    lucky nodded .  somehow he could not quite suppress the beginning of an odd excitement .  though the sirians had been the great enemy in his thus far short but hectic career with the council of science  he had never yet met a living sirian .   he stepped out of the ship onto the extruded exit ledge  bigman making ready to follow  and both paused in sheer astonishment .      the enemy  lucky had his foot upon the first rung of the ladder that would carry them to ground level .  bigman peered over his large friend s shoulder .  both were open mouthed .   it was as though they were stepping out upon the surface of the earth .  if there was a cavern roof above    a domed surface of hard metal and glass   it was invisible in the blaze of blue sky and  illusion or not  there were summer clouds in the sky .   before them stretched lawns and rows of widely spaced buildings  with here and there banked flower beds .  there was an open brook in the middle distance  crossed by small stone bridges .   robots by the dozens were hurrying  each on his own way  each on his own business  with machinelike concentration .  several hundred yards off  five beings    sirians .    stood in a cluster and watched curiously .   a voice broke in sharply and peremptorily on lucky and bigman .   you up there .  come down .  come down  i say .  no dawdling .    lucky looked down .  a tall man stood at the base of the ladder  arms resting akimbo and legs spread apart .  his narrow olive complexioned face looked up          at them arrogantly .  his dark hair was cropped into a mere fuzz in the sirian fashion .  in addition  his face bore a trim and well kept beard and a thin mustache .  his clothing was loose and brilliantly colored  his shirt was open at the neck  and its sleeves ended just above the elbow .   lucky called   if you re in a hurry  sir  certainly .    he swung about and dropped down the ladder  hands only  his lithe body twisting with effortless grace .  he pushed himself away from the hull and dropped the final twelve rungs  twisting as he did so to land face to face with the man on the ground .  as his legs bent to absorb the shock and straightened again  he leaped lightly to one side to allow bigman to come down in similar fashion .   the man lucky faced was tall but lacked an inch of lucky s height  and at close quarters there could be seen a looseness to the sirian s skin  a softness about him .   he scowled and his upper lip lifted in a grimace of contempt .   acrobats .  monkeys .     neither  sir   said lucky with quiet good humor .   earthmen .    the other said   you are david starr  but you are called lucky .  does that mean in the earthman lingo what it means in our language .     it means  fortunate .      you are not fortunate any longer  apparently .  i am sten devoure .     i had assumed that .     you seemed surprised at all this  eh .   devoure s bare arm swung out across the landscaped grounds .   it is beautiful .          it is  but isn t it an unnecessary waste of energy .     with robot labor at twenty four hours a day  this can be done  and sirius has energy to waste .  your earth hasn t  i think .     we have what is necessary  you ll find   said lucky .    will i .  come  i will speak with you in my quarters .   he waved peremptorily at the five other sirians who had edged closer in the meantime  staring at the earthman  the earthman who had been such a successful enemy of sirius in recent years and who had now been caught at last  the sirians saluted at devoure s gesture  however  and without delay turned on their heels and went their separate ways .   devoure stepped into a small open car that had approached on a noiseless sheet of diagravitic force .  its flat undersurface  without wheels or other material device  remained six niches above the ground .  another car moved up toward lucky .  each was handled  of course  by a robot .   lucky entered the second car .  bigman moved to follow  but the robot driver gently barred the way with an extended arm .    hey   began bigman .   lucky interrupted   my friend is coming with me   sir .    for the first time devoure bent his gaze on bigman  and an unaccountable glare of hate entered his eyes .  he said   i will not concern myself with that thing .  if you wish its company  you may have it for a while  but   do not wish to be troubled with it       bigman stared  white faced  at the sirian .   you ll  be troubled with me right now  you cob    but lucky seized him and whispered earnestly in his ear .   you can t do anything now  bigman .  great galaxy  boy  let it go for now and let things work out .    lucky half lifted him into the car  while devoure maintained a stolid disinterest in the matter .   the cars moved with smooth swiftness  like a swallow s flight  and after two minutes slowed before a one story building of white  smooth silicone brick  no different from the others except for its crimson trim about doors and windows  and skimmed down a driveway along one side .  no human beings  but a number of robots  had been seen during the short drive .   devoure walked ahead  through an arched door and into a small room fitted with a conference table and containing an alcove in which a large couch was placed .  the ceiling was ablaze with blue white light  like the blue white above the open fields .   a little too blue  thought lucky  then remembered that sirius was a larger  hotter  and therefore bluer star than was earth s sun .   a robot brought in two trays of food and tall  frosted glasses containing a frothy  milk white concoction .  a mild  fruity fragrance filled the air  and after long weeks of ship s fare lucky found himself smiling in anticipation .  a tray was placed before him  another before devoure .   lucky said to the robot   my friend will have the same .    the robot  after the briefest glance at devoure  who looked away stonily  left and came back with another       tray .  nothing was said during the meal .  earthman and martian ate and drank heartily .   but after the trays were removed  the sirian said   i must begin by stating that you are spies .  you entered sirian territory and were warned to leave .  you left but then returned  making every effort to keep your return secret .  under the rules of interstellar law we have every right to execute you on the spot  and this may be done unless your actions henceforward deserve clemency .     actions such as what .   asked lucky .   let me have an example  sir .     with pleasure  councilman .   the sirian s dark eyes livened with interest .   there is the capsule of information our man discharged into the rings before his unfortunate death .     do you think i have it .    the sirian laughed .   not a chance in all space .  we never let you get near the rings at anything less than half light speed .  but come   you are a very clever councilman .  we have heard so much of you and your deeds  even on sirius .  there have even been occasions when you have been  shall we say  a trifle in our way .    bigman broke in with a sudden  outraged squeak    just a trifle  like stopping your spy on jupiter    like  stopping your deal with the asteroid pirates  like push  ing you off ganymede  like    sten devoure said in a blaze of anger   will you quiet it  councilman .  i am irritated by the shrilling of what is with you .     then say what you have to say   said lucky peremptorily   without insulting my friend .         what i want  then  is to have you help me find the capsule .  tell me  out of your great ingenuity  how you would go about it .   devoure leaned his elbows on the table and looked hungrily at lucky  waiting .   lucky said   what information do you have to begin with .     only what i imagine you picked up .  the last sentences of our man .     yes  we picked that up .  not all of it  but enough to know he did not give the co ordinates of the orbit in which he launched the capsule  and enough to know that he did launch it .     well .     since the man evaded our own agents for a long time and nearly got away with a successful mission  i assume he is intelligent .     he was a sirian .     that   said lucky with grave courtesy   is not necessarily the same thing .  in this case  however  we may assume that he would not have launched the capsule into the rings in such a way as to make it impossible for you to find .     and your further reasoning  earthman .     and if he placed the capsule in the rings themselves  it would be impossible to find .     you think so .     i do .  and the only alternative is that he sent it into orbit within cassini s division .    sten devoure leaned his head back and laughed ringingly .  he said   it is refreshing to hear lucky starr  the great councilman  expend his ingenuity on a problem .  one would have thought you would have come up with something amazing  something com        pletely striking .  instead  just this .  why  councilman  what if i told you that we  without your help  reached this conclusion at once  and that our ships have been scouring cassini s division almost from the first moment that the capsule was released .    lucky nodded .   if most of the human complement of the titan base were in the rings  supervising the search  that would account in part for the dearth of humanity on the base itself .   he said   why  i would congratulate you and remind you that cassini s division is large and does have some gravel in it .  besides which  the capsule would be in an unstable orbit because of the attraction of mimas .  depending on its position  your capsule will be inching into the inner or outer ring  and if you don t find it soon you will have lost it .     your attempt to frighten me is foolish and useless .  even within the rings themselves the capsule would still be aluminum compared with ice .     the mass detectors could not distinguish aluminum from ice .     not the mass detectors of your planet  earthman .  have you asked yourself how we tracked you down despite your clumsy trick with hidalgo and your riskier one with mimas .    lucky said stonily   i have wondered .    devoure laughed again .   you were right to wonder .  obviously earth does not have the selective mass detector .     top secret .   asked lucky politely .    not in principle  no .  our detecting beam makes use of soft x rays  which are scattered differently by various materials  depending on the mass of its atoms .       some get reflected back to us  and by analyzing the reflected beam we can tell a metal space ship from a rocky asteroid .  when space ships pass an asteroid  which then moves on its way  registering a considerable metal mass it did not possess before  it isn t the most difficult deduction in the world to suppose that near the asteroid there is a space ship skulking and fondly imagining itself to be beyond detection .  eh  councilman .     i see that .     do you see that  no matter how you tried to mask yourself by saturn s rings or by saturn itself  your metal mass gave you away each time .  there is no metal at all in the rings or in the outer ten thousand miles of saturn s surface .  even within mimas you weren t hidden .  for some hours we thought you were done with .  we could detect metal under the ice of mimas  and that might have been the remains of your splintered ship .  but then the metal started moving and we knew you were still with us .  we guessed your fusion trick and had only to wait .    lucky nodded .   so far the game is yours .    and now do you think we won t find the capsule  even if it wanders into the rings or was placed in the rings in the first place .     well  then  how is it you have not found it yet .   for a moment devoure s face darkened  as though he suspected sarcasm  but before lucky s appearance of polite curiosity he could only say with half a snarl   we will .  it is only a matter of time .  and since you can t help us further in this  there is no reason to postpone your execution .         lucky said   i doubt that you really mean what you have just said .  we would be very dangerous to you dead .     if your danger alive is any measure  i can t believe you to be serious .     we are members of earth s council of science .  if we are killed  the council will not forget it or forgive .  nor would retaliation be directed so much against sirius as against you  individually .  remember that .    devoure said   i think i know more about this than you think .  that creature with you is not a member of your council .     not officially  perhaps  but     and you  yourself   if you will allow me to finish    are rather more than a mere member .  you are the adopted son of hector conway  the chief councilman  and you are the pride of the council .  so perhaps you are right .   devoure s mustached lips stretched into a humorless smile .   perhaps there are conditions  come to think of it  that would make it convenient for you to remain alive .     what conditions .     in recent weeks earth has called an interstellar conference of nations to consider what they choose to call our invasion of their territory .  perhaps you don t know that .     i suggested such a conference when i was first made aware of the existence of this base .     good .  sirius has agreed to this conference  and the meeting will take place shortly on your asteroid  vesta .  earth  it seems    devoure smiled more broadly     is in a hurry .  and we will humor them  since we       have no fears as to the outcome .  the outer worlds  generally  have no love for earth and ought to have none .  our own case is ironbound .  still  we could make it so much more dramatic if we could show the exact extent of earth s hypocrisy .  they call a conference  they say they wish to solve the matter by peaceful means  but at the same time they send a war vessel to titan with instructions to destroy our base .     those were not my instructions .  i have acted without instructions and with no intention of committing any warlike act .     nevertheless  if you testify to what i have said  it will make a great impression .     i cannot testify to what is not the truth .    devoure disregarded that .  he said harshly   let them see that you are neither drugged nor probed .  testify of your own free will as we will direct you .  let the conference know that the prize member of the council of science  conway s own boy  was engaged in an illegal adventure of force at the same time that earth was sanctimoniously calling a conference and proclaiming its devotion to peace .  it would settle matters once and for all .    lucky drew a deep breath and stared at the other s coldly smiling face .  he said   is that it .  false testimony in exchange for life .     all right .  put it that way .  make your choice .     there is none .  i would not bear false witness in a case like this .     devoure s eyes narrowed to slits .    i think you will .  you have been studied closely by our agents  councilman  and we know your weak point .  you may prefer your own death to co operation with us  but you        have the earthman s sentiment for the weak  the deformed  the monstrous .  you would do it to prevent     and the sirian s soft and pudgy hand extended suddenly  one finger pointing rigidly at bigman    its death .        servicemen and robots   steady  bigman   murmured lucky .   the little martian hunched low in his seat  his eyes watching devoure hotly .   lucky said   let s not be childish in our attempts to frighten .  execution is not easy on a world of robots .  the robots can t kill us  and i m not sure that you or your colleagues would be willing to kill a man in cold blood .     of course not  if you mean by killing the chopping off of a head or the blasting in of a chest .  but then there s nothing frightening in a quick death .  suppose  though  that our robots prepared a stripped down ship .  your   uh   companion could be chained to a bulkhead on that ship by robots who will  of course  be careful not to hurt him .  the ship can be fitted with an automatic pilot that will take it on an orbit away from your sun and out of the ecliptic .  there isn t a chance in a quadrillion that it would ever be spotted by anyone from earth .  it will travel on forever .    bigman broke in   lucky  it doesn t matter what they do to me .  don t you agree to anything .    devoure said  unheeding   your companion will have plenty of air and there ll be a tube of water with             in reach if it s thirsty .  of course it will be alone and there will be no food .  starvation is a slow death  and starvation in the ultimate loneliness of space is a horrible thing to contemplate .    lucky said   that would be a dastardly and dishonorable way of treating a prisoner of war .     there is no war .  you are merely spies .  and in any case  there is no need for it to happen  eh  councilman .  you need only sign the necessary confession that you intended to attack us and agree to confirm this in person at the conference .  i am sure you will heed the beggings of the thing you have befriended .     beggings .   bigman leaped  crimson faced  to his feet .   devoure raised his voice abruptly .   that thing is to be taken into custody .  proceed .    two robots materialized silently at either side  and each seized an arm .  for a moment bigman writhed  and his body lifted off the floor with the intensity of his effort  but his arms were held motionless .   one of the robots said   the master will please not resist  as otherwise the master may harm himself despite all we can do .    devoure said   you ll have twenty four hours to make up your mind .  plenty of time  eh  councilman .   he looked at the illuminated figures on the strip of decorative metal that encircled his left wrist .   and meanwhile  we will prepare our stripped ship .  if we don t have to use it  as i expect we won t  why  what s labor to robots  eh  councilman .  sit where you are  there is no use in trying to help your companion .  he will not be hurt for the while .          bigman was carried out of the room bodily while lucky  half risen out of his seat  watched helplessly .   a light flashed on a small box on the conference table .  devoure leaned over to touch it  and a luminous tube sprang into being just above the box .  the image of a head appeared .  a voice said   yonge and i have the report that you have the councilman  devoure .  why were we told only after his landing .     what difference does that make  zayon .  you know now .  are you coming in .     we certainly are .  we wish to meet the councilman .     come then to my office .    fifteen minutes later  two sirians arrived .  both were as tall as devoure  both were olive skinned  the greater ultraviolet radiation of sirius produced a dark skin  lucky realized   but they were older .  the cut hair of one was grizzled to steely gray .  he was thin lipped and spoke with rapid precision .  he was introduced as harrig zayon  and his uniform made it clear he was a member of the sirian space service .   the other was going somewhat bald .  there was a long scar on his forearm and he had the keen look of one who had grown old in space .  he was barrett yonge  also of the space service .   lucky said   your space service is  i think  somewhat the equivalent of our council of science .     yes  it is   said zayon gravely .   in that sense we are colleagues  though on opposite sides of the fence .     serviceman zayon  then .  serviceman yonge .  is mr .   devoure         devoure broke in   i am not a member of the space service .  it is not necessary that i be .  sirius can be served outside the service too .     particularly   said yonge  one hand resting on the scarred forearm as though to hide the mark   if one is nephew of the director of the central body .    devoure rose .   was that meant as sarcasm  serviceman .     not at all .  it was meant literally .  the relationship makes it possible for you to do sirius more service than otherwise .    but there was a dry quality to his statement  and lucky was not unaware of the flash of hostility between the two aging servicemen and the young and undoubtedly influential relative of sirius s overlord .   zayon tried to deflect the direction things had taken by turning to lucky and saying mildly   has our proposition been offered you .     you mean the suggestion that i lie at the interstellar conference .    zayon looked annoyed and a bit puzzled .  he said   i mean to join us  to become a sirian .     i don t think we had quite reached that point  serviceman .     well  then consider this .  our service knows you well and we respect your abilities and accomplishments .  they are wasted on an earth that must lose someday as a matter of biologic fact .     biologic fact .   lucky frowned .   the sirians  serviceman zayon  are descended from earthmen .     so they are  but not from all earthmen  only from some  from the best  from those with the initiative and strength to reach the stars as colonists .  we        have kept our descent pure  we have not allowed the weaklings in  or those with poor genes .  we have weeded out the unfit from among ourselves so that we are now a pure race of the strong  the fit  and the healthy  while earth remains a conglomerate of the diseased and deformed .    devoure broke in   we had an example here a while  ago  the councilman s companion .  it infuriated and  nauseated me merely to be in the same room with  him  a monkey  a five foot travesty of a human being   a lump of deformity    lucky said slowly   he is a better man than you  sirian .    devoure rose  fist drawn back  trembling .  zayon moved toward him rapidly  laying a hand on his shoulder .   devoure  sit down  please  and let me go on .  this is not the time for extraneous quarrels .   devoure shook the other s hand off roughly but sat down all the same .   serviceman zayon went on earnestly   to the outer worlds  councilman starr  earth is a terrible menace  a bomb of sub humanity  ready to explode and contaminate the clean galaxy .  we don t want that to happen  we can t allow it to happen .  it s what we re fighting for  a clean human race  composed of the fit .    lucky said   composed of those you consider fit .  but fitness comes in all shapes and forms .  the great men of earth have come from the tall and the short  from all manner of head shapes  skin colors  and languages .  variety is our salvation and the salvation of all mankind .     you are simply parroting something you have been taught .  councilman  can t you see you are really one       of us .  you are tall  strong  built like a sirian  you have the courage and daring of a sirian .  why combine with the scum of earth against men like yourself  just because of the accident of your birth on earth .    lucky said   the upshot of all this  serviceman  is that you wish me to come to the interstellar conference on vesta and deliver statements designed to help sirius .     to help sirius  yes  but true statements .  you have spied on us .  your ship was certainly armed .     but you waste your time .  mr .  devoure has already discussed the matter with me .     and you have agreed to be the sirian you really are .   zayon s face lit up at the possibility .   lucky cast a side glance at devoure  who was inspecting the knuckles of his hands with an indifferent air .   lucky said   why  mr .  devoure advanced the proposition in another fashion .  perhaps he did not inform you of my arrival sooner than he did in order to have time to discuss the matter with me alone and to use his own methods .  briefly  he simply said that i was to attend the conference on sirian terms or else my friend bigman was to be sent out in a stripped space ship to die of starvation .    slowly the two sirian servicemen turned to look at devoure  who merely continued the contemplation of his knuckles .   yonge said slowly  speaking directly to devoure    sir  it is not in the service tradition    devoure exploded in sudden flaming anger .   i am not a serviceman and i don t give a half credit piece for your tradition .  i m in charge of this base  and its        security is my responsibility .  you two have been appointed to accompany me as delegates to the conference on vesta so that the service will be represented  but i am to be chief delegate  and the success of the conference is also my responsibility .  if this earthman does not like the type of death reserved for his monkey friend  he need only agree to our terms  and he will agree to them a lot faster with that as stimulus than your offer of making a sirian out of him .    and listen further .   devoure rose from his seat   paced angrily to the far end of the room  and then  turned to glare at the frozen faced servicemen who  listened with disciplined self control .   i m tired of your  interference .  the service has had enough time to make  headway against earth and has a miserable record in  that regard .  let this earthman hear me say this .  he  should know it better than anyone .  the service has a  miserable record  and it is i who have trapped this  starr and not the service .  what you gentlemen need  is a little more guts  and that i intend to supply     it was at this moment that a robot threw open the  door and said   masters  i must be excused for enter  ing without orders from you  but i have been instructed  to tell you this concerning the small master who has  been taken into custody     bigman .   cried lucky  jumping to his feet .   what has happened to him .    after bigman had been carried out of the room by the two robots he had thought furiously .  not  really  of possible ways of escaping .  he was not so unrealistic as to think he could make his way through a horde of robots and  singlehanded  get away from a base as       well organized as this one  even if he had the shooting starr at his disposal  which he had not .   it was more than that .   lucky was being tempted to dishonor and betrayal  and bigman s life was the bait .   either way  lucky must not be subjected to this .  he must not have to save bigman s life at the cost of becoming a traitor .  nor must he have to save his honor by sacrificing bigman and carry the guilt with him for the rest of his life .   there was only one way to prevent both alternatives .  bigman faced that coldly .  if he were to die in some way with which lucky had nothing to do  the big earthman could bear no blame  even in his own mind .  and there would no longer be a live bigman with which to bargain .   bigman was forced into a small diagravitic car and taken for another two minute drive .   but those two minutes were enough to crystallize matters firmly in his mind .  his years with lucky had been happy  exciting ones .  he had lived a full lifetime in them and had faced death without fear .  he could face death now  also without fear .   and a quick death would not be so quick as to prevent him from evening a tiny bit of the score with devoure .  no man in his lifetime had insulted him so without retaliation .  he could not die and leave the score unevened .  the thought of the arrogant sirian so filled bigman with anger that for a moment he could not have told whether it was friendship for lucky or hatred of devoure that was driving him .   the robots lifted him out of the diagravitic car  and one passed its huge metal paws gently and expertly        down the sides of the martian s body in a routine search for weapons .   bigman felt a moment of panic and strove uselessly to knock aside the robot s arm .   i was searched on the ship before they let me get off   he howled  but the robot completed the search without paying attention .   the two seized him again  made ready to take him into a building .  the time  then  was now .  once he was in an actual cell  with force planes cutting him off  his task would be much harder .   bigman kicked his feet desperately forward and turned a somersault between the robots .  he was kept from turning completely around only by the robots  hold of his arms .   one said   it distresses me  master  that you have placed yourself in what must be a painful position .  if you will hold yourself motionless so that you will not interfere with our assigned task  we will hold you as lightly as we can .    but bigman kicked again and then shrieked piercingly   my arm .    the robots knelt at once and deposited bigman gently on his back .   are you in pain  master .     you stupid cobbers  you ve broken my arm .  don t touch it .  get some human being who knows how to take care of a broken arm  or get some robot who can   he ended in a moan  his face twisted in agony .   the robots moved slowly backward  eyes upon him .  they had no feelings  could have none .  but inside them were the positronic brain paths whose orientation was controlled by the potentials and       counter potentials set up by the three laws of robotics .  in the course of their fulfillment of one law  the second   that they obey an order  in this case an order to lead a human being to a specific spot   they had broken a higher law  the first  that they never bring harm to .  a human being .  the result in their brains must have been a kind of positronic chaos .   bigman cried out sharply   get help  sands  of mars   get    it was an order  backed by the power of the first law .  a human being was hurt .  the robots turned  started away   and bigman s right arm flashed down to the top of his hip boot and snaked inside .  he rose nimbly  with a needle gun wanning the palm of his hand .   at the sound of that  one of the robots turned back  voice blurred and thickened as a sign of the weakening hold of the confused positronic brain .   ith the mathter not in pain  then .   the second robot turned back too .    take me back to your sirian masters   bigman said tightly .   it was another order  but the first law was no longer reinforcing it .  a human being had not  after all  been harmed .  there was no shock or surprise at this revelation .  the nearest robot simply said  in a voice that had sharpened once more   as your arm is not  indeed  damaged  it becomes necessary for us to carry out our original order .  please come with us .    bigman wasted no time .  his needle gun flashed noiselessly  and the robot s head was a gout of melting metal .  what was left of it collapsed .         the second robot said   it will not help to destroy our functioning   and walked toward him .   self protection was the third law only .  a robot could not refuse to carry out an order  second law  on the basis of the third alone .  so it was bound to walk into a pointing needle gun .  and other robots were coming from all directions  summoned  no doubt  by some radioed call at the moment when bigman had first pretended the broken arm .   they would all walk into a needle gun  but there would be enough to survive his pumping shots .  those who would survive would then overpower him and carry him into imprisonment .  he would be deprived of the quick death he needed  and lucky would still be faced with the unbearable alternative .   there was only one way out .  bigman put the needle gun to his temple .       bigman against all  bigman cried out piercingly   not one step nearer .  any closer and i ll have to shoot .  you ll kill me .    he nerved himself for the possible shot .  if nothing else could be done  it would have to be that  but the robots stopped .  not one moved .  bigman s eyes moved slowly to right and left .  one robot was on the ground  headless  a useless lump of metal .  one was standing  arms half reaching out toward him .  one was a hundred feet away  caught in mid stride .   slowly bigman turned .  a robot was coming out of a building .  it was caught on the threshold .  still others were farther off .  it was as though a freezing blight had struck them all  struck them with instant paralysis .   he was not really surprised .  it was the first law .  all else had to take second place  orders  their own existence  everything .  they could not move if motion meant harm to a human being .   bigman said   every robot but that one    he pointed to the one facing him  the nearest  the companion of the one he had destroyed    leave now .  back to your immediately previous task and forget me and what has just happened .  failure to obey at once will mean my death .              .   so all but one had to leave .  this was dealing with them harshly  and bigman  grim faced  wondered if the potential being set up to drive the positrons might not be intense enough to harm the platinum indium sponge that made up the delicate robotic brains .   he had the earthman s distrust of robots and he rather hoped that was so .   all the robots but one were gone now .  the muzzle of the needle gun was still against bigman s temple .   he said to the remaining robot   take me back to your master .    he wanted to use a harsher term but what would a robot understand of the insult implied .  with difficulty he forced it down .     now   he said   and quickly .  do not allow any master or robot to interfere with us on our way .  i have this needle gun and shall use it on any master near us  or on myself if i have to .    the robot said hoarsely  the first signs of posi tronic malfunction  lucky had once told bigman  showed up in the timbre of the voice    i will follow orders .  the master may be certain that i shall do nothing that will harm him or another master .    it turned and led the way into the diagravitic car .  bigman followed .  he was half prepared for trickery on the way back  but there was none .  a robot was a machine following inescapable rules of action .  he had to remember that .  only human beings could lie and cheat .   when they stopped at devoure s office  bigman said   i ll wait in the car .  i won t leave .  you go in and tell the master devoure that the master bigman is        free and waiting for him .   bipman struggled with temptation and this time succumbed .  he was too close to devoure to resist successfully .  he said   tell him he can take me on with needle gun or fists  i don t care which .  tell him that if he s too saffron spined to do either  i ll come in and kick him from here to mars .    sten devoure stared at the robot in disbelief  his dark face scowling and his angry eyes peering out from under hunched eyebrows .    do you mean he s out there free .  and armed .    he looked at the two servicemen  who stared back with blank astonishment .   lucky muttered  great galaxy .   under his breath .  the irrepressible bigman would rum everything   and lose his life as well .    serviceman zayon rose heavily to his feet .   well  devoure  you don t expect the robot to be lying  do you .   he stepped across to the wall phone and punched the emergency combination .   if we have an earthman on base  armed and determined  we had better take action .     but how does he come to be armed .   devoure had still not wiped away the traces of confusion  but now he made for the door .  lucky followed him  and the sirian whirled at once .   get back  starr .    he turned to the robot .   stay with this earthman .  he is not to leave this building under any circumstances .    and now he seemed to have come to a decision .  he rushed from the room pulling out a heavy blaster as he did so .  zayon and yonge hesitated  cast a quick       look at lucky  then at the robot  made their own decision  and followed devoure .   the area before devoure s offices was wide and bathed in the artificial light that reproduced sirius s faintly bluish tinge .  bigman stood alone in the center  and at a hundred yards  distance were five robots .  others were approaching from another direction .    come and get that   roared devoure  gesturing to the nearer robots and pointing to bigman .    they won t come any closer   roared back bigman .   if they make a move toward me i shall burn your heart out of your chest  and they know i ll do it .  at least they can t take the chance i won t .   he stood there easily  mockingly .   devoure flushed and lifted his blaster .   bigman said   now don t hurt yourself with that blaster .  you re holding it a little close to your body .    his right elbow was resting in the palm of his left hand .  his right fist squeezed gently as he spoke  and from the muzzle of the needle gun just protruding from between second and third fingers  a jet of deuterium pulsed out under the guidance of a momentarily established magnetic field .  it took skill of the highest order to adjust the squeeze and thumb position correctly  but bigman had that .  no man in the system had more .   the muzzle tip of devoure s blaster was a tiny white spark  and devoure yelled his surprise and dropped it .   bigman said   i don t know who you other two cobbers are  but if either of you makes a move that        looks like a blaster is at the end of it  you ll never finish that move .    all froze .  yonge finally said carefully   how do you come to be armed .     a robot   said bigman   is no smarter than the cobber who runs him .  the robots who searched me on the ship and out here were instructed by someone who didn t know a martian uses his boots for more than something to put his legs into .     and how did you break away from the robots .    bigman said coolly   i had to destroy one .     you destroyed a robot .   a kind of electric horror stunned the three sirians .   bigman felt increasing tension .  he did not concern himself with the robots standing about  but at any moment another human sirian might appear and shoot him in the back from a safe distance .   the spot between his shoulders prickled as he waited for the shot .  well  it would be a flash .  he would never feel it .  and after that they would have lost their hold on lucky and  dead or not  bigman would be the winner .   only  he wanted a chance at devoure first  at that soft sirian cobber who had sat across the table from him and said things no man in the universe could say and be left standing .   bigman said   i could shoot you all .  shall we make an arrangement .     you won t shoot us   said serviceman yonge quietly .   a shooting would simply mean that an earthman has opened hostilities on a sirian planet .  it could mean war .          besides   roared devoure   if you make any attack it will release the robots .  they ll defend three humans rather than one .  throw down that needle gun and put yourself back in custody .     all right  send the robots away  and i ll surrender to you .     the robots will handle you   said devoure .  he made as though to turn nonchalantly toward the other sirians .   my skin crawls at having to talk to this deformed humanoid .    bigman s needle gun flashed at once  the small fire ball exploding a foot before devoure s eyes .   say something like that again and i ll blind you for good .  if the robots make a move  all three of you get it before they reach us .  it may mean war  but you three won t be here to see if it does .  order the robots away and i ll surrender to devoure  if he can take me .  i ll toss my needle gun to one of you other two and surrender .    zayon said stiffly   that sounds reasonable  devoure .    devoure was still rubbing his eyes .   take his gun then .  go over there and take it .     wait   said bigman   don t move yet .  i want your word of honor that i won t be shot down or given to the robots .  devoure has to take me .     my word of honor to you .   exploded devoure .    to me .  but not from you .  the word of one of the other two .  they re wearing the uniform of the sirian service and i ll take their word .  if i give them the needle gun  will they stand by and let you  devoure  come and take me with your bare hands .     you have my word   said zayon .          and mine   added yonge .   devoure said   what is this .  i have no intention of touching the creature .     afraid .   asked bigman softly .   am i too big for you  devoure .  you ve called me names .  do you want to put your muscles where your cowardly mouth is .  here s my needle gun  servicemen .    he tossed the gun suddenly in zayon s direction .  zayon reached out a hand and caught it neatly .   bigman waited .  now for death .   but zayon put the needle gun in his pocket .   devoure called out   robots .   and zayon called out with equal vigor   leave us  robots .    zayon said to devoure   he has our word .  you ll have to take him into custody yourself .     or do i come after you .   bigman called out in shrill mockery .   devoure snarled wordlessly and strode hastily toward bigman .  the small martian waited  slightly crouched  then took a small side step to avoid the arm reaching out for him and uncoiled like a tightly wound spring .   his fist struck the other s face with the dull impact of a mallet hitting a head of cabbage  and devoure staggered back  stumbling into a sitting position .  he stared at bigman in stunned amazement .  his right cheek had reddened and a trickle of blood made its slow way out of the corner of his mouth .  he put his finger to it  drew it away  and looked at the blood with an almost comical disbelief .   yonge said   the earthman is taller than he looks .    bigman said   i m not an earthman  i m a martian .  .   .  .  stand up  devoure .  or are you too soft .        can t you do anything without robots to help you .  do they wipe your mouth when you re done eating .    devoure yelled hoarsely and jumped to his feet but did not rush bigman .  he circled him instead  breathing hard  watching out of inflamed eyes .   bigman wheeled also  watching that panting body  soft with good living and robot help  watching the unskillful arms and clumsy legs .  the sirian  bigman was sure  had never fought fist to fist before .   bigman stepped in again  caught the other s arm with a sure and sudden motion  and twisted .  with a howl devoure flipped and fell prone .   bigman stepped back .   what s the matter .  i m not a he  i m just an it .  what s your trouble .    devoure looked up at the two servicemen with something deadly hi his eyes .  he rose to his knees and groaned as he put a hand to his side where it had hit the ground .   the two sirians did not make any move to help him .  they watched stolidly as bigman cut him down again and then again .   finally zayon stepped forward .   martian  you will hurt him seriously if you continue .  our agreement was to let devoure take you with his bare hands  and actually i think you have what you really wanted when you made the agreement .  that s all .  surrender quietly to me now or i ll have to use the needle gun .    but devoure  panting noisily  gasped   get away .  get away  zayon  it s too late for that .  step back  i say .    he called out in a high pitched yell   robots .  come here .    zayon said   he ll surrender to me .           no surrender   said devoure  ms swollen face  twitching with physical pain and intense fury .   no sur  render .  too late for that you  robot  the closest  one   i don t care what your serial number is   you .  take it   take that thing .   his voice rose to a scream as he pointed to bigman .   destroy it .  break it .  break each piece of it .    yonge shouted   devoure .  are you mad .  a robot can t do a thing like that .    the robot remained standing .  it did not move .   devoure said   you can t harm a human being  robot .  i m not asking you to do so .  but this is not a human being .    the robot turned to look at bigman .   bigman shouted   it won t believe that .  you may consider me non human  but a robot knows better .    devoure said   look at it  robot .  it talks and has a human shape  but so do you and you re no human .  i can prove it s not human .  did you ever see a full grown human so small .  that proves it s not human .  it s an animal and it is   it is harming me .  you must destroy it .     run to mamma robot   yelled bigman mockingly .   but the robot took the first step toward bigman .   yonge stepped forward and moved between the robot and bigman .   i can t allow this  devoure .  a robot must not do such a thing  even if for no other reason than that the stress of potential involved will ruin it .    but devoure said in a hoarse whisper   i m your superior .  if you make one move to stop me  i ll have you out of the service by tomorrow .    the habit of obedience was strong .  yonge fell back        but there was a look of intense distress and horror on his face .   the robot moved more quickly  and now bigman fell back a cautious step .   i m a human being   he said .    it is not human   cried devoure madly .   it is not human .  break every piece of it .  slowly .    a chill fell over bigman and left his mouth dry .  he had not counted on this .  a quick death  yes  but this .  .  .  .   there was no room to retreat  and he was without the escape his needle gun afforded .  there were other robots behind  and all were hearing the word that he was not human .       surrender  there was a smile on devoure s puffed and bruised face .  it must have hurt him  for one lip was split and he dabbed absently at it with his handkerchief  but his eyes were fixed on the robot moving toward bigman and he seemed aware of nothing else .   the small martian had only another six feet in which to retreat  and devoure made no effort to hasten the approaching robot or to move up those in the rear .   yonge said   devoure  for sinus s sake  man  there is no need of this .     no comments  yonge   said devoure tensely .   that humanoid has destroyed a robot and probably damaged others .  we ll need checkups on every robot who has been affected by the sight of his use of violence .  he deserves death .    zayon put out a restraining hand toward yonge   but the latter slapped it impatiently away .  yonge  said   death .  all right .  then ship him back to sirius  and have him tried and executed according to the  processes of law .  or set up a trial here at the base and  have him decently blasted .  but this is no execution .   simply because he beat              devoure cried in sudden fury   that s enough .  you have interfered once too often .  you re under arrest .  zayon  take his blaster and toss it over to me .    he turned briefly  loath to take his eyes off bigman for even a moment .   do it  zayon  or by all the devils of space i ll break you too .    with a bitter  wordless frown zayon held out his hand to yonge .  yonge hesitated  and his fingers curled about the butt of bis blaster  half drawing it in anger .   zayon whispered urgently   no  yonge .  don t give him the excuse .  he ll lift arrest when his madness is over .  he ll have to .    devoure called out   i want that blaster .    yonge ripped it out of its holster with a hand that trembled and thrust it butt first at zayon .  the latter tossed it at devoure s feet and devoure picked it up .   bigman  who had been maintaining an agonized silence as he watched futilely for a chance to dodge  to break away  now cried out   don t touch me  i m a master   as the robot s monstrous hand closed over bis wrist .   for a moment the robot hesitated  and then his grip tightened .  the other hand reached for bigman s elbow .  devoure laughed  a high pitched titter .   yonge turned on his heel and said in a suffocated tone   at least i don t have to watch this cowardly crime .   and as a result he did not observe what happened next  with an effort lucky remained calm when the three sirians left .  from a purely physical standpoint  he could not possibly beat down the robot with his bare hands .  somewhere in the building there might con         ceivably be a weapon he could use to destroy the robot  he could then get out and might even shoot down the three sirians .   but he would not be able to leave titan  nor win out against the entire base .   worse still  if he were killed   and in the end he would be   his deeper purposes would be lost  and he could not risk those .   he said to the robot   what happened to the master bigman .  state the essentials quickly .    the robot did  and lucky listened with a tense and painful attention .  he heard the robot s occasional slurring and lisping of words  the thickening of speech as it described bigman s doubled forcing of the robots by pretending or threatening harm to a human .   lucky groaned within .  a robot dead .  the force of sirian law would be extended to the full against bigman .  lucky knew enough about the sirians  culture and their regard for their robots to know that there could be no extenuating circumstances against robot icide .   how to save the impulsive bigman now .   lucky remembered his own halfhearted attempt to keep bigman on mimas .  he had not foreseen this exactly  but he had feared bigman s temper in the delicate circumstances now surrounding them .  he should have insisted on bigman s staying behind  but what was the use .  even as he thought this  he realized that he needed bigman s company .   but then he had to save him .  somehow he had to save him .   he walked rapidly toward the opening of the building  and the robot stepped stolidly into his path .   ac        cor ing to my instructions  the master s not to leave building under any thircumstances .     i am not leaving the building   said lucky sharply .   i am merely going to the door .  you have no instructions to prevent that .    for a moment the robot was silent  then it said   ac cor ing to my instructions  the master s not to leave building under any circumthantheth .    desperately lucky tried to push it aside  was seized  held motionless  then pushed back .   lucky bit his lip impatiently .  a whole robot  he thought  would have interpreted its instructions broadly .  this robot  however  had been damaged .  it was reduced to the bare essence of robotic understanding .   but he had to see bigman .  he whirled toward the conference table .  in its center there had been a trimen sional image reproducer .  devoure had used it when the two servicemen had called him .    you .  robot .   called lucky .   the robot lumbered to the table .   lucky said   how does the image reproducer work .    the robot was slow .  its speech was continuing to thicken .  it said   the controlth are n thith retheth .     which recess .    the robot showed him  moving a panel aside clumsily .    all right   said lucky .   can i focus on the area  just outside this building .  show me .  do it .    he stepped aside .  the robot worked  fumbling at the knobs .   it ith done  mathter .     let me see  then .   the area outside was in small image above the table  the figures of men smaller        still .  the robot had moved away and stared dully elsewhere .   lucky did not call him back .  there was no sound  but as he groped for what must be the sound control  his attention was caught by the fight that was going on .  devoure was fighting bigman .  fighting bigman .   how had the small imp managed to persuade the two servicemen to stand to one side and allow this to happen .  for of course bigman was cutting his opponent to ribbons .  lucky could extract no joy from it .   this could end only in bigman s death  and lucky knew that bigman realized that and didn t care .  the martian would court sure death  take any chance  to avenge an insult .   .   .   .  ah  one of the servicemen was stopping it now .   with that  lucky found the sound control .  words shot out of the image reproducer  devoure s frenzied call for robots and his shouted order that they break bigman .   for a split second lucky was not sure he had heard correctly  and then he beat both fists desperately against the table and whirled about in near despair .   he had to get out  but how .   there he was  alone with a robot containing only one instruction buzzing in what was left of its posi tronic brain paths  to keep lucky immobilized at all costs .   great galaxy  was there nothing that would take precedence over that order .  he lacked even a weapon with which to threaten suicide or kill the robot .   his eyes fell on the wall phone .  he had last seen zayon at it  something about emergency when the news about bigman broke .        lucky said   robot .  quickly .  what has been done here .    the robot approached  looked at the glowing combination of knobs in faint red  and said with tantalizing slowness   a mathter hath indicated all robotth to prepare battle thathionth .     how would i indicate that all robots are actually to proceed to battle stations at once .  superseding all current orders .    the robot stared at him  and lucky  in almost a frenzy  seized the robot s hand and pumped it .   tell me .  tell me .    could the thing understand him .  or did its ruined brain paths still have impressed upon them some remnant of instructions that prevented it from giving this information .     tell me .  or do it  do it .    the robot  not speaking  reached a finger toward the apparatus in an uneven movement and slowly depressed two buttons .  then its finger lifted an inch and stopped .    is that all .  are you done .   demanded lucky desperately .   but the robot merely turned and with an uneven tread  one foot dragging perceptibly  walked to the door and marched out .   in space devouring strides lucky dashed after him  out of the building and across the hundred yards separating him from bigman and the three sirians .   yonge  having turned in horror from what he expected would be the bloodcurdling destruction of a human being  did not hear the scream of agony he        expected .  instead there was a startled grunt from zayon and a wild cry from devoure .   he turned back .  the robot that had been holding bigman was holding him no more .  he was moving away ini a heavy run .  all the robots in sight were hastening away .   and the earthman  lucky starr  was now at big man s side  somehow .   lucky was bending over bigman  and the small  martian  rubbing his left arm vigorously  was shaking  his head .  yonge heard him say   one minute later   lucky  just one minute later and    devoufe was shouting hoarsely and uselessly at the robots  and then a loud speaker arrangement suddenly filled the air with clamor   commander devoure  instructions please .  our instruments indicate no sign of enemy .  explain battle stations order .  commander devoure  .   .   .    battle stations   muttered devoure  stunned .   no  wonder the robots   his eyes fell on lucky .   you  did that .    lucky nodded .   yes  sir .    devoure s puffy lips set and he said hoarsely   the clever  resourceful councilman .  you ve saved your monkey for the moment .   his blaster pointed firmly at lucky s midriff .   get into my offices .  every one of you .  you too  zayon .  all of you .    the image receiver on his desk was buzzing madly .  obviously it was the failure to get devoure at his office that had forced his distracted underlings to the loud speakers .   devoure flipped on the sound but left the image       blind .  he barked   cancel battle stations order .  it was an error .    the man at the other end spluttered something  and devoure said sharply   there s nothing wrong with the image .  get on the ball .  everyone back on routine .   but almost against his will his hand hovered between his face and the place where the image ought to be  as though he feared that somehow the other might penetrate to vision anyhow and see to what his face had been reduced    and wonder about it .   yonge s nostrils flared as he watched  and he slowly rubbed his scarred forearm .   devoure sat down .   the rest of you stand   he said  and stared sullenly from face to face .   this martian will die  maybe not by robot or in a stripped space ship .  i ll think of something  and if you think you saved him  earthman  be sure i ll think of something more amusing still .  i have an excellent imagination .    lucky said   i demand that he be treated as a prisoner of war .    devoure said   there is no war .  he is a spy .  he deserves death .  he is a roboticide .  he deserves death twice .   his voice trembled suddenly .   he lifted his hands against me .  he deserves death a dozen times .     i ll buy my friend   said lucky in a whisper .   he is not for sale     i can pay a high price .     how .   devoure grinned ferociously .   by bearing witness at the conference as you have been requested .  it is too late for that .  it is not enough .     i couldn t do that in any case   said lucky .   i        will not lie against earth  but there is a truth i can tell  a truth you do not know .    bigman said sharply   don t bargain with him  lucky .     the monkey is right   devoure said .   don t bargain .  nothing you can tell me will buy him .  i wouldn t sell him for all earth in my hand .    yonge interrupted sharply   i would for much less .  listen to the councilman .  their lives may be worth the information they have .    devoure said   don t provoke me .  you are under arrest .    but yonge lifted a chair and let it drop with a crash .   i defy you to arrest me .  i m a serviceman .  you can t execute me out of hand .  you dare not  no matter how i provoke you .  you must reserve me for trial .  and at any trial i have things to say .     such as .   demanded devoure with contempt  all the dislike of the aging serviceman for the young aristocrat was suddenly out in the open .   such as what happened today  how a five foot terrestrial tore you apart until you howled and zayon had to step in to save your life .  zayon will bear witness .  every man jack at the base will remember that you dared not show your face for days after this date   or will you have the nerve to show that torn face before it heals .     be quiet .     i can be quiet .  i need say nothing   if you will stop subordinating the good of sinus to your private hatreds .  listen to what the councilman has to say .   he turned to lucky .   i guarantee you a fair deal .    bigman piped up   what fair deal .  you and zayon will wake up one morning and find yourselves dead       by accident and devoure will be so sorry and send you lots of flowers  only after that there ll be no one to say how he needs robots to hide behind when a martian is after his filthy skin .  then we ll go any way he likes .  so why bargain .     there ll be nothing like that   said yonge stiffly   because i will give the complete story to one of the robots within an hour of my leaving here .  he won t know which one  and he won t find out .  if either zayon or myself dies of anything but natural causes  the story will be relayed to the public sub etherics in full  otherwise  not .  i rather think devoure will be anxious to see that nothing happens to zayon or myself .    zayon shook his head .   i don t like this  yonge .     you ve got to like it  zayon .  you witnessed his beating .  do you think he wouldn t do his worst for you if you didn t take precautions .  come  i m weary of sacrificing the honor of the service to the nephew of the director .    zayon said unhappily   well  what is your information  councilman starr .    lucky said in a low voice   it s more than information .  it s surrender .  there is another councilman on what you call sirian territory .  agree to treat my friend as a prisoner of war and safeguard his life by forgetting the roboticide incident and i ll take you to this other councilman .        prelude to vesta  bigman  who  to the end  had been certain that lucky had some stratagem on hand  was appalled .  he called out in a heartbroken wail   no  lucky .  no .  i don t want to be pulled out that way .    devoure was openly astonished .   where .  no ship could have penetrated our defenses .  it s a lie .     i ll take you to the man   said lucky wearily   if we come to an arrangement .     space .   growled yonge .   it s an arrangement .     wait   said devoure angrily .   i admit this could be of value to us  but is starr suggesting that he will openly testify to the conference on vesta that this other councilman invaded our territory and that starr voluntarily revealed his hiding place .     it s the truth   said lucky .   i will so testify .     the word of honor of a councilman .   sneered devoure .    i have said i will testify .     well  then   said devoure   since our servicemen will have it so  you may have your lives hi exchange .   his eyes suddenly sparked fury .   on mimas .  is that it  councilman .  mimas .     that is correct .               by sinus .   devoure rose to his feet in agitation .   we almost missed it .  nor did this occur to the service .    zayon said with thought   mimas .     the service still doesn t get it   said devoure with a malignant scowl .   three men were on the shooting starr  obviously .  three entered mimas  two left  one stayed behind .  it was your report  yonge  i believe  which stressed the fact that starr always worked with his companion in a party of two .     he always had   said yonge .    and was there no flexibility left in you to consider the possibility of a third .  shall we go then to mimas .   devoure seemed to have lost his mad passion for revenge in the stress of this new development  almost to have regained the mocking irony he had displayed when the two terrestrials had first landed on titan .   and you will give us the pleasure of your company  councilman .     certainly  mr .  devoure   said lucky .   bigman moved away  face averted .  he felt worse now  he thought  than even in that last moment of robotic advance when the metal limbs were on his arm  ready to smash .   the shooting starr was in space again  but not as an independent ship .  it was caught in firm magnetic grapple and moved according to the impulses of the engines of the accompanying sirian ship .   the trip from titan to mimas took the better part of two days  and it was a hard time for lucky  a bitter  suspenseful time .   he missed bigman  who had been taken from him         .   and placed on the sirian ship .   the two on separate ships  devoure had pointed out  were hostages for each other s good behavior .    it was the sirian serviceman  harrig zayon  who made the second on the ship .  there was a stiffness about him .  he made no effort to repeat his original attempt to convert lucky starr to sirian views  and lucky could not resist taking the offensive in the matter .  he asked if devoure were an example  in zayon s eyes  of the superior race of human beings that inhabited the sirian planets .   zayon said reluctantly   devoure has not had the benefit of service training and service discipline .  he is emotional .     your colleague  yonge  seems to consider it more than that .  he makes no secret of his low opinion of devoure .     yonge is   is a representative of an extreme view among the servicemen .  that scar on his arm was received during some internal troubles that attended the rise of the present director of the central body to power .     devoure s uncle .     yes .  the service was on the side of the previous director  and yonge followed orders with serviceman s honor .  as a result he was passed over for promotion under the new regime .  oh  they send him out here and appoint him to the committee which will represent sirius at vesta  but in actual fact he is under devoure .     the director s nephew .     yes .  and yonge resents it .  yonge cannot bring himself to understand that the service is an organ       of the state and does not question its policies or have anything to do with the question of which individual or group is to govern it .  he is an excellent serviceman  otherwise .     but you have not answered the question as to whether you found devoure a satisfactory representative of the sirian elite .    zayon said angrily   what about your earth .  have you never had unsatisfactory rulers .  or even vicious ones .     any number   admitted lucky   but we are a miscellaneous lot on earth  we vary .  no ruler can stay in power very long if he doesn t represent a compromise among us .  compromising rulers may not be dynamic  but neither are they tyrannical .  on sirius you have developed a sameness among yourselves  and a ruler can go to extremes along the lines of that sameness .  for that reason autocracy and force in politics are not the exceptional interlude that they are on earth  but are the rule with you .    zayon sighed  but it was long hours before he spoke to lucky again .  it was not until mimas was large in the visiplate and they were decelerating to land .   zayon said   tell me  councilman .  i ask you on your honor .  is this a trick of some sort .    lucky s stomach tightened  but he said calmly   what do you mean by a trick .     is there really a councilman on mimas .     yes  there is .  what do you expect .  that i have a force knot concealed on mimas designed to blow us all to nothingness .     perhaps something like that .           and what would i gain .  the destruction of one sirian ship and a dozen sirians .     you would gain your honor .     lucky shrugged .   i have made a bargain .  we have a councilman down there .  i will go and get him and there will be no resistance .    zayon nodded .   very well .  i suppose you would not make a sirian after all .  you had better stay an earthman .    lucky smiled bitterly .  that  then  was the source of zayon s ill humor .  his stiff serviceman s sense of honor objected to lucky s behavior even when he believed sirius to be benefiting by it  back at port center  international city  earth  chief councilman hector conway waited to leave for vesta .  he had not heard directly from lucky since the shooting starr had moved into the shadow of hidalgo .   the capsule brought in by captain bernold had been specific enough in its curt way and had been marked by lucky s usual hard common sense .  a call for a conference had been the only way out .  the president had seen that at once  and though some members of the cabinet were bellicose about matters  they had been overruled .   even sirius  quite as lucky had predicted  had adopted the notion eagerly .  it was  obviously  exactly what the sirian government wanted  a conference that was sure to fail  followed by a war on their own terms .  to all outward appearances  they had all the cards .   it was that very fact that had made it so necessary       to keep as much as possible from the public .  if all details were put on the sub ether without careful preparation  an indignant public might howl earth s government irresistibly into war against all the galaxy .  the call for a conference would only make matters worse  since it would be interpreted as a cowardly sell out to the sirians .   and yet complete secrecy was impossible  too  and the press was angry and rebellious at being fed diluted government reports .  things were worsening daily .   the president would have to hold out somehow until the conference could take place .  and yet  if the conference failed  the present situation would be honey sweet compared to that which would come .   in the general indignation that would follow  there would be not only war  but the council of science would be completely discredited and destroyed  and the terrestrial federation would lose its most powerful weapon just when it needed it most .   it had been weeks since hector conway had slept without pills  and for the first time in his career he thought earnestly that he should be retiring .   he rose heavily and made his way forward to the ship now being readied for the launching .  in a week he would be on vesta for preliminary discussions with doremo .  that old pink eyed statesman would be holding the balance of power .  there was no doubting that .  the very weakness of his small world was what made him powerful .  he was the nearest thing to an honest and disinterested neutral in the galaxy  and even the sirians would listen to him .   if conway could get his ear to begin with  .   .   .         he was scarcely aware of the man approaching to stop him until there was a near collision .    eh .  what is this .   demanded conway in annoyance .   the man touched the brim of his hat .   jan dieppe of trans sub etheric  chief .  i wonder if you would answer a few questions .     no  no .  i m ready to board ship .     i realize that  sir .  it s the very reason fm stopping you .  i won t get another chance .  you re heading out for vesta  of course .     yes  of course .     to see about the outrage on saturn .     well .     what do you expect the conference to do  chief .  do you suppose sirius will listen to resolutions and votes .     yes  i think sirius will .     do you think the votes will go against her .     i m sure they will .  now may i pass .     i m sorry  sir  but there s something very important just now that earth s people must know about .     please .  don t tell me what you think they must know .  i assure you that the good of earth s people is close to my heart .     and is that why the council of science is willing to allow foreign governments to vote on whether or not the terrestrial federation s territory has been invaded .  a question that should be reserved to our own decision alone .    conway could not fail to note the undercurrent of threat in the other s outwardly polite but persistent questioning .  he looked over the reporter s shoulder       and could see the secretary of state talking to a group of other newsmen at a point closer to the ship .   he said   what are you getting at .     the public is questioning the good faith of the council  i m afraid  chief .  and in that connection  trans sub ether has picked up a sirian news broadcast that it has not yet made public .  we need your comments on it .     no comments .  a sirian news broadcast designed for home consumption is not worth comment .     this report was quite circumstantial .  for instance  where is councilman david starr  the legendary lucky  himself .  where is he .     what .     come on now  chief .  i know the council s agents dislike publicity  but has councilman starr been sent to saturn on a secret mission .     now if that were so  young man  would you expect me to talk about it .     yes  if sirius were already talking about it .  it s no secret to them .  they say lucky starr invaded the sa turnian system and was captured .  is that true .    conway said stiffly   i do not know the present whereabouts of councilman david starr .     does that mean he might be in the saturnian system .     it means that i do not know his whereabouts .    the reporter s nose wrinkled .   all right .  if you think it sounds better to have the chief of the council of science deny that he knows the whereabouts of one of his important agents  that s your business .  but the general mood of the public is increasingly anti council .  there is considerable talk of the council s        inefficiency in letting sinus get to saturn in the first place and its interest in whitewashing the whole affair for the sake of their political skins .     you are being insulting .  good day  sir .     the sirians are quite definite that lucky starr has been captured in the saturnian system .  any comment on that .     no .  let me pass .     the sirians say that lucky starr will be at the conference .     oh .   for a moment conway could not conceal a spasm of interest .    that seems to get you  chief .  the only catch is that the sirians say he ll be testifying for them .    conway said with difficulty   that remains to be seen .     do you admit he ll be at the conference .     i know nothing about that .    the reporter stepped aside .   all right  chief .  it s just that the sirians say that starr has already given them valuable information and that the sirians will be able to convict us of aggression on the basis of it .  i mean  what s the council doing .  fighting with us or against us .    conway  feeling unbearably harried  muttered   no comment   and started to pass by .   the reporter called after him .   starr is your adopted son  isn t he  chief .    for a moment conway turned back .  then  without a word  he hastened on to the ship .   what was there to say .  what could he say except that ahead of him lay an interstellar conference more crucial for earth than any meeting of any sort in its       history .  that this conference was weighted heavily on the side of sinus .  that chances were almost intolerably great that peace  the council of science  the terrestrial federation would all be destroyed .   and that only the thin shield of lucky s efforts protected them .   somehow  what depressed conway more than anything else   more  even  than a lost war   was the thought that if the sirian news report were true and if the conference nevertheless failed despite lucky s original intentions  lucky would go down in history as earth s arch traitor .  and only a few would ever know better .       on vesta  the secretary of state  lament finney  was a career politician who had served some fifteen years in the legislature and whose relations with the council of science had never been overwhelmingly friendly .  he was aging now  not in the best of health  and inclined to be querulous .  officially he headed the terrestrial delegation to vesta .  in actuality  though  conway understood quite well that he  himself  as head of the council  must be prepared to take full responsibility for failure   if there was failure .   finney made that clear even before the ship  one of earth s largest space liners  took off .   he said   the press is almost uncontrollable .  you re in a bad spot  conway .     all earth is .     you  conway .    conway said gloomily   well  i am under no illusions that if things go badly the council can expect support from the government .     i m afraid not .   the secretary of state was strapping himself in with meticulous care against the rigors of take off and making certain that his bottle of anti space sickness pills were handy .   government sup             port for you would only mean the downfall of the government  and there will be enough troubles with a war emergency .  we can t afford political instability .    conway thought  he has no confidence in the outcome of the conference at all .  he expects the war .   he said   listen  finney  if the worst does come to  the worst  i will need voices on my side to help pre  vent councilman starr s reputation from      finney lifted his gray head momentarily from the hydraulic cushion and stared at the other out of fading  troubled eyes .   impossible .  your councilman went into saturn on his own  asked no permission  received no orders .  he was willing to take the risks .  if things turn out badly  he is done .  what else can we do .     you know he     i don t know   said the politician violently .   i know nothing officially .  you ve been in public life long enough to know that under certain conditions the people need a scapegoat and insist on one .  councilman starr will be the scapegoat .    he leaned back again  closed his eyes  and conway leaned back beside him .  elsewhere in the ship others were in their places  and the far thunder of the engines started up and rose in pitch as the ship raised itself slowly from the launching pad and lifted toward the sky .   the shooting starr hovered a thousand miles above vesta  caught in its feeble gravity and circling it slowly with engines blocked .  grappled to it was a small lifeboat from the sirian mother ship .   serviceman zayon had left the shooting starr to join the sirian delegation on vesta  and a robot re         mained behind in his place .  in the lifeboat was big man  and with him serviceman yonge .   lucky had been surprised when yonge s face first stared out at him in the receiver .  he said   what are you doing out in space .  is bigman with you .     he is .  i m his guard .  i suppose you expected a robot .     yes  i did .  or won t they trust bigman with a robot after last time .     no  this is just devoure s little way of seeing to it that i don t attend the conference .  it s a slap at the service .    lucky said   serviceman zayon will be there .     zayon   yonge sniffed .   he is an adequate man  but he s a follower .  he can t realize that there s more to the service than blindly obeying orders from above  that we owe it to sinus to see to it that she is ruled according to the inflexible principles of honor that guide the service itself .    lucky said   how is bigman .     well enough .  he seems unhappy .  it s strange that such an odd looking person should have a sterner sense of duty and honor than a person like yourself .    lucky clamped his lips together .  there was little  time left  and it worried him whenever either service  man began speculating about lucky s loss of honor .   from that it was a step to wondering if lucky might  by some chance have retained his honor  and then they  might wonder what his intentions really were  and  after that  yonge shrugged .   well  i called only to make sure all was well .  i am responsible for your welfare until  in good time  we get you down before the conference .          wait  serviceman .  you performed a service for me  back on titan     i did nothing for you .  i followed the dictates of duty .     nevertheless  you saved bigman s life and mine  too  perhaps .  it may so happen that when the conference is over you may consider your life in danger .     my life .    lucky said carefully   once i have given evidence  devoure may for one reason or another decide to get rid of you despite the risk of having sirians find out about his fight with bigman .    yonge laughed bitterly .   he wasn t seen once on the trip out here .  he was waiting in his cabin for his face to heal .  i m safe enough .     just the same  if you consider yourself in danger  approach hector conway  chief councilman of science .  my word on it that he will accept you as a political exile .     i suppose you mean that kindly   said yonge   but i think that after the conference it will be conway who will have to seek political asylum .   yonge broke connections .   and lucky was left to look down at gleaming vesta and to think sadly that  after all  the chances were heavily in favor of yonge s being right  vesta was one of the largest of the asteroids .  it was not the size of ceres  which was more than five hundred miles in diameter and a giant among asteroids  but its     mile span put it into the second class  where only two other asteroids  pallas and juno  competed with it .         as seen from earth  vesta was the brightest of the asteroids because of the chance that had composed its outermost shell so largely of calcium carbonate rather than the darker silicates and metallic oxides that made up the other  asteroids .   scientists speculated on this odd divergence in chemical constitution  which had not been suspected until an actual landing was made upon it  before that the ancient astronomers had wondered if vesta lay under a coat of ice or frozen carbon dioxide  but had come to no conclusion .  and the feature writers took to calling it the  world of marble .    the  world of marble  had been converted into a naval base in the first days of the fight with the space pirates of the asteroid belt .  the natural caverns under its surface had been enlarged and made airtight  and there had been room to store a fleet and house two years of provisions for it .   now the naval base was more or less obsolete  but with small changes the caverns could be  and had been  made a most suitable meeting ground for delegates from all over the galaxy .   food and water supplies had been laid down  and luxuries which naval men had not required were added .  as one passed the marble surface and entered the interior  there was little to distinguish vesta from an earthside hotel .   the terrestrial delegation as the hosts  vesta was terrestrial territory  not even the sirians could dispute that  assigned the quarters and saw to it that the delegates were comfortable .  this meant the adjustment of the various quarters to the slight difference in gravity and atmospheric conditions to which the delegates       might be accustomed .  those from warren  for instance  had the quarters air conditioned to a moderate chill to allow for the frigid climate of their home planet .   it was not an accident that greatest pains were taken for the delegation from elam .  it was a small world circling a red dwarf star .  its environment was such that one would not have supposed human beings could flourish there .  yet the very deficiencies were turned into account by the restless ingenuity of the human species .   there was not enough light to allow earth type plants to grow properly  so artificial lights were used and special breeds were cultivated  until elamite grains and agricultural products generally were not merely adequate but of superior quality that could not be duplicated elsewhere in the galaxy .  elamite prosperity rested on her agricultural exports in a way that other worlds more favored by nature could not match .   probably as a result of the poor light of elam s sun  there was no biological favoring of skin pigmentation .  the inhabitants were fak skinned almost to extremes .   the head of the elamite delegation  for instance  was almost an albino .  he was agas doremo  for more than thirty years the recognized leader of the neutralist forces in the galaxy .  in every question that arose between earth and sinus  which  of course  represented the extreme anti terrestrial forces of the galaxy  he held the balance even .   conway counted on him to do so in this case too .  he entered the quarters assigned to the elamite with an air of friendship .  he took care to keep from being overeffusive and shook hands warmly .  he blinked in        the low pitched  red tinged light and accepted a glass of native elamite brew .   doremo said   your hair has grown white since last i saw you  conway   as white as mine .     it has been many years since we last met  doremo .     then it hasn t grown white just these last few months .    conway smiled ruefully .   it would have  i think  if it had been dark to begin with .    doremo nodded and sipped his drink .  he said   earth has let itself be placed in a most uncomfortable position .     so it has  and yet by all the rules of logic  earth is in the right .     yes .   doremo was noncommittal .    i don t know how much thought you ve given this  matter     considerable .     or how willing you are to discuss the matter in  advance     why not .  the sirians have been at me .     ah .  already .     i stopped off at titan on the way in .   doremo shook his head   they ve got a beautiful base there  as i could see once they supplied me with dark glasses    it s the horrible blue light of sinus that spoils things  of course .  you have to give them credit  conway  they do things with a splash .     have you decided that they have a right to colonize saturn .    doremo said   my dear conway  i have decided only that i want peace .  a war will do no one any good .  the situation  however  is this  the sirians are in the       saturnian system .  how can they be forced out of it without war .     there is one way   said conway .   if the other outer worlds were to make it clear that they considered sirius to be an invader  sirius could not face the enmity of all the galaxy .     ah  but how are the outer worlds to be persuaded to vote against sirius .   doremo said .   most of them  if you ll forgive me  have a traditional suspicion of earth  and they will tell themselves that the saturnian system was  after all  uninhabited .     but it has been a settled assumption since earth first granted independence to the outer worlds  as a result of the hegellian doctrine  that no smaller unit than a stellar system is to be considered capable of independence .  an unoccupied planetary system means nothing unless the stellar system of which it is a part is unoccupied as a whole .     i agree with you .  i admit that this has been the assumption .  however  the assumption has never been put to the test .  now it will be .     do you think   said conway softly   that it would be wise to destroy the assumption  to accept a new principle that would allow any stranger to enter a system and colonize such unpopulated planets or planetoids as he may come across .     no   said doremo emphatically   i do not think so .   i think it to the best interests of all of us that stellar  systems continue to be considered as indivisible   but     but .     there will be passions aroused at this conference that will make it difficult for delegates to approach        matters logically .  if i may presume to advise  earth     go ahead .  this is unofficial and off the record .       would say  count on no support at this conference .  allow sirius to remain on saturn for the present .  she will overplay her hand eventually and then you can call a second conference with higher hopes .    conway shook his head .   impossible .  if we fail here  there will be passions aroused on our side  they are aroused already .    doremo shrugged .   passions everywhere .  i am very pessimistic about this .    conway said persuasively   but if you yourself believe that sirius ought not to be on saturn  could you not make an effort to persuade others of this .  you are a person of influence who commands the respect of the galaxy .  i don t ask you to do anything but stick by your own belief .  it may make all the difference between war and peace .    doremo put his glass aside and dabbed at his lip with a napkin .   it is what i would very much like to do  conway  but i don t even dare to try at this conference .  sirius has matters so entirely its own way that it might be dangerous for elam to stand against them .  we are a small world .   .   .   .  after all  conway  if you called this conference in order to reach a peaceful solution  why did you simultaneously send war vessels into the saturnian system .     is that what the sirians told you  doremo .     yes .  they showed me some of the evidence they had .  i was even shown a captured earth ship in flight to vesta under the magnetic grapple of a sirian vessel .  i was told that no less a person than lucky starr        of whom even we on elam have heard somewhat  was on board .  i understand starr is circling off vesta now  waiting to testify .    slowly conway nodded .   doremo said   now if starr admits to warlike actions against the sirians   and he will  otherwise it is inconceivable the sirians will allow him to testify    then it will be all the conference needs .  no arguments will stand against it .  starr  i believe  is an adopted son of yours .     in a way  yes   muttered conway .    that makes it worse  you see .  and if you say that  he acted without earth s sanction  as i suppose you  must     it s true that he did   said conway   but i am not prepared to say what we will claim .     if you disown him  no one will believe you .  your own son  you see .  the outer world delegates will set up the cry of  perfidious terrestria   of earth s supposed hypocrisy .  sirius will make the most of it  and      be able to do nothing .  i will not even be able to cast my personal vote in favor of earth .  .  .  .  earth had better give in now .    conway shook his head .   earth cannot .     then   said doremo with infinite sadness   it will mean war  with all of us against earth  conway .        the conference  conway had finished his drink .  now he rose to go  shaking hands with a look of settled melancholy on his face .   he said  almost as an afterthought   but you know  we haven t heard lucky s testimony yet .  if the effects aren t as bad as you think  if his testimony should even prove harmless  would you work then on behalf of peace .    doremo shrugged .   you are grasping at straws .  yes  yes  in the unlikely case that the conference is not stampeded past recall by your foster son s words  i will do my bit .  as i told you  i am really on your side .     i thank you  sir .   they shook hands again .   doremo stared after the departing chief councilman with a sad little shake of his head .  outside the door  however  conway paused to catch his breath .  it was really quite as much as he had expected .  now if only the sirians would present lucky .   the conference opened on the stiff and formal note to be expected .  everyone was painfully correct  and when earth s delegation entered to take their posts in            the front and at the extreme right of the hall  all the delegates already seated  even the sirians in the front and extreme left  rose .   when the secretary of state  representing the host power  rose to make a welcoming speech  he spoke in generalities about peace and the door it opened to the continuing expansion of mankind through the galaxy  of the common ancestry and brotherhood of all men  of the grievous disaster war would be .  he carefully made no mention of the specific points of issue  did not refer to sirius by name  and  above all  made no threats .   he was graciously applauded .  then the conference voted agas doremo into the chair to preside  he was the only man on whom both sides could agree   and the chief business of the conference began .   the conference was not open to the public  but there were special booths for reporters from the various worlds represented .  they were not to interview individual delegates but were allowed to listen and send out uncensored reports .   the proceedings  as was customary in such interstellar gatherings  were carried on in interlingua  the language amalgam that served throughout the galaxy .   after a short speech by doremo extolling the virtues of compromise and begging no one to be so stubborn as to risk war where a slight yielding might insure peace  he recognized earth s secretary of state once more .   this time the secretary was a partisan  presenting his side of the dispute forcefully and well .   there was  however  no mistaking the hostile atti         tude of the other delegates .  it hung like a fog over the assembly hall .   conway sat next to the orating secretary  with his chin digging into his chest .  ordinarily it would be a mistake for earth to present its major speech at the very start .  it would be a case of shooting off the best ammunition before the nature of the target was known .  it would give sinus the opportunity for a crushing rebuttal .   but in this case  however  this was exactly what conway wanted .   he whipped out a handkerchief  passed it over his forehead  then put it hastily back and hoped he had not been noticed .  he did not want to seem worried .   sirius reserved its rebuttal and  undoubtedly by arrangement  representatives of three of the outer worlds  three that were notoriously under sirian influence  rose to speak briefly .  each avoided the direct problem but commented forcefully on the aggressive intentions of earth and on its ambitions to reimpose a galactic government under its own rule .  they set the stage for the eventual sirian display and  having done so  there was a lunch recess .   finally  six hours after the conference had been called to order  sten devoure of sirius was recognized and rose slowly to his feet .  he stepped forward with quiet deliberation to the rostrum and stood there  looking down upon the delegates with an expression of proud confidence on his olive skinned face .   there was no sign of his misadventure with bigman .    there was a stir among the delegates that quieted       only after a number of minutes during which devoure made no effort to begin speaking .   conway was certain that every delegate knew that lucky starr would be testifying soon .  they were waiting for this complete humiliation of earth with excitement and anticipation .   devoure began his speech at last  very quietly .  his introduction was historical .  going back to the days when sirius was a terrestrial colony  he rehearsed once again the grievances of that day .  he brushed over the hegellian doctrine  which had established the independence of sirius as well as that of the other colonies  as insincere  and one by one cited the supposed efforts of earth to re establish domination .   coming down to the present  he said   we are now accused of having colonized an unoccupied world .  we plead guilty to that .  we are accused of having taken an empty world and made it a beautiful habitation for human beings .  we plead guilty to that .  we are accused of extending the range of the human race to a world suitable for it that had been neglected by others .  we plead guilty to that .    we have not been accused of offering violence to anyone in the process .  we have not been accused of making war  of killing and wounding  in the course of our occupation .  we are accused of no crime at all .  instead  it is merely stated that not quite a billion miles away from the world we now so peacefully occupy there is another occupied world named earth .    we are not aware that this has anything to do with our world  saturn .  we offer no violence to earth  and they accuse us of none .  we ask only the privilege of        being left to ourselves  and in return for that we are glad to offer to leave them to themselves .    they say saturn is theirs .  why .  have they occupied its satellites at any time .  no .  have they shown interest in it .  no .  for the thousands of years during which it was theirs for the taking  did they want it .  no .  it was only after we landed on it that they suddenly discovered their interest in it .    they say saturn circles about the same sun that earth does .  we admit that  but we also point out that the fact is irrelevant .  an empty world is an empty world  regardless of the particular route it travels through space .  we colonized it first and it is ours .    now i have said that sirius occupied the saturnian system without force of any kind and without the threat of force  that we are actuated in all we do by a desire for peace .  we do not speak much of peace  as earth does  but we at least practice it .  when earth called for a conference  we accepted at once  for the sake of peace  even though there is no shadow of any sort on our title to the saturnian system .    but what of earth .  how does it back its views .  they are very fluent in their talks on peace  but their actions match their words very poorly .  they called for peace and practiced war .  they demanded a conference and at the same time outfitted a war expedition .  in short  while sirius risked its interests for the sake of peace  earth  in return  made unprovoked war upon us .  i can prove this from the mouth of a member of earth s own council of science .    he raised his hand as he spoke the last sentence  his first gesture of any sort  and pointed dramatically to a doorway upon which a spot of light had been       allowed to fall .  lucky starr was standing there  tall and defiantly straight .  a robot flanked him on either side .   lucky  on being brought down to vesta  finally saw bigman again .  the little martian ran to him  while yonge looked on with dour amusement from a distance .    lucky   pleaded bigman .   sands of mars  lucky  don t go through with it .  they can t make you say a word if you don t want to  and it doesn t really matter what happens to me .    slowly lucky shook his head .   wait  bigman .  wait one more day .    yonge came up and took bigman by the elbow .   sorry  starr  but we need him till you re through .  devoure has a great sense of hostage  and at this point i rather think he s right .  you re going to have to face your own people  and dishonor will be difficult .    lucky nerved himself for just that when he finally stood hi the doorway and felt the eyes upon him  the silence  the caught breaths .  in the spotlight himself  lucky saw the delegates to the conference as nothing but a giant black mass .  it was only after the robots led him into the witness box that faces swam out of the crowd at him  and he could see hector conway in the front row .   for a moment conway smiled at him with weary affection  but lucky dared not smile back .  this was the crisis and he must do nothing that  even at this late moment  might warn the sirians .   devoure stared at the earthman hungrily  savoring        his coming triumph .  he said   gentlemen .  i wish temporarily to convert this conference into something approaching a court of law .  i have a witness here whom i wish all the delegates to hear .  i well rest my case on what he says   he  an earthman and an important agent of the council of science .    he then said to lucky with sudden sharpness   your name  citizenship  and position  please .    lucky said   i am david starr  native of earth  and member of the council of science .     have you been subjected to drugs  to psychic probing  or to mental violence of any sort to induce you to testify here .     no  sir .     you speak voluntarily  and will tell the truth .     i speak voluntarily and will tell the truth .    devoure turned to the delegates .   it may occur to some of you that councilman starr has indeed been handled mentally without his knowledge or that he may be denying mental harm as the very result of that mental harm .  if so  he may be examined by any member of this conference with medical qualification   i know there are a number of such   if anyone demands such examination .    no one made the demand  and devoure went on  addressing lucky   when did you first become aware of the sirian base within the saturnian system .    curtly  unemotionally  eyes staring stonily forward  lucky told of the first entry into the saturnian system and the warning to leave .   conway nodded slightly at lucky s complete omission of the capsule or of agent x s spying activities .  agent x might have been merely a ter        restrial criminal .  obviously sirius wanted no mention of its own spying at this time and  as obviously  lucky was satisfied to go along with them in this .    and did you leave after being warned .     i did  sir .     permanently .     no  sir .     what did you do next .    lucky described the ruse with hidalgo  the approach to saturn s south pole  the flight through the gap in the rings to mimas .   devoure interrupted   did we at any time offer violence to your ship .     no  sir .    devoure turned to the delegates again .   there is no need to rely only upon the word of the councilman .  i have here telephotos of the pursuit of the councilman s ship to mimas .    while lucky remained in the spotlight the rest of the chamber was darkened  and in the three dimensional imagery the delegates watched scenes of the shooting starr speeding toward the rings and disappearing into a gap which  at the angle of photography  could not be seen .   it was next shown racing headlong into mimas and disappearing in a flash of ruddy light and vapor .   at this time devoure must have felt the growth of a furtive admiration for the daring of the earthman  for he said with a touch of annoyed haste   our inability to overtake the councilman was the result of his ship s equipment with agrav motors .  maneuvers in the neighborhood of saturn were more difficult for us than for him .  for that reason we our         selves had not previously approached mimas and were not psychologically ready for his doing so .    if conway had dared he would have shouted aloud at that .  the fool .  devoure would pay for that moment of jealousy .  of course by mentioning agrav he was trying to stir up the outer worlds  fears of earth s scientific advances  and that might be a mistake too .  the fears might grow too strong .   devoure said to lucky   now then  what happened once you left mimas .    lucky described his capture  and devoure  having hinted at sirius s possession of advanced mass detection devices  said   and then  once on titan  did you give us further information concerning your activities on mimas .     yes  sir .  i told you that another councilman was still on mimas  and then i accompanied you back to mimas .    this the delegates had apparently not known .  there was a furor  which devoure shouted down .  he cried   i have a complete telephoto of the removal of the councilman from mimas  where he was sent to establish a secret war base against us at the very time that earth called this conference  allegedly for peace .     again the darkening and again the three dimensional image .  in full detail the conference watched the landing on mimas  saw the surface melted down  watched lucky disappear into the tunnel formed and councilman ben wessilewsky brought up and on board ship .  the last scenes were those taken within wess s temporary quarters under the surface of mimas .         a fully equipped base  as you see   said devoure .  then  turning to lucky  he said   may your actions throughout all this be considered to have the official approval of earth .    it was a leading question and there was no doubt as to the answer that was desired and expected  but here lucky hesitated  while the audience waited breathlessly and a frown gathered on devoure s face .   finally lucky said   i will tell the precise truth .  i did not receive direct permission to re enter saturn a second time  but i know that in everything i did i would have met with the full approval of the council of science .    and at that admission there was wild commotion among the reporters and a hubbub on the floor .  the conference delegates were rising in their seats  and cries of  vote .  vote .   could be made out .   to all appearances the conference had ended and earth had lost .       biter bit  agas doremo was on his feet  banging the traditional gavel for silence with complete ineffectuality .  con way plowed forward through a host of threatening gestures and catcalls and pulled the circuit breaker  thus sounding the old pirate warning .  a shrill rising falling rasp of sound squealed above the disorder and beat the delegates into surprised silence .   conway shut it off  and in the sudden quiet doremo said quickly   i have agreed to recognize chief councilman hector conway of the terrestrial federation that he might cross examine councilman starr .    there were shouts of  no  no   but doremo continued obdurately   i ask the conference to play fair in this respect .  the chief councilman assures me his cross examination will be brief .    amid rustling and a tide of whispering  conway approached lucky .   he smiled but spoke with an air of formality  saying   councilman starr  mr .  devoure did not question you as to your intentions in all this .  tell me  why did you enter the saturnian system .     in order to colonize mimas  chief .     did you feel you had the right to do so .               it was an empty world  chief .    conway turned so as to face a suddenly puzzled and quiet group of delegates .   would you repeat that  councilman starr .     i wished to establish human beings on mimas  an empty world that belongs to the terrestrial federation  chief .    devoure was on his feet  calling out furiously   mimas is part of the saturnian system .     exactly   said lucky   as saturn is part of earth s solar system .  but by your interpretation mimas is merely an empty world .  a while ago you admitted that sirian ships had never approached mimas before my ship landed on it .    conway smiled .  lucky had caught that error on devoure s part too .   conway said   councilman starr was not here  mr .  devoure  when you made your introductory speech .  let me quote a passage from it  word for word   an empty world is an empty world  regardless of the particular route it travels through space .  we colonized it first and it is ours .     the chief councilman turned toward the delegates and said with great deliberation   if the viewpoint of the terrestrial federation is correct  then mimas is earth s  because it circles a planet that circles our sun .  if the viewpoint of sinus is correct  then mimas is still earth s  because it was empty and we colonized it first .  by sirius s own line of reasoning  the fact that another satellite of saturn was colonized by sirius had nothing to do with the case .    in either event  by invading a world belonging to the terrestrial federation and removing therefrom        our colonist  sirius has committed an act of war and has shown its true hypocrisy  since it refused to allow others the rights it claimed for itself .    and now again there was a confused milling about   and it was doremo who spoke next .   gentlemen  i  have something to say .  the facts  as stated by council   men starr and conway  are irrefutable .  this demon  strates the complete anarchy into which the galaxy  would be thrown if the sirian view were to prevail .   every uninhabited rock would be a source of conten  tion  every asteroid a threat to peace .  the sirians   by their own action  have shown themselves  insincere    it was a complete and sudden change about .   had time been allowed  sirius might yet have rallied its forces  but doremo  an experienced and skilled parliamentarian  maneuvered the conference into a vote while the pro sirians were still completely demoralized and before they had a chance to consider whether they dared go against the plain facts as suddenly revealed .   three worlds voted on the side of sirius .  they were penthesileia  duvarn  and mullen  all small and all known to be under sirius s political influence .  the rest of the council  better than fifty votes  was on the side of earth .  sirius was ordered to release the earth men it had taken prisoner .  it was ordered to dismantle its base and leave the solar system within a month .   the orders could not be enforced except by war  of course  but earth was ready for war and sirius would have to face it now without the help of the outer       worlds .  there wasn t a man on vesta who expected her to fight under those conditions .   devoure  panting and his face contorted  saw  lucky once more .   it was a foul trick   he said .   it  was a device to force us into     you forced me   said lucky quietly   by the threat to bigman s life .  do you remember .  or would you like the details of that published .     we still have your monkey friend   began devoure  malignantly   and conference vote or not    chief councilman conway  also present  smiled .    if you re referring to bigman  mr .  devoure  you  don t have him .  he is in our hands  together with a  serviceman named yonge  who told me that council  man starr had assured him safe conduct in case of  need .  he apparently feels that in your present mood it  would be unsafe for himself to accompany you back to  titan .  may i suggest that you consider whether it  might be unsafe for you to go back to sirius .  if you  wish to apply for asylum     but devoure  speechless  turned his back and left .   doremo was all a grin as he bade farewell to con way and lucky .    you ll be glad to see earth again  i dare say  young man .    lucky nodded his agreement .     i m going home by liner within the hour  sir  with the poor old shooter being towed along behind  and frankly  there s nothing that could please me more just now .     good .  and congratulations on a magnificent piece of work .  when chief conway asked me to allow him time for cross examination at the beginning of the        session  i agreed  but thought he must be mad .  when you were done testifying and he signaled for recognition  i was sure he was mad .  but obviously all this was planned in advance .    conway said   lucky had sent me a message outlining what he hoped to do .  of course it wasn t till the last hour or two that we were sure it had worked out .     i think you had faith in the councilman   said doremo .   why  hi your first conversation with me  you asked if i would come out on your side if lucky s evidence failed of effect .  i didn t see what you could mean then  of course  but i understood when the time came .     i thank you for throwing your weight to our side .     i threw it on the side of what had obviously been demonstrated to be justice .   .   .   .  you re a subtle opponent  young man   he said to lucky .   lucky smiled .   i merely counted on sirius s lack of sincerity .  if they had really believed in what they claimed was their point of view  my councilman colleague would have been left on mimas and all we would have had for our pains was a small satellite of ice and a difficult war to fight .     quite .  well  no doubt there ll be second thoughts when the delegates get back home  and some will become angry with earth and with me and even with themselves  i suppose  for having let themselves be stampeded .  in cold blood  though  they ll realize that they have established a principle here  the indivisibility of stellar systems  and i think they ll also realize that the good of this principle will outweigh any hurt to their pride or their prejudices .  i really think this conference will be looked back on by historians as something important and as something that contributed a       great deal to the peace and welfare of the galaxy .  i m quite pleased .    and he shook hands with both  most vigorously .   lucky and bigman were together again  and though the ship was large and the passenger complement numerous  they kept to themselves .  mars was behind them  bigman spending the better part of an hour observing it with great satisfaction  and earth not very far ahead .   bigman finally managed to voice his embarrassment .   space  lucky   he said   i never saw what you were  doing  not once .  i thought well  i don t want to  say what i thought .  only  sands of mars  i wish you had warned me .     bigman  i couldn t .  that was the one thing i couldn t do .  don t you see .  i had to maneuver the sirians into hijacking wess off mimas without letting them see the implications .  i couldn t show them i wanted them to do it or they d have seen the trap at once .  i had to work it so that it would seem i was being forced into it bitterly against my will .  at the start  i assure you  i didn t know exactly how i was going to do it  but i did know one thing   if you knew about the plan  bigman  you d have given the show away .    bigman was outraged .    i d give it away .  why  you earthslug  a blaster couldn t have forced it out of me .     i know .  no torture could have forced it out of you  bigman .  you d just give it away  free .  you re a miserable actor and you know it .  once you got mad  it would come spilling out  one way or another .  that s why i half wanted you to stay on mimas  remember .         i knew i couldn t tell you the planned course of action and i knew you d misunderstand what i was doing and be miserable about it .  as it was  though  you turned out a godsend .     i did .  for beating up that cobber .     indirectly  yes .  it gave me the opportunity to make it look as though i were sincerely swapping wess s freedom for your life .  it took less acting to do that than to give wess away under any conditions i could have dreamed up in your absence .  in fact  as it was  i didn t have to act at all .  it was a good swap .     aw  lucky .     aw  yourself .  besides  you were so heartbroken about it that they never suspected a trick .  anyone watching you would have been convinced i was really betraying earth .     sands of mars  lucky   said bigman  stricken   i should have known you wouldn t do anything like that .  i was a nitwit .     i m glad you were   said lucky fervently  and he ruffled the little fellow s hair affectionately .   when conway and wess joined them at dinner  wess said   this isn t going to be the kind of homecoming that fellow devoure can expect .  ship s sub ether is full of the stuff they re printing on earth about us  about you especially  of course .    lucky frowned .   that s nothing to be thankful about .  it just makes our job harder in the future .  publicity .  stop and think what they would be saying if the sirians had been just one inch smarter and hadn t fallen for the bait or had pulled out of the conference at the last minute .         conway shuddered visibly .   i d rather not .  but whatever it would be  that s what devoure is getting .    lucky said   i guess he ll survive .  his uncle will pull him through .     anyway   said bigman   we re through with him .     are we .   said lucky somberly .   i wonder .    and they ate in silence for a few moments .   conway  in an obvious attempt to alter the sud  denly darkened atmosphere  said   of course  in a  sense the sirians could not afford to leave wess on  mimas  so we didn t really give them a fair chance .   after all  they were looking for the capsule in the  rings  and for all they know  wess  only thirty thou  sand miles outside the rings  might    bigman dropped his fork  and his eyes were like saucers .   blasting rockets .    what s the matter  bigman .   asked wess kindly .   did you accidentally think of something and sprain your brain .     shut up  leather head   said bigman .   listen  lucky  in all this mess we forgot about agent x s capsule .  it s still out there in the rings unless the sirians have found it already  and it they haven t  they still have a couple of weeks to do it in .    conway said at once   i ve thought of that  bigman .  but frankly  i consider it lost for good .  you can t find anything in the rings .     but  chief  hasn t lucky told you about the special  x ray mass detectors they have and    by then  though  all were staring at lucky .  he had a queer look on his face  as though he couldn t make up his mind whether to laugh or to swear .   great galaxy   he cried .   i forgot about it completely .           the capsule .   said bigman .   you forgot it .     yes .  i forgot i had it .  here it is .   and lucky brought something metallic and about an inch in diameter out of his pocket and put it on the table .   bigman s nimble fingers were on it first  turning it over and over  then the others snatched at it too  and took their turns .   bigman said   is that the capsule .  are you sure .     i m reasonably sure .  we ll open it  of course  and make certain .     but  when  how  where   they were all about  him  demanding .   he fended them off .   i m sorry .  i really am .  .  .  .  look  do you remember the few words we picked up from agent x just before his ship blew up .  remember the syllables  normal orb   which we decided meant  normal orbit  .  well  the sirians made the natural assumption that  normal  meant  usual   that the capsule would be put into the kind of orbit usual for ring particles  and looked in the rings for it .    however   normal  also means perpendicular .  the rings of saturn move directly west to east  so the capsule in a normal orbit to the rings would move directly north to south  or south to north .  this made sense  because then the capsule would not be lost in the rings .    now any orbit about saturn moving directly north and south must pass over the north and south poles  no matter how else that orbit varies .  we approached saturn s south pole and i watched the mass detector for anything that seemed to be in the proper type of orbit .  in polar space there were hardly any particles  so i felt i ought to be able to spot it if it were there .        i didn t like to say anything about it  though  because the chances were small  i thought  and i hated to rouse false hopes .    but something registered on the mass detectors  and i took the chance .  i matched velocities and then left the ship .  as you guessed later  bigman  i seized the opportunity to gimmick the agrav attachment at that time in preparation for the later surrender  but i also picked up the capsule .    when we landed in mimas i left it among the air conditioning coils in wess s quarters .  then  when we came back to get him and surrender him to devoure  i picked up the capsule and put it in my pocket .  i was routinely searched for weapons when i embarked on the ship  i recall  but the robot searcher did not interpret an inch sphere as a weapon .   .   .   .  there are serious drawbacks to using robots .  anyway  that s the whole story .     but why didn t you tell us .   howled bigman .  lucky looked confused .   i meant to .  honestly .  but after i first picked up the capsule and got back to the ship  we had already been spotted by the sirians  remember  and it was a question of getting away .  after that  in fact  if you ll think back  there was never one moment when something wasn t popping .  i just    somehow   never got around to remembering to tell anyone .     what a brain   said bigman contemptuously .   no wonder you don t like to go anywhere without me .    conway laughed and slapped the small martian on the back .   that s it  bigman  take care of the big lug and make sure he knows which way is up .           once   said wess   you get someone to tell you which way is up  of course .    and the ship swirled down through earth s atmosphere toward landing .
