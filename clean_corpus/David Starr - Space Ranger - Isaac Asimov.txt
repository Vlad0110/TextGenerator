fair fight   david said     i   ll see you in the dome if you wish .  meanwhile  step aside .       he walked forward unhurriedly  and griswold stepped back .     you stupid greenhorn .  we can   t have a fist fight with nosepieces on .          take your nosepiece off  then     said david     and i   ll take mine off .  stop me in fair fight  if you can .          fair fight .     came the approving shout from the crowd  and bigman yelled     put up or back down  griswold .       he leaped forward flipping griswold   s blaster from his hip .    david put his hand to his nosepiece .     ready .       bigman called     i   ll count three .       bigman began counting     one         and at the count of    three    david quietly removed his nosepiece and tossed it  with the attached cylinders  to one side .  he stood there  unprotected  holding his breath against the unbearable atmosphere of mars  .  .  .   david starr space ranger  isaac asimov writing as paul french   a del key

 the space ranger takes over          solution     about the author      preface   back in the     s  i wrote a series of six derring do novels about david    lucky    starr and his battles against malefactors within the solar system .  each of the six took place in a different region of the system  and in each case i made use of the astronomical facts   as they were then known .    now  more than a quarter century later  these novels are being published in new editions  but what a quarter century it has been .  more has been learned about the worlds of our solar system in this last quarter century than in all the thousands of years that went before .    david starr  space ranger was written in      and at that time  there was still a faint possibility that there were canals on mars  as had first been reported three quarters of a century earlier .  there was  therefore  a faint possibility that intelligent life existed there  or had existed at one time .    since then  though  we have sent probes past mars and around it to take photographs of its surface  and map the entire planet .  in       we even landed small laboratories on the martian surface to test its soil .    there are no canals .  there are instead  craters  giant volcanoes and enormous canyons .  the atmosphere is only   percent as dense as earth   s and is almost entirely carbon dioxide .  there is no clear sign of any life at all upon mars  and the possibility of advanced life upon it  now or ever  seems nil .    if i had written the book today  i would have had to adjust the plot to take all this into account .    i hope my gentle readers enjoy the book anyway  as an adventure story  but please don   t forget that the advance of science can outdate even the most conscientious science fiction writer and that my astronomical descriptions are no longer accurate in all respects .    isaac asimov    the plum from mars   david starr was staring right at the man  so he saw it happen .  he saw him die .    david had been waiting patiently for dr .  henree and  in the meanwhile  enjoying the atmosphere of international city   s newest restaurant .  this was to be his first real celebration now that he had obtained his degree and qualified for full membership in the council of science .    he did not mind waiting .  the cafe supreme still glistened from the freshly applied chromosilicone paints .  the subdued light that spread evenly over the entire dining room had no visible source .  at the wall end of david   s table was the small  self glowing cube which contained a tiny three dimensional replica of the band whose music filled in a soft background .  the leader   s baton was a half inch flash of motion and of course the table top itself was of the sanito type  the ultimate in force field modernity and  except for the deliberate flicker  quite invisible .    david   s calm brown eyes swept the other tables  half hidden in their alcoves  not out of boredom  but because people interested him more than any of the scientific gadgetry that the cafe supreme could gather .  tri television and force fields were wonders ten years before  yet were already accepted by all .  people  on the other hand  did not change  but even now  ten thousand years after the pyramids were built and five thousand years after the first atom bomb had exploded  they were still the insoluble mystery and the unfaded wonder .    there was a young girl in a pretty gown laughing gently with the man who sat opposite her  a middle aged man  in uncomfortable holiday clothing  punching the menu combination on the mechanical waiter while his wife and two children watched gravely  two businessmen talking animatedly over their dessert .    and it was as david   s glance flicked over the businessmen that it happened .  one of them  face congesting with blood  moved convulsively and attempted to rise .  the other  crying out  stretched out an arm in a vague gesture of help  but the first had already collapsed in his seat and was beginning to slide under the table .    david had risen to his feet at the first sign of disturbance and now his long legs ate the distance between the tables in three quick strides .  he was in the booth and  at a touch of his finger on the electronic contact near the tri television cube  a violet curtain with fluorescent designs swept across the open end of the alcove .  it would attract no attention .  many diners preferred to take advantage of that sort of privacy .    the sick man   s companion only now found his voice .  he said     manning is ill .  it   s some sort of seizure .  are you a doctor .       david   s voice was calm and level .  it carried assurance .  he said     now sit quietly and make no noise .  we will have the manager here and what can be done will be done .       he had his hands on the sick man  lifting him as though he were a rag doll  although the man was heavyset .  he pushed the table as far to one side as possible  his fingers separated uncannily by an inch of force field as he gripped it .  he laid the man on the seat  loosening the magno seams of his blouse  and began applying artificial respiration .    david had no illusion as to the possibility of recovery .  he knew the symptoms  the sudden flushing  the loss of voice and breath  the few minutes    fight for life  and then  the end .    the curtain brushed aside .  with admirable dispatch the manager had answered the emergency signal which david had tapped even before he had left his own table .  the manager was a short  plump man  dressed in black  tightly fitting clothing of conservative cut .  his face was disturbed .     did someone in this wing    he seemed to shrink in upon himself as his eyes took in the sight .    the surviving diner was speaking with hysterical rapidity .     we were having dinner when my friend had this seizure .  as for this other man  i don   t know who he is .       david abandoned his futile attempts at revival .  he brushed his thick brown hair off his forehead .  he said     you are the manager .          i am oliver gaspere  manager of the cafe supreme     said the plump man bewilderedly .     the emergency call from table    sounds and when i come  it is empty .  i am told a young man has just run into the booth of table     and i follow and find this .     he turned .     i shall call the house doctor .       david said     one moment .  there is no use in that this man is dead .          what .     cried the other diner .  he lunged forward  crying     manning .       david starr pulled him back  pinning him against the unseeable table top .     easy  man .  you cannot help him and this is no time for noise .          no  no     gaspere agreed rapidly .     we must not upset the other diners .  but see here  sir  a doctor must still examine this poor man to decide the cause of death .  i can allow no irregularities in my restaurant .          i am sorry  mr .  gaspere  but i forbid the examination of this man by anyone at the moment .          what are you talking about .  if this man dies of a heart attack          please .  let us have co operation and not useless discussion .  what is your name  sir .       the living diner said dully     eugene forester .          well  then  mr .  forester  i want to know exactly what you and your companion ate just now .          sir .     the little manager stared at david  with eyes swelling out of their sockets .     are you suggesting that something in the food caused this .          i   m not making suggestions .  i   m asking questions .          you have no right to ask questions .  who are you .  you are nobody .  i demand that a doctor examine this poor man .          mr .  gaspere  this is council of science business .       david bared the inner surface of his wrist  curling the flexible metallite sleeve above it .  for a moment it was merely exposed skin  and then an oval spot darkened and turned black .  within it little yellow grains of light danced and flickered in the familiar patterns of the big dipper and of orion .    the manager   s lips trembled .  the council of science was not an official government agency  but its members were nearly above the government   he said     i am sorry  sir .          no apologies are necessary .  now  mr .  forester  will you answer my first question .       forester muttered     we had the special dinner number three .          both of you .          that   s right .       david said     were there no substitutions on either part .     he had studied the menu at his own table .  the cafe supreme featured extraterrestrial delicacies  but the special dinner number three was one of the more ordinary meals native to earth  vegetable soup  veal chops  baked potato  peas  ice cream  and coffee .       yes  there was a substitution .     forester   s brows drew together .     manning ordered stewed marpluhis for dessert .          and you didn   t .          no .          and where are the marpluhis now .     david had eaten them himself .  they were pluhis grown in the vast martian greenhouses  juicy and pitless  with a faint cinnamon flavor superimposed on their fruit iness .    forester said     he ate them .  what do you suppose .          how soon before he collapsed .          about five minutes  i think .  we hadn   t even finished our coffee .     the man was turning sickly pale .     were they poisoned .       david did not answer .  he turned to the manager     what about the marplums .          there was nothing wrong with them .  nothing .     gaspere seized the curtains of the alcove and shook them in his passion  but did not forget to speak in the softest of whispers .     they were a fresh shipment from mars  government tested and approved .  we have served hundreds of portions in the last three nights alone .  nothing like this has happened till now .          just the same you had better give orders to eliminate marplums from the list of desserts until we can inspect them again .  and now  in case it wasn   t the marpluhis at all  please bring me a carton of some sort and we will transfer what is left of the dinner for study .          immediately .  immediately .          and of course speak to no one of this .       the manager returned in a few moments  smearing his brow with a feathery handkerchief .  he said     i cannot understand it .  i really cannot .       david stowed the used plastic dishes  with scraps of food still adhering to them  in the carton  added what was left of the toasted rolls  recapped the waxed cups in which the coffee had been served  and put them aside .  gaspere left off rubbing his hands frantically to reach a finger toward the contact at the edge of the table .    david   s hand moved quickly  and the manager was startled to find his wrist imprisoned .       but  sir  the crumbs .          i   ll take those too .     he used his penknife to collect each scrap  its sharp steel sliding easily along the nothingness of the force field .  david himself doubted the worth of force field table tops .  their sheer transparency was anything but conducive to relaxation .  the sight of dishes and cutlery resting on nothing could not help but leave diners tense  so that the field had to be put deliberately out of phase to induce continual interference sparkles that gave rise to an illusion of substance .    in restaurants they were popular since at the conclusion of a meal it was necessary only to extend the force field a fraction of an inch to destroy whatever adhering crumbs and drops remained .  it was only when david had concluded his collection that he allowed gaspere to perform the extension  removing the safety catch first by a touch of the finger and then permitting gaspere to use his special key .  a new  absolutely clean surface was instantly presented .       and now  just a moment .     david glanced at the metal face of his wrist watch  then flicked a corner of the curtain aside .    he said softly     dr .  henree .       the lanky middle aged man who was sitting on what had been david   s seat fifteen minutes earlier stiffened and looked about him with surprise .    david was smiling .     here i am .     he put a linger to his lips .    dr .  henree rose .  his clothes hung loosely upon him and his thinning gray hair was combed carefully over a bald spot .  he said     my dear david  are you here already .  i had thought you were late .  but is anything wrong .       david   s smile had been short lived .  he said     it   s another one .       dr .  henree stepped within the curtain  looked at the dead man  and muttered     dear me .          that   s one way of putting it     said david .       i think     said dr .  henree  removing his glasses and playing the mild force beam of his pencil cleaner over the lenses before replacing them     i think we had better close down the restaurant .       gaspere opened and closed his mouth soundlessly  like a fish .  finally he said in a strangled gasp     close the restaurant .  it has been open only a week .  it will be ruin .  absolute rum .          oh  but only for an hour or so .  we will have to remove the body and inspect your kitchens .  surely you want us to remove the stigma of food poisoning if we can  and surely it would be even less convenient for you to have us make arrangements for this in the presence of the diners .          very well then .  i will see that the restaurant is made available to you  but i must have an hour   s grace to allow present diners to finish their meals .  i hope there will be no publicity .          none  i assure you .     dr .  henree   s lined face was a mask of worry .     david  will you call council hall and ask to speak to conway .  we have a procedure for such cases .  he will know what to do .          must i stay .     put in forester suddenly .     i feel sick .          who is this  david .     asked dr .  henree .       the dead man   s dinner companion .  his name is forester .          oh .  then i am afraid  mr .  forester  you will have to be sick here .       the restaurant was cold and repulsive in its emptiness .  silent operatives had come and gone .  efficiently they had gone through the kitchens atom by atom .  now only dr .  henree and david starr remained .  they sat in an empty alcove .  there were no lights  and the tri televisions on each table were simply dead cubes of glass .    dr .  henree shook his head .     we will learn nothing .  i am sure of that from experience .  i am sorry  david .  this is not the proper celebration we had planned .          plenty of time for celebration later .  you mentioned in your letters these cases of food poisoning  so i was prepared .  still  i wasn   t aware of this intense secrecy which seems necessary .  i might have been more discreet if i had known .          no .  it is no use .  we cannot hide this trouble forever .  little by little there are tiny leaks .  people see other people die while eating and then hear of still other cases .  always while they   re eating .  it is bad and will grow worse .  well  we will talk more of this tomorrow when you talk to conway himself .           wait .     david looked deep into the older man   s eyes .     there is something that worries you more than the death of a man or the death of a thousand .  something i don   t know .  what is it .       dr .  henree sighed .     i   m afraid  david  that earth is in great danger .  most of the council does not believe it and conway is only half convinced  but i am certain that this supposed food poisoning is a clever and brutal attempt at seizing control of earth   s economic life and government .  and so far  david  there is no hint as to who is behind the threat and exactly how it is being accomplished .  the council of science is entirely helpless .        the breadbasket in the sky   hector conway  chief counselor of science  stood at his window in the topmost suite of science tower  the slender structure which dominated the northern suburbs of international city .  the city was beginning to sparkle in the early twilight .  soon it would turn to streaks of white along the elevated pedestrian promenades .  the buildings would light up in jeweled patterns as the windows came to life .  almost centered in his window were the distant domes of the halls of congress  with the executive mansion snuggled between .    he was alone in his office  and the automatic lock was adjusted to dr .  henree   s fingerprints only .  he could feel some of his depression lifting .  david starr was on his way  suddenly and magically grown up  ready to receive his first assignment as a member of the council .  he felt almost as though his son were about to visit him .  in a way  that was how it was .  david starr was his son  his and augustus henree   s .    there had been three of them at first  himself and gus henree and lawrence starr .  how he remembered lawrence starr .  they had all three gone through school together  qualified for the council together  done their first investigations together  and then lawrence starr had been promoted .  it was to be expected  he was by far the most brilliant of the three .    so he had received a semi permanent station on venus  and that was the first time the three had not tackled a proposition together .  he had gone with his wife and child .  the wife was barbara .  lovely barbara starr .  neither henree nor himself had ever married  and for neither were there any girls to compete with barbara in memory .  when david was born  it was uncle gus and uncle hector  until he sometimes got confused and called his father uncle lawrence .    and then on the trip to venus there was the pirate attack .  it had been a total massacre .  pirate ships took virtually no prisoners in space  and more than a hundred human beings were dead before two hours had passed .  among them were lawrence and barbara .    conway could remember the day  the exact minute  when the news had reached science tower .  patrol ships had shot out into space  tracing the pirates  they attacked the asteroid lairs in a fury that was completely unprecedented .  whether they caught the particular villains who had gutted the venus bound ship none could ever say  but the pirate power had been broken from that year on .    and the patrol ships found something else  a tiny lifeboat winding a precarious orbit between venus and earth  radiating its coldly automatic radio calls for help .  only a child was inside .  a frightened  lonely four year old  who did not speak for hours except to say stoutly     mother said i wasn   t to cry .       it was david starr .  his story  seen through childish eyes  was garbled  but interpretation was only too easy .  conway could still see what those last minutes within the gutted ship must have been like  lawrence starr  dying in the control room  with the outlaws forcing their way in  barbara  a blast gun in her hand  desperately thrusting david into the lifeboat  trying to set the controls as best she could  rocketing it into space .  and then .    she had a gun in her hand .  as long as she could  she must have used it against the enemy  and when that could be no longer  against herself .    conway ached to think of it .  ached  and once again wished they had allowed him to accompany the patrol ships so that with his own hands he might have helped to turn the asteroid caves into flaming oceans of atomic destruction .  but members of the council of science  they said  were too valuable to risk in police actions  so he stayed home and read the news bulletins as they rolled out on the ticker tape of his telenews projector .    between them he and augustus henree had adopted david starr  bent their lives to erase those last horrible memories of space .  they were both mother and father to him  they personally supervised his tutoring  they trained him with one thought in mind  to make him what lawrence starr had once been .    he had exceeded their expectations .  in height he was lawrence  reaching six feet  rangy and hard  with the cool nerves and quick muscles of an athlete and the sharp  clear brain of a first class scientist .  and beyond that there was something about his brown hair with the suggestion of a wave in it  in his level  wide set brown eyes  in the trace of a cleft in his chin which vanished when he smiled  that was reminiscent of barbara .    he had raced through his academy days leaving a trail of sparks and the dead ash of previous records both on the playing fields and in the classroohis .    conway had been perturbed .     it   s not natural  gus .  he   s outdoing his father .       and henree  who didn   t believe in unnecessary speech  had puffed at his pipe and smiled proudly .       i hate to say this     conway had continued     because you   ll laugh at me  but there   s something not quite normal in it .  remember that the child was stranded in space for two days with just a thin lifeboat hull between himself and solar radiation .  he was only seventy million miles from the sun during a period of sunspot maximum .          all you   re saying     said henree     is that david should have been burnt to death .          well  i don   t know     mumbled conway .     the effect of radiation on living tissue  on human living tissue  has its mysteries .          well  naturally .  it   s not a field in which experimentation is very feasible .       david had finished college with the highest average on record .  he had managed to do original work in biophysics on the graduate level .  he was the youngest man ever to be accorded full membership in the council of science .    to conway there had been a loss in all this .  four years earlier he had been elected chief counselor .  it was an honor he would have given his life for  yet   he knew that had lawrence starr lived  the election would have gone in a worthier direction .    and he had lost all but occasional contact with young david starr  for to be chief counselor meant that one had no life other than the beetling problehis of all the galaxy .  even at graduation exercises he had seen david only from a distance .  in the last four years he might have spoken to him four times .    so his heart beat high when he heard the door open .  he turned  walking rapidly to meet them as they walked in .       gus old man .     he held out his hand  wrung the other   s .     and david boy .       an hour passed .  it was true night before they could stop speaking of themselves and turn to the universe .    it was david who broke out .  he said     i saw my first poisoning today  uncle hector .  i knew enough to prevent panic .  i wish i knew enough to prevent poisoning .       conway said soberly     no one knows that much .  i suppose  gus  it was a martian product again .          no way of telling  hector .  but a marplum was involved .          suppose     said david starr     you let me know anything i   m allowed to know about this .          it   s remarkably simple     said conway .     horribly simple .  in the last four months something like two hundred people have died immediately after eating some mars grown product .  it   s no known poison  the symptoms are those of no known disease .  there is a rapid and complete paralysis of the nerves controlling the diaphragm and the muscles of the chest .  it amounts to a paralysis of the lungs  which is fatal in five minutes .       it goes deeper than that too .  in the few cases where we   ve caught the victims in time  we   ve tried artificial respiration  as you did  and even iron lungs .  they still died in five minutes .  the heart is affected as well .  autopsies show us nothing except nerve degeneration that must have been unbelievably rapid .          what about the food that poisoned them .     asked david .       dead end     said conway .     there is always time for the poisoned item or portion to be completely consumed .  other specimens of the same sort at the table or in the kitchen are harmless .  we   ve fed them to animals and even to human volunteers .  the stomach contents of the dead men have yielded uncertain results .          then how do you know it   s food poisoning at all .          because the coincidence of death after eating a martian product time after time  without known exception  is more than coincidence .       david said thoughtfully     and it isn   t contagious  obviously .          no .  thank the stars for that .  even so  it   s bad enough .  so far we   ve kept this as quiet as we can  with full co operation from the planetary police .  two hundred deaths in four months over the population of all earth is still a manageable phenomenon  but the rate may increase .  and if the people of earth become aware that any mouthful of martian food might be their last  the consequences could be horrible .  even though we were to point out that the death rate is only fifty per month out of a population of five billions  each person would think himself certain to be one of those fifty .          yes     said david     and that would mean that the market for martian food imports would fall through the floor .  it would be too bad for the martian farming syndicates .          that .     conway shrugged his shoulders  thrusting aside the problem of the farming syndicates as something of no moment .     do you see nothing else .          i see that earth   s own agriculture can   t support five billion people .          that   s it exactly .  we can   t do without food from the colonial planets .  there would be starvation on earth in sk weeks .  yet if the people are afraid of martian food  there will be no preventing that  and i don   t know how long it can be staved off .  each new death is a new crisis .  will this be the one that the tele news will get hold of .  will the truth come out now .  and there   s gus   s theory on top of everything .       dr .  henree sat back  tamping tobacco gently into his pipe .     i feel sure  david  that this epidemic of food poisoning is not a natural phenomenon .  it is too widespread .  it strikes one day in bengal  the next day in new york  the day after in zanzibar .  there must be intelligence behind it .          i tell you       began conway .       let him go on  uncle hector     urged david .       if any group were seeking to control earth  what better move could they make than to strike at our weakest point  our food supply .  earth is the most populous planet in all the galaxy .  it should be  since it is mankind   s original home .  but that very fact makes us the weakest world  in a sense  since we   re not self supporting .  our breadbasket is in the sky  on mars  on ganymede  on europa .  if you cut the imports in any manner  either by pirate action or by the much more subtle system being used now  we are quickly helpless .  that is all .          but     said david     if that were the case  wouldn   t the responsible group communicate with the government  if only to give an ultimatum .          it would seem so  but they may be waiting their time  waiting for ripeness .  or they may be dealing with the farmers of mars directly .  the colonists have minds of their own  mistrust earth  and  in fact  if they see their livelihood threatened  may throw in with these criminals altogether .  maybe even     he puffed strenuously     they themselves are but i   ll make no accusations .          and my part     said david .     what is it yqu would have me do .          let me tell him     said conway .     david  we want you to go to central laboratories on the moon .  you will be part of the research team investigating the problem .  at this moment they are receiving samples of every shipment of food leaving mars .  we are bound to come across some poisoned item .  half of all items are fed to rats  the remaining portions of any fatal pieces are analyzed by all the means at our disposal .          i see .  and if uncle gus is right  i suppose you have another team on mars .          very experienced men .  but meanwhile  will you be ready to leave for the moon tomorrow night .          certainly .  but if that   s the case  may i leave now to get ready .          of course .          and would there be any objection to my using my own ship .        not at all .       the two scientists  alone in the room  stared down at the fairy tale lights of the city for a long time before either spoke .    finally conway said     how like lawrence he is .  but he   s still so young .  it will be dangerous .       henree said     you really think it will work .          certainly .     conway laughed .     you heard his last question about mars .  he has no intention of going to the moon .  i know him that well .  and it   s the best way to protect him .  the official records will say he is going to the moon  the men at central laboratories are instructed to report his arrival .  when he does reach mars  there will be no reason for your conspirators  if they exist  to take him for a member of the council  and of course he will maintain an incognito because he will be busy fooling us  he thinks .       conway added     he   s brilliant .  he may be able to do something the rest of us could not do .  fortunately  he   s still young and can be maneuvered .  in a few years that will be impossible .  he would see through us .       conway   s cohimunicator tinkled gently .  he flipped it open .     what is it .          personal communication for you  sir .          for me .  transmit it .     he looked wildly at henree .     it can   t be from the conspirators you babble about .          open it and see     suggested henree .    conway sliced the envelope open .  for a moment he stared .  then he laughed a bit wildly  tossed the open sheet to henree  and slumped back in his chair .    henree picked it up .  there were only two scrawled lines which read     have it your way .  mars it is .     it was signed     david .       henree roared with laughter .     you maneuvered him all right .       and conway could not help but join .     men for the farms of mars   to a native earthman  earth meant earth .  it was just the third planet from that sun which was known to the inhabitants of the galaxy as sol .  in official geography  however  earth was more  it included all the bodies of the solar system .  mars was as much earth as earth itself was  and the men and women who lived on mars were as much earthmen as though they lived on the home planet .  legally  at any rate .  they voted for representatives in the all earth congress and for planetary president .    but that was as far as it went .  the earthmen of mars considered themselves quite a separate and better breed  and the newcomer had a long way to go to be accepted by the martian farmboy as anything more than a casual tourist of not much account .    david starr found that out almost at once when he entered the farm employment building .  a little man was at his heels as he walked in .  a really little man .  he was about five feet two and his nose would have rubbed against david   s breastbone if they had stood face to face .  he had pale red hair brushed straight back  a wide mouth  and the typical open collar  double breasted overall and hip high  brightly colored boots of the martian farmboy .    as david headed for the window over which glowed the legend     farm employment     footsteps rattled about him  and a tenor voice cried out     hold on .  decelerate your footsteps  fella .       the little man was facing him .    david said     is there anything i can do for you .       the little man carefully inspected him  section by section  then put out one arm and leaned negligently against the earthman   s waistline .     when did you descend the old gangplank .          what gangplank .          pretty voluminous for an earthie at that .  did you get cramped out there .          i   m from earth  yes .       the little man brought his hands down one after the other so that they slapped sharply against his boots .  it was the f armboy gesture of self assertion .       in that case     he said     suppose you assume a waiting position and let a native attend to his business .       david said     as you please .          and if you have any objection to taking your turn  you can take it up with me when we   re through or any time thereafter at your convenience .  my name is bigman .  i   m john bigman jones  but you can ask for me anywhere in town by the name of bigman .     he paused  then added     that  earthie  is my cognomen .  any complaints about it .       and david said gravely     none at all .       bigman said     right .     and left for the desk  while david  breaking into a smile as soon as the other   s back was safely turned  sat down to wait .    he had been on mars for less than twelve hours  just long enough to register his ship under an assumed name in the large sub surface garages outside the city  take a room for the night at one of the hotels  and spend a few hours of the morning walking through the domed city .    there were only three of these cities on mars  and their fewness was to be expected in view of the expense required to maintain the tremendous domes and to supply the torrents of power necessary to provide the temperature and gravity of earth .  this  wingrad city  named after robert clark wingrad  the first man to reach mars  was the largest .    it was not very different from a city on earth  it was almost a piece of earth cut out and put on a different planet  it was as though the men on mars  thirty five million miles away at the very nearest  had to hide that fact from themselves somehow .  in the center of town  where the ellipsoidal dome was a quarter of a mile high  there were even twenty story buildings .    there was only one thing missing .  there was no sun and no blue sky .  the dome itself was translucent  and when the sun shone on it  light was uniformly spread over all its ten square miles .  the light intensity at any region of the dome was small so that the    sky    to a man in the city was a pale  pale yellow .  the total effect  however  was about equivalent to that of a cloudy day on earth .    when night came  the dome faded and disappeared into starless black .  but then the street lights went on  and wingrad city seemed more than ever like earth .  within the buildings artificial light was used day and night david starr looked up at the sudden sound of loud voices .    bigman was still at the desk  shouting     i tell you this is a case of blacklist .  you   ve got me blacklisted  by jupiter .       the man behind the desk seemed flustered .  he had fluffy sideburns with which his fingers kept playing .  he said     we have no blacklists  mr .  jones .          my name is bigman .  what   s the matter .  are you afraid to exhibit friendship .  you called me bigman the first few days .          we have no blacklists  bigman .  farmhands just aren   t in demand .          what are you talking about .  tim jenkins got placed day before yesterday in two minutes .          jenkins had experience as a rocket man .          i can handle a rocket as well as tim any day .          well  you   re down here as a seeder .          and i   m a good one .  don   t they need seeders .          look  bigman     said the man behind the desk     i have your name on the roster .  that   s all i can do .  i   ll let you know if anything turns up .     he turned a concentrated attention on the record book before him  following up entries with elaborate unconcern .    bigman turned  then shouted over his shoulder     all right  but i   m sitting right here  and the next labor requisition you get  i   m being sent out .  if they don   t want me  i want to hear them say so to me .  to me  do you understand .  to me  j .  bigman j .   personally .       the man behind the desk said nothing .  bigman took a seat  muttering .  david starr rose and approached the desk .  no other farmboy had entered to dispute his place in line .    he said     i   d like a job .       the man looked up  pulled an employment blank and hand printer toward himself .     what kind .          any kind of farm work available .       the man put down his hand printer .     are you mars bred .          no  sir .  i   m from earth .          sorry .  nothing open .       david said     well  look here .  i can work  and i need work .  great galaxy  is there a law against earthmen working .          no  but there isn   t much you can do on a farm without experience .          i still need a job .          there are lots of jobs in town .  next window over .          i can   t use a job in town .       the man behind the desk looked speculatively at david  and david had no trouble in reading the glance .  men traveled to mars for many reasons  and one of them was that earth had become too uncomfortable .  when a search call went out for a fugitive  the cities of mars were combed thoroughly  after all  they were part of earth   but no one ever found a hunted man on the mars farms .  to the farming syndicates  the best farmboy was one who had no other place he dared go .  they protected such and took care not to lose them to the earth authorities they half resented and more than half despised .       name .     said the clerk  eyes back on the form .       dick williams     said david  giving the name under which he had garaged his ship .    the clerk did not ask for identification .     where can i get in touch with you .          landis hotel  room     .          any low gravity experience at all .       the questioning went on and on  most of the blanks had to be left empty .  the clerk sighed  put the blank into the slot which automatically microfilmed it  filed it  and thus added it to the permanent records of the office .    he said     i   ll let you know .     but he didn   t sound hopeful .    david turned away .  he had not expected much to come of this  but at least he had established himself as a somewhat legitimate seeker after a farming job .   the next step he whirled .  three men were entering the employment office and the little fellow  bigman  had hopped angrily out of his seat .  he was facing them now  arms carried loosely away from his hips although he had no weapons that david could see .    the three who entered stopped  and then one of the two who brought up the rear laughed and said     looks as if we have bigman  the mighty midget  here .  maybe he   s looking for a job  boss .     the speaker was broad across the shoulders and his nose was flattened against his face .  he had a chewed to death  unlit cigar of green martian tobacco in his mouth and he needed a shave badly .       quiet  griswold     said the man in front .  he was pudgy  not too tall  and the soft skin on his cheeks and on the back of his neck was sleek and smooth .    his overall was typical mars  of course  but it was of much finer material than that of any of the other farmboys in the room .  his hip high boots were spiraled in pink and rose .    in all his later travels on mars  david starr never saw two pairs of boots of identical design  never saw boots that were other than garish .  it was the mark of individuality among the farmboys .    bigman was approaching the three  his little chest swelling and his face twisted with anger .  he said     i want my papers out of you  hermes .  i   ve got a right to them .       the pudgy man in front was hennes .  he said quietly     you   re not worth any papers  bigman .          i can   t get another job without decent papers .  i worked for you for two years and did my part .          you did a blasted lot more than your part .  out of my way .     he tramped past bigman  approached the desk  and said     i need an experienced seeder   a good one .  i want one tall enough to see in order to replace a little boy i had to get rid of .       bigman felt that .     by space     he yelled     you   re right i did more than my part .  i was on duty when i wasn   t supposed to be  you mean .  i was on duty long enough to see you go driving wheels over sand into the desert at midnight .  only the next morning you knew nothing about it  except that i got heaved for referring to it  and without reference papers       hennes looked over his shoulder  annoyed .     gris wold     he said     throw that fool out .       bigman did not retreat  although griswold would have made two of him .  he said in his high voice     all right .  one at a time .       but david starr moved now  his smooth stride deceptively slow .    griswold said     you   re in my way  friend .  i   ve got some trash to throw out .       from behind david  bigman cried out     it   s all right  earthie .  let him at me .       david ignored that .  he said to griswold     this seems to be a public place  friend .  we   ve all got the right to be here .       griswold said     let   s not argue  friend .     he put a hand roughly on david   s shoulder as though to thrust him to one side .    but david   s left hand shot up to catch the wrist of griswold   s outstretched arm  and his right hand straight armed the other   s shoulder .  griswold went whirling backward  slahiming hard against the plastic partition that divided the room in two .       i   d rather argue  friend     said david .    the clerk had come to his feet with a yell .  other desk workers swarmed to the openings in the partition  but made no move to interfere .  bigman was laughing and clapping david on the back .     pretty good for a fellow from earth .       for the moment hennes seemed frozen .  the remaining farmboy  short and bearded  with the pasty face of one who had spent too much time under the small sun of mars and not enough under the artificial sun lamps of the city  had allowed his mouth to drop ridiculously open .    griswold recovered his breath slowly .  he shook bis head .  his cigar  which had dropped to the ground  he kicked aside .  then he looked up  his eyes popping with fury .  he pushed himself away from the wall and there was a momentary glint of steel that was swallowed up in his hand .    but david stepped to one side and brought up his arm .  the small  crooked cylinder that ordinarily rested snugly between his upper arm and body shot down the length of his sleeve and into his gripping palm .    hennes cried out     watch your step  griswold .  he   s got a blaster .          drop your blade     said david .    griswold swore wildly  but metal clattered against the floor .  bigman darted forward and picked up the blade  chortling at the stubbled one   s discomfiture .    david held out his hand for it and spared it a quick glance .     nice  innocent baby for a farmboy to have     he said .     what   s the law in mars against carrying a force blade .       he knew it as the most vicious weapon in the galaxy .  outwardly  it was merely a short shaft of stainless steel that was a little thicker than the haft of a knife but which could still be held nicely in the palm .  within it was a tiny motor that could generate an invisible nine inch long  razor thin force field that could cut through anything composed of ordinary matter .  armor was of no use against it  and since it could slice through bone as easily as through flesh  its stab was almost invariably fatal .    hennes stepped between them .  he said     where   s your license for a blaster  earthie .  put it away and we   ll call it quits .  get back there  griswold .          hold on     said david  as hennes turned away .     you   re looking for a man  aren   t you .       hennes turned back  his eyebrows lifting in amusement .     i   m looking for a man .  yes .          all right .  i   m looking for a job .          i   m looking for an experienced seeder .  do you qualify .          well  no .          have you ever harvested .  can you handle a sand car .  in short  you   re just  if i may judge from your costume      and he stepped back as though to get a better over all view      an earthman who happens to be handy with a blaster .  i can   t use you .          not even     david   s voice fell to a whisper     if i tell you that i   m interested in food poisoning .       hennes   s face didn   t change  his eyes didn   t flicker  he said     i don   t see your point .          think harder  then .     he was smiling thinly  and there was little humor in that smile .    hennes said     working on a mars farm isn   t easy .          i   m not the easy type     said david .    the other looked over his rangy frame again .     well  maybe you   re not .  all right  we   ll lodge and feed you  start you with three changes of clothing and a pair of boots .  fifty dollars the first year  payable at the end of the year .  if you don   t work out the year  the fifty is forfeited .          fair enough .  what type of work .          the only kind you can do .  general helper at the chowhouse .  if you learn  you   ll move up  if not  that   s where you spend the year .          done .  what about bigman .       bigman  who had been staring from one to the other  squawked     no  sir .  i don   t work for that sand bug  and i wouldn   t advise you to  either .       david said over his shoulder .     how about a short stretch in return for papers of reference .          well     said bigman     a month  maybe .       hermes said     is he a friend of yours .       david nodded .     i won   t come without him .          i   ll take him too  then .  one month  and he   s to keep his mouth shut .  no pay  except his papers .  let   s get out of here .  my sand car   s outside .       the five left  david and bigman bringing up the rear .    bigman said     i owe you a favor  friend .  you may collect at will .       the sand car was open just then  but david could see the slots into which panels could slide in order that it might be enclosed against the drifting dust storhis of mars .  the wheels were broad to minimize the tendency to sink when crossing the soft drifts .  the area of glass was reduced to a minimum and  where it existed  merged into the surrounding metal as though they had been welded together .    the streets were moderately crowded  but no one paid any attention to the very common sight of sand cars and f armboys .    hennes said     we   ll sit in front .  you and your friend may sit in back  earthman .       he had moved into the driver   s seat as he spoke .  the controls were in the middle of the front partition  with the windshield centered above .  griswold took the seat at hennes   s right .    bigman moved into the rear and david followed him .  someone was behind him .  david half turned as bigman called suddenly     watch out .       it was the second of hennes   s henchmen who was now crouching in the car door  his pasty bearded face snarling and taut .  david moved quickly  but it was far too late .    his last sight was that of the gleaming muzzle of a weapon in the henchman   s hand  and then he was conscious of a soft purring noise .  there was scarcely any sensation to it  and a distant  distant voice said     all right  zukis .  get in back and keep watch     in words that seemed to come from the end of a long tunnel .  there was a last momentary feeling of motion forward  and then there was complete nothingness .    david starr slumped forward in his seat  and the last signs of life about him vanished .       alien life   ragged patches of light floated past david starr .  slowly he became aware of a tremendous tingling all about him and a separate pressure on his back .  the back pressure resolved itself into the fact that he was lying face up on a hard mattress .  the tingling he knew to be the aftermath of a stun gun  a weapon whose radiation worked upon the nerve centers at the base of the brain .    before light became coherent  before he was thoroughly aware of his surroundings  he felt his shoulders being shaken and the distant sting of sharp slaps on his cheeks .  the light washed into his open eyes and he brought his tingling arm up to ward off the next slap .    it was bigman leaning over him  his little rabbity face with its round snub nose nearly touching his .  he said     by ganymede  i thought they finished you for good .           david brought himself up to an aching elbow .  he said     it almost feels as if they did .  where are we .          in the farm lockup .  it   s no use trying to get out  either .  the door   s locked  the windows are barred .     he looked depressed .    david felt under his arms .  they had removed his blasters .  naturally .  so much was to be expected .  he said     did they stun you  too  bigman .       bigman shook his head .     zukis horizontaled me with the gun butt .     he fingered a region of his skull with gingerly distaste .  then he swelled     but i nearly broke his arm first .       there was the sound of footsteps outside the door .  david sat up and waited .  hermes entered  and with him there came an older man  with a long  tired looking face set off by faded blue eyes under bushy gray eyebrows that seemed fixed in a permanent furrow .  he was dressed in city costume  which was much like that of earth .  he even lacked the martian hip boots .    hennes spoke to bigman first .     get out to the chowhouse and the first time you sneeze without permission you   ll be broken in two .       bigman scowled  waved to david with an    i   ll be seeing you  earthman     and swaggered out with a clattering of boots .    hennes watched him leave and locked the door behind him .  he turned to the man with the gray eyebrows .     this is the one  mr .  makian .  he calls himself williams .          you took a chance stunning him  hennes .  if you had killed him  a valuable lead might have gone with the canal dust .       hennes shrugged .     he was armed .  we could take no chances .  in any case  he   s here  sir .       they were discussing him  david thought  as though he weren   t there or were just another inanimate part of the bed .    makian turned to him  his eyes hard .     you  there    i own this ranch .  over a hundred miles in any direction is all makian .  i say who is to be free and who is to be in prison  who works and who starves  even who lives and who dies .  do you understand me .          yes     said david .       then answer frankly  and you   ll have nothing to fear .  try to hide anything and we   ll have it out of you one way or another .  we may have to kill you .  do you still understand me .          perfectly .          is your name williams .          it   s the only name i will give on mars .          fair enough .  what do you know about food poisoning .       david swung his feet off the bed .  he said     look  my sister died over an afternoon snack of bread and jam .  she was twelve years old  and lay there dead with the jam still on her face .  we called the doctor .  he said it was food poisoning and told us not to eat anything in the house till he came back with certain analytical equipment .  he never came back .       somebody else came instead .  someone with a great deal of authority .  he had plain clothes men to escort him .  he had us describe all that had happened .  he said to us     it was a heart attack .     we told him that was ridiculous because my sister had nothing wrong with her heart  but he wouldn   t listen to us .  he told us that if we spread ridiculous stories about food poisoning  we would get in trouble .  then he took the jar of jam with him .  he was even angry with us for having wiped the jam from my sister   s lips .       i tried to get in touch with our doctor  but his nurse would never admit he was in .  i broke into his office and found him there  but all he would say was that he had made a mistaken diagnosis .  he seemed afraid to talk about it .  i went to the police  but they wouldn   t listen .       the jar of jam the men took away was the only thing in the house my sister ate that day that the rest of the  family hadn   t eaten as well .  that jar was freshly opened and it was imported from mars .  we   re old fashioned people and like the old food .  that was the only mars product in the house .  i tried to find out through the newspapers whether there had been any other cases of food poisoning .  it all seemed so suspicious to me .  i even went to international city .  i quit my job and decided that in one way or another i would find out what had killed my sister and try to nail anyone that might be responsible .  everywhere i hit a blank  and then there came policemen with a warrant for my arrest .       i was almost expecting that  and got out a step ahead of them .  i came to mars for two reasons .  first  it was the only way to keep out of jail  though it doesn   t seem so now  does it .    and second  because of one thing i did find out .  there were two or three suspicious deaths in the restaurants of international city and in each case they were at restaurants which featured martian cuisines .  so i decided the answer was on mars .       makian was running a thick thumb down the long line of his chin .  he said     the yarn hangs together  hennes .  what do you think .          i say  get names and dates  and check the story .  we don   t know who this man is .       makian sounded almost querulous .     you know we can   t do that  hennes .  i don   t want to do anything that would spread news of all this mess .  it would break the entire syndicate .     he turned to david .     i   m going to send benson to speak to you  he   s our agronomist .     then  again to hennes     you stay here till benson comes .       it was about half an hour before benson came .  during that interval david leaned carelessly back on the cot paying no attention to hennes  who  for his part  played the same sort of game .    then the door opened and a voice said     i   m benson .     it was a gentle  hesitant voice and it belonged to a round faced individual of about forty  with thinning sandy hair and rimless eyeglasses .  his small mouth spread itself in a smile .    benson went on     and you  i suppose  are williams .          that   s right     said david starr .    benson looked carefully at the young earthman  as though he were analyzing him by eye .  he said     are you disposed to violence .          i   m unarmed     david pointed out     and surrounded by a farm full of men quite ready to kill me if i step out of line .          quite right .  would you leave us  hennes .       hennes jumped to his feet in protest .     that   s not safe  benson .          please  hennes .     benson   s mild eyes peered over his spectacles .    hennes growled  clapped one hand against a boot in disgruntlement  and walked out the door .  benson locked it behind him .        you see  williams     he said apologetically     in the last half year i   ve grown to be an important man here .  even hennes listens to me .  i   m still not used to it .     he smiled again .     tell me .  mr .  makian says you actually witnessed a death by this strange food poisoning .          my sister   s .          oh .     benson flushed .     i   m dreadfully sorry .  i know it must be a painful subject to you  but might i have the details .  it   s very important .       david repeated the story he had earlier told makian .    benson said     and it happened as quickly as that .          it could only have been five to ten minutes after she had eaten .          terrible .  terrible .  you have no idea how distressing all this is .     he was rubbing his hands together nervously .     in any case  williams  i   d like to fill in the story for you .  you   ve guessed most of it  anyway  and  somehow  i feel responsible to you for what happened to your sister .  all of us here on mars are responsible until such time as we clear up the mystery .  you see  this has been going on for months now  these poisonings .  not many  but enough to have us at our wit   s end .       we   ve traced back the poisoned foodstuffs and we are certain they come from no one farm .  but one thing did turn up  all the poisoned food is shipped out of wingrad city  the other two cities on mars are clean so far .  that would seem to indicate that the source of infection is within the city  and hennes has been working on the assumption .  he has taken to riding to the city  nights  on detective expeditions of his own  but he has turned up nothing .          i see .  that explains bigman   s remarks     said david .       eh .     benson   s face twisted in puzzlement  then cleared .     oh  you mean the little fellow who goes about shouting all the time .  yes  he caught hennes leaving once  and hennes had him thrown out .  hennes is a most impulsive man .  in any case  i think hennes is wrong .  naturally all the poison would travel through wingrad city .  it is the shipping point for the entire hemisphere .       now mr .  makian himself believes the infection to be deliberately spread through human agency .  at least he and several others of the syndicate have received messages offering to buy their farms for a ridiculously small sum .  there is no mention of the poisoning and no evidence whatsoever of any connection between the offers to buy and this horrible business .       david was listening intently .  he said     and who makes these offers to buy .          why  how should we know .  i have seen the letters and they only say that if the offers are accepted  the syndicate is to broadcast a coded message over a particular sub etheric waveband .  the price offer  the letters say  will decrease by    per cent each month .          and the letters can   t be traced .          i   m afraid not .  they pass through the ordinary mails with an    asteroid    postmark .  how can one search the asteroids .          have the planetary police been informed .       benson laughed softly .     do you think mr .  makian  or any of the syndicate for that matter  would call in the police for a thing like this .  this is a declaration of personal war to them .  you don   t properly appreciate the martian mentality  mr .  williams .  you don   t run to the law when you   re in trouble unless you   re willing to confess it   s something you can   t handle yourself .  no farmboy is ever willing to do that .  i   ve suggested that the information be submitted to the council of science  but mr .  makian wouldn   t even do that .  he said the council was working on the poisoning without success  and if that were the kind of darned fools they were  he would do without them .  and that   s where i come in .          you   re working on the poisoning too .        that   s right .  i   m the agronomist here .        that   s the title mr .  makian gave you .        uh huh .  strictly speaking  an agronomist is a person who specializes in scientific agriculture .  i   ve been trained in principles of fertility maintenance  crop rotation  and matters of that sort .  i   ve always specialized in martian problehis .  there aren   t many of us and so one can get a rather good position  even though the farmboys sometimes lose patience with us and think we   re just college idiots without practical experience .  anyway  i   ve had additional training as well in botany and bacteriology  so i   ve been put in charge by mr .  makian of the entire research program on mars with respect to the poisoning .  the other members of the syndicate are co operating .        and what have you found out  mr .  benson .        actually as little as the council of science  which is not surprising considering how little i have in the way of equipment and help in comparison with them .  but i have developed certain theories .  the poisoning is too rapid for anything but a bacterial toxin .  at least if we consider the nerve degeneration that takes place and the other symptoms .  i suspect martian bacteria .          what .          there is martian life  you know .  when earthmen first arrived  mars was covered with simple forms of life .  there were giant algae whose blue green color was seen telescopically even before space travel was invented .  there were bacteria like forms that lived on the algae and even little insect like creatures that were free moving  yet manufactured their own food like plants .          do they still exist .          why  certainly .  we clear them off the land completely before converting areas to our own farms and introduce our own strains of bacteria  the ones that are necessary to plant growth .  out in the uncultivated areas  however  martian life still flourishes .          but how can they be affecting our plants  then .          that   s a good question .  you see  martian farms are not like the earth farm lands you   re used to .  on mars  the farms are not open to sun and air .  the sun on mars doesn   t give enough heat for earth plants and there is no rain .  but there is good  fertile soil and there is quite enough carbon dioxide which the plants live on primarily .  so crops on mars are grown under vast sheets of glass .  they are seeded  cared for  and harvested by nearly automatic machinery so that our farmboys are machinists more than anything else .  the farms are artificially watered by a system of planet wide piping that carries back to the polar icecaps .       i tell you this so you will realize that it would be difficult to infect plants ordinarily .  the fields are closed and guarded from all directions except from beneath .          what does that mean .     asked david .       it means that underneath are the famous martian caverns and within them there may be intelligent martians .          you mean martian men .          not men .  but organisms as intelligent as man .  i have reason to believe that there are martian intelligences that are probably anxious to drive us intruding earthmen from the face of their planet .          dinnertime      what reason .     demanded david .    benson looked embarrassed .  he moved one hand slowly over his head  smoothing the sparse strands of light hair that did not manage to hide the pink streaks of hairless skull that lay between .  he said     none that i could convince the council of science with .  none that i could even present to mr .  makian .  but i believe i   m right .          is it anything you would care to talk about .          well  i don   t know .  frankly  it   s been a long time since i   ve spoken to anyone but farmboys .  you   re a college man obviously .  what did you major in .          history     said david promptly .     my thesis concerned the international politics of the early atomic age .          oh .     benson looked disappointed .     any courses in science at all .          i had a couple in chemistry  one in zoology .          i see .  it occurred to me that i might be able to convince mr .  makian to let you help me in my laboratory .  it wouldn   t be much of a job  especially since you have no scientific training  but it would be better than what hennes will have you doing .           thank you  mr .  benson .  but about the martians .          oh yes .  it   s simple enough .  you may not know it but there are extensive caves under the martian surface  perhaps several miles under .  so much is known from earthquake data  or  rather  marsquake data .  some investigators claim they are merely the result of natural water action in the days when mars still had oceans  but then radiation has been picked up that has its source beneath the soil and which can   t have a human source but must have some intelligent source .  the signals are too orderly to be anything else .       it makes sense  really  if you stop to think about it .  in the youth of the planet there was sufficient water and oxygen to support life  but with a gravity only two fifths that of earth  both substances leaked slowly away into space .  if there were intelligent martians  they must have been able to foresee that .  they might have built huge caverns well underneath their soil  into which they could retire with enough water and air to continue indefinitely  if they kept their population stable .  now suppose these martians found that their planet   s surface was harboring intelligent life once more   life from another planet .  suppose they resented it or feared our eventual interference with them .  what we call food poisoning might be bacteriological warfare .       david said thoughtfully     yes  i see your point .          but would the syndicate .  or the council of science .  well  never mind .  i   ll have you working for me soon  and perhaps we   ll be able to convince them yet .       he smiled and held out a soft hand which was swallowed up in david starr   s large one .       i think they   ll be letting you out now     benson said .    they did let him out  and for the first time david had the chance to observe the heart of a martian farm .  it was domed  of course  as the city had been .  david had been sure of that from the instant he had regained consciousness .  you couldn   t expect to be breathing free air and living under earth strength gravity unless you were within a powered dome .    naturally the dome was much smaller than that of a city .  at its highest it was only about one hundred feet  its translucent structure visible in all its details  strings of white fluorescent lights outdoing the translucent glimmer of the sunlight .  the whole structure covered about half a square mile .    after the first evening  however  david had little time to extend his observations .  the farm dome seemed full of men and they all had to be fed three times a day .  in the evenings particularly  with the day   s work done  there seemed no end to them .  stolidly he would stand behind the chow table while farmboys with plastic platters moved past him .  the platters  david found out eventually  were manufactured especially for martian farm use .  under the heat of human hands they could be molded and closed about the food at such times as it was necessary to carry meals out to the desert .  molded so  they kept the sand out and the heat in .  within the farm dome they could be flattened out again and used in the usual way .    the farmboys paid david little attention .  only bigman  whose lithe frame slipped among the tables replacing sauce bottles and spice containers  waved to him .  it was a terrible drop in social position for the little fellow  but he was philosophical about it .       it   s only for a month     he had explained one time in the kitchen  when they were preparing the day   s stew and the head cook had left on his own business for a few minutes     and most of the fellows know the score and are making it easy for me .  of course there   s griswold  zukis  and that bunch  the rats that try to get somewhere by licking hennes   s boots .  but what in space do i care .  it   s only a few weeks .       another time he said     don   t let it bother you about the boys not cottoning to you .  they know you   re an earthman  see  and they don   t know you   re pretty good for an earthman  like i do .  hennes is always poking about after me  or else griswold is  to make sure i don   t talk to them  or else they would have heard the facts from me .  but they   ll get wise .       but the process was taking time .  for david  it remained the same  a farmboy and his platter  a dollop of mashed potatoes  a ladle of peas  and a small steak  animal food was much scarcer on mars than plant food  since meat had to be imported from earth  .  the farmboy then helped himself to a sliver of cake and a cup of coffee .  then another farmboy with another platter  another dollop of mashed potatoes  another ladle of peas  and so on .  to them  it seemed  david starr was just an earthman with a ladle in one hand and a large tined fork in the other .  he wasn   t even a face  just a ladle and a fork .    the cook stuck his head through the door  his little eyes peering piggily over the sagging pouches beneath .        hey  williams .  rattle your legs and get some food into the special mess .       makian  benson  hennes  and any others who were considered especially worthy in point of view of position or of length of service dined in a room by themselves  .  they sat at tables and had the food brought to them .  david had been through this before .  he prepared special platters and brought them into the room on a wheeled service table .    he threaded his way quietly through the tables  beginning with the one at which makian  hennes  and two others sat .  at benson   s table he lingered .  benson accepted his platter with a smile and a    how are you .     and proceeded to eat with relish .  david  with an air of conscientiousness  brushed at invisible crumbs .  his mouth managed to get itself close to benson   s ears and his lips scarcely moved as he said     anyone ever get poisoned here at the farm .       benson started at the sudden sound of words and looked quickly at david .  as quickly he looked away  tried to appear indifferent .  he shook his head in a sharp negative .       the vegetables are martian  aren   t they .     murmured david .    a new voice sounded in the room .  it was a rough yell from the other end of the room .     by space  you long earth jackass  get a move on .       it was griswold  his face still stubbled .  he must shave sometimes  david thought  since the stubble never grew longer  but no one ever seemed to see it shorter  either .  griswold was at the last table to be visited .  he was still mumbling  his anger boiling over .  his lips drew back .     bring over that platter  dish jockey .  faster .  faster .       david did so  but without hurry  and griswold   s hand  with the fork in it  jabbed quickly .  david moved more quickly  and the fork clanged sharply against the hard plastic of the tray .    balancing the tray in one hand  david caught griswold   s fist with the other .  his grip grew tight .  the other three at the table pushed back their chairs and rose .    david   s voice  low  icy  and dead level  sounded just high enough to be heard by griswold .     drop it and ask for your ration decently  or you   ll have it all at once .       griswold writhed  but david maintained his hold .  david   s knee in the back of griswold   s chair prevented the farmboy from pushing away from the table .       ask nicely     said david .  he smiled  deceptively gentle .     like a man with breeding .       griswold was panting harshly .  the fork dropped from between his numbed fingers .  he growled     let me have the tray .          is that all .          please .     he spat it out .    david lowered the tray and released the other   s fist from which the blood had been crushed  leaving it white .  griswold massaged it with his other hand and reached for his fork .  he looked about him  mad with fury  but there was only amusement or indifference in the eyes that met his .  the farms on mars were hard  each man had to care for himself .    makian was standing .     williams     he called .    david approached .     sir .       makian made no direct reference to what had just occurred  but he stood there for a moment  looking carefully at david  as though he were seeing him for the first time and liked what he saw .  he said     would you like to join the checkup tomorrow .          the checkup  sir .  what is that .     unobtrusively he surveyed the table .  makian   s steak was gone  but his peas remained behind and the mashed potatoes were scarcely touched .  he had not the grit  apparently  of hennes  who had left a clean platter .       the checkup is the monthly drive through all the farm to check on the plant rows .  it   s an old farm custom .  we check on possible accidental breaks in the glass  on the condition and workings of the irrigation pipes and farm machinery  also on possible poaching .  we need as many good men as possible out on the checkup .          i   d like to go  sir .          good .  i think you   ll do .     makian turned to hennes  who had been listening throughout with cold and unemotional eyes .     i like the boy   s style  hennes .  we may be able to make a farmboy out of him .  and  hennes     his voice sank and david  moving away  could no longer catch it  but from the quick hooded glance makian cast in the direction of griswold   s table  it could not have been very complimentary to the veteran farmboy .    david starr caught the footstep inside his own partitioning and acted even before he was fully awake .  he slipped off the far side of the bed and underneath .  he caught the glimpse of bare feet glimmering whitely in the pale light of the residual fluorescents shining through the window .  the residuals were allowed to burn in the farm dome during the sleeping period to avoid darkness too inconveniently black .    david waited  heard the rustle of the sheets as hands probed uselessly through the bed  then a whisper .     earthman .  earthman .  where in space       david touched one of the feet and was rewarded by a sudden withdrawal and a sharp intake of breath .    there was a pause and then a head  shapeless in the dusk  was near his .     earthman .  you there .          where else would i be sleeping  bigman .  i like it here under the bed .       the little fellow fumed and whispered peevishly     you might have squeezed a yell out of me and then i would have been in the stew to my ears .  i   ve got to talk to you .          now   s your chance .     david chuckled softly and crawled back into bed .    bigman said     you   re a suspicious space bug for an earthman .          you bet     said david .     i intend living a long life .          if you   re not careful  you won   t .          no .          no .  i   m foolish to be here .  if i   m caught  i   ll never get my reference papers .  it   s just that you helped me when i could use it  and it   s my turn to pay back .  what was it you did to this louse  griswold .          just a little mixup in the special mess .          a little mixup .  he was raving mad .  it was all hennes could do to hold him back .          is this what you came to tell me  bigman .           part of it .  they were behind the garage just after eghts out .  they didn   t know i was around  and i didn   t tell them .  anyway  hennes was yanking the stuffings out of griswold  first for starting something with you when the old man was watching  and second  for not having the sand to finish once he had started it .  griswold was too mad to talk sense .  near as i could judge  he was just gargling something about how he would have your gizzard .  hennes said     he broke off .     listen  didn   t you tell me that hennes was all clear as far as you were concerned .          he seems so .          those midnight trips            you only saw him once .          once is enough .  if it was legitimate  why can   t you give me the straight stuff .          it   s not mine to give  bigman  but it all seems legitimate .          if that   s the case  what   s he got against you .  why doesn   t he call off his dogs .          what do you mean .          well  when griswold finished talking  hennes said he was to hold off .  he said you would be out on checkup tomorrow and that would be the time .  so i thought i   d come and warn you  earthman .  better stay off checkup .       david   s voice remained unflurried .     checkup would be time for what .  did hennes say .          i didn   t hear past that .  they moved away and i couldn   t follow  or i would have been out in the open .  but i assume it   s pretty plain .           maybe .  but suppose we try to find out for sure exactly what they   re after .       bigman leaned close  as though he were trying to extract a reading from david   s face despite the gloom .     how do you mean .       david said     how do you suppose .  i   ll be at the checkup and give the boys a chance to show me .          you can   t do that     gasped bigman .     you couldn   t handle yourself on a checkup against them .  you don   t know anything about mars  you poor earthman you .          then     said david phlegmatically     it could mean suicide  i suppose .  let   s wait and see .     he patted bigman on the shoulder  turned over  and went to sleep again .          sand away .       checkup excitement began within the farm dome as soon as the main fluorescents were turned on .  there was a wild noise and a mad scurry .  sand cars were brought out in rows  each farmboy tending his own .    makiari was here and there  never too long at any one point .  hennes  in his flat  efficient voice  assigned the parties and set the routes across the farm   s vast expanse .  he looked up as he passed david and stopped .       williams     he said     are you still of a mind to be on the checkup .          i wouldn   t miss it .          all right then .  since you haven   t any car of your own  i   ll assign you one out of general stock .  once it   s assigned  it   s yours to take care of and keep in working condition .  any repairs or damage which we consider avoidable will come out of your pay .  understood .          fair enough .          i   ll put you on griswold   s team .  i know that you and he don   t get along  but he   s our best man in the fields and you   re an earthie without experience .  i wouldn   t care to load you onto a lesser man .  can you drive a sand car .           i think i can handle any moving vehicle with a little practice .          you can  eh .  we   ll give you your chance to make good on that .     he was about to step away when his eyes caught something .  he barked     and where do you think you   re going .       bigman had just stepped into the assembly room .  he was in a new outfit and his boots had been polished to mirror shine .  his hair was slicked down and his face was scrubbed and pink .  he drawled     on the checkup  hennes   mister hennes .  i   m not on detention and i still have my rating as licensed farmboy even though you have put me on chow detail .  that means i can go on checkup .  it also means i have a right to my old car and my old squad .       hennes shrugged .     you read the rule books a lot  and that   s what they say  i suppose .  but one more week  bigman  one more week .  after that  if you ever show your nose anywhere on makian territory i   ll have a real man step on you and squash you .       bigman made a threatening gesture at hennes   s retreating back and then turned to david .     ever used a nosepiece  earthman .          never actually .  i   ve heard about them  of course .          hearing isn   t using .  i   ve checked an extra one out for you .  look  let me show you how to get it on .  no  no  get your thumbs out of there .  now watch how i hold my hands .  that   s right .  now over the head and make sure the straps aren   t twisted in the back of the neck  or you   ll end with a headache .  now can you see through them .       the upper part of david   s face was transformed into a plastic encased monstrosity  and the double hose leading from the oxygen cylinders up each side of his chin subtracted further from any appearance of humanity .       do you have trouble breathing .     asked bigman .    david was struggling  fighting to suck in air .  he yanked the nosepiece off .     how do you turn it on .  there   s no gauge .       bigman was laughing .     that   s the return for the scare you gave me last night .  you don   t need a gauge .  the cylinders automatically feed oxygen as soon as the warmth and pressure of your face trip a contact  and it automatically closes off when you take it off .          then there   s something wrong with it .  i          nothing wrong with it .  it feeds at a gas pressure of one fifth normal to match the pressure of the mars atmosphere  and you can   t suck it in out here when you   re fighting the pressure of a normal earth atmosphere .  out there in the desert it will be fine .  and it will be enough  too  because even though it   s one fifth normal  it   s all oxygen .  you   ll have as much oxygen as you always had .  just remember one thing  breathe in through your nose but breathe out through your mouth .  if you breathe out through your nose  you   ll fog up your eyepieces  and that won   t be good .       he strutted about david   s tall  straight body and shook his head .     don   t know what to do about your boots .  black and white .  you look like a garbage detail or something .     he glanced down at his own chartreuse and vermilion creations with more than a little complacency .    david said     i   ll manage .  you   d better get to your car .  it looks as though they   re getting ready to move .          you   re right .  well  take it easy .  watch out for the gravity change .  that   s hard to take if you   re not used  to it .  and  earthman          well .          keep your eyes open .  you know what i mean .          thanks .  i shall .       the sand cars were lining up now in squares of nine .  there were more than a hundred all told  each with its farmboy peering over its tires and controls .  each vehicle had its handmade signs intended as humor .  the sand car trundled out for david was speckled with such signs from half a dozen previous owners  beginning with a    watch out  girls    circling the bullet like prow of the car and ending with a    this ain   t no dust storm  this is me     on the rear bumper .    david climbed in and closed the door .  it fit tightly .  not even a seam showed .  immediately above his head there was the filtered and refiltered vent that allowed equalization of air pressure within and without the car .  the glass was not quite clear .  it had a faint misting that was proof of dozens of dust storhis met and weathered .  david found the controls familiar enough .  they were standard for ground cars  for the most part .  the few unfamiliar buttons explained themselves upon manipulation .    griswold came past  gesturing at him furiously .  he opened his door .    griswold yelled     get your front flaps down  you jerk .  we   re not heading into any storm .       david searched for the proper button and found it on the steering wheel shaft .  the windshields  which looked as though they were welded to metal  disengaged themselves and sank down into sockets .  visibility improved .  of course  he thought .  mars   s atmosphere would scarcely  raise wind enough to disturb them  and this was martian summer .  it would not be too cold .    a voice called     hey  earthman .     he looked up .  bigman was waving at him .  he was in griswold   s group of nine also .  david waved back .    a section of the dome lifted up .  nine cars trundled in  moving sluggishly .  the section closed behind them .  minutes passed  then it opened  empty  and nine more moved in .    griswold   s voice sounded suddenly and loudly next to david   s ear .  david turned and saw the small receiver in the car top just behind his head .  the small grilled opening at the head of the steering wheel shaft was a mouthpiece .       squad eight  ready .       the voices sounded consecutively     number one  ready .        number two  ready .        number three  ready .     there was a pause after number six .  just a few seconds .  david then called     number seven  ready .     there followed    number eight  ready .     big man   s reedy tones came last .     number nine  ready .       the dome section was raising again and the cars ahead of david began moving .  david slowly stepped on the resistor  cutting the coils  allowing electricity to pour into the motor .  his sand car leaped ahead  all but crashing into the rear of the one in front .  he let out the resistor with a jerk and felt the car tremble beneath him .  gently he babied it along .  the section enclosed them like a small tunnel  shutting off behind .    he became conscious of the hiss of air being pumped out of the section back into the dome proper .  he felt his heart begin to pound  but his hands were steady upon the wheel .    his clothing bellied away from him and the air was seeping out along the cylindrical line where boots met thigh .  there was a tingling in his hands and chin  a feeling of puffiness  of distention .  he swallowed repeatedly  to relieve the gathering pain in his ears .  after five minutes he found himself panting in an effort to gather enough oxygen for his needs .    the others were slipping on their nosepieces .  he did the same  and this time oxygen slid smoothly up his nostrils .  he breathed deeply  puffing it out through his mouth .  his arms and feet still tingled  but the feeling was beginning to die away .    and now the section was opening ahead of them  and the flat  ruddy sands of mars glittered in the sun   s feeble light .  there was a yell in unison from eight farmboy throats as the section lifted .       sand awa a a ay .     and the first cars in line began to move .    it was the traditional farmboy cry  made thin and almost soprano in the thin air of mars .    david let in the resistor and crawled across the line that marked the boundary between dome metal and martian soil .    and it hit him .    the sudden gravity change was like a sharp fall of a thousand feet .  one hundred and twenty pounds of his two hundred disappeared as he crossed the line  and it left him by way of the pit of his stomach .  he clutched at the wheel as the sensation of fall  fall  fall persisted .  the sand car veered wildly .    there was the sound of griswold   s voice  which maintained its hoarseness even in the incongruous hollowness forced upon it by the thin air which carried sound waves so poorly .     number seven .  back in line .       david fought with the wheel  fought with his own sensations  fought to make himself see clearly .  he dragged at the oxygen through his nosepiece and slowly the worst passed .    he could see bigman looking anxiously in his direction .  he took one hand away from the wheel momentarily to wave  then concentrated on the road .    the martian desert was almost flat  flat and bare .  not even a scrub of vegetation existed here .  this particular area had been dead and deserted for who knew how many thousands or millions of years .  the thought suddenly struck him that perhaps he was wrong .  perhaps the desert sands had been coated with blue green microorganisms until earthmen had come and burned them away to make room for their farms .    the cars ahead trailed faint dust that rose slowly  as if it were part of a motion picture film that had been slowed down .  it settled as slowly .    david   s car was trailing badly .  he added speed and still more speed  and found that something was going wrong .  the others  ahead of him  were hugging the ground but he  himself  was bounding like a jackrabbit .  at every trifling imperfection in the ground surface  at every projecting line of rock  his car took off .  it drifted lazily up into the air  inches high  its wheels whining against nothing .  it came down as gently  then lurched forward with a jerk as the straining wheels caught hold .    it caused him to lose ground  and when he poured the juice in to gain again  the jumping grew worse .  it was the low gravity that did it  of course  but the others managed to compensate for it .  he wondered how .    it was getting cold .  even at martian summer  he guessed the temperature to be barely above freezing .  he could look directly at the sun in the sky .  it was a dwarfed sun in a purple sky in which he could make out three or four stars .  the air was too thin to blank them out or to scatter light in such a manner as to form the sky blue of earth .    griswold   s voice was sounding again     cars one  four  and seven to the left .  cars two  five  and eight to the center .  cars three  six  and nine to the right cars two and three will be in charge of their subsections .       griswold   s car  number  one  was beginning to curl to the left  and david  following it with his eyes  noticed the dark line on the leftward horizon .  number four was following one  and david turned his wheel sharply left to match the angle of veer .    what followed caught him by surprise .  his car went into a rapid skid  scarcely allowing him time to realize it .  he yanked desperately at the wheel  spinning it in the direction of skid .  he shut off all power and felt the wheels rasp as the car whirled onward .  the desert circled before him  so that only its redness could make any impression .    and then there was bigman   s thin cry through the receiver     stamp on the emergency traction .  it   s just to the right of the resistors .       david probed desperately for the emergency traction  whatever it was  but his aching feet found nothing .  the dark line on the horizon appeared before him and then vanished .  it was much sharper now  and broader .  even in that rapid flash  its nature became appallingly evident .  it was one of the fissures of mars  long and straight .  like the far more numerous ones on earth   s moon  they were cracks in the planetary surface  made as the world dried through millions of years .  they were up to a hundred feet across and no man had plumbed their depth .       it   s a pink  stubby button      .  yelled bigman .     stamp everywhere .       david did so  and there was a sudden slight yielding beneath his toes .  the  swift motion of his sand car became a rebellious grinding that tore at him .  the dust came up in clouds  choking him and obscuring everything .    he bent over the wheel and waited .  the car was definitely slowing .  and then  finally  it stopped .    he sat back and breathed quietly for a moment then he withdrew his nosepiece  wiped the inner surfaces while the cold air stung at nose and eyes  and replaced it .  his clothes were ruddy gray with dust and his chin was caked with it .  he could feel its dry ness upon his lips  and the interior of his car was filthy with it .    the two other cars of his sub section had pulled up next to him .  griswold was climbing out of one  his stubbled face made monstrously ugly by the nose piece .  david was suddenly aware of the reason for the popularity of beards and stubble among the farmboys .  they were protection against the cold  thin wind of mars .    griswold was snarling  showing yellowed and broken teeth .  he said     earthman  the repairs for this sand car will come right out of your wages .  you had hennes   s warning .       david opened the door and climbed out .  from outside  the car was a worse wreck still  if that were possible .  the tires were torn and from them projected the huge teeth which were obviously the    emergency traction .       he said     not one cent comes out of my wages  griswold .  there was something wrong with the car .          that   s for sure .  the driver .  a stupid  dumb lug driver  that   s what   s wrong with the car .       another car came squealing up  and griswold turned to it .    his stubble seemed to bristle .     get the blast out of here  you cinch bug .  get on with your job .       bigman jumped out of his car .     not till i take a look at the earthman   s car .       bigman weighed less than fifty pounds on mars  and in one long  flat leap he was at david   s side .  he bent for a moment  then straightened .  he said     where are the weight rods  griswold .       david said     what are the weight rods  bigman .       the little fellow spoke rapidly .     when you take these sand cars out into low gravity  you put foot  thick beams over each of the axles .  you take them out when you   re on high grav .  i   m sorry  fella  but i never once thought that this might be what       david stopped him .  his lips drew back .  it would explain why his car had floated upward at each bump while the others were glued to the soil .  he turned to griswold .     did you know they were gone .       griswold swore .     each man is responsible for his own car .  if you didn   t notice they were gone  that   s your negligence .       all the cars were now on the scene .  a circle of hairy men were forming around the three  quiet  attentive  not interfering .    bigman stormed .     you big hunk of silica  the  man   s a tenderfoot .  he can   t be expected to          quiet  bigman     said david .     this is my job .  i ask you again  griswold .  did you know about this in advance .          and i told you  earthie .  in the desert a man has to watch himself .  i   m not going to mother you .          all right .  in that case i   ll watch myself right now .     david looked about .  they were almost at the edge of the fissure .  another ten feet and he would have been a dead man .     however  you   ll have to watch yourself  too  because i   m taking your car .  you can drive mine back to the farm dome or you can stay here for all i care .          by mars .     griswold   s hand shot to his hip and there was a sudden rough cry from  the circle of watching men .       fair fight .  fair fight .       the code of the martian deserts was a hard one  but it drew the line at advantages considered unfair .  that was understood and enforced .  only by such mutual precautions could any man be protected from an eventual force knife in the back or blast gun in the belly .    griswold looked at the hard faces about him .  he said     we   ll have it out back in the dome .  on your jobs  men .       david said     i   ll see you in the dome if you wish .  meanwhile  step aside .       he walked forward unhurriedly  and griswold stepped back .     you stupid greenhorn .  we can   t have a fist fight with nosepieces on .  do you have anything but bone inside your skull .          take your nosepiece off  then     said david     and i   ll take mine off .  stop me in fair fight  if you can .          fair fight .     came the approving shout from the crowd  and bigman yelled     put up or back down  griswold .     he leaped forward  ripping griswold   s blaster from his hip .    david put his hand to his nosepiece .     ready .       bigman called     i   ll count three .       the men yelled confusedly .  they were waiting now  in keen anticipation .  griswold glanced wildly about him .    bigman was counting     one       and at the count of    three    david quietly removed his nosepiece  and tossed it  with the attached cylinders  to one side .  he stood there  unprotecteds holding his breath against the unbreathable atmosphere of mars .       bigman makes a discovery   grlswold did not stir  and his nosepiece remained in place .  there was a threatening growl from the spectators .    david moved as quickly as he dared  gauging his steps against the light gravity .  he lunged cluhisily  it was almost as though water were holding him up  and caught griswold about the shoulder .  he twisted sideways  avoiding the farmboy   s knee .  one hand reached to griswold   s chin  caught the nosepiece and yanked it up and off .    griswold grabbed for it with the beginning of a thin yell  but caught himself and clamped his mouth shut against the loss of any air .  he broke away  staggering a bit .  slowly he circled david .    nearly a minute had passed since david had drawn his last breath .  his lungs felt the strain .  griswold  eyes bloodshot  crouched and sidled toward david .  his legs were springy  his motions graceful .  he was used to low gravity and could handle himself .  david realized grimly that he himself probably could not .  one quick  injudicious move and he might find himself sprawling .    each second took its strain .  david kept out of reach and watched the twisting grimace on griswold   s face tauten and grow tortured .  he would have to outwait the farmboy .  he himself had an athlete   s lungs .  griswold ate too much and drank too much to be in proper shape .  the fissure caught his eye .  it was some four feet behind him now  a sheer cliff  dropping perpendicularly .  it was toward it that griswold was maneuvering him .    he halted his retreat .  in ten seconds griswold would have to charge .  he would have to .  and griswold did .    david let himself drop to one side  and caught the other with his shoulder .  he whirled under the impact and allowed the force of the whirl to add itself to his own thrusting fist which caught griswold   s jawbone at its socket .    griswold staggered blindly .  he let out his breath in a huge puff and filled his lungs with a mixture of argon  neon  and carbon dioxide .  slowly  dreadfullys he crumpled .  with a last effort he tried to raise him self  half succeeded  started falling again  tottered forward in an attempt to maintain his balance   there was a confused yelling in david   s ears .  on trembling legs  deaf and blind to everything but his nosepiece on the ground  he walked back to the car .  forcing his tortured  oxygen craving body to work slowly and with dignity  he buckled on his cylinders with care and adjusted his nosepiece .  then  finally  he took a shuddering drag of oxygen that poured into his lungs like the rush of cold water into a desiccated stomach .    it was a full minute before he could do anything but breathe  his huge chest rising and falling in large  rapid sweeps .  he opened his eyes .        where   s griswold .       they were around him  all of them  bigman in the very fore .    bigman looked surprised .     didn   t you see .          i knocked him down .     david looked about sharply .  griswold was nowhere .    bigman made a down sweeping motion with his hand .     into the fissure .          what .     david frowned beneath the nosepiece .     this is a bad joke .          no  no .        over the edge like a diver .        by space  it was his own fault .        clear case of self defense for you  earthie .     they were all talking at once .    david said     wait  what happened .  did   throw him over .          no  earthie     bigman clamored .     it wasn   t your doing .  you hit him and the bug went down .  then he tried to get up .  he started going down again  and when he tried to keep his balance  he sort of hopped forward  too blind to see what lay ahead of him .  we tried to get him  but there wasn   t enough time  and over he went .  if he hadn   t been so busy maneuvering you to the edge of the fissure so he could throw you over  it wouldn   t have happened .       david looked at the men .  they looked at him .    finally one of the farmboys thrust out a hard hand .     good show  farmboy .       it was calmly said  but it meant acceptance  and it broke the log jam .    bigman yelled a triumph  jumped six feet into the air  and sank slowly down  with legs twiddling under him in a maneuver no ballet dancer  however expert  could have duplicated under earth gravity .  the others were crowding close now .  men who had addressed david only as    earthie    or    you     or not at all  were clapping him on the back and telling him he was a man mars could be proud of .    bigman shouted     men  let   s continue the checkup .  do we need griswold to show us how .       they howled back     no .          then how about it .     he vaulted into his car .       come on  farmboy     they yelled at david  who jumped into what had been griswold   s car fifteen minutes before and set it in motion .    once again the call of    sand awa a a ay .     shrilled and ululated through the martian wisps .    the news spread by sand car radio  leaping across the empty spaces between the glass enclosed stretches of farm lands .  while david maneuvered his vehicle up and down the corridors between the glass walls  word of griswold   s end made its way across all the expanse of the farm .    the eight remaining farmboys of what had been griswold   s sub section gathered together once again in the dying ruddy light of mars   s sinking sun and retraced the early morning drive back to the farm dome .  when david returned  he found himself already notorious .    there was no formal evening meal that day .  it had been eaten out in the desert before the return  so in less than half an hour of the completion of the checkup  men had gathered before the main house  waiting .    there was no doubt that by now hennes and the old man himself had heard of the fight .  there were enough of the    hennes crowd     that is  men who had been hired since hennes had become foreman and whose interests were tied thoroughly to those of hennes  to insure the fact that the news had spread in that direction .  so the men waited with pleased anticipation .    it was not that they had any great hate for hennes .  he was efficient and no brute .  but he was not liked .  he was cold and aloof  lacked the quality of easy mixing which had marked earlier foremen .  on mars  with its lack of social distinctions  that was a serious shortcoming and one which the men could not help but resent .  and griswold himself had been anything but popular .    all in all  it was more excitement than the makian farm had seen in three martian years  and a martian year is just one month short of being two earth years long .    when david appeared  a considerable cheer went up and way was made for him  though a small group well to one side looked glum and hostile .    inside  the cheers must have been heard  for makian  hennes  benson  and a few others stepped out .  david walked up the foot of the ramp which led to the doorway and hennes moved forward to the head of the ramp  where he stood  looking down .    david said     sir  i have come to explain today   s incident .       hennes said evenly     a valuable employee of the makian farms died today as the result of a quarrel with you .  can your explanation remove that fact .          no  sir  but the man griswold was beaten in fair fight .       a voice called out from the crowd     griswold tried to kill the boy .  he forgot to have the weight rods included in the boy   s car by accident     there were several scattered squawks of laughter at the final sarcastic word .    hennes paled .  his fist clenched .     who said that .       there was silence  and then from the very front of the crowd a small  subdued voice said     please  teacher  it wasn   t i .     bigman was standing there  hands clasped before him  eyes looking modestly down .    the laughter came again  and this time it was a roar .    hennes suppressed fury with an effort .  he said to david     do you claim an attempt on your life .       david said     no  sir .  i claim only a fair fight  witnessed by seven farmboys .  a man who enters a fair fight must be willing to come out as best he can .  do you intend to set up new rules .       a yell of approval went up from the audience .  hennes looked about him .  he cried     i am sorry that you men are being misled and agitated into actions you will regret .  now get back to your work  all of you  and be assured that your attitude this evening will not be forgotten .  as for you  williams  we will consider the case .  this is not the end .       he slammed back into main house and  after a moment   s hesitation  the rest followed him .    david was called to benson   s office early the next day .  it had been a long night of celebration  which david could neither avoid nor break away from  and he yawned prodigiously as he stooped to avoid hitting the lintel .    benson said     come in  williams .     he was dressed in a white smock and the air in the office had a characteristic animal odor that came from the cages of rats and hahisters .  he smiled .     you look sleepy .  sit down .          thanks     said david .     i am sleepy .  what can i do for you .          it   s what i can do for you  williams .  you   re in trouble and you could be in worse trouble .  i   m afraid you don   t know what conditions on mars are like .  mr .  makian has the full legal authority to order you blasted if he believes the death of griswold can be considered murder .          without a trial .          no  but hennes could find twelve farmboys who would think his way easily enough .          he   d have trouble with the rest of the farmboys if he tried to do that  wouldn   t he .          i know .  i told hennes that over and over again last night .  don   t think that hennes and i get along .  he   s too dictatorial for me  too fond  by far  of his own ideas  such as that private detective work of his which i mentioned to you the other time .  and mr .  makian agreed with me completely .  he must let hennes take charge of all direct dealings with the men  of course  which is why he didn   t interfere yesterday  but he told hennes afterward  to his face  that he wasn   t going to sit by and see his farm destroyed over a stupid rascal such as griswold  and hennes had to promise to let the matter stew for a while .  just the same  he won   t forget this in a hurry  and hennes is a bad enemy to have here .          i   ll have to risk it  won   t i .          we can run the risk to a minimum .  i   ve asked makian if i may use you here .  you could be quite useful  you know  even without scientific training .  you can help feed the animals and clean the cages .  i could teach you how to anesthetize them and make injections .  it won   t be much  but it will keep you out of hennes   s way and prevent disruption of farm morale which is something we can   t afford now  as you should know .  are you willing .       with the utmost gravity david said     it would be rather a social comedown for a man who   s been told he   s an honest to goodness farmboy now .       the scientist frowned .     oh  come now  williams .  don   t take seriously what those fools tell you .  farm boy .  huh .  it   s a fancy name for a semi skilled agricultural laborer and nothing more .  you   d be silly to listen to their upside down notions of social status .  look  if you work with me you might be helping to work out the mystery of the poisonings  help avenge your sister .  that   s why you came to mars  wasn   t it .       i   ll work for you     said david .       good .     benson   s round face stretched in a smile of relief .    bigman looked through the door cautiously .  he half whispered     hey .       david turned around and closed the cage door .     hello  bigman .          is benson around .          no .  he   s gone for the day .          okay .     bigman entered  walking carefully  as though to prevent even an accidental contact between his clothing and any object in the laboratories .     .     don   t tell me you have something against benson .           who  me .  no .  he   s just a bit   you know .     he tapped his temple a few times .     what kind of a grown man would come to mars to fool around with little animals .  and then he   s always telling us how to run the planting and harvesting .  what does he know .  you can   t learn anything about mars farming in some earth college .  at that  he tries to make himself seem better than we are .  you know what i mean .  we have to slap him down sometimes .       he looked gloomily at david .     and now look at you .  he   s got you all spiffed out in a nightgown  too  playing nursemaid to a mouse .  why do you let him .          it   s just for a while     said david .       well .     bigman pondered a moment  then thrust out his hand awkwardly .     i want to say good by .       david took it .     leaving .          my month   s up .  i have my papers so now i   ll be getting a job somewhere else .  i   m glad i met up with you  earthie .  maybe when your own time   s up we can meet again .  you won   t want to stay under hennes .          hold on .     david did not release the little fellow   s hand .     you   ll be going to wingrad city now  won   t you .          till i find a job .  yes .          good .  i   ve been waiting for this for a week .  i can   t leave the farm  bigman  so will you do an errand for me .          you bet .  just name it .          it   s a little risky .  you   d have to come back here .          all right .  i   m not afraid of hennes .  besides  there are ways for us to meet he doesn   t know a thing about .  i   ve been on makian farms a lot longer than he has .       david forced bigman into a seat .  he squatted next to him  and his voice was a whisper .     look  there   s a library at the corner of canal and phobos streets in wingrad city .  i want you to get some book films for me along with a viewer .  the information that will get you the proper films is in this sealed       bigman   s hand clawed out sharply  seizing david   s right sleeve  forcing it upward .       here  what are you doing .     demanded david .       i want to see something     panted bigman .  he had bared david   s wrist now  holding it  inner surface upward  watching it breathlessly .    david made no move to withdraw it .  he watched his own wrist without concern .     well  what   s the idea .          wrong one     muttered bigman .       really .     david took his wrist away from bigman   s clutch effortlessly and exposed the other wrist .  he held them both before him .     what are you looking for .          you know what i   m looking for .  i thought your face was familiar ever since you came here .  couldn   t place it .  i could kick myself .  what kind of an earth man would come here and be rated as good as any native farmboy in less than a month .  and i have to wait for you to send me to the library at the council of science before i tumble .          i still don   t understand you  bigman .          i think you do  david starr .     he nearly shouted the name in his triumph .       night meeting   david said     quiet  man .       bigman   s voice sank .     i   ve seen you in video reels often enough .  but why don   t your wrists show the mark .  i   ve heard all the members of the council were marked .          where did you hear this .  and who told you the library at canal and phobos is the council of science .       bigman flushed .     don   t look down at the farmboy  mister .  i   ve lived in the city .  i   ve even had schooling .          my apologies .  i didn   t mean it that way .  will you still help me .          not until i understand about your wrists .          that   s not hard .  it   s a colorless tattoo that will turn dark in air  but only if i want it to .          how   s that .          it   s a matter of emotion .  each human emotion is accompanied by a particular hormone pattern in the blood .  one and only one such pattern activates the tattoo .  i happen to know the emotion that fits .       david did nothing visibly  but slowly a patch on the inner surface of his right wrist appeared and darkened .  the golden dots of the big dipper and orion glowed momentarily and then the whole faded rapidly .    bigman   s face glowed and his hands came down for that automatic smack against his boots .  david caught his arms roughly .       hey     said bigman .       no excitement  please .  are you with me .          sure i   m with you .  i   ll be back tonight with the stuff you want and i   ll tell you where we can meet .    there   s a place outside  near the second section       he went on  whispering directions .    david nodded .     good .  here   s the envelope .       bigman took it and inserted it between his hip boot and thigh .  he said     there   s a pocket on the inside top of the better quality hip boots  mr .  starr .  do you know that .          i do .  don   t look down at this farmboy  either .  and my name  bigman  is still williams .  that leaves just one last statement .  the council librarians will be the only ones who will be able to open that envelope safely .  if anyone else tries  he   ll be hurt .       bigman drew himself up .     no one else will open it .  there are people who are bigger than i am .  maybe you think i don   t know that  but i do .  just the same  bigger or not  nobody  and i mean nobody  will take this from me without killing me .  what   s more  i wasn   t thinking of opening it myself  either  if you   ve given that any thought .          i have     said david .     i try to give all possibilities some  thought  but i didn   t give that one very much .       bigman smiled  made a mock pass with his fist at david   s chin  and was gone .    it was almost dinnertime when benson returned .  he looked unhappy and his plump cheeks were drooping .    he said listlessly     how are you  williams .       david was washing his hands by dipping them into the special detergent solution which was universally used on mars for this purpose .  he withdrew his hands into the stream of warm air for drying  while the wash water flushed away into the tanks where it could be purified and returned to the central supply .  water was expensive on mars and was used and reused wherever possible .    david said     you look tired  mr .  benson .       benson closed the door carefully behind him .  he blurted it out .     six people died yesterday of the poisoning .  that   s the highest number yet for a single day .  it   s getting worse all the time and there   s nothing we seem to be able to do .       he glowered at the lines of animal cages .     all alive  i suppose .          all alive     said david .       well  what can i do .  every day makian asks me if i have discovered anything .  does he think i can find discoveries under my pillow in the morning .  i was in the grain bins today  williams .  it was an ocean of wheat  thousands and thousands of tons all set for shipment to earth .  i dipped into it a hundred times .  fifty grains here  fifty grains there .  i tried every corner of every bin .  i had them dip twenty feet down for samples .  but what good is it .  under present conditions it would be a generous estimate to suppose that one out of a billion grains is infected .       he nudged at the suitcase he had brought with him .     do you think the fifty thousand grains i   ve got here have the one in a billion among them .  one chance in twenty thousand .       david said     mr .  benson  you told me that no one ever died on the farm here  even though we eat martian food almost exclusively .          not as far as i know .          how about mars as a whole .       benson frowned .     i don   t know .  i suppose not or i would have heard of it .  of course life isn   t as tightly organized here on mars as it is on earth .  a farmboy dies and usually he is simply buried without formality .  there are few questions .     then  sharply     why do you ask .          i was just thinking that if it were a martian germ  people on mars might be more accustomed to it than earth people .  they might be ihimune .          well .  not a bad thought for a non scientist .  in fact  it   s a good idea .  i   ll keep it in mind     he reached up to pat david   s shoulder .     you go on and eat .  we   ll begin feeding the new samples tomorrow .       as david left  benson turned to his suitcase and was lifting out the carefully labeled little packets  one of which might hold the all important poisoned kernel .  by tomorrow those samples would be ground  each little pile of powder carefully mixed and painstakingly divided into twenty sub samples  some for feeding and some for testing .    by tomorrow .  david smiled tightly to himself .  he wondered where he would be tomorrow .  he even wondered if he would be alive tomorrow .    the farm dome lay asleep like a giant prehistoric monster curled upon the surface of mars .  the residual fluorescents were pale glimmers against the dome roof .  amid the silence the ordinarily unheard vibrations of the dome   s atmospherics  which compressed martian atmosphere to the normal earth level and added moisture and oxygen from the quantities supplied by the growing plants of the vast greenhouses  sounded in a low grumble .    david was moving quickly from shadow to shadow with a caution that was  to a large extent  not necessary .  there was no one watching .  the hard composition of the dome was low overhead  bending rapidly to the ground  when he reached lock    .  his hair brushed it .    the inner door was open and he stepped inside .  his pencil flashlight swept the walls within and found the controls .  they weren   t labeled  but bigman   s directions had been clear enough .  he depressed the yellow button .  there was a faint click  a pause  and then the soughing of air .  it was much louder than it had been on the day of the checkup  and since the lock was a small one designed for three or four men rather than a giant one designed for nine sand cars  the air pressure dropped much more quickly .    he adjusted his nosepiece  waited for the hissing to die away  the silence indicating pressure equilibrium .  only then did he depress the red button .  the outer section lifted and he stepped out .    this time he was not trying to control a car .  he lowered himself to the hard  cold sands and waited for the stomach turning sensations to pass as he accustomed himself to the gravity change .  it took scarcely two minutes for that to happen .  a few more gravity change passages  david thought grimly  and he would have what the farmboys called    gravity legs .       he rose  turned to get his bearings  and then found himself  quite involuntarily  frozen in fascination .    it was the first time he had ever seen the martian night sky .  the stars themselves were the old familiar ones of earth  arranged in all the familiar constellations .  the distance from mars to earth  great though it was  was insufficient to alter perceptibly the relative positions of the distant stars .  but though the stars were unchanged in position  how vastly they were changed in brilliance .    the thinner air of mars scarcely softened them  but left them hard and gem bright .  there was no moon  of course  not one such as earth knew .  mars   s two satellites  phobos and deimos  were tiny things only five or ten miles across  simply mountains flying loose in space .  even though they were much closer to mars than the moon was to earth  they would show no disk and be only two more stars .    he searched for them  even though he realized they might easily both be on the other side of mars .  low on the western horizon he caught something else .  slowly he turned to it .  it was by far the brightest object in the sky  with a faint blue green tinge to it that was matched for beauty by nothing else in the heavens he watched .  separated from it by about the width of mars   s shrunken sun was another object  yellower  bright in itself but dwarfed by the much greater brillance of its neighbor .    david needed no star map to identify the double object .  they were the earth and the moon  the double    evening star    of mars .    he tore his eyes away  turned toward the low out cropping of rock visible in the light of his pencil flash  and began walking .  bigman had told him to use those rocks as a guide .  it was cold in the martian night  and david was regretfully aware of the heating powers of even the martian sun  one hundred and thirty million miles away .    the sand car was invisible  or nearly so  in the weak starlight  and he heard the low  even purr of its engines long before he saw it .    he called     bigman .     and the little fellow popped out of it .       space .     said bigman .     i was beginning to think you were lost .          why is the engine running .          that   s easy .  how else do i keep from freezing to death .  we won   t be heard  though .  i know this place .              do you have the films .          do i .  listen  i don   t know what you had in the message you sent but they had five or six scholars circling me like satellites .  it was    mr .  jones this    and    mr .  jones that .     i said     my name   s bigman     i said .  and then it was    mr .  bigman  if you please .     anyway      bigman ticked items off on his fingers      before the day was gone  they had four films for me  two viewers  a box as big as myself which i haven   t opened  and the loan  or maybe the gift for all i know  of a sand car to carry it all in .       david smiled but made no answer .  he entered into the welcome warmth of the car and quickly  in a race to outrun the fleet night  adjusted the viewers for projection and inserted a film in each .  direct viewing would have been quicker  more preferable  but even in the warm interior of the sand car his nosepiece was still a necessity  and the bulbous transparent covering of his eyes made direct viewing impossible .    slowly the sand car lurched forward through the night  repeating almost exactly the route of griswold   s subsection on the day of the checkup .       i don   t get it     said bigman .  he had been muttering under his breath uselessly for fifteen minutes and now he had to repeat his louder statement twice before the brooding david would respond .       don   t get what .          what you   re doing .  where you   re going .  i figure this is my business because i   m going to stay with you from here on .  i   ve been thinking today  mr .  st    williams  thinking a lot .  mr .  makian   s been in a kind of biting temper for months now  and he wasn   t a bad joe at all before that .  hermes came in at that time  with a new shuffle for all hands .  and schoolboy benson gets his licks in all of a sudden .  before it all started he was nobody  and now he   s real pally with the big shots .  then  to top it off  you   re here  with the council of science ready to put up anything you want .  it   s something big  i know  and i want to be in on it         do you .     said david .     did you see the maps i was viewing .          sure .  just old maps of mars .  i   ve seen them a million times .          how about the ones with the crosshatched areas .  do you know what those areas stood for .          any farmboy can tell you that .  there are supposed to be caverns underneath  except that i don   t believe it .  my point is this .  how in space can anyone tell there are holes two miles underneath the ground if no one   s been down there to see .  tell me that .       david did not bother to describe the science of seismography to bigman .  instead  he said     ever hear of martians .       bigman began     sure .  what kind of a question     and then the sand car screeched and trembled as the little fellow   s hands moved convulsively on the wheels .     you mean real martians .  mars mar tians  not people martians eke us .  martians living here before people came .       his thin laugh rattled piercingly inside the car and when he caught his breath again  it is difficult to laugh and breathe at the same time with a nosepiece on   he said     you   ve been talking to that guy benson .       david remained gravely unruffled at the other   s glee .     why do you say that  bigman .          we once caught him reading some kind of book about it  and we ribbed the pants off him .  jumping asteroids  he got sore .  he called us all ignorant peasants  and i looked up the word in the dictionary and told the boys what it meant .  there was talk of mayhem for a while  and he got shoved around sort of by accident  if you know what i mean  for a while after that .  he never mentioned anything about martians to his after that  wouldn   t have had the nerve .  i guess  though  he figured you were an earthman and would fall for that kind of comet gas .          are you sure it   s comet gas .          sure .  what else can it be .  people have been on mars for hundreds and hundreds of years .  no one   s ever seen martians .          suppose they   re down in the caverns two miles underneath .          no one   s seen the caverns either .  besides  how would the martians get there in the first place .  people have been over every inch of mars and there sure aren   t staircases going down anywhere .  or elevators  either .          are you certain .  i saw one the other day .          what .     bigman looked back over his shoulder .  he said     kidding me .          it wasn   t a staircase  but it was a hole .  and it was at least two miles deep .          oh  you mean the fissure .  nuts  that doesn   t mean anything .  mars if full of fissures .          exactly  bigman .  and i   ve got detailed maps of the fissures on mars too .  right here .  there   s a funny thing about them which  as nearly as i can tell from the geography you brought me  hasn   t been noticed before .  not a single fissure crosses a single cavern .          what does that prove .          it makes sense .  if you were building airtight caverns  would you want a hole in the roof .  and there   s another coincidence .  each fissure cuts close to a cavern  but without ever touching  as though the martians used them as points of entrance into the caverns they were building .       the sand car stopped suddenly .  in the dim light of the viewers  which were still focused on two maps projected simultaneously upon the flat white surface of the built in screens  bigman   s face blinked somberly at david in the back seat .    he said     wait a minute .  wait a jumping minute .  where are we going .          to the fissure  bigman  about two miles past the place where griswold went over .  that   s where it gets nearest the cavern under the makian farms .          and once we get there .       david said calmly     once we get there  why  i   ll climb down into it .          into the fissure      are you serious .     asked bigman .       quite serious     said david .       you mean      he tried to smile      there really are martians .          would you believe me if i said there were .          no .  he came to a sudden decision .     but that doesn   t matter .  i said i wanted to be in this  and i don   t back out .     once again the car moved forward .    the feeble dawn of the martian heavens was beginning to light the grim landscape when the car approached the fissure .  it had been creeping for half an hour previous  its powerful headlights probing the darkness  lest  as bigman had put it  they find the fissure a little too quickly .    david climbed out of the car and approached the giant crack .  no light penetrated it as yet .  it was a black and ominous hole in the ground  stretching out of sight in either direction  with the opposing lip a featureless gray prominence .  he pointed his flash downward and the beam of light faded into nothing .    bigman came up behind him .     are you sure this is the right place .       david looked about him .     according to the maps  this is the closest approach to a cavern .  how far are we from the nearest farm section .          two miles easy .       the earthman nodded .  farmboys were unlikely to touch this spot except possibly during checkup .    he said     no use waiting then .       bigman said     how are you going to do it  anyway .       david had already lifted the box which bigman had obtained in wingrad city out of the car .  he tore it open and took out the contents .     ever see one of these .     he asked .    bigman shook his head .  he twiddled a piece of it between gloved thumb and forefinger .  it consisted of a pair of long ropes with a silky sheen connected at twelve inch intervals by crosspieces .       it   s a rope ladder  i suppose     he said .       yes     said david     but not rope .  this is spun silicone  lighter than magnesium  stronger than steel  and barely affected by any temperatures we   re likely to meet on mars .  mostly  it   s used on the moon  where the gravity is really  low and the mountains really high .  on mars  there   s not much use for it because it   s a rather flat world .  in fact  it was a stroke of luck that the council could locate one in the city .          what good will this do you .     bigman was running the length of it through his hands until the ladder ended in a thick bulb of metal .       careful     said david .     if the safety catch isn   t on  you can damage yourself pretty badly .      .    he took it gently out of bigman   s hand  encircled the metal bulb with his own strong hands  and twisted each hand in opposing directions .  there was a sharp little click  but when he released his hold  the bulb seemed unchanged .       now look .     the soil of mars thinned and vanished at the approaches of the fissure  and the cliff edge was naked rock .  david bent and  with a light pressure  touched the bulb end of the ladder to the crag  faintly ruddy in the flushing sky of morning .  he took his hand away  and it remained there  balanced at an odd angle .       lift it up     he said .   .    bigman looked at him  bent  and lifted .  for a moment he looked puzzled as the bulb remained where it was  then he yanked with all his might and still nothing happened .    he looked up angrily .     what did you do .       david smiled .     when the safety is released  any pressure at the tip of the bulb releases a thin force field about twelve inches long that cuts right into the rock .  the end of the field then expands outward in each direction about six inches  to make a    t    of force .  the limits of the field are blunt  not sharp  so you can   t loosen it by yanking it from side to side .  the only way you can pull out the bulb is to break the rock clean off .          how do you release it .       david ran the hundred foot length of ladder through his hands and came up with a similar bulb at the other end .  he twisted it  then pushed it at the rock .  it remained there  and after some fifteen seconds the first bulb fell on its side .       if you activate one bulb     he said     the other is automatically deactivated .  or  of course  if you adjust the safety catch of an activated bulb      he bent down and did so      it is deactivated      he lifted it up      and the other remains unaffected .       bigman squatted .  where the two bulbs had been there were now narrow cuts about four inches long in the living rock .  they were too narrow for him to insert his fingernail .    david star was speaking .  he said     i   ve got water and food for a week .  i   m afraid my oxygen won   t last more than two days  but you wait a week anyway .  if i   m not back then  this is the letter you   re to deliver to the council headquarters .          hold on .  you don   t really think these fairy tale martians          i mean lots of things .  i mean i may slip .  the rope ladder may be faulty .  i may accidentally anchor it to a point at which there is a fault in the rock .  anything .  so can i rely on you .       bigman looked disappointed .     but that   s a fine situation .  am i supposed to sit around up here while you take all the risks .          it   s the way a team works  bigman .  you know that .       he was stooping at the lip of the fissure .  the sun was edging over the horizon before them and the sky had faded from black to purple .  the fissure  however  remained a forbidding dusky abyss .  the sparse atmosphere of mars did not scatter light very well  and only when the sun was directly overhead was the eternal night of the fissure dispelled .    stolidly david tossed the ladder into the fissure .  its fiber made no noise as it swung against the rock  upheld by the knob which held tightly to the stony lip .  a hundred feet below they could hear the other knob thump once or twice .    david yanked at the rope to test its hold  then  seizing the topmost rung with his hands  he vaulted into the abyss himself .  it was a feathery feeling floating down at less than half the speed one would have on earth  but there it ended .  his actual weight was not far below earth normal  considering the two oxygen cylinders he carried  each the largest size available at the farm .    his head projected above surface .  bigman was staring at him  wide eyed .  david said     now get away and take the car with you .  return the films and viewers to the council and leave the scooter .          right     said bigman .  all cars carried emergency four wheeled platforms that could travel fifty miles under their own power .  they were uncomfortable and no protection at all against cold or  worse still  against dust storhis .  still  when a sand car broke down miles from home  scooters were better than waiting to be found .    david starr looked downward .  it was too dark to see the end of the ladder  the sheen of which glimmered into grayness .  allowing his legs to dangle free  he scrambled down the face of the cliff rung by rung  counting as he did so .  at the eightieth rung he reached for the free end of the ladder and reeled it in after hooking an arm about and through a rung  leaving both hands free .    when the lower bulb was in his hand  he reached to the right and thrust it at the face of the cliff .  it remained there .  he yanked hard at it  and it held .  quickly he swung himself from his previous position to the branch of the rope ladder now dangling from the new anchor .  one hand remained on the portion of the ladder he had left  waiting for it to give .  when it did so  he swung it outward  so that the bulb from above would swing wide of himself as it fell .    he felt a slight pendulum effect upon himself as the bulb  which had been at the lip of the fissure thirty seconds before  now lashed back and forth some one hundred and eighty feet below the surface of mars .  he looked up .  there was a broad swath of purple sky to be seen  but he knew it would get narrower with each rung he descended .    down he went  and at every eighty rungs he set himself a new anchor  first to the right of the old one and then to the left  maintaining in general a straight passage downward .    six hours had passed  and once again david paused for a bite of concentrated ration and a swig of water from his canteen .  catching his feet in rungs and relaxing the pressure on his arms was all he could do in the way of resting .  nowhere in all the descent had there been a horizontal ledge large enough for him to catch his breath upon .  at least nowhere within the reach of his flashlight .    that was bad in other ways .  it meant that the trip upward  supposing that there ever was to be a trip upward  would have to be made by the slow method of jabbing each bulb  in turn  at a spot as high as one could reach .  it could be done and had been   on the moon .  on mars the gravity was more than twice what it was on the moon  and progress would be horribly slow  far slower than the journey down was .  and that  david realized grimly  was slow enough .  he could not be much more than a mile below surface .    downward there was only black .  above  the now narrow streak of sky had brightened .  david decided to wait .  it was past eleven by his earth time watch  and that had fair significance on mars  where the period of rotation was only half an hour longer than on earth .  the sun would soon be overhead .    he thought soberly that the maps of the martian caverns were at best only rough approximations from the action of vibration waves under the planet   s surface .  with very slight errors existing he could be miles away from the true entrance into the caverns .    and then  too  there might be no entrances at all .  the caverns might be purely natural phenomena  like the carlsbad caverns on earth .  except  of course  that these martian caverns were hundreds of miles across .    he waited  almost drowsily  hanging loosely over nothing  in darkness and silence .  he flexed his numbed fingers .  even under the gloves  the martian cold nipped .  when he was descending  the activity kept him warm  when he waited  the cold burrowed in .    he had almost decided to renew his climbing to keep from freezing when he caught the first  approach of dim light .  he looked up and saw the slowly descending dim yellow of sunlight .  over the lip of the fissure  into the small streak of sky that remained to his vision  the sun came .  it took ten minutes for the light to increase to maximum  when the entire burning globe had become visible .  small though it was to an earthman   s eyes  its width was one quarter that of the fissure opening .  david knew the light would last half an hour or less and that the darkness would return for twenty four hours thereafter .    he looked about rapidly  swinging as he did so .  the wall of the fissure was by no means straight .  it was jagged  but it was everywhere vertical .  it was as though a cut had been made into the martian soil with a badly crimped knife  but one which cut straight down .  the opposite wall was considerably closer than it had been at the surface  but david estimated that there would be at least another mile or two of descent before it would be close enough to touch .    still  it all amounted to nothing .  nothing .    and then he saw the patch of blackness .  david   s breath whistled sharply .  there was considerable blackness elsewhere .  wherever an outcropping of rock cast a shadow  there was blackness .  it was just that this particular patch was rectangular .  it had perfect  or what seemed to be perfect  right angles .  it had to be artificial .  it was like a door of some sort set into the rock .    quickly he caught up the lower knob of the ladder  set it as far out in the direction of the patch as he could reach  gathered in the other knob as it fell  and set it still farther out in the same direction .  he alternated them as rapidly as he could  hoping savagely that the sun would hold out  that the patch itself was not  somehow  an illusion .    the sun had crossed the fissure and now touched the lip of the wall from which he dangled .  the rock he faced  which had been yellow red  turned gray again .  but there was still light upon the other wall  and he could see well enough .  he was less than a hundred feet away  and each alternation of ladder knobs brought him a yard closer .    glimmering  the sunlight traveled up the opposite wall  and the dusk was closing in when he reached the edge of the patch .  his gloved ringers closed upon the edge of a cavity set into the rock .  it was smooth  the line had neither fault nor flaw .  it had to be made by intelligence .    he needed sunlight no longer .  the small beam of the flashlight would be enough .  he swung his ladder into the inset  and when he dropped a knob he felt it clunk sharply on rock beneath .  a horizontal ledge .    he descended quickly  and in a few minutes found himself standing on rock .  for the first time in more than six hours he was standing on something solid .  he found the inactive bulb  thrust it into rock at waist level  brought down the ladder  then adjusted the safety latch and pulled out the bulb .  for the first time in more than six hours both ends of the ladder were free .    david looped the ladder around his waist and arm and looked about .  the cavity in the face of the cliff was about ten feet high and six across .  with his flashlight pointing the way  he walked inward and came face to face with a smooth and quite solid stone slab that barred farther progress .    it  too  was the work of intelligence .  it had to be .  but it remained an effective barrier to further exploration just the same .    there was a sudden pain in his ears  and he spun sharply .  there could be only one explanation .  somehow the air pressure about himself was increasing .    he moved back toward the face of the cliff and was not surprised to find that the opening through which he had come was barred by rock which had not previously been there .  it had slid into place without a sound .    his heart beat quickly .  he was obviously in an air lock of some sort .  carefully he removed his nose piece and sampled the new air .  it felt good in his lungs  and it was warm .    he advanced to the inner slab of rock and waited confidently for it to lift up and away .    it did exactly that  but a full minute before it did so david felt his arms compressed suddenly against his body as though a steel lasso had been thrown about him and tightened .  he had time for one startled cry  and then his legs pushed one against the other under similar pressure .    and so it was that when the inner door opened and the way to enter the cavern was clear before him  david starr could move neither hand nor foot .         birth of the space ranger    david waited .  there was no use in speaking to empty air .  presumably the entities who had built the caverns and who could so ihimobilize him in so ihimaterial a fashion would be perfectly capable of playing all the cards .    he felt himself lift from the ground and slowly tip backward until the line of his body was parallel with the floor .  he tried to crane his head upward but found it to be nearly ihimovable .  the bonds were not so strong as those which had tightened about his limbs .  it was rather like a harness of velvety rubber that gave  but only so far .    he moved inward smoothly .  it was like entering warm  fragrant  breathable water .  as his head left the air lock  the last portion of his body to do so  a dreamless sleep closed over him .    david starr opened his eyes with no sensation of any passage of time but  with the sensation of life near by .  exactly what form that sensation took he could not say .  he was first conscious of the heat .  it was that of a hot summer day on earth .  second  there was the dim red light that surrounded him and that scarcely sufficed for vision .  by it he could barely make out the walls of a small room as he turned his head .  nowhere was there motion  nowhere life .    and yet somewhere near there must be the working of a powerful intelligence .  david felt that in a way he could not explain .    cautiously he tried to move a hand  and it lifted without hindrance .  wonderingly he sat upright and found himself on a surface that yielded and gave but whose nature he could not make out in the dimness .    the voice came suddenly .     the creature is aware of its surroundings  .   .   .     the last part of the statement was a jumble of meaningless sound .  david could not identify the direction from which the voice came .  it was from all directions and no direction .    a second voice sounded .  it was different  though the difference was a subtle one .  it was gentler  smoother  more feminine  somehow .     are you well  creature .       david said     i cannot see you .       the first voice  david thought of it as a man   s  sounded again .     it is then as i told  .   .   .     again the jumble .     you are not equipped to see mind .       the last phrase was blurred  but to david it sounded like    see mind .          i can see matter     he said     but there is scarcely light to see by .       there was a silence  as though the two were conferring apart  and then there was the gentle thrusting of an object into david   s hand .  it was his flashlight .       has this     came the masculine voice     any significance to you with regard to light .          why  certainly .  don   t you see .     he flashed it on and quickly splashed the light beam about himself .    the room was empty of life  and quite bare .  the surface he rested upon was transparent to light and some four feet off the floor .       it is as i said     said the feminine voice excitedly .     the creature   s sight sense is activated by short wave radiation .          but most of the radiation of the instrument is in the infrared .  it was that i judged by     protested the other .  the light was brightening even as the voice sounded  turning first orange  then yellow  and finally white .    david said     can you cool the room too .          but it has been carefully adjusted to the temperature of your body .          nevertheless  i would have it cooler .       they were co operative  at least .  a cool wind swept over david  welcome and refreshing .  he let the temperature drop to seventy before he stopped them .    david thought     i think you are cohimunicating directly with my mind .  presumably that is why i seem to hear you speaking international english .       the masculine voice said     the last phrase is a jumble  but certainly we are cohimunicating .  how else would that be done .       david nodded to himself .  that accounted for the occasional noisy blur .  when a proper name was used that had no accompanying picture for his own mind to interpret  it could only be received as a blur .  mental static .    the feminine voice said     in the early history of our race there are legends that our minds were closed to one another and that we communicated by means   of symbols for the eye and ear .  from your question i cannot help but wonder if this is the case with your own people  creature .       david said     that is so .  how long is it since i was brought into the cavern .       the masculine voice said     not quite a planetary rotation .  we apologize for any inconvenience we caused you  but it was our first opportunity to study one of the new surface creatures alive .  we have salvaged several before this  one only a short while ago  but none were functional  and the amount of information obtained from such is  of necessity  limited .       david wondered if griswold had been the recently salvaged corpse .  he said cautiously     is your examination of myself over .       the feminine voice responded quickly .     you fear harm .  there is a distinct impression in your mind that we may be so savage as to interfere with your life functions in order to gain knowledge .  how horrible .          i   m sorry if i have offended you .  it is merely that i am unacquainted with your methods .       the masculine voice said     we know all we need .  we are quite capable of making a molecule by molecule investigation of your body without the need of physical contact at all .  the evidence of our psycho mechanisms is quite sufficient .          what are these psycho mechanisms you mention .          are you acquainted with matter mind transformations .          i am afraid not      there was a pause  and then the masculine voice said curtly     i have just investigated your mind .  i am afraid  judging by its texture  that your grasp of scientific principles is insufficient for you to understand my explanations .       david felt put in his place .  he said     my apologies .       the masculine voice went on .     i would ask you some questions .          proceed  sir .          what was the last part of your statement .          it was merely a manner of honorable address .       a pause .     oh yes  i see .  you complicate your communication symbols in accordance with the person you address .  an odd custom .  but i delay .  tell me  creature  you radiate an enormous heat .  are you ill or can this be normal .          it is quite normal .  the dead bodies you examined were undoubtedly at the temperature of their environment  whatever it was .  but while functioning  our bodies maintain a constant temperature that best suits us .          then you are not natives of this planet .       david said     before i answer this question  may i ask you what your attitude would be toward creatures like myself if we originated from another planet .          i assure you that you and your fellow creatures are a matter of indifference to us except in so far as you arouse our curiosity .  i see from your mind that you are uneasy with regard to our motives .  i see that you fear our hostility .  remove such thoughts .          can you not read in my mind  then  the answer to your questions .  why do you question me specifically .          i can only read emotions and general attitudes in absence of precise communication .  but  then  you are a creature and would not understand .  for precise information  communication must involve an effort of will .  if it will help to ease your mind  i will inform you that we have every reason to believe you to be a member of a race not native to this planet .  for one thing  the composition of your tissues is utterly different from that of any living thing ever known to have existed on the face of the world .  your body heat indicates also that you come from another world  a warmer one .          you are correct .  we come from earth .          i do not understand the last word .          from the planet next nearer the sun than this one .          so .  that is most interesting .  at the time our race retired to the caverns some half a million revolutions ago we knew your planet to possess life  though probably not intelligence .  was your race intelligent then .          scarcely     said david .  one million earth years had passed since the martians had left the surface of their planet .       it is indeed interesting .  i must carry this report to  the central mind directly .  come   .          let me remain behind      .  i would like to communicate further with this creature .          as you please .       the feminine voice said     tell me of your world .     david spoke freely .  he felt a pleasant  almost delicious  languor .  suspicion departed and there was no reason he could not answer truthfully and in full .    these beings were kind and friendly .  he bubbled with information .    and then she released her hold on his mind and he stopped abruptly .  angrily he said     what have i been saying .          nothing of harm     the feminine voice assured him .     i have merely repressed the inhibitions of your mind .  it is unlawful to do so  and i would not have   dared do it if were here .  but you are only a   creature and i am so curious .  i knew that your suspicion was too deep to let you talk without a little help from me and your suspicion is so misplaced .  we would never harm you creatures as long as you do not intrude upon us .          we have already done so  have we not .     asked david .     we occupy your planet from end to end .          you are still testing me .  you mistrust me .  the surface of the planet is of no interest to us .  this is home .  and yet     the feminine voice seemed almost wistful     there must be a certain thrill in traveling from world to world .  we are well aware that there are many planets in space and many suns .  to think that creatures like yourself are inheriting all that .  it is all so interesting that i am thankful again and again that we sensed you making your cluhisy way down toward us in time to make an opening for you .          what .     david could not help but shout  although he knew that the sound waves his vocal cords created went unheeded and that only the thoughts of his mind were sensed .     you made that opening .          not i alone .  helped .  that is why we were given the chance to investigate you .          but how did you do it .           why  by willing it .          i don   t understand .          but it is simple .  can you not see it in my mind .  but i forget .  you are a creature .  you see  when we retired to the caverns we were forced to destroy many thousands of cubic miles of matter to make space for ourselves under the surface .  there was nowhere to store the matter as such  so we converted it to energy and         .          no  no  i don   t follow you .          you don   t understand .  in that case  all i can say is that the energy was stored in such a way that it could be tapped by an effort of the mind .          but if all the matter that was once in these vast caverns were converted into energy          there would be a great deal .  certainly .  we have lived on that energy for half a million revolutions  and it is calculated that we have enough for twenty million more revolutions .  even before we left the surface we had studied the relation of mind and matter and since we have come to the caverns we have perfected the science to such a degree that we have abandoned matter entirely as far as our personal use is concerned .  we are creatures of pure mind and energy  who never die and are no longer born .  i am here with you  but since you cannot sense mind  you are not aware of me except with your mind .          but surely people such as yourselves can make themselves heir to all the universe .          you fear that we shall contest the universe with poor material creatures such as yourself .  that we shall fight for a place among the stars .  that is silly .    all the universe is here with us .  we are sufficient to ourselves .       david was silent .  then slowly he put his hands to his head as he had the sensation of fine  very fine tendrils gently touching his mind .  it was the first time the feeling had come  and he shrank from its intimacy .    she said     my apologies again .  but you are such an interesting creature .  your mind tells me that your fellow creatures are in great danger and you suspect that we might be the cause .  i assure you  creature  it is not so .       she said it simply .  david had no course but to be eeve .    he said     your companion said my tissue chemistry was entirely different from that of any life on mars .  may i ask how .          it is composed of a nitrogenous material .          protein     explained david .       i do not understand that word .          what are your tissues composed of .          of  .  it is entirely different .    there is practically no nitrogen in it .          you could offer me no food  then .          i am afraid not .  says any organic matter   of our planet would be quickly poisonous to you .  we could manufacture simple compounds of your life type that you might feed on  but the complex nitrogenous material that forms the bulk of your tissue is quite beyond us without much study .  are you hungry  creature .     there was no mistaking the sympathy and concern in her thoughts .   david persisted in thinking of it as a voice .     he said     for the moment i have still my own food .       the feminine voice said     it seems unpleasant for me to think of you simply as a creature .  what is your name .     then  as though she feared she might not be understood     how do your fellow creatures identify you .          i am called david starr .          i do not understand that except that there seems a reference to the suns of the universe .  do they call you that because you are a traveler through space .          no .  many of my people travel through space .     starr    has no particular meaning at present .  it is simply a sound to identify me  as your names are simply sounds .  at least they make no picture  i cannot understand them .          what a pity .  you should have a name which would indicate your travels through space  the way in which you range from one end of the universe to the other .  if i were a creature such as yourself  it seems to me that it would be fitting i should be called    space ranger .          and so it was that from the lips of a living creature he did not see and could never see in its true form david starr heard  for the first time  the name by which  eventually  all the galaxy would know him .        the storm   a deeper  slower voice now took form in david   s mind .  it said gravely     i greet you  creature .  it is a good name has just given you .       the feminine voice said     i make way for you   by the loss of a faint touch upon his mind david became unmistakably aware that the owner of the feminine voice was no longer in mental contact .  he turned warily  laboring once more under the illusion that there was direction to these voices and finding his untried mind still attempting to interpret in the old inadequate ways something with which it had never before come in contact .  the voice came from no direction  of course .  it was within his mind .    the creature of the deep voice gauged the difficulty .  it said     you are disturbed by the failure of your sense equipment to detect me and i do not wish you to be disturbed .  i could adopt the outward physical appearance of a creature such as yourself but that would be a poor and undignified imposture .  will this suffice .       david starr watched the glimmer appear in the air before him .  it was a soft streak of blue green light about seven feet high and a foot wide .    he said calmly     that is quite sufficient .       the deep voice said     good .  and now let me explain who i am .  i am the administrator of  .  the report of the capture of a live specimen of the new surface life came to me as a matter of course .  i will examine your mind .       the office of the new being had been a jumble of sound  and nothing more  to david  but he had caught the unmistakable sense of dignity and responsibility that accompanied it .  nevertheless he said firmly     i would much prefer that you remained outside my mind .          your modesty     said the deep voice     is quite understandable and praiseworthy .  i should explain that my inspection would be confined most carefully to the outer fringes only .  i would avoid very scrupulously any intrusion on your inner privacy .       david tensed his muscles uselessly .  for long minutes there was nothing .  even the illusive feathery touch upon his mind  that had been present when the owner of the feminine voice had probed it  was absent from this new and more experienced inspection .  and yet david was aware  without knowing how he could possibly be aware  of the compartments of his mind being delicately opened  then closed  without pain or disturbance .    the deep voice said     i thank you .  you will be released very shortly and returned to the surface .       david said defiantly     what have you found in my mind .          enough to pity your fellows .  we of the inner life were once like yourselves so we have some comprehension of it .  your people are out of balance with the universe .  you have a questioning mind that seeks to understand what it dimly senses  without possessing the truer  deeper senses that alone can reveal reality to you .  in your futile seeking after the shadows that encompass you  you drive through space to the outer most limits of the galaxy .  it is as i have said      has named you well .  you are a race of space rangers indeed .       yet of what use is your ranging .  the true victory is within .  to understand the material universe  you must first become divorced from it as we are .  we have turned away from the stars and toward ourselves .  we have retreated to the caverns of our one world and abandoned our bodies .  with us there is no longer death  except when a mind would rest  or birth  except when a mind gone to rest must be replaced .       david said     yet you are not all sufficient to yourselves .  some of you suffer from curiosity .  the being who spoke to me before wished to know of earth .           is recently born .  her days are not equal to a hundred revolutions of the planet about the sun .  her control of thought patterns is imperfect .  we who are mature can easily conceive all the various designs into which your earth history could have been woven .  few of them would be comprehensible to yourself  and not in an infinity of years could we have exhausted  the thoughts possible in the consideration of your one world  and each thought would have been as fascinating and stimulating as the one thought which happens to represent reality .  in time     will learn that this is so .           yet you yourself take the trouble to examine my mind .          in order that i may make certain of that which i previously merely suspected .  your race has the capacity for growth .  under the best circuhistances a million revolutions of our planet   a moment in the life of the galaxy   may see it achieve the inner life .  that would be good .  my race would have a companion in eternity and companionship would benefit us mutually .       you say we may achieve it     said david cautiously .       your species have certain tendencies my people never had .  from your mind i can see easily that there are tendencies against the welfare of the whole .          if you speak of such things as crime and war  then see in my mind that the vast majority of humans fights the anti social tendencies and that though our progress against them is slow  it is certain .          i see that .  i see more .  i see that you yourself are eager for the welfare of the whole .  you have a strong and healthy mind  the essence of which i would not be sorry to see made into one of ours .  i would like to help you in your strivings .          how .     demanded david .       your mind is full of suspicion again .  relieve your tension .  my help would not be through personal interference in the activities of your people  i assure you .  such interference would be incomprehensible to yourselves and undignified for myself .  let me suggest instead the two inadequacies which you are most aware of in yourself .       first  since you are composed of unstable ingredients  you are a creature of no permanence .  not only will you decompose and dissolve in a few revolutions of the planet  but if before then you are subjected to any of a thousand different stresses  you will die .  secondly  you feel that you can work best in secrecy  yet not long ago a fellow creature recognized your true identity although you had pretended to a different identity altogether .  is what i have said true .       david said     it is true .  but what can you do about it .       the deep voice said     it is already done and in your hand .       and there was a soft textured something in david starr   s hand .  his fingers almost let it drop before they realized they were holding it .  it was a nearly weightless strip of well  of what .    the deep voice answered the unspoken thought placidly .     it is neither gauze  nor fiber  nor plastic  nor metal .  it is not matter at all as your mind understands matter .  it is  .  put it over your eyes .       david did as he was told  and it sprang from his hands as though it had a primitive life of its own  folding softly and warmly against every fold of structure of his forehead  eyes  and nose  yet it did not prevent him from breathing or from blinking his eyes .       what has been accomplished .     he asked .    before the words were out of his mouth there was a mirror before him  manufactured out of energy as silently and quickly as thought itself .  in it he could see himself but dimly .  his farmboy costume  from hip boots to wide lapels  appeared out of focus through a shadowy mist that changed continuously  as though it were a thin smoke that drifted yet never vanished .  from his upper lip to the top of his head all was lost in a shimmer of light that blazed without blinding and through which nothing could be seen .  as he stared  the mirror vanished  returning to the store of energy from which it had been momentarily withdrawn .    david asked wonderingly     is that how i would appear to others .          yes  if those others had only the sensory equipment you yourself have .          yet i can see perfectly .  that means that light rays enter the shield .  why may they not leave then and reveal my face .          they do leave  as you say  but they are changed in the passage and reveal only what you see in the mirror .  to explain that properly  i must use concepts lacking in your mind   s understanding .          and the rest .     david   s hands moved slowly over the smoke that encircled him .  he felt nothing .    the deep voice again answered the voiceless thought .     you feel nothing .  yet what appears to you as smoke is a barrier which is resistant to short wave radiation and impassable to material objects of larger than molecular size .          you mean it is a personal force shield .          that is a crude description  yes .       david said     great galaxy  it   s impossible .  it has been definitely proven that no force field small enough to protect a man from radiation and from material inertia can be generated by any machine capable of being carried by a man .          and so it is to any science of which your fellows        david starr  space ranger   are capable of evolving .  but the mask you wear is not a power source .  it is instead a storage device of energy which  for instance  can be derived from a few moments    exposure to a sun radiating as strongly as ours is from the distance of this planet .  it is  further  a mechanism for releasing that energy at mental demand .  since your own mind is incapable of controlling the power  it has been adjusted to the characteristics of your mind and will operate automatically as needed .  remove the mask now .       david lifted his hand to his eyes and  again responsive to his will  the mask fell away and was only a strip of gauze in his hand .    the deep voice spoke for a last time .     and now you must leave us  space ranger .       and as gently as can be imagined  consciousness left david starr .    nor was there any transition in his return to consciousness .  it came back in its entirety .  there wasn   t even a moment   s uncertainty as to his whereabouts  none of the    where am i .     attitude .    he knew with surety that he was standing on his good two legs upon the surface of mars  that he was wearing the nosepiece again and breathing through it  that behind him was the exact place at the lip of the fissure where he had thrust the rope ladder   s anchor for the beginning of the descent  that to his left  half hidden among the rocks  was the scooter which bigman had left behind .    he even knew the exact manner in which he had been returned to the surface .  it was not memory  it was information deliberately inserted in his mind  probably as a final device to impress him with the power of the martians over matter energy fntercon versions .  they had dissolved a runnel to the surface for him .  they had lifted him against gravity at almost rocket speed  turning the solid rock to energy before him and congealing the energy to rock once more behind him  until he was standing on the planet   s outer skin once more .    there were even words in his mind that he had never consciously heard .  they were in the feminine voice of the caverns  and the words were simply these     have no fear  space ranger .       he stepped forward and was aware that the warm  earth like surroundings that had been prepared for him in the cavern below no longer existed .  he felt the cold the more for the contrast and the wind was stronger than any he had felt yet on mars .  the sun was low in the east as it had been when he first descended the fissure .  was that the previous dawn .  he had no way of judging the passage of time during his unconscious intervals  but he felt certain his descent had not been more than two dawns before anyway .    there was a difference to the sky .  it seemed bluer and the sun was redder .  david frowned thoughtfully for a moment  then shrugged .  he was becoming accustomed to the martian landscape  that was all .  it was beginning to seem more familiar and  through habit  he was interpreting it in the old earthly patterns .    meanwhile it would be better to begin the return to the farm dome immediately .  the scooter was by no means so quick as a sand car nor as comfortable .  the less time spent on it the better .    he took approximate sightings among the rock formations and felt like an old hand because of it .  the farmboys found their way across what seemed trackless desert by just this method .  they would sight along a rock that    looked like a watermelon on a hat     proceed in that direction until level with one that    looked like a spaceship with two off center jets    and head between it and a farther rock that    looked like a box with its top stove in .     it was a crude method but it required no instruments other than a retentive memory and a picturesque imagination  and the farmboys had those in plenty .    david was following the route bigman had recohimended for speediest return with the least chance of going wrong among the less spectacular formations .  the scooter jounced along  leaping crazily when it struck ridges and kicking up the dust when it turned  david rode with it  digging his heels firmly into the sockets provided for them and holding a metal steering leash tightly in each hand .  he made no effort to cut his speed .  even if the vehicle turned over  there would be little chance for much harm to himself under martian gravity .    it was another consideration that stopped him  the queer taste in his mouth and the itch along the side of his jawbone and down the line of his backbone .  there was a faint grittiness in his mouth  and he looked back with distaste at the plume of dust that jetted out behind him like rocket exhaust .  strange that it should work its way forward and around him to fill his mouth as it did .    forward and around .  great galaxy .  the thought that came to him at that moment clamped a cold  stifling hand upon his heart and throat .    he slowed the scooter and headed for a rocky ridge where it could stir up no dust .  there he stopped it and waited for the air to grow clear .  but it didn   t .  his tongue worked about  tasting the inside of his mouth and shrinking from the increasing roughness that came of fine grit .  he looked at the redder sun and bluer sky with new understanding .  it was the general dust in the air that was scattering more light  taking the blue from the sun and adding it to the sky in general .  his lips were growing dry and the itching was spreading .    there was no longer doubt about it  and with a grim intensity of purpose he flung himself upon his scooter and dashed at top speed across the rocks  gravel  and dust .    dust .    dust .    even on earth men knew intimately of  the martian dust storm  which resembled only in sound the sandstorm of the earthly deserts .  it was the deadliest storm known to the inhabited solar system .  no man  caught as david starr was now  without a sand car as protection  miles from the nearest shelter  had ever  in all the history of mars  survived a dust storm .  men had rolled in death throes within fifty feet of a dome  unable to make the distance while observers within neither dared nor could sally to the rescue without a sand car .    david starr knew that only minutes separated him from the same agonizing death .  already the dust was creeping remorselessly between his nosepiece and the skin of his face .  he could feel it in his watering  blinking eyes .        the missing piece   the nature of the martian dust storm is not well understood .  like earth   s moon  the surface of mars is  to a large extent  covered by fine dust .  unlike the moon  mars possesses an atmosphere capable of stirring up that dust .  usually this is not a serious matter .  the martian atmosphere is thin and winds are not long sustained .    but occasionally  for reasons unknown  though possibly connected with electron bombardments from space  the dust becomes electrically charged and each particle repels its neighbors .  even without wind they would tend to lift upward .  each step would raise a cloud that would refuse to settle  but would drift and wisp out through the air .    when to this a wind is added  a fully developed dust storm might be said to exist .  the dust is never thick enough to obscure vision  that isn   t its danger .  it is rather the pervasiveness of the dust that kills .    the dust particles are extremely fine and penetrate everywhere .  clothes cannot keep them out  the shelter of a rocky ledge means nothing  even the nosepiece with its broad gasket fitting against the face is helpless to prevent the individual particle from working its way through .    at the height of a storm two minutes would suffice to arouse an unbearable itching  five minutes would virtually blind a man  and fifteen minutes would kill him .  even a mild storm  so gentle that it may not even be noticed by the people exposed  is sufficient to redden exposed skin in what are called dust burns .    david starr knew all this and more .  he knew that his own skin was reddening .  he was coughing without its having any effect on clearing his caking throat .  he had tried clamping his mouth shut  blowing his breath out during exhalations through the smallest opening he could manage .  it didn   t help .  the dust crept in  working its way past his lips .  the scooter was jerking irregularly now as the dust did to its motor what it was doing to david .    his eyes were swollen nearly closed now .  the tears that streamed out were accumulating against the gasket at the bottom of the nosepiece and were  fogging the eyepieces  through which he could see nothing anyway .    nothing could stop those tiny dust particles but the elaborately machined seahis of a dome or a sand car .  nothing .    nothing .    through the maddening itch and the racking cough he was thinking desperately of the martians .  would they have known that a dust storm was brewing .  could they have .  would they have sent him to the surface if they had known .  from his mind they must have gleaned the information that he had only a scooter to carry him back to the dome .  they might have as easily transported him to the surface just outside the farm dome  or  for that matter  even inside the dome .    they must have known conditions were right for a dust storm .  he remembered how the being with the deep voice had been so abrupt in his decision to return david to the surface  as though he hurried in order that time might be allowed for david to be caught in the storm .    and yet the last words of the feminine voice  the words he had not consciously heard and which  therefore  he was certain had been inserted in his mind while he was being borne through rock to the surface  were     have no fear  space ranger .       even as he thought all this he knew the answer .  one hand was fumbling in his pocket  the other at his nosepiece .  as the nosepiece lifted off  the partially protected nose and eyes received a fresh surge of dust  burning and irritating   he had the irresistible desire to sneeze  but fought it back .  the involuntary intake of breath would fill his lungs with quantities of the dust .  that in itself might be fatal .    but he was bringing up the strip of gauze he had taken from his pocket  letting it wrap about his eyes and nose  and then over it he slapped the nosepiece again .    only then did he sneeze .  it meant he drew in vast quantities of mars   s useless atmospheric gases  but no dust was coming .  he followed that by force breathing  gasping in as much oxygen as he could and puffing it out  flinging the dust of his mouth away  alternating that with deliberate inhalations through the mouth to prevent any oncoming of oxygen drunkenness .    gradually  as the tears washed the dust out of his eyes and no new dust entered  he found he could see again .  his limbs and body were obscured by the smokiness of the force shield that surrounded him  .  and he knew the upper part of his head to be invisible in the glow of his mask .    air molecules could penetrate the shield freely  but  small though they were  the dust particles were large enough to be stopped .  david could see the process with the naked eye .  as each dust particle struck the shield  it was halted and the energy of its motion converted into light  so that at its point of attempted penetration a tiny sparkle showed .  david found his body an ocean of such sparkles crowding one another  all the brighter as the martian sun  red and smokily dim through the dust  allowed the ground below to remain in semi darkness .    david slapped and brushed at his clothing .  dust clouds arose  too fine to see even if the cloudiness of the shield had not prevented sight in any case .  the dust left but could not return .  gradually he became almost clear of the particles .  he looked dubiously at the scooter and attempted to start its motor .  he was rewarded only by a short  grating noise and then silence .  it was to be expected .  unlike the sand cars  scooters did not  could not  have enclosed motors .    he would have to walk .  the thought was not a particularly frightening one .  the farm dome was little more than two miles away and he had plenty of oxygen .  his cylinders were full .  the martians had seen to that before sending him back .    he thought he understood them now .  they did know the dust storm was coming .  they might even have helped it along .  it would be strange if  with their long experience with martian weather and their advanced science  they had not learned the fundamental causes and mechanisms of dust storhis .  but in sending him out to face the storm  they knew he had the perfect defense in his pocket .  they had not warned him of either the ordeal that awaited him or of the defense he carried .  it made sense .  if he were the man who deserved the gift of the force shield  he would  or should  think of it himself .  if he did not  he was the wrong man for the job .    david smiled grimly even as he winced at the touch of his clothing against inflamed skin as he stretched his legs across the martian terrain .  the martians were coldly unemotional in risking his life  but he could almost sympathize with them .  he had thought quickly enough to save himself  but he denied himself any pride in that .  he should have thought of the mask much sooner .    the force shield that surrounded him was making it easier to travel .  he noted that the shield covered the soles of his boots so that they never made contact with the martian surface but came to rest some quarter inch above it .  the repulsion between himself and the planet was an elastic one  as though he were on many steel springs .  that  combined with the low gravity  enabled him to devour the distance between himself and the dome in swinging giant strides .    he was in a hurry .  more than anything else at the moment he felt the need of a hot bath .    by the time david reached one of the outer locks of the farm dome the worst of the storm was over and the light flashes on his force shield had thinnedto occasional sparks .  it was safe to remove the mask from his eyes .    when the locks had opened for him  there were first of all stares  and then cries  as the farmboys on duty swarmed about him .       jumping jupiter  it   s williams .          where   ve you been  boy .          what happened .       and above the confused cries and simultaneous questioning there came the shrill cry     how did you get through the dust storm .       the question penetrated  and there was a short silence .    someone said     look at his face .  it   s like a peeled tomato .       that was an exaggeration  but there was enough truth to it to impress all who were there .  hands were yanking at his collar which had been tightly bound about his neck in the fight against the martian cold .  they shuffled him into a seat and put in a call for hennes .    hennes arrived in ten minutes  hopping off a scooter and approaching with a look that was compounded of annoyance and anger .  there were no visible signs of any relief at the safe return of a man in his employ .    he barked     what   s this all about  williams .       david lifted his eyes and said coolly     i was lost .          oh  is that what you call it .  gone for two days and you were just lost .  how did you manage it .          i thought i   d take a walk and i walked too far .          you thought you needed a breath of air  so you   ve been walking through two martian nights .  do you expect me to believe that .          are any sand cars missing .       one of the farmboys interposed hastily as hennes reddened further .     he   s knocked out  mr .  hennes .  he was out in the dust storm .       hennes said     don   t be a fool .  if he were out in the dust storm  he wouldn   t be sitting here alive .          well  i know     the farmboy said     but look at him .       hennes looked at him .  the redness of his exposed neck and shoulders was a fact that could not be easily argued away .    he said     were you in the storm .          i   m afraid so     said david .       how did you get through .          there was a man     said david .     a man in smoke and light .  the dust didn   t bother him .  he called himself the space ranger .       the men were gathering close .  hennes turned on them furiously  his plump face working .       get the space out of here .     he yelled .     back to your work .  and you  jonnitel  get a sand car out here .       it was nearly an hour before the hot bath he craved was allowed david .  hennes permitted no one else to approach him .  over and over again  as he paced the floor of his private office  he would stop in midstride  whirl in sudden fury  and demand of david     what about this space ranger .  where did you meet him .  what did he say .  what did he do .  what   s this smoke and light you speak of .       to all of wliich david would only shake his head slightly and say     i took a walk .  i got lost .  a man calling himself the space ranger brought me back .       hennes gave up eventually .  the dome doctor took charge .  david got his hot bath .  his body was anointed with creahis and injected with the proper hormones .  he could not avoid the injection of soporite as well .  he was asleep almost before the needle was withdrawn .    he woke to find himself between clean  cool sheets in the sick bay .  the reddening of the skin had subsided considerably .  they would be at him again  he knew  but he would have to fight them off but a little while longer .    he was sure he had the answer to the food poisoning mystery now  almost the whole answer .  he needed only a missing piece or two  and  of course  legal proof .    he heard the light footstep beyond the head of his bed and stiffened slightly .  was it going to begin again so soon .  but it was only benson who moved into his line of vision .  benson  with his plump lips pursed  his thin hair in disarray  his whole face a picture of worry .  he carried something that looked like an old fashioned cluhisy gun .    he said     williams  are you awake .       david said     you see i am .       benson passed the back of his hand across a perspiring forehead .     they don   t know i   m here .  i shouldn   t be  i suppose .          why not .          hennes is convinced you   re involved with this food poisoning .  he   s been raving to makian and my self about it .  he claims you   ve been out somewhere and have nothing to say about it now other than ridiculous stories .  despite anything i can do  i   m afraid you   re in terrible trouble .          despite anything you can do .  you don   t believe hennes   s theory about my complicity in all this .       benson leaned forward  and david could feel his breath warm on his face as he whispered     no  i don   t .  i don   t because i think your story is true .  that   s why i   ve come here .  i must ask you about this creature you speak of  the one you claim was covered with smoke and light .  are you sure it wasn   t a hallucination  williams .          i saw him     said david .       how do you know he was human .  did he speak english .          he didn   t speak  but he was shaped like a human .     david   s eyes fastened upon benson .     do you think it was a martian .          ah      benson   s lips drew back in a spasmodic smile      you remember my theory .  yes  i think it was a martian .  think  man  think .  they   re coming out in the open now and every piece of information may be vital .  we have so little time .          why so little time .     david raised himself to one elbow .       of course you don   t know what   s happened since you   ve been gone  but frankly  williams  we are all of us in despair now .     he held up the gun like affair in his hand and said bitterly     do you know what this is .          i   ve seen you with it before .           it   s my sampling harpoon  it   s my own invention .  i take it with me when i   m at the storage bins in the city .  it shoots a little hollow pellet attached to it by a metal mesh cord into a bin of  let us say  grain .  at a certain time after shooting an opening appears in the front of the pellet long enough to allow the hollow within to become packed with grain .  after that the pellet closes again .  i drag it back and empty out the random sample it has accumulated .  by varying the time after shooting in which the pellet opens  samples can be taken at various depths in the bin .       david said     that   s ingenious  but why are you carrying it now .          because i   m wondering if i oughtn   t to throw it into the disposal unit after i leave you .  it was my only weapon for fighting the poisoners .  it has done me no good so far  and can certainly do me no good in the future .          what has happened .     david seized the other   s shoulder and gripped it hard .     tell me .       benson winced at the pain .  he said     every member of the farming syndicates has received a new letter from whoever is behind the poisoning .  there   s no doubt that the letters and the poisonings are caused by the same men  or rather  entities .  the letters admit it now .          what do they say .       benson shrugged .     what difference do the details make .  what it amounts to is a demand for complete surrender on our part or the food poisoning attacks will be multiplied a thousandfold .  i believe it can and will be done  and if that happens  earth and mars  the whole system  in fact  will panic .       he rose to his feet .     i   ve told makian and hennes that i believe you  that your space ranger is the clue to the whole thing  but they won   t believe me .  hennes    think  even suspects that i   m in it with you .       he seemed absorbed in his own wrongs .  david said     how long do we have benson .          two days .  no  that was yesterday .  we have thirty six hours now .       thirty six hours .    david would have to work quickly .  very quickly .  but maybe there would yet be time .  without knowing it benson had given him the missing piece to the mystery .        the council takes over   benson left some ten minutes later .  nothing that david told him satisfied him with regard to his theories connecting martians and poisoning  and his uneasiness grew rapidly .    he said     i don   t want hennes catching me .  we   ve had   words .          what about makian .  he   s on our side  isn   t he .          i don   t know .  he stands to be ruined by day after tomorrow .  i don   t think he has enough spine left to stand up to the fellow .  look  i   d better go .  if you think of anything  anything at all  get it to me somehow  will you .       he held out a hand .  david took it briefly  and then benson was gone .    david sat up in bed .  his own uneasiness had grown since he had awakened .  his clothes were thrown over a chair at the other end of the room .  his boots stood upright by the side of the bed .  he had not dared inspect them in benson   s presence  had scarcely dared look at them .    perhaps  he thought pessimistically  they had not tampered with them .  a farmboy   s hip boots are inviolate .  stealing from a farmboy   s hip boots  next to stealing his sand car in the open desert  was the unforgivable crime .  even in death  a farmboy   s boots were buried with him  with the contents unremoved .    david groped inside the inner pocket of each boot in turn  and his fingers met nothingness .  there had been a handkerchief in one  a few odd coins in the other .  undoubtedly they had gone through his clothing  he had expected that .  but apparently they had not drawn the line at his boots .  he held his breath as his arm dived into the recesses of one boot .  the soft leather reached to his armpit and crumpled down as his fingers stretched out to the toes .  a surge of pure gladness filled him as he felt the soft gauze like material of the martian mask .    he had hidden it there on general principles before the bath  but he had not anticipated the soporite .  it was luck  purely  that they had not searched the toes of his boots .  he would have to be more careful henceforward .    he put the mask into a boot pocket and clipped it shut .  he picked up the boots  they had been polished while he slept  which was good of someone  and showed the almost instinctive respect which the farm boy had for boots  anyone   s boots .    his clothes had been put through the refresher spray as well .  the shining plastic fibers of which they were composed had a brand new smell about them .  the pockets were all empty  of course  but underneath the chair all the contents were in a careless heap .  he sorted them out .  nothing seemed to be missing .  even the handkerchief and coins from his boot pockets were there .    he put on underclothes and socks  the one piece overall  and then the boots .  he was buckling his belt when a brown bearded farmboy stepped in .    david looked up .  he said coldly     what do you want  zukis .       the farmboy said     where do you think you   re going  earthie .     his little eyes were glaring viciously  and to david the other   s expression was much the same as it had been the first day he had laid eyes on him .  david could recall hennes   s sand car outside the farm employment office  himself just settling into the seat  and the bearded angry face glowering at him  while a weapon fired before he could move to defend himself .       nowhere     said david     that i need ask your permission .          that so .  you   re wrong  mister  because you   re staying right here .  hennes   s orders .     zukis blocked the door with his body .  two blasters were conspicuously displayed at either side of his drooping belt .    zukis waited .  then  his greasy beard splitting in two as he smiled yellowly  he said     think maybe you   ve changed your mind  earthie .          maybe     said david .  he added     someone got in to see me just now .  how come .  weren   t you watching .          shut up     snarled zukis .       or were you paid off to look the other way for a while .  hennes might not like that .       zukis spat  missing david   s boots by half an inch .    david said     you want to toss out your blasters and try that again .       zukis said     just watch out if you want any feeding  earthie .       he closed and locked the door behind him as he left .  a few minutes passed and there was the sound of clattering metal against it as it opened again .  zukis carried a tray .  there was the yellow of squash on it and the green of something leafy .       vegetable salad     said zukis .     good enough for you .       a blackened thumb showed over one end of the tray .  the other end balanced upon the back of his wrist so that the farmboy   s hand was not visible .    david straightened  leaping to one side  bending his legs under him and bringing them down upon the mattress of the bed .  zukis  caught by surprise  turned in alarm  but david  using the springs of the mattress as extra leverage  launched into the air .    he collided heavily with the farmboy  brought down one hand flatly on the tray  ripping it out of the other   s grasp and hurling it to the ground while twining his other hand in the farmboy   s beard .    zukis dropped  yelling hoarsely .  david   s booted foot came down on the farmboy   s hand  the one that had been hidden under the tray .  the other   s yell became an agonized scream as the smashed fingers flew open  releasing the cocked blaster they had been holding .    david   s hand whipped away from the beard and caught the other   s unharmed wrist as it groped for the second blaster .  he brought it up roughly  across the prone chest  under the head and out again .  he pulled .       quiet     he said     or i   ll tear your arm loose from its socket .       zukis subsided  his eyes rolling  his breath puffing out wetly .  he said     what are you after .          why were you hiding the blaster under the tray .          i had to protect myself  didn   t i .  in case you jumped me while my hands were full of tray .          then why didn   t you send someone else with the tray and cover him .          i didn   t think of that     whined zukis .    david tightened pressure a bit and zukis   s mouth twisted in agony .     suppose you tell the truth  zukis .          i   i was going to kill you .          and what would you have told makian .              you were   trying to escape .          was that your own idea .          no .  it was hennes   s .  get hennes .  i   m just following orders .       david released him .  he picked up one blaster and flicked the other out of its holster .     get up .       zukis rolled over on one side .  he groaned as he tried to lift his weight on a mashed right hand and nearly torn left shoulder .       what are you going to do .  you wouldn   t shoot an unarmed man  would you .          wouldn   t you .     asked david .    a new voice broke in .     drop those guns  williams     it said crisply .    david moved his head quickly .  hennes was in the doorway  blaster leveled .  behind him was makian  face gray and etched with lines .  hennes   s eyes showed his intentions plainly enough and his blaster was ready .    david dropped the blasters he had just torn from zukis .        kick them over     said hermes .    david did so .       now .  what happened .       david said     you know what happened .  zukis tried a little assassination at your orders and i didn   t sit still and take it .       zukis was gabbling .     no  sir  mr .  hennes .  no  sir .  it was no such thing .  i was bringing in his lunch when he jumped me .  my hands were full of tray  i had no chance to defend myself .          shut up     said hennes contemptuously .     we   ll have a talk about that later .  get out of here and be back with a couple of pinions in less than no time .       zukis scrambled out .    makian said mildly     why the pinions  hennes .          because this man is a dangerous impostor  mr .  makian .  you remember i brought him in because he seemed to know something about the food poisoning .          yes .  yes  of course .          he told us a story about a younger sister being poisoned by martian jam  remember .  i checked on that .  there haven   t been too many deaths by poisoning that have reached the authorities the way this man claimed his sister   s death had .  less than two hundred and fifty  in fact .  it was easy to check them all and i had that done .  none on record involved a twelve year old girl  with a brother of williams    age  who died over a jar of jam .       makian was startled .     how long have you known this  hennes .          almost since he came here .  but i let it go .  i wanted to see what he was after .  i set griswold to watching him          to trying to kill me  you mean     interrupted david .       yes  you would say that  considering that you killed him because he was fool enough to let you suspect him .     he turned back to makian .     then he managed to wiggle himself in with that soft headed sap  benson  where he could keep close check on our progress in investigating the poisoning .  then  as the last straw  he slipped out of the dome three nights ago for a reason he won   t explain .  you want to know why .  he was reporting to the men who hired him   the ones who are behind all this .  it   s more than just a coincidence that the ultimatum came while he was gone .          and where were you .     demanded david suddenly .     did you stop keeping tabs on me after griswold died .  if you knew i was gone on the kind of deal you suspected  why wasn   t a party sent out after me .       makian looked puzzled  and began     well       but david interrupted .     let me finish  mr .  makian .  i think that maybe hennes wasn   t in the dome the night i left and even the day and night after i left .  where were you  hennes .       hennes stepped forward  his mouth twisting .  david   s cupped hand was near his face .  he did not believe hennes would shoot  but he was ready to use the shield mask if he had to .    makian placed a nervous hand on hennes   s shoulder .     i suggest we leave him for the council .       david said quickly     what is this about the council .          none of your business     snarled hennes .    zukis was back with the pinions .  they were flexible plastic rods that could be bent in any way and then frozen in position .  they were infinitely stronger than ropes or even metal handcuffs .       hold out your hands     ordered hennes .    david did so without a word .  the pinion was wrapped twice about his wrists .  zukis  leering  drew them savagely tight then drew out the pin  which action resulted in an automatic molecular rearrangement that hardened the plastic .  the energy developed in that rearrangement made the plastic warm to the touch .  another pinion went about david   s ankles .    david sat quietly down upon the bed .  in one hand he still had the shield mask .  makian   s remark about the council was proof enough to david that he would not remain pinioned long .  meanwhile he was content to allow matters to develop further .    he said again     what   s this about the council .       but he need not have asked .  there was a yell from outside  and a catapulting figure hurled itself through the door with the cry of     where   s williams .       it was bigman himself  as large as life  which wasn   t very large .  he was paying no attention to anything but david   s seated figure .  he was speaking rapidly and breathlessly .     i didn   t hear you were through a dust storm till i landed inside the dome .  sizzling ceres  you must have been fried .  how did you get through it .  i i     he noticed david   s position for the first time  and turned furiously .     who in space has the boy tied up like this .       hennes had caught his breath by now .  one of his hands shot out and caught bigman   s overall collar in a brutal grip that lifted his slight body    off the floor .        i told you what would happen  slug  if i caught you here again .       bigman yelled     let go  you pulp mouth jerk .  i   ve got a right in here .  i give you a second and a half to let me go or you   ll answer to the council of science .       makian said     for mars    sake  hennes  let him go .       hennes let him drop .     get out of here .          not on your life .  i   m an accredited employee of the council .  i came here with dr .  silvers .  ask him .       he nodded at the tall  thin man just outside the door .  his name suited him .  his hair was silver white and he had a mustache of the same shade .       if you   ll pardon me     said dr .  silvers     i would like to take charge of matters .  the government at international city on earth has declared a state of system emergency and all the farms will be under the control of the council of science henceforward .  i have been assigned to take over the makian farms .          i expected something like this     muttered makian unhappily .       remove this man   s pinions     ordered dr .  silvers .    hennes said     he   s dangerous .          i will take full responsibility .       bigman jumped and clicked his heels .     on your way  hennes .       hennes paled in anger  but no words came .    three hours had passed when dr .  silvers met makian and hennes again in makian   s private quarters .    he said     i   ll want to go over all the production records of this farm for the last six months .  i will have to see your dr .  benson with regard to whatever advances he has made in connection with solving this food poisoning problem .  we have six weeks to break this matter .  no more .       six weeks     exploded hennes .     you mean one day .          no  sir .  if we haven   t the answer by the time the ultimatum expires  all exports of food from mars will be stopped .  we will not give in while a single chance remains .          by space     said hennes .     earth will starve .          not for six weeks     said dr .  silvers .     food supplies will last that long  with rationing .          there   ll be panic and rioting     said hennes .       true     said dr .  silvers grimly .     it will be most unpleasant .          you   ll ruin the farm syndicates     groaned makian .       it will be ruined anyway .  now  i intend to see dr .  benson this evening .  we will have a four way conference tomorrow at noon .  tomorrow midnight  if nothing breaks anywhere on mars or at the moon   s central laboratories  the embargo goes into effect and arrangements will be made for an all mars conference of the various syndicate members .          why .     asked hennes      because     said dr .  silvers     there is reason to think that whoever is behind this mad crime must be connected with the farms closely .  they know too much about the farms for any other conclusion to be arrived at .          what about williams .          i   ve questioned him .  he sticks to his story  which is  i   ll admit  queer enough .  i   ve sent him to the city  where he   ll be questioned further  under hypnosis  if necessary .       the door signal flashed .    dr .  silvers said     open the door  mr .  makian .       makian did so  as though he were not owner of one of the largest farms on mars and  by virtue of that fact  one of the richest and most powerful men in the solar system .    bigman stepped in .  he looked at hermes challengingly .  he said     williams is on a sand car heading back for the city under guard .          good     said dr .  silvers  his thin lips set tightly .    a mile outside the farm dome the sand car stopped .  david starr  nosepiece in place  stepped out .  he waved to the driver  who leaned out and said     remember .  lock   .  we   ll have one of our men there to let you in .       david smiled and nodded .  he watched the sand car continue its trip toward the city and then turned back on foot to the farm dome .    the men of the council co operated  of course .  they had helped him in his desire to leave openly and to return secretly  but none of them  not even dr .  silvers  knew the purpose of his request .    he had the pieces to the puzzle  but he still needed the proof .           i am the space ranger .       hennes entered his bedroom in a haze compounded equally of weariness and anger .  the weariness was simple .  it was nearing   a . m .  he had not had too much rest the last two nights or  for that matter  much relief of tension in the last six months .  yet he had felt it necessary to sit through the session this dr .  silvers of the council had had with benson .    dr .  silvers had not liked that  and that accounted for one bit of the anger that drenched and drowned him .  dr .  silvers .  an old incompetent who came bustling down from the city thinking he could get to the bottom of the trouble in a day and a night when all the science of earth and mars had been exerting itself for months to no avail .  and hennes was angry at makian as well for becoming as limp as well oiled boots and nothing more than the simple lackey of the white headed fool .  makian .  two decades ago he had been almost a legend as the toughest owner of the toughest farm on mars .    there was benson  too  and his interference with hennes   s plans for settling the interfering greenhorn  this williams  in the quickest and easiest way .  and griswold and zukis  who were too stupid to carry through the necessary steps that would have won over the weakness of makian and the sentimentality of benson .    he pondered briefly the advisability of a soporite pill .  on this night he wanted rest for the necessary keenness of the next day and yet his anger might keep sleep away .    he shook his head .  no .  he could not risk drugged helplessness in the event of some crucial turn of events in the night .    he compromised by throwing the toggle switch that magnetically bound the door in place .  he even tested the door briefly to make sure the electromagnetic circuits worked .  personal doors  in the totally masculine and informal life of a farm dome  were so frequently locked that it was not uncommon to have insulation wear through  wires fall loose  without anyone being the wiser over the years .  his own door had not been locked  to his knowledge  since he had first taken the job .    the circuit was in order .  the door did not even tremble as he pulled at it .  so much for that .    he sighed heavily  sat down upon the bed  and removed his boots  first one  then the other .  he rubbed his ieet wearily  sighed again  then stiffened  stiffened so suddenly that he shot off the bed without really being aware of moving .    his stare was one of complete bewilderment .  i couldn   t be .  it couldn   t be .  it would mean that william   s foolish story was true .  it would mean that benson   s ridiculous mournings about martians might  after all  turn out to be no  he refused to believe that .  it would be easier to believe that his lack sleep mind was having a private joke .    yet the dark of the room was alight with the cold blue white brilliance that carried no glare with it .  by it he could see the bed  the walls  the chair  the dresser  even his boots  standing where he had just placed them .  and he could see the man creature with only a blaze of light where a head ought to be and no distinct feature elsewhere  rather a kind of smoke instead .    he felt the wall against his back .  he had not been conscious of his retreat backward .    the object spoke  and the words were hollow and booming as though they carried an echo with them .    the object said     i am the space ranger .       hennes drew himself up .  first surprise over  he forced himself into calmness .  in a steady voice he said     what do you want .       the space ranger did not move or speak  and hennes found his eyes fastened upon the apparition .    the foreman waited  his chest pumping  and still the thing of smoke and light did not move .  it might have been a robot geared to make the one statement of identity .  for a moment hennes wondered if that might be the case  and surrendered the thought as soon as it was born .  he was standing next to the chest of drawers  and not all his wonder allowed him to forget that fact .  slowly his hand was moving .    in the light of the thing itself his motion was not invisible  but it paid no attention .  hennes   s hand was resting lightly on the surface of the bureau in a pretense of innocent gesture .  the robot  martian  man  whatever it was  hennes thought  would not know the secret of the bureau .  it had hidden in the room  waiting  but it had not searched the room .  or if it had done so  it had been a most skillful job  since even now hennes   s flicking eye could note no single abnormal thing about the room  nothing misplaced  nothing where it should not be  except for the space ranger itself .    his fingers touched a little notch in the wood .  it was a common mechanism and few farm managers on mars lacked one .  in a way it was old fashioned  as old fashioned as the imported wooden bureau itself  a tradition dating back to the lawless old days of the farming pioneers  but tradition dies hard .  the little notch moved slightly under his fingernail and a panel in the side of the chest dropped outward .  hennes was ready for it  and the hand was a blur of motion toward the blaster which the moving panel had revealed .    he held the blaster now  aimed dead center  and in all that tune the creature had not moved .  what passed for arms dangled emptily    hennes found confidence sweeping back .  robot  martian  or man  the object could not withstand a blaster .  it was a small weapon  and the projectile it hurled was almost contemptible in size .  the old fashioned    guns    of ancient days carried metal slugs that were rocks in comparison .  but the small projectile of the blaster was far more deadly .  once set in motion  anything that stopped it tripped a tiny atomic trigger that converted a sub microscopic fraction of its mass into energy  and in that conversion the object that stopped it  whether rock  metal  or human flesh  was consumed to the accompaniment of a tiny noise like the flick of a fingernail against rubber .    hennes said in a tone that borrowed menace from the blaster he held     who are you .  what do you want .       once again the object spoke  and once again it said slowly     i am the space ranger .       hennes   s lips curved in cold ferocity as he fired .    the projectile left the muzzle  raced squarely at the object of smoke  reached it  and stopped .  it stopped instantaneously  without touching the body that was still one quarter of an inch beyond its final penetration .  even the concussion of collision was not carried beyond the force shield barrier which absorbed all the projectile   s momentum  converting it into a flare of light .    that flare of light was never seen .  it was drowned out in the intense blaze that was the blaster projectile exploding into energy as it stopped with no surrounding matter to shield the blast of light .  it was as though a pin sized sun existed in the room for a tiny fraction of a second .    hennes  with a wild yell  threw his hands to his eyes as though to protect them against a physical blow .  it was too late .  minutes later  when he dared open his eyelids  his aching  burning eyes could tell him nothing .  open or closed  he saw only red studded blackness .  he could not see the space ranger whirl into motion  pounce upon his boots  search their pockets with flying fingers  break the door   s magnetic circuit  and slip out of the room seconds before the inevitable crowd of people with their confused cries of alarm had begun to gather .    hennes   s hand still covered his eyes when he heard them .  he called     get the thing .  get him .  he   s in the room .  tackle him  you mars forsaken  black booted cowards .          there   s no one in the room     half a dozen voices called  and someone added     smells like a blaster  though .       a firmer  more authoritative voice said     what   s wrong  hennes .     it was dr .  silvers .       intruders     said hennes  shaking in frustration and wrath .     doesn   t anyone see him .  what   s the matter with all of you .  are you     he couldn   t say the word .  his blinking eyes were watering and blurred light was just beginning to make its way into them again .  he couldn   t say    blind .       silvers asked     who was the intruder .  can you describe him .       and hennes could only shake his head helplessly .  how could he explain .  could he tell them of a nightmare of smoke that could speak and against which a blaster bullet could only explode prematurely and without damage except to the man who sped it on its way .    dr .  james silvers made his way back to his room in dull gloom .  this disturbance that had routed him out of his room before he had completed preparation for bed  this aimless running about of men  the tongue tied lack of explanation on the part of hennes  all were to him nothing but a series of pinpricks .  his eyes were fixed on tomorrow .    he had no faith in victory  no faith in the efficacy of any embargo .  let the food shipments stop .  let even a few on earth find out why  or  worse still  invent their own theories therefor  and the results might be more frightful than any mass poisoning .    this young david starr expressed confidence  but so far his actions inspired none in himself .  his story of a space ranger was a poorly calculated one  fit only to arouse the suspicions of men such as hennes and bringing him almost to his death .  it was fortunate for the youngster that he  silvers  had arrived at the proper time .  nor had he explained the reasons for such a story .  he had merely expounded his plans for leaving the city and then secretly returning .  yet when silvers had first received starr   s letter  brought by the little fellow  the one that called himself big man in tremendous defiance of the truth  he had quickly checked with council headquarters on earth .  it had confirmed that david starr was to be obeyed in all particulars .    yet how could such a young man   dr .  silvers halted .  that was strange .  the door to his room  which he had left ajar in his haste  was still ajar  but no light shone out into the hall .  yet he had not put it out before leaving .  he could remember its glow behind him as he had hastened down the hall toward the stairs .    had someone put it out for him on some strange impulse toward economy .  it seemed hardly likely .    there was no sound within the room .  he drew his blaster  threw the door open  and stepped firmly to where he knew the light switch to be located .    a hand dropped over his mouth .    he squirmed  but the arm was a large and muscular one  and the voice in his ear was familiar .       it   s all right  dr .  silvers .  i just didn   t want you to give me away by yelling in surprise .       the arm dropped away .  dr .  silvers said     starr .           yes .  close the door .  it seemed your room would be the best hiding place while the search goes on .  in any case  i must speak to you .  did hennes say what had happened .          no  not really .  were you involved in that .       david   s smile was lost in the darkness .     in a way  dr .  silvers .  hennes was visited by the space ranger  and in the confusion i was able to reach your room with no one  i hope  having seen me .       the old scientist   s voice rose despite himself .     what are you saying .  i am in no mood for jokes .          i am not joking .  the space ranger exists .          that will not do .  the story did not impress hennes and i deserve the truth .          it impresses hennes now  i am sure  and you will have the truth when tomorrow is done .  meanwhile  listen to me .  the space ranger  as i say  exists  and he is our great hope .  the game we play is a rickety one and though i know who is behind the poisoning  the knowledge may be useless .  it is not a criminal or two  intending to gain a few millions by colossal blackmail  that we face  but rather a well organized group that intends to gain control of the entire solar system .  it can carry on  i am convinced  even if we pick off the leaders  unless we learn enough of the details of the conspiracy to stop its workings cold .          show me the leader     said dr .  silvers grimly     and the council will learn all necessary details .          never quickly enough     said david  just as grimly .     we must have the answer  all the answer  in less than twenty four hours .  victory after that will not stop the death of millions upon earth .       dr .  silvers said     what do you plan then .           in theory     said david     i know who the poisoner is and how the poisoning was accomplished .  to be met with anything but a flat denial on the part of the poisoner i need a bit of material proof .  that i will have before the evening is over .  to gain from him  even then  the necessary information  we must break his morale completely .  there we must use the space ranger .  indeed  he has begun the process of morale cracking already .          the space ranger again .  you are bewitched by this thing .  if he does exist  if this is not a trick of yours in which even i must be a victim  who is he and what is he .  how do you know he is not deceiving you .          i can tell no one the details of that .  i can only tell you that i know him to be on the side of humanity .  i trust him    as i would myself  and i will take full responsibility for him .  you must do as i say  dr .  silvers  in this matter  or i warn you we will have no choice but to proceed without you .  the importance of the game is such that even you may not stand in my way .       there was no mistaking the firm resolution of the voice .  dr .  silvers could not see the expression of david   s face in the darkness  but somehow he did not have to .     what is it you wish me to do .          tomorrow noon you will meet with makian  hennes  and benson .  bring bigman with you as a personal bodyguard .  he is small  but he is quick and knows no fear .  have the central building protected by council men  and i would advise that you have them armed with repeater blasters and gas pellets just in case .  now remember this  between twelve fifteen and twelve thirty leave the rear entrance unguarded and unobserved .  i will guarantee its safety .  show no surprise at whatever happens thereafter .          will you be there .          no .  my presence will not be necessary .          then .          there will be a visit from the space ranger .  he knows what i know  and from him the accusations will be more shattering to the criminal .       dr .  silvers felt hope arising in spite of himself .     do you think  then  that we   ll succeed .       there was a long silence .  then david starr said     how can i tell .  i can only hope so .       there was a longer silence .  dr .  silvers felt a tiny draft as though the door had opened .  he turned to the light switch .  the room flooded with light  and he found himself alone .        the space ranger takes over   david starr worked as quickly as he dared .  not much was left of the night .  some of the excitement and tension were beginning to fade  and the utter weariness that he had been refusing to acknowledge for hours was soaking in just a bit .    his small pencil flash flickered here and there .  he hoped earnestly that what he sought for would not be behind still additional locks .  if it were  he would have to use force  and he was in no mood to attract attention just then .  there was no safe that he could see  nothing equivalent to such an object .  that was both good and bad .  what he looked for would not be out of reach  but then again it might not be in the room at all .    that would be a pity after the carefully planned manner in which he had obtained the key to this room .  hennes would not recover quickly from the working out of that plan .    david smiled .  he himself had been almost as surprised as hennes at the very first .  his words     i am the space ranger     had been the first he had spoken through the force shield since his emergence from the martian caverns .  he could not remember what his voice had sounded like there .  perhaps he had not truly heard it .  perhaps  under martian influence  he had simply sensed his own thoughts as he did theirs .    here on the surface  however  the sound of his own voice had left him thunderstruck .  its hollowness and booming depth had been entirely unexpected .  he recovered  of course  and understood almost immediately .  although the shield let air molecules pass  it probably slowed them .  such interference would naturally affect sound waves .    david was not exactly sorry for that .  the voice  as it was  would be helpful .    the shield had worked well against the blaster radiation .  the flash had not been stopped entirely  he had seen it clearly .  at least the effect upon himself had been nothing compared to that upon hermes .    methodically  even as his weary mind turned these things over  he was inspecting the contents of shelves and cabinets .    the light beam held steady for a moment .  david reached past other gadgets to pick up a small metal object .  he turned it over and over in the small light .  he wound a little button which set at different positions and observed what happened afterward .    his heart bounded .    it was the final proof .  the proof of all his speculations   the speculations that had been so reasonable and so complete and yet had rested upon nothing more than logic .  now the logic had been borne out by something made of molecules  something that could be touched and felt .    he put it in his hip boot pocket to join his mask and the keys he had taken from hennes   s boots earlier in the night .         david starr  space ranger   he locked the door behind him and stepped out into the open .  the dome above was beginning to gray visibly .  soon the main fluorescents would go oa and day would officially begin .  the last day  either for the poisoners or for earth civilization as it then was .    meanwhile there would be a chance for sleep .    the makian farm dome lay in a frozen quiet .  few of the farmboys could even guess at what was going on .  that it was something serious was  of course  obvious  but further than that it was impossible to see .  some few whispered that makian had been caught in serious financial irregularities  but no one could believe it .  it wasn   t even logical  since why would they send in an army just for that .    certainly hard faced men in uniform circled central building with repeater blasters cradled in their arms .  on the roof of the building two artillery pieces had been set up .  and the area around it was deserted .  all farmboys  except those necessary for the maintenance of essential utilities  had been restricted to barracks .  those few excepted were ordered to remain strictly at their jobs .    at       p . m .  exactly  the two men patrolling the rear of the building separated  moved away  leaving that area unguarded .  at twelve thirty they returned and took up their patrols .  one of the artillerymen on the roof afterward stated that he had seen someone enter the building in that interval .  he admitted he had caught only a brief glimpse and his description did not make very much sense  since he said it seemed to be a man on fire .    nobody believed him at the time .    dr .  silvers was not certain of anything .  not at all certain .  he scarcely knew how to begin the session .  he looked at the other four that sat about the table .    makian .  he looked as if he hadn   t slept in a week .  probably hadn   t  either .  he hadn   t spoken a word so far .  silvers wondered if he was completely aware of his surroundings .    hennes .  he was wearing dark glasses .  he took them off at one time and his eyes were bloodshot and angry .  now he sat there muttering to himself .    benson .  quiet and unhappy .  dr .  silvers had spent several hours with him the night before and there was no doubt in his mind that the failures of his investigations were an embarrassment and a grief to him .  he had spoken about martians  native martians  as causes of the poisonings  but silvers had known better than to take that seriously .    bigman .  the only happy one of the lot .  to be sure he understood only a fragment of the real crisis .  he was leaning back in his chair  obviously pleased at being at the same table with important people  savoring his role to the full .    and there was one additional chair that silvers had brought to the table .  it stood there  empty and waiting .  no one cohimented on the fact .    dr .  silvers kept the conversation going somehow  making insubstantial remarks  trying to mask his own uncertainties .  like the empty chair  he was waiting .    at twelve sixteen he looked up and rose slowly to his feet .  no words came .  bigman pushed his chair        david siarr  space ranger   back and it went over with a crash .  hennes   s head turned sharply and he grasped the table with fingers that became white with strain .  benson looked about and whimpered .  only makian seemed unmoved .  his eyes lifted  then  apparently  took in the sight merely as another incomprehensible element in a world that had grown too large and strange for him .    the figure in the doorway said     i am the space ranger .       in the bright lights of the room the glow that surrounded his head was somewhat subdued  the smoke that concealed his body somewhat more substantial than hennes had seen it the night before .    the space ranger moved in .  almost automatically the seated men pushed their chairs away  clearing a place at the table  so that the one empty chair stood in lonely isolation .    the space ranger sat down  face invisible behind light  smoky arms extended before him  resting on the table  and yet not resting upon it .  between the table and the arms one quarter of an inch of empty space existed .    the space ranger said     i have come to speak to criminals .       it was hennes who broke the sticky silence that followed .  he said  in a voice that dripped with husky venom     you mean burglars .       his hand went momentarily to his dark glasses but did not remove them .  his fingers shook visibly .    the space ranger   s voice was a monotone of slow  hollow words .     it is true i am a burglar .  here are the keys i abstracted from your boots .  i need them no longer .       slivers of metal flashed across the table toward hennes  who did not pick them up .    the space ranger went on     but the burglary took place in order to prevent a greater crime .  there is the crime of the trusted foreman  for instance  who periodically spent nights in wingrad city on a one man search for poisoners .       bigman   s little face puckered in glee .     hey  hennes     he called     sounds like you   re being paged .       but hennes had eyes and ears only for the apparition across the table .  he said     what is the crime in that .          the crime     said the space ranger     of a fast trip out in the direction of the asteroids .          why .  what for .          is it not from the asteroids that the poisoners    ultimata have come .          are you accusing me of being behind the food poisoning .  i deny it .  i demand your proof .  that is  if you think you need any proof .  perhaps you think that your masquerade can force me to admit a lie .          where were you the two nights before the final ultimatum was received .          i will not answer .  i deny your right to question me .          i will answer the question for you then .  the machinery of the vast poisoning combine is located in the asteroids  where what is left of the old pirate bands have gathered .  the brains of the combine is here at makian farms .       here makian rose unsteadily to his feet  his mouth working .    the space ranger waved him down with a firm motion of his smoky arm and continued     you  hennes  are the go between .       hennes did remove his glasses now .  his plump  sleek face  somewhat marred by his red rihimed eyes  was set into a hard mold .    he said     you bore me  space ranger  or whatever you call yourself .  this conference  as i understand it  was for the purpose of discussing means of combating the poisoners .  if it is being converted into a forum for the stupid accusations of a play actor  i am leaving .       dr .  silvers reached across bigman to grasp hennes   s wrist .     please stay  hennes .  i want to hear more of this .  no one will convict you without ample proof .       hennes dashed silvers   s hand away and rose from his chair .    bigman said quietly     i   d love to see you shot  hennes  which is exactly what you will be if you go out the door .          bigman is right     said silvers .     there are armed men outside  with instructions to allow no one to leave without orders from me .       hennes   s fists clenched and unclenched .  he said     i will not contribute another word to this illegal procedure .  you are all witnesses that i am being detained by force .     he sat down again and folded his arms across his chest .    the space ranger began again     and yet hennes is only the go between .  he is too great a villain to be the real villain .       benson said faintly     you speak in contradictions .           only apparently .  consider the crime .  you can learn a great deal about a criminal from the nature of the crime he cohimits .  first  there is the fact that few people  comparatively  have died so far .  presumably the criminals could have gained what they wanted more quickly by beginning with wholesale poisonings  instead of merely threatening for six months during which they risked capture and gained nothing .  what does this mean .  it would seem that the leader somehow hesitates to kill .  that is certainly not in character for hermes .  i have obtained most of my information from williams  who is not among us now  and from him i know that after his arrival at the farm hermes tried several times to arrange his murder .       hennes forgot his resolve .  he shouted     a lie .     the space ranger went on  unheeding     so hennes would have no compunction against killing .  we would have to find someone of gentler mold .  yet what would force an essentially gentle person to kill people he has never seen  who have done him no harm .  after all  though an insignificant percentage of earth   s population has been poisoned  the dead number several hundred .  fifty of them were children .  presumably  then  there is a strong drive for wealth and power which overcomes his gentleness .  what lies behind that drive .  a life of frustration  perhaps  which has driven him into a morbid hatred of humanity as a whole  a desire to show those who despised him how great a man he really is .  we look for a man  then  who might be expected to have an advanced inferiority complex .  where can we find such a one .       all were watching the space ranger now with an intentness that burned in every eye .  something of keenness had returned even to makian   s expression .  benson was frowning in thought  and bigman had forgotten to grin .    the space ranger continued     most important as a clue is what followed the arrival of williams at the farm .  he was at once suspected of being a spy .  his story of the poisoning of his sister was easily shown to be false .  hermes  as i have said  was for outright murder .  the leader  with his softer conscience  would take another method .  he tried to neutralize the dangerous williams by developing a friendship for him and pretending to unfriendliness with hennes .       let us suhimarize .  what do we know about the leader of the poisoners .  he is a man with a conscience who has seemed friendly to williams and unfriendly to hennes .  a man with an inferiority com plex resulting from a life of frustration because he was different from others  less of a man  smaller       there was a rapid movement .  a chair was thrust from the table  and a figure backed rapidly away  a blaster in his hand .    benson rose to his feet and yelled     great space .  bigman .       dr .  silvers cried helplessly     but   but i was to bring him here as a bodyguard .  he   s armed .       for a moment bigman stood there  blaster ready  watching each of them out of his sharp little eyes .        solution   bigman said  his high voice firm     don   t let   s draw any quick conclusions now .  it may sound as if the space ranger is describing me  but he hasn   t said so yet .       they watched him .  no one spoke .    bigman flipped his blaster suddenly  caught it by the muzzle  and tossed it onto the table where it skihimed noisily across in the direction of the space ranger .     i say i   m not the man  and there   s my weapon to show i mean it .       the space ranger   s smoke obscured fingers reached for it .       i also say you   re not the man     he said  and the blaster skihimed back to bigman .    bigman pounced upon it  shoved it back in his holster  and sat down once more .     now suppose you keep on talking  space ranger .       the space ranger said     it might have been bigman  but there are many reasons why it could not have been .  in the first place  the enmity between bigman and hennes arose long before williams appeared on the scene .       dr .  silvers protested .     but look here .  if the leader was pretending to be on the outs with hennes  it might not have been just for williams    sake .  it might have been a long standing scheme .       the space ranger said     your point is well taken  dr .  silvers .  but consider this .  the leader  whoever he is  must be in complete control of the gang   s tactics .  he must be able to enforce his own squeamish ness about killing upon a group of what are probably the most desperate outlaws in the system .  there is only one way he can do that  and that is by arranging it so that they cannot possibly continue without him .  how .  by controlling the supply of poison and the method of poisoning .  surely bigman could do neither .          how do you know that .     demanded dr .  silvers .       because bigman doesn   t have the training that would enable him to develop and produce a new poison more virulent than any known .  he doesn   t have the laboratory or the botanical and bacteriological training .  he doesn   t have access to the food bins at wingrad city .  all of which  however  does apply to benson .       the agronomist  perspiring profusely  raised his voice in a weak yell .     what are you trying to do .  test me as you tested bigman just now .          i didn   t test bigman     said the space ranger .     i never accused him .  i do accuse you  benson .  you are the brains and leader of the food poisoning combine .          no .  you   re mad .          not at all .  quite sane .  williams first suspected you and passed his suspicions on to me .          he had no reason to .  i was perfectly frank with him .          too frank .  you made the mistake of telling him that it was your opinion that martian bacteria growing upon farm products were the source of the poison .  as an agronomist  you must have known that was impossible .  martian life is not protein in nature and could no more feed on earth plants than we could feed on rocks .  so you told a deliberate lie  and that made everything else about you suspect .  it made williams wonder if perhaps you had yourself made an extract of martian bacteria .  the extract would be poisonous .  don   t you think so .       benson cried wildly     but how could i possibly spread the poison .  you don   t make sense .          you had access to the makian farm shipments .  after the first few poisonings you could arrange to obtain samples from the storage bins at the city .  you told williams how you carefully took samples from different bins  from different levels of a single bin .  you told him how you used a harpoon like affair you invented yourself .          but what is there wrong with that .          a good deal .  last night i obtained keys from hennes .  i used them to get into the one place in the farm dome which is consistently kept locked   your laboratory .  there i found this .     he held the small metal object up to the light .    dr .  silvers said     what is it  space ranger .          it is benson   s sample taker .  it fits at the end of his food harpoon .  observe how it works .       the space ranger adjusted a small knob at one end .     firing the harpoon .     he said     trips this safety catch .  so .  now watch .       there was the faintest buzzing noise .  it ended after five seconds  and the fore end of the sampler gaped open  remained so for a second  then closed .        that   s the way it   s supposed to work     cried benson .     i made no secret of it .          no  you didn   t     said the space ranger sternly .     you and hennes had been quarreling for days over williams .  you hadn   t the stomach to have him killed .  at the very last you brought the harpoon with you to williams    bedside to see if the sight of it would surprise him into some action that would give him away .  it didn   t  but hennes would wait no longer  anyway .  zukis was sent in to kill him .          but what   s wrong with the sampler .     demanded benson .       let me show its workings again .  but this time  dr .  silvers  please observe the side of the sampler toward yourself now .       dr .  silvers leaned across the table  watching closely .  bigman  blaster out once more  divided his attention between benson and hennes .  makian was on his feet  leathery cheeks flushed .    once again the sampler was set  once again the little mouth flew open  and this time  as they watched the neutral side indicated  a covering sliver of metal withdrew there as well  revealing a shallow depression that glistened guhimily .       there     said the space ranger     you can see what happened .  each time benson took a sample  a few grains of wheat  a piece of fruit  a leaf of lettuce was smeared with that colorless gum  a poisonous extract of martian bacteria .  it is a simple poison  no doubt  that is not affected by subsequent food processing and eventually turns up in a loaf of bread  a jar of jam  a can of baby food .  it was a clever and diabolical trick .       benson was beating on the table .     it   s all a lie  a rotten lie .          bigman     said the space ranger     gag the man .  stand near him and don   t let him move .          really     protested dr .  silvers     you   re making a case  space ranger  but you must let the man defend himself .          there is no time     said the space ranger     and proof that will satisfy even you will be forthcoming quickly .       bigman used his handkerchief as a gag .  benson struggled and then sat in sweating stillness as the butt of bigman   s blaster collided noisily with his skull .       the next time     said bigman     it will be hard enough to knock you out  maybe fix you up with a concussion .       the space ranger rose .     you all suspected  or pretended to suspect  bigman when i spoke of a man with an inferiority complex because he was small .  there are more ways of being small than in size .  bigman compensates for his size by belligerence and loud assertion of his own opinions .  the men here respect him because of this .  benson  however  living here on mars among men of action finds himself despised as a    college farmer     ignored as a weakling  and looked down upon by men whom he considers much his inferiors .  to be unable to compensate for this except by murder of the most cowardly sort is another and worse kind of smallness .       but benson is mentally sick .  to get a confession out of him would be difficult  perhaps impossible .  however  hermes would do almost as well as a source of knowledge about the future activities of the poisoners .  he could tell us exactly where in the asteroids we could find his various henchmen .  he could tell us where the supply of poison  for use at midnight tonight  is kept .  he could tell us many things .       hennes sneered .     i could tell you nothing  and i will tell you nothing .  if you shoot benson and myself right now  matters will proceed exactly as they would if we were alive .  so do your worst .          would you talk     said the space ranger     if we guaranteed your personal safety .          who would believe in your guarantee .     said hennes .     i   ll stick to my story .  i   m an innocent man .  killing us will do you no good .          you realize that if you refuse to talk  millions of men  women  and children may die .       hennes shrugged .       very well     said the space ranger .     i have been told something about the effects of the martian poison benson has developed .  once in the stomach  absorption is very quick  the nerves to the chest muscles are paralyzed  the victim can   t breathe .  it is painful strangulation stretched over five minutes .  of course that is when the poison has been introduced into the stomach .       the space ranger  as he spoke  drew from his pocket a small glass pellet .  he opened the sampler and drew it across the guhimed surface until the glitter of the glass had been obscured by a sticky coating .       now if     he said     the poison were placed just within the lips  matters would be different .  it would be absorbed much more slowly and would take effect much more gradually .  makian     he called suddenly     there   s the man who betrayed you  used your farm to organize the poisoning of men and the ruin of the farm syndicates .  grab his arms and pinion them .       the space ranger tossed a pinion upon the table .    makian  with a cry of long pent rage  threw himself on hennes .  for a moment wrath restored to him some of the strength of his youth and hennes struggled in vain against him .    when makian stepped away  hennes was strapped to his chair  his arms drawn painfully behind and around its back  his wrists pinioned tightly .    makian said between rasping pants     after you talk  it will be my pleasure to take you apart with my ten fingers .       the space ranger circled the table now  approach ing hennes slowly  the smeared glass pellet held in two fingers before him .  hennes shrank away .  at the other end of the table benson writhed desperately  and bigman kicked him into stillness .    the space ranger pinched hennes   s lower lip and drew it out  exposing his teeth .  hennes tried to snap his head away  but the space ranger   s fingers pinched together and hennes let out a muffled scream .    the space ranger dropped the pellet in the space between lip and teeth .       i believe it will take about ten minutes before you absorb enough poison through the mouth membranes to begin taking noticeable effect     said the space ranger .     if you agree to talk before then  we will remove the pellet and let you rinse your mouth .  otherwise  the poison will take effect slowly .  gradually it will become more and more difficult and painful to breathe  and finally  in about an hour  you will die of very slow strangulation .  and if you do die  you will have accomplished nothing  because the demonstration will be very educational for benson and we will proceed to sweat the truth out of him .       the perspiration trickled down hennes   s temples .  he made choking noises in the back of his throat .    the space ranger waited patiently .    hennes cried     i   ll talk .  i   ll talk .  take it out .  take it out .       the words were muffled through his distorted lips  but their intent and the hideous terror in every line of his face were plain enough .       good .  you had better take notes  dr .  silvers .       it was three days before dr .  silvers met david starr again .  he had had little sleep in that interval and he was tired  but not too tired to greet david gladly .  bigman  who had not left silvers in all that interval  was equally effusive in his greetings .       it worked     said silvers .     you   ve heard about it  i   m sure .  it worked unbelievably well .          i know     said david  smiling .     the space ranger told me all about it .          then you   ve seen him since .          only for a moment or two .          he disappeared almost immediately afterward .  i mentioned him in my report  i had to  of course .  but it certainly made me feel foolish .  in any case  i have bigman here and old makian as witnesses .          and myself     said david .       yes  of course .  well  it   s over .  we located the poison stores and cleaned out the asteroids .  there   ll be two dozen men up for life sentences and benson   s work will actually be beneficial in the end .  his experiments on martian life were  in their way  revolutionary .  it   s possible a whole new series of antibiotics may be the final results of his attempts to poison earth into submission .  if the poor fool had aimed at scientific eminence  he would have ended a great man .  thank hennes   s confession for stopping him .       david said     that confession was carefully planned for .  the space ranger had been working on him since the night before .          oh  well  i doubt that any human could have withstood the danger of poisoning that hennes was subject to .  in fact  what would have happened if hennes had been really innocent .  the chance the space ranger took was a big one .          not really .  there was no poison involved .  benson knew that .  do you suppose benson would have left his sampler in his laboratory smeared with poison as evidence against himself .  do you suppose he kept any poison where it might be found by accident .          but the poison on the pellet .           .   .   .  was simple gelatin  unfavored .  benson would have known it would be something like that .  that   s why the space ranger did not try to get a confession out of him .  that   s why he had him gagged  to prevent a warning .  hennes might have figured it out for himself  if he hadn   t been in blind panic .          well  i   ll be tossed out into space     said dr .  silvers blankly .    he was still rubbing his chin when he finally made his excuses and went off to bed .    david turned to bigman .       and what will you be doing now  bigman .       bigman said     dr .  silvers has offered me a permanent job with the council .  but i don   t think i   ll take it .          why not .          well  i   ll tell you  mr .  starr .  i sort of figure on going with you  wherever you happen to be going after this .          i   m just going to earth     said david .    they were alone  yet bigman looked cautiously over his shoulder before he spoke .     it seems to me you   ll be going lots of places besides earth   space ranger .          what .          sure .  i knew that when i first saw you come in with all that light and smoke .  that   s why i didn   t take  you serious when it looked as if you were accusing me of being the poisoner .     his face was broken out in a giant grin .       do you know what you   re talking about .          i sure do .  i couldn   t see your face  or the details of your costume  but you were wearing hip boots and you were the right height and build .          coincidence .          maybe .  i couldn   t see the design on the hip boots but i made out a little of them  the colors  for instance .  and you   re the only farmboy i ever heard of that was willing to wear simple black and white .       david starr threw his head back and laughed .     you win .  do you really want to join forces with me .          i   d be proud to     said bigman .    david held out his hand and the two shook .       together then     said david     wherever we go .      about the author   isaac asimov was born in the soviet union to his great surprise .  he moved quickly to correct the situation .  when his parents emigrated to the united states  isaac  three years old at the time  stowed away in their baggage .  he has been an american citizen since the age of eight .    brought up in brooklyn  and educated in its public schools  he eventually found his way to columbia university and  over the protests of the school administration  managed to annex a series of degrees in chemistry  up to and including a ph . d .  he then infiltrated boston university and climbed the academic ladder  ignoring all cries of outrage  until he found himself professor of biochemistry .    meanwhile  at the age of nine  he found the love of his life  in the inanimate sense  when he discovered his first science fiction magazine .  by the time he was eleven  he began to write stories  and at eighteen  he actually worked up the nerve to submit one .  it was rejected .  after four long months of tribulation and suffering  he sold his first story and  thereafter  he never looked back .    in       when he was twenty one years old  he wrote the classic short story    nightfall    and his future was assured .  shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories  and shortly after that he had begun his foundation series .    what was left except quantity .  at the present time  he has published over     books  distributed through every major division of the dewey system of library classification  and shows no signs of slowing up .  he remains as youthful  as lively  and as lovable as ever  and grows more handsome with each year .  you can be sure that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious .    he is married to janet jeppson  psychiatrist and writer  has two children by a previous marriage  and lives in new york city .
