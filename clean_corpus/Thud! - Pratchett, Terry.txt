thud .    a novel of discworld        terry pratchett      contents     epigraph        epigraph        thud         it started out as a perfect day .  it would soon enough be an         on this day in       the painter methodia rascal woke up in the         one little light lluminated the cellar  which was to say that         there was a small crowd outside the watch house in         it was politics .  vimes could never get a handle on politics  which         the locker room wasn   t big enough .  nothing like big enough .       the door opened .       in theory  the only problem in fred   s life now was his door .       fred colon and nobby nobbs  having been rousted from their         vimes eased himself into his chair and looked at the         ankh morpork   s finest strolled back down toward the yard .          say that again  paying attention to every word  will         bloody stupid thing to say  vimes thought five minutes         treacle street was just the kind of area the dwarfs colonized         aimless and hopeless  the troll wandered         when vimes stepped out into the brilliant daylight  the first         one dwarf in the cells  one in the tender  loving care of         sally knew something was up as soon as she got back into the         vimes fretted through the afternoon .  there was  of course         what was this .       the pork futures warehouse was   one of those things  the            i don   t think i can go through with this     angua had hissed         darkness .          there   s something i didn   t want to mention in front of         bewildered and aimless  the troll wanders through the         the main office was packed  but vimes fought his way         the moon was somewhere beyond the clouds  but angua didn   t         the leap wasn   t intentional .  her hindbrain arranged it all by         on this day in       the painter methodia rascal tried putting         it was five a . m .  rain rustled out the sky  not hard  but with a         in a dank cellar that once was an attic and was now half full of         nobby nobbs  a shadow in the warm red gloom  nudged         coffee was only a way of stealing time that should by rights            the troll mob was a tableau .  trolls stood or sat or lay            you wish me to believe     said lord vetinari     that mr .          it was still nighttime in the city of endless rain .  it was never not         through the ruin of the world the troll staggers         angua decided to go straight to pseudopolis yard rather         there was an old military saying that fred colon used to         i should be in charge of the mine raid  thought vimes .  we         captain carrot had been busy .  the city dwarfs liked him .  so         pointer and pickles was dusty .  dust was the keynote of the         the entity slithered through the rainy streets .  confounded again .          there was a crowd of dwarfs milling around outside the yard .       the showers in the watch house were the talk of the city .       vimes sat and stared at his notebook .  he   d got    talking         the drinking had started in the bucket  in gleam street .       fred colon peered through the bars .  he was  on the whole  a      fun .  what is it good for .       it was odd  having sybil in pseudopolis yard .  it had been one of            i   ve never been on a girls    night out before     said cheery         the ramkins never threw anything away .  there was something         when did lord vetinari sleep .  presumably  the man must         i don   t use magic  thought vimes  walking through the rain         the rain cooled vimes down .  it had cooled down the streets          the entity known as the summoning dark sped through streets         grag bashfullsson lodged in a subdivided cellar in cheap         vimes didn   t remember going to sleep .  he didn   t remember         when vimes stepped out into the damp dawn  two coaches            this is all rather fun     said sybil an hour later as the         you could catch up with the dwarfs long before they   re near         what vimes remembered most of all about that journey            bunty was surprised to see them so soon  but ladies who         angua and sally had been put in the same bedroom .  angua         and now koom valley stretched away ahead of vimes  and he         vimes opened his eyes .  after a while  moving his arm            he   ll be back soon  you know     said sybil .     even if it   s         he wanted to sleep .  he   d never felt this tired before .  vimes            is that clock right .             ob oggle oog soggle .          sybil tried not to look at the worried faces of her host and         vimes  half limping and half running  tripped and fell into a         night  forever .  but within it  a city  shadowy and only real in         it hadn   t exactly been an ambush  the dwarfs just caught up         on this day in       the painter methodia rascal

fourth thing tak did  he wrote a cave .   the fifth thing tak did  he wrote a geode  an egg of stone .     and in the twilight of the mouth of the cave  the geode hatched  and the brothers were born .   the first brother walked toward the light  and stood under the open sky .  thus he became too tall .  he was the first man .  he found no laws  and he was enlightened .   the second brother walked toward the darkness  and stood under a roof of stone .  thus he achieved the correct height .  he was the first dwarf .  he found the laws tak had written  and he was endarkened .   but some of the living spirit of tak was trapped in the broken stone egg  and it became the first troll  wandering the world unbidden and unwanted  without soul or purpose  learning or understanding .  fearful of light and darkness it shambles forever in twilight  knowing nothing  learning nothing  creating nothing  being nothing            from    gd tak    gar     the things tak wrote   trans .  prof .  w .

troll pictograms found carved on a basalt slab in the deepest level of the ankh morpork treacle mines  in pig treacle measures estimated at         years old .       thud        that was the sound the heavy club made as it connected with the head .  the body jerked  and slumped back .   and it was done  unheard  unseen  the perfect end  a perfect solution  a perfect story .   but  as the dwarfs say  where there is trouble you will always find a troll .   the troll saw .       it started out as a perfect day .  it would soon enough be an imperfect one  he knew  but just for these few minutes  it was possible to pretend that it wouldn   t .   sam vimes shaved himself .  it was his daily act of defiance  a confirmation that he was   well  plain sam vimes .   admittedly  he shaved himself in a mansion  and while he did so his butler read out bits from the times  but they were just   circumstances .  it was still sam vimes looking back at him from the mirror .  the day he saw the duke of ankh morpork in there would be a bad day .     duke    was just a job description  that   s all .      most of the news is about the current   dwarfish situation  sir     said willikins  as vimes negotiated the tricky area under the nose .  he still used his granddad   s cutthroat razor .  it was another anchor to reality .  besides  the steel was a lot better than the steel you got today .  sybil  who had a strange enthusiasm for modern gadgetry  kept on suggesting he get one of those new shavers  with a little magic imp inside that had its own scissors and did all the cutting very quickly  but vimes had held out .  if anyone was going to be using a blade near his face  it was going to be him .      koom valley  koom valley     he muttered to his reflection .     anything new .         not as such  sir     said willikins  turning back to the front page .     there is a report of that speech by grag hamcrusher .  there was a disturbance afterwards  it says .  several dwarfs and trolls were wounded .  community leaders have appealed for calm .      vimes shook some lather off the blade .     hah .  i bet they have .  tell me  willikins  did you fight much when you were a kid .  were you in a gang or anything .         i was privileged to belong to the shamlegger street rude boys  sir     said the butler primly .      really .     said vimes  genuinely impressed .     they were pretty tough nuts  as i recall .         thank you  sir     said willikins smoothly .     i pride myself i used to give somewhat more than i got if we needed to discuss the vexed area of turf issues with the young men from rope street .  stevedore   s hooks were their weapon of choice  as i recall .         and yours    .     said vimes  agog .      a cap brim sewn with sharpened pennies  sir .  an ever present help in times of trouble .         ye gods  man .  you could put someone   s eye out with something like that .         with care  sir  yes .      and here you stand now  in your pinstripe trousers and butlering coat  shiny as schmaltz and fat as butter  vimes thought  while he tidied up under the ears .  and i   m a duke .  how the world turns .      and have you ever heard someone say    let   s have a disturbance    .     he said .      never  sir     said wilkins  picking up the paper again .      me neither .  it only happens in newspapers .     vimes glanced at the bandage on his arm .  it had been quite disturbing  even so .      did it mention i took personal charge .     he said .      no  sir .  but it does say here that rival factions in the street outside were kept apart by the valiant efforts of the watch  sir .         they actually used the word    valiant    .     said vimes .      indeed they did  sir .         well  good     vimes conceded grumpily .     do they record that two officers had to be taken to the free hospital  one of them quite badly hurt .         unaccountably  not  sir     said the butler .      huh .  typical .  oh  well   carry on .      willikins coughed a butlery cough .     you might wish to lower the razor for the next one  sir .  i got into trouble with her ladyship about last week   s little nick .      vimes watched his image sigh  and lowered the razor .     all right  willikins .  tell me the worst .      behind him  the paper was professionally rustled .     the headline on page three is     vampire officer for the watch .      sir     said the butler and took a careful step backwards .      damn .  who told them .         i really couldn   t say  sir .  it says you are not in favor of vampires in the watch  but will be interviewing a recruit today .  it says there is a lively controversy over the issue .         turn to page eight  will you .     said vimes grimly .  behind him  the paper rustled again .      well .     he said .     that   s where they usually put their silly political cartoon  isn   t it .         you did put the razor down  did you  sir .     said willikins .      yes .         perhaps it would also be just as well if you stepped away from the washbasin  too  sir .         there   s one of me  isn   t there       said vimes grimly .      indeed there is  sir .  it portrays a small  nervous vampire and  if i may say so  a rather larger than life drawing of yourself leaning over your desk  holding a wooden stake in your right hand .  the caption is    any good on a stakeout  eh .      sir  this being a humorous wordplay referring  on the one hand  to the standard police procedure           yes  i think i can just about spot it     said vimes wearily .     any chance you could nip down and buy the original before sybil does .  every time they run a cartoon of me  she gets hold of it and hangs it up in the library .         mr .   er  fizz does capture a very good likeness  sir     the butler conceded .     and i regret to say that her ladyship has already instructed me to go down to the times office on her behalf .      vimes groaned .      moreover  sir     willikins went on     her ladyship desired me to remind you that she and young sam will meet at the studio of sir joshua at eleven sharp  sir .  the painting is at an important stage  i gather .         but i           she was very specific  sir .  she said if a commander of police cannot take time off  who can .          on this day in       the painter methodia rascal woke up in the night because the sounds of warfare were coming from a drawer in his bedside table .   again .       one little light illuminated the cellar  which was to say that it lent different textures to the darkness and divided shadow from darker shadow .   the figures barely showed up at all .  it was quite impossible  with normal eyes  to tell who was talking .      this is not to be talked about  do you understand .         not talked about .  he   s dead .         this is dwarf business .  it   s not to come to the ears of the city watch .  they have no place here .  do any of us want them down here .         they do have dwarf officers           hah .  d   rkza .  too much time in the sun .  they   re just short humans now .  do they think dwarf .  and vimes will dig and dig and wave the silly rags and tatters they call laws .  why should we allow such a violation .  besides  this is hardly a mystery .  only a troll could have done it  agreed .  i said  are we agreed .         that is what happened     said a figure  the voice was thin and old and  in truth  uncertain .      indeed  it was a troll     said another voice  almost the twin of that one  but with a little more assurance .   the subsequent pause was underlined by the ever present sound of the pumps .      it could only have been a troll     said the first voice .     and is it not said that behind every crime you will find the troll .          there was a small crowd outside the watch house in pseudopolis yard when commander sam vimes arrived at work .  it had been a fine sunny morning up until then .  now it was still sunny  but nothing like as fine .   the crowd had placards .  bloodsuckers out .  .   vimes read  and no fangs .  faces turned toward him with a sullen  half frightened defiance .   he uttered a bad word under his breath  but only just .   otto chriek  the times iconographer  was standing nearby  holding a sunshade and looking dejected .  he caught vimes   s eye and trudged over .      what   s in this for you  otto .     said vimes .     come to get a picture of a jolly good riot  have you .         it   s news  commander     said otto  looking down at his very shiny shoes .      who tipped you off .         i just do zer pictures  commander     said otto  looking up with a hurt expression .     anyvay  i couldn   t tell you even if i knew  because of zer freedom of the press .         freedom to pour oil on a flame  d   you mean .     vimes demanded .      zat   s freedom for you     said otto .     no vun said it vas nice .         but   well  you   re a vampire  too .     said vimes  waving a hand toward the protesters .     do you like what   s been stirred up .         it   s still news  commander     said otto meekly .   vimes glared at the crowd again .  it was mostly human .  there was one troll  although  admittedly  the troll had probably joined in on general principle  simply because something was happening .  a vampire would need a masonry drill and a lot of patience before it could put a troll to any trouble .  still  there was one good thing  if you could call it that   this little sideshow took people   s minds off koom valley .      it   s strange that they don   t seem to mind you  otto     he said  calming down a little .      vell  i   m not official     said otto .     i do not haf zer sword und zer badge .  i do not threaten .  i am just a vorking stiff .  and i make zem laff .      vimes stared at the man .  he   s never thought about that before .  but yes   little fussy otto  in his red lined black opera cloak with pockets for all his gear  his shiny black shoes  his carefully cut widow   s peak and  not least  his ridiculous accent that grew thicker or thinner depending on whom he was talking to  did not look like a threat .  he looked funny  a joke  a music hall vampire .  it had never previously occurred to vimes that  just possibly  the joke was on other people .  make them laugh  and they   re not afraid .   he nodded to otto and went inside  where sergeant cheery littlebottom was standing   on a box   at the too high duty officer   s desk  her chevrons all shiny and new on her sleeve .  vimes made a mental note to do something about the box .  some of the dwarf officers were getting sensitive about having to use it .      i think we could do with a couple of lads standing outside  cheery     he said .     nothing provocative  just a little reminder to people that we keep the peace .         i don   t think we   ll need that  mister vimes     said the dwarf .      i   m not interested in seeing a picture in the times showing the watch   s first vampire recruit being mobbed by protesters  corp   sergeant     said vimes severely .      i thought you wouldn   t be  sir     said cheery .     so i asked sergeant angua to fetch her .  they came in the back way half an hour ago .  she   s showing her the building .  i think they   re down in the locker room .         you asked angua to do it .     said vimes  his heart sinking .      yessir .     said cheery  suddenly looking worried .     er   is there a problem .      vimes stared at her .  she   s a good  orderly officer  he thought  i wish i had two more like her .  and she deserved the promotion  heavens knew  but  he reminded himself  she   s from woerworld  isn   t she .  she should have remebered about the   thing between them and werewolves .  maybe it   s my fault .  i tell    em that all coppers are just coppers .      what .  oh  no     he said .     probably not .      a vampire and a werewolf in one room  he thought  as he headed on up the stairs to his office .  well  they   ll just have to deal with it .  and that   ll be just the first of our problems .      and i took mr .  pessimal up to the interview room     cheery called after him .   vimes stopped in mid stair .      pessimal .     he said .      the government inspector  sir .     said cheery .     the one you told me about .      oh yes  thought vimes .  the second of our problems .       it was politics .  vimes could never get a handle on politics  which was full of traps for honest men .  this one had been sprung last week  in lord vetinari   s office  at the normal daily briefing        ah  vimes     said his lordship  as vimes entered .     so kind of you to come .  isn   t it a beautiful day .      up until now  vimes thought when he spotted the two other people in the room .      you wanted me  sir .     he said  turning to vetinari again .     there   s a silicon anti defamation league march in water street  and i   ve got traffic backed up all the way to least gate           i   m sure it can wait  commander .         yes  sir .  that   s the trouble  sir .  that   s what it   s doing .      vetinari waved a languid hand .     full carts congesting the street  vimes  is a sign of progress     he declared .      only in the figurative sense  sir     said vimes .      well  at any rate i   m sure your men can deal with it     said vetinari  nodding to an empty chair .     you have so many of them now .  such an expense .  do sit down  commander .  do you know mr .  john smith .      the other man at the table took the pipe out of his mouth and gave vimes a smile of manic friendliness .      i don   t believe wwwe have had the pleasure     he said  extending a hand .  it should not be possible to roll your double yous  but john smith managed it .   shake hands with a vampire .  not bloody likely  vimes thought  not even one wearing a badly hand knitted pullover .  he saluted instead .      pleased to meet you  sir     he said crisply  standing to attention .  it really was an awful garment  that pullover .  it had a queasy zigzag pattern  in many strange  unhappy colors .  it looked like something knitted as a present by a colorblind aunt  the sort of thing you wouldn   t dare throw away in case the garbage collectors laughed at you and kicked your trash cans over .      vimes  mr .  smith is       vetinari began .      president of the ankh morpork mission of the uberwald league of temperance     said vimes .     and i believe the lady next to him to be mrs .  doreen winkings  treasurer of same .  this is about having a vampire in the watch  isn   t it  sir .  again .         yes  vimes  it is     said vetinari .     and  yes  it is again .  shall we all be seated .  vimes .      there was no escape  vimes knew  as he sagged resentfully into a chair .  and this time he was going to lose .  vetinari had cornered him .   vimes knew all the arguments for having different species in the watch .  they were good arguments .  some of the arguments against them were bad arguments .  there were trolls in the watch  plenty of dwarfs  one werewolf  three golems  an igor  and  not least  corporal nobbs   so why not a vampire .  and the league of temperance was a fact .  vampires wearing the league   s black ribbon     not one drop .      were a fact  too .  admittedly  vampires who had sworn off blood could be a bit weird  but they were intelligent and clever and  as such  a potential asset to society .  and the watch was the most visible arm of government in the city .  why not set an example .   because  said vimes   s battered but still functional soul  you hate bloody vampires .  no messing about  no dissembling  no weasel words about    the public won   t stand for it    or    it   s not the right time .     you hate bloody vampires  and it   s your bloody watch .   the other three were staring at him .      mr .  vimes     said mrs .  winkings .     ve cannot help but notice that you still haf not employed any of our members in the vatch        say    watch     why don   t you .  vimes thought .  i know you can .  let the twenty third letter of the alphabet enter your life .  ask mr .  smith for some  he   s got more than enough .  anyway  i have a new argument .  it   s copper bottomed .      mrs .  winkings     he said aloud     no vampire has applied to join the watch .  they   re just not mentally suited to a copper   s way of life .  and it   s commander vimes  thank you .      mrs .  winkings   s little eyes gleamed with righteous malice .      oh  are you sayink vampires are   stupid .     she said .      no  mrs .  winkings  i   m saying they   re intelligent .  and there   s your problem  right there .  why would a clever person want to risk getting their nadg   their head kicked in on a daily basis for thirty eight dollars a month plus allowances .  vampires have got class  education  a von in front of their name .  there   s a hundred better things for them to be doing than walking the streets as a cop .  what do you want me to do  force them to join the force .         wwwouldn   t they be offered officer rank .     said john smith .  there was sweat on his face  and his permanent smile was manic  rumor had it he was finding the pledge very hard going .      no .  everyone starts on the street     said vimes .  that wasn   t entirely true  but the question had offended him .     and on the night watch  too .  good training .  the best there is .  a week of rainy nights with the mists coming up and the water trickling down your neck and odd noises in the shadows   well  that   s when we find out if we   ve got a real copper        he knew it as soon as he said it .  he   d walked right into it .  they must have found a candidate .      vell  zat is good news .     said mrs .  winkings  leaning back .   vimes wanted to shake her and shout  you   re not a vampire  doreen .  you   re married to one  yes  but he didn   t become one until a time when it is beyond human imagining that he could possibly have wanted to bite you .  all the real black ribboners try to act normal and unobtrusive .  no flowing cloaks  no sucking  and definitely no ripping the underwired nightdresses off young ladies .  everyone knows john not a vampire at all smith used to be count vargo st .  gruet von vilinus .  but now he smokes a pipe and wears those horrible woolen sweaters  and he collects bananas and makes models of human organs out of matchsticks  because he thinks hobbies make you more human .  but you  doreen .  you were born in cockbill street .  your mum was a washerwoman .  no one would ever rip your nightdress off  not without a crane .  but you   re so   into this  right .  it   s a damn hobby .  you try to look more like vampires than vampires do .  incidentally  those fake pointy teeth rattle when you talk .      vimes .         hmm .     vimes became aware that people had been speaking .      mr .  smith has some good news     said vetinari .      indeed  yes     said john smith  beaming manically .     wwwe have a recruit for you  commander .  a vampire wwho wwants to be in the wwwatch .         ant  of course  zer night vill not prezent a problem     said doreen triumphantly .     ve are zer night .         are you trying to tell me that i must       vimes began .  vetinari cut in quickly .      oh  no  commander .  we all fully respect your autonomy as head of the watch .  clearly  you must hire whomsoever you think fit .  all i ask is that the candidate is interviewed  in a spirit of fairness .      yeah  right  thought vimes .  and politics with uberwald will become just that bit easier  won   t it  if you can say you even have a black ribboner in the watch .  and if i turn this man down  i   ll have to explain why .  and    i just don   t like vampires  okay .     probably won   t do .      of course     he said .     send him along .         he is  in fact  she     said lord vetinari .  he glanced down at his paperwork .     salacia deloresista amanita trigestatra zeldana malifee       he paused  turned over several pages  and said     i think we can skip some of these  but they end    von humpeding .     she is fifty one  but     he added quickly  before vimes could seize on this revelation     that is no age at all for a vampire .  oh  and she   d prefer to be known simply as sally .          the locker room wasn   t big enough .  nothing like big enough .  captain angua tried not to inhale .   a large hall  that was fine .  the open air  even better .  what she needed was room to breathe .  more specifically  she needed room not to breathe vampire .   damn cheery .  but she couldn   t have refused  that would have looked bad .  all she could do was grin and bear it and fight down a pressing desire to rip out the girl   s throat with her teeth .   she must know she   s doing it  she thought .  they must know that they exude this air of effortless ease  confident in any company  at home everywhere  making everyone else feel second class and awkward .  oh  my .  call me sally  indeed .      sorry about this     she said aloud  trying to force the hairs on the back of her neck not to rise .     it   s a bit close in here .     she coughed .     anyway  this is it .  don   t worry  it always smells like this in here .  and don   t bother to lock your locker  all the keys are the same and anyway most of the doors spring open if you hit the frame in the right way .  don   t keep valuables in it  this place is too full of coppers .  and don   t get too upset when someone puts holy water or a wooden stake in there .         is that likely to happen .     said sally .      not likely     said angua .     certain .  f   rinstance  i used to find dog collars and bone shaped biscuits in mine .         didn   t you complain .         what .  no .  you don   t complain .     snapped angua  wishing she could stop inhaling right now .  already she was sure her hair was a mess .      but i thought the watch was           look  it   s nothing to do with what you   what we are  okay .     said angua .     if you were a dwarf  it   d be a pair of platform soles or a stepladder or something  although that doesn   t happen so much these days .  mostly they try it on everyone .  it   s a copper thing .  and then they   ll watch what you do  you see .  no one cares if you   re a troll or a gnome or a zombie or a vampire     much  she added to herself     but don   t let them believe you   re a whiner or a snitch .  and actually the biscuits were pretty good  to tell you the truth   ah  have you met igor yet .         many times     said sally .  angua forced a smile .  in uberwald  you met igors all the time .  especially if you were a vampire .      the one here  though .     she said .      i don   t think so .      ah .  that was a relief .  angua normally avoided igor   s laboratory  because the smells that emanated therefrom were either painfully chemical or horribly  suggestively organic  but now she   d snuff them up with relief .  she headed for the door with slightly more speed than politeness required  and knocked .   it creaked open .  any door opened by an igor would creak .  it was a knack .      hi  igor     said sally cheerfully .     gimme six .      angua left them chatting .  igors were naturally servile  vampires were naturally not .  it was an ideal match .  at least she could go and get some air now .       the door opened .      mr .  pessimal  sir     said cheery  ushering in a man not much taller than she was into vimes   s office .     and here   s the office copy of the times        mr .  pessimal was neat .  in fact  he went beyond neat .  he was a folding kind of person .  his suit was cheap but very clean  his little boots sparkled .  his hair gleamed  too  even more than the boots .  it had a center parting and had been plastered down so severely that it looked as though it had been painted on his head .   all the city   s departments got inspected from time to time  vetinari had said .  there was no reason why the watch should be passed over  was there .  it was  after all  a major drain on the city coffers .   vimes had pointed out that a drain was where things went to waste .   nevertheless  vetinari had said .  just    nevertheless .     you couldn   t argue with    nevertheless .      and the outcome was mr .  pessimal  walking toward vimes .   he twinkled as he walked .  vimes couldn   t think of another way to describe it .  every move was   well  neat .   shovel purse and spectacles on a ribbon  i   ll bet  he thought .   mr .  pessimal folded himself onto the chair in front of vimes   s desk and opened the clasps of his briefcase with two little snaps of doom .  with some ceremony  he donned a pair of spectacles .  they were on a black ribbon .      my letter of accreditation from lord vetinari  your grace     he said  handing over a sheet of paper .      thank you  mr    .  a .  e .  pessimal     said vimes  glancing at it and putting it on one side .     and how can we help you .  it   s commander vimes when i   m at work  by the way .         i will need an office  your grace .  and an oversight of all your paperwork .  as you know  i am tasked to give his lordship a complete overview and cost benefit analysis of the watch  with any suggestions for improvement in every aspect of its activities .  your cooperation is appreciated but not essential .         suggestions for improvement  eh .     said vimes cheerfully  while behind a .  e .  pessimal   s chair sergeant littlebottom shut her eyes in dread .     jolly good .  i   ve always been known for my cooperative attitude .  i did mention about the duke thing  did i .         yes  your grace     said a .  e .  pessimal primly .     nevertheless  you are the duke of ankh morpork and it would be inappropriate to address you in any other way .  i would feel disrespectful .         i see .  and how should i address you  mr .  pessimal .     said vimes .  out of the corner of his eye he saw a floorboard on the other side of the room lift almost imperceptibly .      a .  e .  pessimal will be quite acceptable  your grace     said the inspector .      the a standing for    .     vimes said  taking his eyes off the board for a moment .      just a  your grace     said a .  e .  pessimal patiently .     a .  e .  pessimal .         you mean you weren   t named  you were initialed .         just so  your grace     said the little man calmly .      what do your friends call you .     a .  e .  pessimal looked as though there was one major assumption in that sentence that he did not understand  so vimes took a small amount of pity on him .      well  sergeant littlebottom here will look after you     he said with fake joviality .      find mr .  a .  e .  pessimal an office somewhere  sergeant  and let him see any paperwork he requires .     as much as possible  vimes thought .  bury him in the stuff  if it keeps him away from me .      thank you  your grace     said a .  e .  pessimal .     i shall need to interview some officers  too .         why .     said vimes .      to ensure that my report is comprehensive  your grace     said mr .  a .  e .  pessimal calmly .      i can tell you anything you need to know     said vimes .      yes  your grace  but that is not how an inquiry works .  i must act completely independently .  quis custodiet ipsos custodes .  your grace .         i know that one     said vimes .     who watches the watchmen .  me  mr .  pessimal .         ah  but who watches you  your grace .     said the inspector with a brief little smile .      i do that  too .  all the time     said vimes .     believe me .         quite so  your grace .  nevertheless  i must represent the public interest here .  i shall try not to be obtrusive .         very good of you  mr .  pessimal     said vimes  giving up .  he hadn   t realized he   d been upsetting vetinari so much lately .  this felt like one of his games .     all right .  enjoy your hopefully brief stay with us .  do excuse me  this is a busy morning  what with the damn koom valley thing and everything .  come in  fred .      that was a trick he   d learned from vetinari .  it was hard for a visitor to hang on when their replacement was in the room .  besides  fred sweated a lot in this hot weather  he was a champion sweater .  and in all these years he   d never worked out that when you stood outside the office door  the long floorboard seesawed slightly on the joist and rose just where vimes could notice it .   the piece of floorboard settled again  and the door opened .      don   t know how you do it  mr .  vimes .     said sergeant colon cheerfully .     i was just about to knock .      after you   d had a decent earful  thought vimes .  he was pleased to see a .  e .  pessimal   s nose wrinkle  though .      what   s up  fred .     he said .     oh  don   t worry  mr .  pessimal was just leaving .  carry on  sergeant littlebottom .  good morning  mr .  pessimal .      fred colon removed his helmet as soon as the inspector had been ushered away by cheery  and wiped his forehead .      it   s heating up out there again     he said .     we   re in for thunderstorms  i reckon .         yes  fred .  and you wanted what  exactly .     said vimes  contriving to indicate that while fred was always welcome  just now was not the best of times .      er   something big   s going down on the street  sir     said fred earnestly  in the manner of one who had memorized the phrase .   vimes sighed .     fred  do you mean something   s happening .         yes  sir .  it   s the dwarfs  sir .  i mean the lads here .  it   s got worse .  they keep going into huddles .  everywhere you look  sir  there   s huddlin    goin    on .  only they stops as soon as anyone else comes close .  even the sergeants .  they stops and gives you a look  sir .  and that   s makin    the trolls edgy  as you might expect .         we   re not going to have koom valley replayed in this nick  fred     said vimes .     i know the city   s full of it right now  what with the anniversary coming up  but i   ll drop like a ton of rectangular building things on any copper who tries a bit of historical recreation in the locker room .  he   ll be out on his arse before he knows it .  make sure everyone understands that .         yessir .  but i ain   t talking about all that stuff  sir .  we all know about that     said fred colon .     this is something different  fresh today .  it feels bad  sir  makes my neck tingle .  the dwarfs know something .  something they ain   t sayin    .      vimes hesitated .  fred colon was not the greatest gift to policing .  he was slow  stolid  and not very imaginative .  but he   d plodded his way around the streets for so long that he   d left a groove  and somewhere inside that stupid  fat head was something very smart that sniffed the wind and heard the buzz and read the writing on the wall  admittedly doing the last bit with its lips moving .      probably it   s just that damn hamcrusher who has got them stirred up again  fred     he said .      i hear them mentioning his name in their lingo  yes  sir  but there   s more to it  i   ll swear .  i mean  they looked really uneasy  sir .  it   s something important  sir  i can feel it in my water .      vimes considered the admissibility of fred colon   s water as exhibit a .  it wasn   t something you   d want to wave around in a court of law  but the gut feeling of an ancient street monster like fred counted for a lot  one copper to another .   he said     where   s carrot .         off  sir .  he pulled the swing shift and the morning shift down at treacle mine road .  everyone   s doin    double shifts  sir     fred colon added reproachfully .      sorry  fred  you know how it is .  look  i   ll get him on it when he comes in .  he   s a dwarf  he   ll hear the buzz .         i think he might be just a wee bit too tall to hear this buzz  sir     said colon  in an odd voice .   vimes put his head on one side .      what makes you say that  fred .      fred colon shook his head .     just a feeling  sir     he said .  he added  in a voice tinged with reminiscence and despair     it was better when there was just you and me and nobby and the lad carrot  eh .  we all knew who was who in the old days .  we knew what one another was thinking           yes  we were thinking     i wish the odds were on our side  just for once     fred     said vimes .     look  i know this is getting us all down  right .  but i need you senior officers to tough it out  okay .  how do you like your new office .      colon brightened up .      very nice  sir .  shame about the door     course .      finding a niche for fred colon had been a problem .  to look at him  you   d see a man who might well  if he fell over a cliff  have to stop and ask directions on the way down .  you had to know fred colon .  the newer coppers didn   t .  they just saw a cowardly  stupid  fat man  which  to tell the truth  was pretty much what was there .  but it wasn   t all that was there .   fred had looked retirement in the face  and didn   t want any .  vimes had got around the problem by giving him the post of custody officer  to the amusement of all   and an office in the watch training school across the alley  which was much better known as  and probably would forever be known as  the old lemonade factory .  he   d thrown in the job of watch liaison officer  because it sounded good and no one knew what it meant .  vimes had also given him corporal nobbs  who was another awkward dinosaur in today   s watch .   it was working  too .  nobby and colon had a street level knowledge of the city that rivaled vimes   s own .  they ambled about  apparently aimlessly and completely unthreatening  and they watched and they listened to the urban equivalent of the jungle drums .  and sometimes the drums came to them .  once  fred   s sweaty little office had been the place where bare armed ladies had mixed up great batches of sarsaparilla and raspberry lava and ginger pop .  now the kettle was always on and it was open house for all his old mates  ex watchmen and old cons   sometimes the same individual   and vimes happily signed the bill for the doughnuts consumed when they dropped by to get out from under their wives    feet .  it was worth it .  old coppers kept their eyes open  and gossiped like washerwomen .       in theory  the only problem in fred   s life now was his door .      the historians    guild say we   ve got to preserve as much of the old fabric as possible  fred     said vimes .      i know that  sir  but   well     the twaddle room     sir .  i mean  really .         nice brass plate  though  fred     said vimes .     it   s what they called the basic soft drink syrup  i   m told .  important historical fact .  you could stick a piece of paper over the top of it .         we do that  sir  but the lads pull it off and snigger .      vimes sighed .     sort it out  fred .  if an old sergeant can   t sort out that sort of thing  the world has become a very strange place .  is that all .         well  yes  sir  really .  but           c   mon  fred  it   s going to be a busy day .         have you heard of mr .  shine  sir .         do you clean stubborn surfaces with it .     said vimes .      er   what  sir .     said fred .  no one did perplexed better than fred colon .  vimes felt ashamed of himself .      sorry  fred .  no  i haven   t heard of mr .  shine .  why .         oh   nothing  really .     mr .  shine  him diamond .     seen it on walls a few times lately .  troll graffiti  you know  carved in deep .  seems to be causing a buzz among the trolls .  important  maybe .      vimes nodded .  you ignored the writing on the walls at your peril .  sometimes it was the city   s way of telling you if not what was on its bubbling mind then at least what was in its creaking heart .      well  keep listening  fred .  i   m relying on you not to let a buzz become a sting     said vimes with extra cheerfulness to keep the man   s spirits up .     and now i   ve got to see our vampire .         best of luck  sam .  i think it   s going to be a long day .      sam  thought vimes  as the old sergeant went out .  gods know he   s earned it  but he only calls me sam when he   s really worried .  well  we all are .   we   re waiting for the first shoe to drop .   vimes unfolded the copy of the times that cheery had left on his desk .  he always read it at work  to catch up on the news that willikins had thought it unsafe to hear whilst shaving .   koom valley  koom valley .  vimes shook out the paper and saw koom valley everywhere .  bloody  bloody koom valley .  gods damn the wretched place  although obviously they had already done so   damned it and then forsaken it .  up close it was just another rocky wasteland in the mountains .  in theory  it was a long way away  but it seemed to be getting a lot closer lately .  koom valley wasn   t really a place now  not anymore .  it was a state of mind .   if you wanted the bare facts  it was where the dwarfs had ambushed the trolls and or the trolls had ambushed the dwarfs  one ill famed day under unkind stars .  oh  they   d fought one another since creation  as far as vimes understood it  but at the battle of koom valley that mutual hatred became  as it were  official  and  as such  had developed a kind of mobile geography .  where any dwarf fought any troll  there was koom valley .  even if it was a punch up in a pub  it was koom valley .  it was part of the mythology of both races  a rallying cry  the ancestral reason why you couldn   t trust those short  bearded big  rocky bastards .   there had been plenty of such koom valleys since that first one .  the war between the dwarfs and the trolls was a battle of natural forces  like the war between the wind and the waves .  it had a momentum of its own .   saturday was koom valley day  and ankh morpork was full of trolls and dwarfs and you know what .  the further trolls and dwarfs got from the mountains  the more that bloody  bloody koom valley mattered .  the parades were okay  the watch had gotten good at keeping them apart  and anyway they were in the morning  when everyone was still mostly sober .  but when the dwarf bars and the troll bars emptied out in the evening  hell went for a stroll with its sleeves rolled up .   in the bad old days  the watch would find business elsewhere  and only turned up when stewed tempers had run their course .  then they   d bring out the hurry up wagon and arrest every troll and dwarf too drunk  dazed  or dead to move .  it was simple .   that was then .  now there were too many dwarfs and trolls   no  mental correction   the city had been enriched by vibrant  growing communities of dwarfs and trolls   and there was more   yes  call it venom in the air .  too much ancient politics  too many chips handed down from shoulder to shoulder .  too much boozing  too .   and then  just when you thought it was as bad as it could be  up popped grag hamcrusher and his chums .  deep downers  they were called  dwarfs as fundamental as the bedrock .  they   d turned up a month ago  occupied some old house in treacle street  and had hired a bunch of local lads to open up the basements .  they were    grags .     vimes knew just enough dwarfish to know that    grag    meant    renowned master of dwarfish lore     but hamcrusher had mastered it in his own special way .  he preached the superiority of dwarf over troll  and that the duty of every dwarf was to follow in the footsteps of their forefathers and remove trollkind from the face of the world .  it was written in some holy book  apparently  so that made it okay  and probably compulsory .   young dwarfs listened to him  because he talked about history and destiny and all the other words that always got trotted out to put a gloss on slaughter .  it was heady stuff  except that brains weren   t involved .  malign idiots like him were the reason you saw dwarfs walking around now not just with the    cultural    battle axes but heavy mail  chains  morningstars  broadswords   all the dumb  in your face swaggering that was known as    clang .      trolls listened  too .  you saw more lichen  more clan graffiti  more body carving  and much  much bigger clubs being dragged around .   it hadn   t always been like this .  things had loosened up a lot in the last ten years or so .  dwarfs and trolls as races would never be chums  but the city stirred them together  and it had seemed to vimes that they had managed to get along with no more than surface abrasions .   now the melting pot was full of lumps again .   gods damn hamcrusher .  vimes itched to arrest him .  technically  he was doing nothing wrong  but that was no barrier to a copper who knew his business .  he could certainly get him under    behavior likely to cause a breach of the peace .     vetinari had been against it  though .  he   d said it   d only inflame the situation  but how much worse could it get .   vimes closed his eyes and recalled that little figure  dressed in heavy black leather robes and hooded so that he would not commit the crime of seeing daylight .  a little figure  but with big words .  he remembered     beware of the troll .  trust him not .  turn him from your door .  he is nothing  a mere accident of forces  unwritten  unclean  the mineral world   s pale  jealous echo of living  thinking creatures .  in his head  a rock  in his heart  a stone .  he does not build  he does not delve  he neither plants nor harvests .  his nascence was a deed of theft and everywhere he drags his club he steals .  when not thieving  he plans theft .  the only purpose in his miserable life is its ending  relieving from the wretched rock his all too heavy burden of thought .  i say this in sadness .  to kill the troll is no murder .  at its very worst  it is an act of charity .      it was about that time that the mob had broken into the hall .   that was how much worse it could be .  vimes blinked at the newspaper again  this time seeking anything that dared suggest that people in ankh morpork still lived in the real world        oh  damn .     he got up and hurried down the stairs  where cheery practically cowered at his thundering approach .      did we know about this .     he demanded  thumping the paper down on the occurrences ledger .      know about what  sir .     said cheery nervously .   vimes prodded a short  illustrated article on page four  his finger stabbing at the page .      see that .     he growled .     that pea brained idiot at the post office has only gone and issued a koom valley stamp .      the dwarf looked nervously at the article .     er   two stamps  sir     she said .   vimes looked closer .  he hadn   t taken in much of the detail before the red mist descended .  oh yes  two stamps .  they were very nearly identical .  they both showed koom valley  a rocky area ringed by mountains .  they both showed the battle .  but in one  little figures of trolls were pursuing dwarfs from right to left  and in the other  dwarfs were chasing trolls from left to right .  koom valley  where the trolls ambushed the dwarfs and the dwarfs ambushed the trolls .  vimes groaned .  pick your own stupid history  a snip at ten pence  highly collectible .         the koom valley memorial issue        he read .     but we don   t want them to remember it .  we want them to forget it .         it   s only stamps  sir     said cheery .     i mean  there   s no law against stamps           there ought to be one against being a bloody fool .         if there was  sir  we   d be on overtime every day .     said cheery  grinning .   vimes relaxed a little .     yep  and no one could build cells fast enough .  remember the cabbage scented stamp last month .     send your expatriate sons and daughters the familiar odor of home    .  they actually caught fire if you put too many of them together .         i still can   t get the smell out of my clothes  sir .         there are people living a hundred miles away who can   t  i reckon .  what did we do with the bloody things in the end .         i put them in no .    evidence locker and left the key in the lock     said cheery .      but nobby nobbs always steals anything that       vimes began .      that   s right  sir .     said cheery happily .     i haven   t seen them for weeks .      there was a crash from the direction of the canteen  followed by shouting .  something in vimes  perhaps the very part of him that had been waiting for the first shoe  propelled him across the office  down the passage  and to the canteen   s doorway at a speed that left dust spiraling on the floor .   what met his eyes was a tableau in various shades of guilt .  one of the trestle tables had been knocked over .  food and cheap tinware were strewn across the floor .  on one side of the mess was troll constable mica  currently being held between troll constables bluejohn and schist  on the other was dwarf constable brakenshield  currently being lifted off the ground by probably human corporal nobbs and definitely human constable haddock .   there were watchmen at the other tables  too  all caught in the act of rising .  and  in the silence  audible only to the fine tuned ears of a man searching for it  was the sound of hands pausing an inch away from the weapon of choice and very slowly being lowered .      all right     said vimes in the ringing vacuum .     who   s going to be the first to tell me a huge whopper .  corporal nobbs .         well  mr .  vimes     said nobby nobbs  dropping the mute brakensheild to the floor        er   brakensheild here   picked up mica   s   yes  picked up mica   s mug by mistake  as it were   and   we all spotted that and jumped up  yes       nobby speeded up now  the really steep fibs now successfully negotiated        and that   s how the table got knocked over      cos     and here nobby   s face assumed an expression of virtuous imbecility that was really quite frightening to see     he   d have really hurt himself if he   d taken a swig of troll coffee  sir .      inside  vimes sighed .  as stupid  lame excuses went  it wasn   t actually a bad one .  for one thing  it had the virtue of being completely unbelievable .  no dwarf would come close to picking up a mug of troll expresso  which was a molten chemical stew with rust sprinkled on the top .  everyone knew this  just as everyone knew that vimes could see that brakensheild was holding an axe over his head and constable bluejohn was still frozen in the act of wrenching a club off mica .  and everyone knew  too  that vimes was in the mood to sack the first bloody idiot to make a wrong move  and probably anyone standing near him .      that   s what it was  was it .     said vimes .     so it wasn   t  as it might be  someone making a nasty remark about a fellow officer and others of his race  perhaps .  some little bit of stupidity to add to the mess of it that   s floating around the streets right now .         oh  nothing like that  sir     said nobby .     just one of them   things .         nearly a nasty accident  was it .     said vimes .      yessir .         well  we don   t want any nasty accidents  do we  nobby           nosir .         none of us want nasty accidents  i expect     said vimes  looking around the room .  some of the constables  he was grimly glad to see  were sweating with the effort of not moving .     and it   s so easy to have    em  when your mind isn   t firmly on the job .  understood .      there was a general muttering .      i can   t hear you .      this time there were audible riffs on the theme of    yessir .         right     snapped vimes .     now get out there and keep the peace  because as sure as hell you won   t do it in here .     he directed a special glare at constables brakenshield and mica  and strode back to the main office  where he almost bumped into sergeant angua .      sorry  sir  i was just fetching       she began .      i sorted it out  don   t worry     said vimes .     but it was that close .         some of the dwarfs are really on edge  sir .  i can smell it     said angua .      you and fred colon     said vimes .      i don   t think it   s just the hamcrusher thing  sir .  it   s something   dwarfish .         well  i can   t beat it out of them .  and just when the day couldn   t get any worse  i   ve got to interview a damned vampire .      too late vimes saw the urgent look in angua   s eyes .      ah   i think that would be me     said a small voice behind him .       fred colon and nobby nobbs  having been rousted from their lengthy coffee break  proceeded gently up broad way  giving the ol    uniform an airing .  what with one thing or another  it was probably a good idea not to be back at the yard for a while .   they walked like men who had all day .  they did have all day .  they had chosen this particular street because it was busy and wide and you didn   t get too many trolls and dwarfs in this part of town .  the reasoning was faultless .  in lots of areas  right now  dwarfs or trolls were wandering around in groups or  alternatively  staying still in groups in case any of those wandering bastards tried any trouble in this neighborhood .  there had been little flare ups for weeks .  in these areas  nobby and fred considered  there wasn   t much peace  so it was a waste of effort to keep what little was left of it  right .  you wouldn   t try keeping sheep in places where all the sheep got eaten by wolves  right .  it stood to reason .  it would look silly .  whereas in big streets like broad way there was lots of peace  which  obviously  needed keeping .  common sense told them this was true .  it was as plain as the nose on your face  and especially the one on nobby   s face .      bad business     said colon  as they strolled .     i   ve never seen the dwarfs like this .         it always gets tricky  sarge  just before koom valley day     nobby observed .      yeah  but hamcrusher   s really got them on the boil and no mistake .     colon removed his helmet and wiped his brow .     i told sam about my water  and he was impressed .         well  he would be     nobby agreed .     it would impress anyone .      colon tapped his nose .     there   s a storm coming  nobby .         not a cloud in the sky  sarge     nobby observed .      figure of speech  nobby  figure of speech .     colon sighed and glanced sideways at his friend .  when he continued  it was in the hesitant tones of a man with something on his mind .     as a matter of fact  nobby  there was another matter about which  per say  i wanted to speak to you about  man to       there was only the tiniest hesitation        man .         yes  sarge .         now you know  nobby  that i   ve always taken a pers   nal interest in your moral well being  what with you havin    no dad to put your feet on the proper path           that   s right  sarge .  i would have strayed no end if you hadn   t     said nobby virtuously .      well  you know you was telling me about that girl you   re goin    out with  what was her name  now           tawneee  sarge .         that   s the   bunny .  the one you said worked in a club  right .         that   s right .  is there a problem  sarge .     said nobby anxiously .      not as such .  but when you was on your day off last week  me an    constable jolson got called into the pink pussycat club  nobby .  you know .  there   s pole dancing and table dancing and stuff of that nature .  and you know ol    mrs .  spudding what lives in new cobblers .         ol    mrs .  spudding with the wooden teeth  sarge .         the very same  nobby     said colon magisterially .     she does the cleaning in there .  and it appears that when she come in at eight o   clock in the morning ae em  with no one else about  nobby  well  i hardly like to say this  but it appears she took it into her head to have a twirl on the pole .      they shared a moment of silence as nobby ran this image in the cinema of his imagination and hastily consigned much of it to the cutting room floor .      but she must be seventy five  sarge .     he said  staring at nothing in fascinated horror .      a girl can dream  nobby  a girl can dream .  o   course  she forgot she wasn   t as limber as she used to be  plus she got her foot caught in her long drawers and panicked when her dress fell over her head .  she was in a bad way when the manager came in  having been upside down for three hours  with her false teeth fallen out on the floor .  wouldn   t let go of the pole  too .  not a pretty sight  i trust i do not have to draw you a picture .  come the finish  precious jolson had to rip the pole out top and bottom and we slid her off .  that girl   s got the muscles of a troll  nobby  i   ll swear it .  and then  nobby  when we was bringing her    round behind the scenes  this young lady wearing two sequins and a bootlace comes up and says she   s a friend of yours .  i did not know where to put my face .         you   re not supposed to put it anywhere  sarge .  they throw you out for that sort of thing     observed nobby .      you never told me she was a pole dancer  nobby .     fred wailed .      don   t say it like that  sarge .     nobby sounded a little hurt .     this is modern times .  and she   s got class  tawneee has .  she even brings her own pole .  no hanky panky .         but  i mean   showin    her body off in lewd ways  nobby .  dancing around without her vest and practic   ly no drawers on .  is that any way to behave .      nobby considered this deep metaphysical question from various angles .      er   yes .     he ventured .      anyway  i thought you were still walking out with verity pushpram .  that   s a handy little seafood stall she runs     colon said  sounding as though he was pleading a case .      oh  hammerhead   s a nice girl if you catch her on a good day  sarge     nobby conceded .      you mean those days when she doesn   t tell you to bugger off and chases you down the street throwing crabs at you .         exactly those days  sarge .  but good or bad  you can never get rid of the smell of fish .  and her eyes are too far apart .  i mean  it   s hard to get a relationship goin    with a girl who can   t see you if you stand right in front of her .         i shouldn   t think tawneee can see you if you   re up close  either .     colon burst out .     she   s nearly six feet tall and she   s got a bosom like   well  she   s a big girl  nobby .     fred colon was at a loss .  nobby nobbs and a dancer with big hair  a big smile  and   general bigitigy .  look upon this picture  and on this .  it did your head in  it really did .   he struggled on .     she told me  nobby  that she   d been miss may on the centerfold of girls  giggles and garters .  well  i mean    .         what do you mean  sarge .  anyway  she wasn   t just miss may  she was the first week in june as well     nobby pointed out .     it was the only way they had room .         err   well  i ask you     fred floundered     is a girl who displays her body for money the kind of wife for a copper .  ask yourself that .      for the second time in five minutes  what passed for nobby   s face wrinkled up in deep thought .      is this a trick question  sarge .     he said at last .        cos i know for a fact that haddock has got that picture pinned up in his locker and every time he opens it he goes     pwaor  will you look at th               how did you meet her  anyway .     said colon quickly .      what .  oh  our eyes met when i shoved an iou in her garter  sarge     said nobby happily .      and   she hadn   t just been hit on the head  or something .         i don   t think so  sarge .         she   s not   ill  is she .     said fred colon  exploring every likelihood .      no  sarge .         are you sure .         she says perhaps we   re two halves of the same soul  sarge     said nobby dreamily .   colon stopped with one foot raised above the pavement .  he stared at nothing  his lips moving .      sarge .     said nobby  puzzled by this .      yeah   yeah     said colon  more or less to himself .     yeah .  i can see that .  not the same stuff in each half  obviously .  sort of   sieved        the foot landed .      i say .      it was more of a bleat than a cry  and it came from the door of the royal art museum .  a tall  thin figure was beckoning to the watchmen  who strolled over .      yessir .     said colon  touching his helmet .      we   ve had a burglareah  officer .         burglar rear .     said nobby .      oh dear  sir     said colon  putting a warning hand on the corporal   s shoulders .     anything taken .         years .  i rather think that   s hwhy it was a burglareah  you see .     said the man .  he had the attitude of a preoccupied chicken  but fred colon was impressed .  you could barely understand the man  he was that posh .  it was not so much speech as modulated yawning .     i   m sir reynold stitched  the curator of fine art  and i was hwalking through the long gallereah and   oh  dear  they took the rascal .      the man looked at two blank faces .      methodia rascal .     he tried .     the battle of koom valley .     it is a priceless work of art .      colon hitched up his stomach .     ah     he said     that   s serious .  we   d better take a look at it .  er   i mean  the locale where it was situated in .         years  years  of course     said sir reynold .     do come this hway .  i am given to understand that the modern hwatch can learn a lot just by looking at the place where a thing was  is that not so .         like  that it   s gone .     said nobby .     oh  years .  we   re good at that .         er   quite so     said sir reynold .     do come this way .      the watchmen followed .  they had been inside the museum before  of course .  most citizens had  on days when no better entertainment presented itself .  under the governance of lord vetinari it hosted fewer modern exhibitions these days  since his lordship held views  but a gentle stroll among the ancient tapestries and rather brown and dusty paintings was a pleasant way of spending an afternoon .  plus  it was always nice to look at the pictures of big pink women with no clothes on .   nobby was having a problem .     here  sarge  what   s he going on about .     he whispered .     it sounds like he   s yawning all the time .  what a galler rear .         a gallery  nobby .  that   s very high class talkin     that is .         i can hardly understand him .         shows it   s high class  nobby .  it wouldn   t be much good if people like you could understand  right .         good point  sarge     nobby conceded .     i hadn   t thought of that .         you found it missing this morning  sir .     said colon  as they trailed after the curator into a gallery still littered with ladders and dust sheets .      years indeed .         so it was stolen last night  then .      sir reynold hesitated .      er   not necessarileah  i   m afraid .  we have been refurbishing the long gallereah .  the picture was too big to move  of course  so hwe had it covered in heavy dust sheets for the past month .  but when we took them down this morning  there hwas only the frame .  observe .      the rascal occupied   or rather  had occupied   an actual frame some ten feet high and fifty feet long  which  as such  was pretty close to being a work of art in its own right .  it was still there  framing nothing but uneven  dusty plaster .      i suppose some rich private collector has it now     sir reynold moaned .     but how could he keep it a secret .  the mural is one of the most recognizable paintings in the hworld .  every civilized person hwould spot it in an instant .         what did it look like .     said fred colon .   sir reynold performed that downshift of assumptions that was the normal response to any conversation with ankh morpork   s finest .      i can probableah find you a copy     he said weakly .     but the original is fifty feet long .  have you never seen it .         well  i remember being brought to see it when i was a kiddie  but it   s a bit long  really .  you can   t really see it  anyway .  i mean  by the time you get to the other end you   ve forgotten what was happening back up the line  as it were .         alas  that is regrettableah true  sergeant     said sir reynold .     and hwhat is so vexing is that the hwhole point of this refurbishment hwas to build a special circular room to hold the rascal .  his ideah  you know  hwas that the viewer should be hwholly encircled by the mural and feel right in the thick of the action  as it hwere .  you hwould be there in koom valleah .  he called it panoscopic art .  say hwhat you like about the current interest  but the extra visitors hwould have made it possible to display the picture as hwe believe he intended it to be displayed .  and now this .         if you were going to move it  why didn   t you just take it down and put it away nice and safe  sir .         you mean roll it up .     said sir reynold  horrified .     that could cause such a lot of damage .  oh  the horror .  no  hwe had a very careful exercise planned for next wheek  to be done with the utmost diligence .     he shuddered .     hwhen i think of someone just hacking it out of the frame i feel quite faint           hey  this must be a clue  sarge .     said nobby  who had returned to his default activity of mooching about and poking at things to see if they were valuable .     look  someone dumped a load of stinking ol    rubbish here .      he   d wandered across to a plinth  which did  indeed  appear to be piled high with rags .      don   t touch that  please .     said sir reynold  rushing over .     that   s don   t talk to me about mondays .  it   s daniellarina pouter   s most controversial hwork .  you didn   t move anything  did you .     he added nervously .     it   s literalleah priceless  and she   s got a sharp tongue on her .         it   s only a lot of old rubbish     nobby protested  backing away .      art is greater than the sum of its mere mechanical components  corporal     said the curator .     surely you hwould not say that caravati   s three large pink women and one piece of gauze is just  ahem     a lot of old pigment    .         what about this one  then .     said nobby  pointing to the adjacent plinth .     it   s just a big stake with a nail in it .  is this art  too .         freedom .  if it hwas ever on the market  it hwould probableah fetch thirty thousand dollars     said sir reynold .      for a bit of wood with a nail in it .     said fred colon .     who did it .         after he viewed don   t talk to me about mondays .   lord vetinari graciousleah had ms .  pouter nailed to the stake by her ear     said stitched .     however  she did manage to pull free during the afternoon .         i bet she was mad .     said nobby .      not after she hwon several awards for it .  i believe she   s planning to nail herself to several other things .  it could be a very exciting exhibition .         tell you what  then  sir     said nobby cheerfully .     why don   t you leave the ol    big frame where it is and give it a new name  like art theft .         no     said sir reynold coldly .     that would be foolish .      shaking his head at the way of the world  fred colon walked right up to the wall so cruelly   or cruelleah   denuded of its covering .  the painting had been crudely cut from its frame .  sergeant colon was not a high speed thinker  but that point struck him as odd .  if you   ve got a month to pinch a painting  why botch the job .  fred had a copper   s view of humanity that differed in some respects from that of the curator .  never say that people wouldn   t do something  no matter how strange it was .  probably there were some mad rich people out there who would buy the painting  even if it meant only ever viewing it in the privacy of their own mansion .  people could be like that .  in fact  knowing that this was their big secret probably gave them a lonely  tight little shiver inside .   but the thieves had slashed the painting out as if they didn   t care about making a sale .  there were several ragged inches all along the   just a moment     fred stood back .  a clue .  there it was  right there .  he got lovely  tight little shiver inside .      this painting     he declared     this painting   this painting which isn   t here  i mean  obviously  was stolen by a   troll .         my goodness  how can you tell .     said sir reynold .      i   m very glad you asked me that question  sir     said fred colon  who was .     i have detected  you see  that the top of the circular muriel was cut really close to the frame .     he pointed .     now  your troll would easily be able to reach up with his knife  right  and cut along the edge of the frame at the top and down a bit on each side  see .  but your average troll don   t bend that well  so when it come to cutting along the bottom  right  he made a bit of a mess of the job and left it all jagged .  plus  only a troll could carry it away .  a stair carpet   s bad enough  and a rolled up muriel would be a lot heavier than that .      he beamed .      well done  sergeant .     said the curator .      good thinking  fred     said nobby .      thank you  corporal     said fred colon generously .      or it could have been a couple of dwarfs with a stepladder     nobby went on cheerfully .     the decorators have left a few behind .  they   re all over the place .      fred colon sighed .      y   see  nobby     he said     it   s comments like that  made in front of a member of the public  that are the reason why i   m a sergeant and you ain   t .  if it was dwarfs  it would be neat all    round  obviously .  is this place locked up at night  mr .  sir reynold .         of course .  not just locked  but barred .  old john is meticulous about it .  and he lives in the attics  so he can make this place like a fortress .         this   d be the caretaker .     said fred .     we   ll need to talk to him .         certainly you may     said sir reynold nervously .     now  i think hwe may have some details about the painting in our storeroom .  i   ll  er  just go and  er  find them        he hurried off toward a small doorway .      i wonder how they got it out .     said nobby  when they were alone .      who says they did .     said fred colon .     big place like this  full of attics and cellars and odd corners  well  why not stash it away and wait awhile .  you get in as a customer one day  see  hide under a sheet  take out the muriel in the night  hide it somewhere  then go out with the customers next day .  simple  eh .     he beamed at nobby .     you   ve got to outsmart the criminal mind  see .         or they could   ve just smashed down a door and pushed off with the muriel in the middle of the night     said nobby .     why mess about with a cunning plan when a simple one will do .      fred sighed .     i can see this is going to be a complicated case  nobby .         you should ask vimesy if we can have it  then     said nobby .     i mean  we already know the facts  right .      hovering in the air  unsaid  was  where would you like to be in the next few days .  out there  where the axes and clubs are likely to be flying  or in here  searching all the attics and cellars very  very carefully .  think about it .  and it wouldn   t be cowardice  right .     cos a famous muriel like this is bound to be part of our national heritage  right .  even if it is just a painting of a load of dwarfs and trolls having a scrap .      i think i will do a proper report and suggest to mr .  vimes that maybe we should handle this one     said fred colon slowly .     it needs the attention of mature officers .  d   you know much about art  nobby .         if necessary  sarge .         oh  come on  nobby .         what .  tawneee says what she does is art  sarge .  and she wears more clothes than a lot of the women on the walls around here  so why be sniffy about it .         yeah  but       fred colon hesitated here .  he knew in his heart that spinning upside down around a pole wearing a costume you could floss with definitely was not art  and being painted lying on a bed wearing nothing but a smile and a small bunch of grapes was good solid art  but putting your finger on why this was the case was a bit tricky .      no urns     he said at last .      what urns .     said nobby .      nude women are only art if there   s an urn in it     said fred colon .  this sounded a bit weak even to him  so he added     or a plinth .  both is best  o   course .  it   s a secret sign  see  that they put in to say that it   s art and okay to look at .         what about a potted plant .         that   s okay if it   s in an urn .         what about if it   s not got an urn or a plinth or a potted plant .     said nobby .      have you one in mind  nobby .     said colon suspiciously .      yes  the goddess anoia arising from the cutlery     said nobby .     they   ve got it here .  it was painted by a bloke with three i   s in his name  which sounds pretty artistic to me .         the number of i   s is important  nobby     said sergeant colon gravely     but in these situations you have to ask yourself     where   s the cherub .     if there   s a little fat pink kid holding a mirror or a fan or similar  then it   s still okay .  even if he   s grinning .  obviously you can   t get urns everywhere .         all right  but supposing       nobby began  the distant door opened  and sir reynold came hurrying across the marble floor with a book under his arm .      ah  i   m afraid there is no copy of the painting     he said .     clearly  a copy that did it justice hwould be quite hard to make .  but  er  this rather sensationalist treatise has many detailed sketches  at least .  these days every visitor seems to have a copy  of course .  did you know that more than two thousand four hundred and ninety individual dwarfs and trolls can be identified by armor or body markings in the original picture .  it drove rascal quite mad  poor fellow .  it took him sixteen years to complete .         that   s nothing     said nobby cheerfully .     fred here hasn   t finished painting his kitchen yet  and he started twenty years ago .         thank you for that  nobby     said colon coldly .  he took the book from the curator .  the title was the koom valley codex .     mad how .     he said .      hwell  he neglected his other hwork  you see .  he hwas constantly moving his lodgings  because he couldn   t pay the rent and he had to drag that huge canvas with him .  imagine .  he had to beg for paints in the street  hwhich took up a lot of his time  since not many people have a tube of burnt umber on them .  he said it talked to him  too .  you   ll find it all in there .  rather dramatized  i fear .         the painting talked to him .      sir reynold made a face .     hwe believe that   s hwhat he meant .  hwe don   t really know .  he did not have any friends .  he hwas convinced that if he hwent to sleep at night he hwould turn into a chicken .  he   d leave little notes for himself saying    you are not a chicken     although sometimes he thought he hwas lying .  the general belief is that he concentrated so much on the painting that it gave him some kind of brain fever .  toward the end he hwas sure he hwas losing his mind .  he said he could hearh the battle .         how do you know that  sir .     said fred colon .     you said he didn   t have any friends .         ah  the incisive intellect of the policeman .     said sir reynold  smiling .     he left notes to himself  sergeant .  all the time .  hwhen his last landlady entered his room  she found many hundreds of them  stuffed in old chicken feed sacks .  fortunately  she couldn   t read  and since she   d fixed in her mind the idea that the lodger hwas some sort of genius and therefore might have something she could sell  she called in a neighbor  a miss adelina happily  hwho painted hwatercolors  and miss happily called in a friend hwho framed pictures  hwho hurriedly summoned ephraim dowster  the noted landscape artist .  scholars have puzzled over the notes ever since  seeking some insight into the poor man   s tortured mind .  they are not in order  you see .  some are very   odd .         odder than    you are not a chicken    .     said fred .      yes     said sir reynold .     oh  there is stuff about voices  omens  ghosts   he also hwrote his journal on random pieces of paper  you know  and never gave any indication as to the date or hwhere he hwas staying  in case the chicken found him .  and he used very guarded language  because he didn   t hwant the chicken to find out .         sorry  i thought you said he thought he was the chic       colon began .      hwho can fathom the thought processes of the sadleah disturbed  sergeant     said sir reynold wearily .      er   and does the painting talk .     said nobby nobbs .     stranger things have happened  right .         ahah  no     said sir reynold .     at least  not in my time .  ever since that book hwas reprinted  there   s been a guard in here during visiting hours  and he says it has never uttered a hword .  certainlyeah it has always fascinated people and there have always been stories about hidden treasure there .  that is hwhy the book has been republished .  people love a mystereah  don   t they .         not us     said fred colon .      i don   t even know what a mister rear is     said nobby  leafing through the codex .     here  i heard about this book .  my friend dave who runs the stamp shop says there   s this story about a dwarf  right  who turned up in this town near koom valley more   n two weeks after the battle  an    he was all injured    cos he   d been ambushed by trolls  an    starvin     right  an    no one knew much dwarfish  but it was like he wanted them to follow him  and he kept sayin    this word over and over again  which turned out  right  to be dwarfish for    treasure     right  only when they followed him back to the valley  right  he died on the way  an    they never found nothin     an    then this artist bloke found some   thing in koom valley and hid the place where he   s found it in this painting  but it drove him bananas .  like it was haunted  dave said .  he said the government hushed it up .         yeah  but your mate dave says the government always hushes things up  nobby     said fred .      well  they do .         except he always gets to hear about    em  and he never gets hushed up     said fred .      i know you like to point the finger of scoff  sarge  but there   s a lot goes on that we don   t know about .         like what  exactly .     colon retorted .     name me one thing that   s going on that you don   t know about .  there   you can   t  can you .      sir reynold cleared his throat .     that is certainly one of the theories     he said  speaking carefully  as people tended to after hearing the colon nobbs brains trust crossing purposes .     regrettably  methodia rascal   s notes support just about any theory one may prefer .  the current populariteah of the painting is  i suspect  because the book does indeed revisit the old story that there   s some huge secret hidden in the painting .         oh .     said fred colon  perking up .     what kind of secret .         i have no idea .  the landscape hwas painted in great detail .  a pointer to a secret cave  perhaps .  something about the positioning of some of the combatants .  there are all kinds of theories .  rather strange people come along with tape measures and rather hworryingly intent expressions  but i don   t think they ever find anything .         perhaps one of them pinched it .     nobby suggested .      i doubt it .  they tend to be rather furtive individuals who bring sandwiches and a flask and stay here all day .  the sort of people who love anagrams and secret signs and have little theories and pimples .  probably quite harmless except to one another .  besides  hwhy steal it .  we like people to take an interest in it .  i don   t think that kind of person hwould hwant to take it home  because it hwould be too large to fit under the bed .  did you know that rascal hwrote that sometimes in the night he heard screams .  the noise of battle  one is forced to assume .  so sad .         not something you   d want over the fireplace  then     said fred colon .      precisely  sergeant .  even if it hwere possible to have a fireplace fifty feet long .         thank you  sir .  one other thing  though .  how many doors are there in this place .         three     said sir reynold promptly .     but two are always locked .         but if the troll              or the dwarfs     said nobby .      or  as my junior colleague points out  the dwarfs tried to get it out           gargoyles     said sir reynold proudly .     two hwatch the main door constantleah from the building opposite  and there   s one each on the other doors .  and there are staff on during the day  of course .         this may sound a silly question  sir  but have you looked everywhere .         i   ve had the staff searching all morning  sergeant .  it hwould be a very big and very heavy roll .  this place is full of odd corners  but it hwould be very obvious .      colon saluted .     thank you  sir .  we   ll just have a look around  if you don   t mind .         yes  for urns     said nobby nobbs .       vimes eased himself into his chair and looked at the damned vampire .  she could have passed for sixteen  it was certainly hard to believe that she was not a lot younger than vimes .  she had short hair  which vimes had never seen on a vampire before  and looked  if not like a boy  then like a girl who wouldn   t mind passing for one .      sorry about the   remark down there     he said .     it   s not been a good week and it   s getting worse by the hour .         you don   t have to be frightened     said sally .     if it   s any help  i don   t like this any more than you do .         i am not frightened     said vimes sharply .      sorry  mr .  vimes .  you smell frightened .  not badly     sally added .     but just a bit .  and your heart is beating faster .  i am sorry if i have offended you .  i was just trying to put you at your ease .      vimes leaned back .     don   t try to put me at my ease  miss von humpeding     he said .     it makes me nervous when people do that .  it   s not as though i have any ease to be put at .  and do not comment on my smell  either  thank you .  oh  and it   s commander vimes  or    sir     understand .  not    mister vimes .             and i would prefer to be called sally     said the vampire .   they looked at each other  both aware that this was not going well  both uncertain that they could make it go any better .      so      sally      you want to be a copper .     said vimes .      a policeman .  yes .         any history of policing in your family .     said vimes .  it was a standard opening question .  it always helped if they   d inherited some idea about coppering .      no  just the throat biting     said sally .   there was another pause .   vimes sighed .      look  i just want to know one thing     he said .     did john not a vampire at all smith and doreen winkings put you up to this .         no .     said sally .     i approached them .  and if it   s any help to you  i didn   t think there   d be all this fuss  either .      vimes looked surprised .      but you applied to join     he said .      yes  but i don   t see why there has to be all this   interest .         don   t blame me .  that was your league of temperance .         really .  your lord vetinari was quoted in the newspaper     said sally .     all that stuff about the lack of species discrimination being in the finest traditions of the watch .         hah .     said vimes .     well  it   s true that a copper   s a copper  as far as i   m concerned  but the fine traditions of the watch  miss von humpeding  largely consist of finding somewhere out of the rain  mumping for free beer    round the backs of pubs  and always keeping two notebooks .         you don   t want me  then .     said sally .     i thought you needed all the recruits you could get .  look  i   m probably stronger than anyone on your payroll who isn   t a troll  i   m quite clever  i don   t mind hard work  and i   ve got excellent night vision .  i can be useful .  i want to be useful .         can you turn into a bat .      she looked shocked .     what .  what kind of question is that to ask me .         probably among the less tricky ones     said vimes .     besides  it might be useful .  can you .         no .         oh  well  never mind           i can turn into a lot of bats     said sally .     one bat is hard to do  because you have to deal with changes in body mass  and you can   t do that if you   ve been reformed for a while .  anyway  it gives me a headache .         what was your last job .         didn   t have one .  i was a musician .      vimes brightened up .      really .  some of the lads have been talking about setting up a watch band .         could they use a cello .         probably not .      vimes drummed his fingers on his desk .  well  she hadn   t gone for his throat yet  had she .  that was the problem  of course .  vampires were fine right up until the point where  suddenly  they weren   t .  but  in truth  right now  he had to admit it  he needed anyone who could stand upright and finish a sentence .  this damn business was taking its toll .  he needed men out there all the time  just to keep the lid on things .  oh  right now it was just scuffles and stone throwing and breaking windows and running away  but all that stuff added up  like snowflakes on an avalanche slope .  people needed to see coppers at a time like this .  they gave the illusion that the whole world hadn   t gone insane .   and the temperance league was pretty good and very supportive of its members .  it was in the interests of all members that no one found themselves standing in a strange bedroom with an embarrassingly full feeling .  they   d be watching her        we   ve got no room for passengers in the watch     he said .     we   re too pressed right now to give you any more than what is laughingly known as on the job training  but you   ll be on the streets from day one   er  how are you with the daylight thing .         i   m fine with long sleeves and a wide brim .  i carry the kit  anyway .      vimes nodded .  a small dustpan and brush  a vial of animal blood  and a small card saying       help  i have crumbled and i can   t get up .  please sweep me into a heap and crush vial .  i am a black ribboner and will not harm you .  thanking you in advance .     his fingers rattled on the desktop again .  she returned his stare .      all right  you   re in     vimes said at last .     on probation  to start with .  everyone starts that way .  sort out the paperwork with sergeant littlebottom downstairs  report to sergeant detritus for your gear and orientation lecture  and try not to laugh .  and now you   ve got what you want  and we   re not being official   tell me why .         pardon .     said sally .      a vampire wanting to be a copper .     said vimes  leaning back in his chair .     i can   t quite make that fit     sally .             i thought it would be an interesting job in the fresh air  which would offer opportunities to help people  commander vimes .         hmm     said vimes .     if you can say that without smiling  you might make a copper after all .  welcome to the job  lance constable .  i hope you have        the door slammed .  captain carrot took two steps into the room  saw sally  and hesitated .      lance constable von humpeding has just joined us  captain     said vimes .      er   fine   hello  miss     said carrot quickly  and turned to vimes .     sir  someone   s killed hamcrusher .          ankh morpork   s finest strolled back down toward the yard .      what i   d do     said nobby     is cut the painting up into little bits  like  oh  a few inches across .         that   s diamonds  nobby .  it   s how you get rid of stolen diamonds .         all right  then  how about this one .  you cut the muriel up into bits the size of ordinary paintings  okay .  then you paint a painting on the other side of each one  an    put    em in frames  an    leave    em around the place .  no one will notice extra paintings  right .  an    then you can go an    pinch    em when the fuss has died down .         and how do you get them out  nobby .         well  first you get some glue  and a really long stick  and        fred colon shook his head .     can   t see it happening  nobby .         all right  then  you get some paint that   s the same color as the walls  and you glue the painting to the wall somewhere it   ll fit  and you paint over it with your wall paint so it looks just like the wall .         got a convenient bit of wall in mind  then .         how about inside the frame that   s there already  sarge .         bloody hell  nobby  that   s clever     said fred  stopping dead .      thank you  sarge .  that means a lot  coming from you .         but you   ve still got to get it out  nobby .         remember all those dust sheets  sarge .  i bet in a few weeks    time a couple of blokes in overalls will be able to walk out of the place with a big white roll under their arms and no one   d think twice about it     cos they   d  like  be thinkin    the muriel had been pinched weeks before .      there were a few moments of silence before sergeant colon said  in a hushed voice     that   s a very dangerous mind you got there  nobby .  very dangerous indeed .  how   d you get the new paint off  though .         oh  that   s easy     said nobby .     and i know where to get some painters    aprons  too .         nobby .     said fred  shocked .      all right  sarge .  you can   t blame a man for dreaming  though .         this could be a feather in our caps  nobby .  and we could do with one now .         your water playing up again  sarge .         you may laugh  nobby  but you   ve only got to look around     said fred gloomily .     it   s just gang fights now  but it   s going to get worse  you mark my words .  all this scrapping over something that happened thousands of years ago .  i don   t know why they don   t get back to where they came from if they want to do that .         most of    em come from here now     observed nobby .   fred grunted his disdain for a mere fact of geography .      war  nobby .  huh .  what is it good for .     he said .      dunno  sarge .  freeing slaves  maybe .         absol   well  okay .         defending yourself against a totalitarian aggressor .         all right  i   ll grant you that  but           saving civilization from a horde of           it doesn   t do any good in the long run is what i   m saying  nobby  if you   d listen for five seconds together     said fred colon sharply .      yeah  but in the long run  what does  sarge .             say that again  paying attention to every word  will you .     said vimes .      he   s dead  sir .  hamcrusher is dead .  the dwarfs are sure of it .      vimes stared at his captain .  then he glanced at sally and said     i gave you an order  lance constable von humpeding .  go and get joined up .      when the girl had hurried out  he said     i hope you   re sure about it as well  captain           it   s spreading through the dwarfs like  like       carrot began .      alcohol .     vimes suggested .      very fast  anyway     carrot conceded .     last night  they say .  a troll got into his place in treacle street and beat him to death .  i heard some of the lads talking about it .         carrot  wouldn   t we know if something like that had happened .     said vimes  but in theater of his mind  angua and fred colon uttered their cassandraic warnings again .  the dwarfs knew something .  the dwarfs were worried .      don   t we  sir .     said carrot .     i mean  i   ve just told you .         why aren   t his people shouting it in the streets .  political assassination and all that sort of thing .  shouldn   t they be screaming bloody murder .  who told you this .         constable ironbender and corporal ringfounder  sir .  they   re steady lads .  ringfounder   s up for sergeant soon .  er   there was something else  sir .  i did ask them why we hadn   t heard officially  and ironbender said   you won   t like this  sir   he said the watch wasn   t to be told .     carrot watched vimes carefully .  it was hard to see the change of expression on the commander   s face  but certain small muscles set firmly .      on whose orders .     said vimes .      someone called ardent  apparently .  he   s hamcrusher   s   interpreter  i suppose you could say .  he says it   s dwarf business .         but this is ankh morpork  captain .  and murder is murder .         yes  sir .         and we are the city watch     vimes went on .     it says so on the door .         actually  it mostly says copers are barstuds on the door at the moment  but i   ve got someone scrubbing it off     said carrot .     and i           that means if anyone gets murdered  we   re responsible     said vimes .      i know what you mean  sir     said carrot carefully .      does vetinari know .         i can   t imagine that he doesn   t .         me neither .     vimes thought for a moment .     what about the times .  there   s plenty of dwarfs working there .         i   d be surprised if they passed it on to humans  sir .  i only got to hear about it because i   m a dwarf  and ironbender really wants to make sergeant  and  frankly  i overheard them  but i doubt if the printing dwarfs would mention it to the editor .         are you telling me  captain  that dwarfs in the watch would keep a murder secret .      carrot looked shocked .     oh no  sir .         good .         they   d just keep it secret from humans .  sorry  sir .      the important thing is not to shout at this point  vimes told himself .  do not   what do they call it   go postal .  treat this as a learning exercise .  find out why the world is not as you thought it was .  assemble the facts  digest the information  consider the implications .  then go postal .  but with precision .      dwarfs have always been law abiding citizens  captain     he said .     they even pay their taxes .  suddenly they think it   s okay not to report a possible murder .      carrot could see the steely glint in vimes   s eyes .      well  the fact is       he began .      yes .         you see  hamcrusher was a deep down dwarf  sir .  i mean really deep down .  hates coming to the surface .  they say he lived at sub sub basement level           i know all that .  so .         so how far down does our jurisdiction go  sir .     said carrot .      what .  as far down as we like .         er   does it say that anywhere  sir .  most of the dwarfs here are from copperhead and llamedos and uberwald     said carrot .     those places have surface laws and underground laws .  i know it   s not the same here but   well  it   s how they see the world .  and  of course  hamcrusher   s dwarfs are all deep downers  and you know how ordinary dwarfs think about them .      they come bloody close to worshiping them  vimes thought  pinching the bridge of his nose and shutting his eyes .  it just gets worse and worse .      all right     he said .     but this is ankh morpork  and we have our own laws .  there can be no harm in us just checking up on the health of brother hamcrusher  can there .  we can knock on the door  can   t we .  say we   ve got good reason to ask .  i know it   s only a rumor  but if enough people believe a rumor like that  we will not be able to keep a lid on it .         good idea  sir .         go and tell angua i want her along .  and   oh  haddock .  and ringfounder  maybe .  you come  too  of course .         er   not a good idea  sir .  i happen to know most deep downers are nervous about me .  they believe i   m too human to be a dwarf .         really .      six feet three inches in his stockinged feet  thought vimes .  adopted and raised by dwarfs in a little dwarf mine in the mountains .  his dwarfish name is kzad bhat  which means head banger .  he coughed .     why on earth should they think that  i wonder .     he said .      all right  i know i   m   technically human  sir  but size has traditionally never been a dwarfish definition of a dwarf .  hamcrusher   s group aren   t happy about me  though .         sorry to hear it .  i   ll take cheery  then .         are you mad  sir .  you know what they think about female dwarfs who actually admit it .         all right  then  i   ll take sergeant detritus .  they   ll believe in him all right  won   t they .         could be said to be a bit provocative  sir       carrot began doubtfully .      detritus is an ankh morpork copper  captain  just like you and me     said vimes .     i suppose i   m acceptable  am i .         yes  sir  of course .  i think you worry them  though .         i do .  oh .     vimes hesitated .     well  that   s good .  and detritus is an officer of the law .  we   ve still got some law here .  and as far as i   m concerned  it goes deep .  all the way down .          bloody stupid thing to say  vimes thought five minutes later  as he walked through the streets at the head of the little squad .  he cursed himself for saying it .   coppers stayed alive by trickery .  that   s how it worked .  you had your watch houses with the big blue lights outside  and you made certain there were always burly watchmen visible in the big public places  and you swanked around like you owned the place .  but you didn   t own it .  it was all smoke and mirrors .  you magicked a little policeman into everyone   s head .  you relied on people giving in  knowing the rules .  but in truth  a hundred well armed people could wipe out the watch  if they knew what they were doing .  once some madman finds out that a copper taken unawares dies just like anyone else  the spell is broken .   hamcrusher   s dwarfs don   t believe in the city watch .  that could turn out to be a problem .  maybe bringing a troll along was provocative  but detritus was a citizen  gods damn it  just like everyone else .  if you        duddle dum duddle dum duddle dum .      ah  yes .  no matter how bad things were  there was always room for them to get just that little bit worse     vimes pulled the smart brown box out of his pocket and flipped it open .  the pointy eared face of a small green imp stared up at him with that wistful  hopeless smile  which  in its various incarnations  he   d come to know and dread .      good morning  insert name here .  i am the dis organizer mark five  the gooseberrytm .  how may i       it began  speaking fast in order to get as much said as possible before the inevitable interruption .      i swear i switched you off     said vimes .      you threatened me with a hammer     said the imp accusingly  and rattled the tiny bars .     he threatens state of the craft technomancy with a hammer  everybody .     it shouted .     he doesn   t even fill in the registration card .  that   s why i have to call him insert nam           i thought you   d got rid of that thing  sir     said angua  as vimes snapped the lid shut .     i thought it had had an   accident .         hah .     said a muffled voice from the box .      sybil always gets me a new one     said vimes  making a face .     a better one .  but i know this one was turned off .      the box   s lid thrust upwards .      i wake up for alarms .     the imp shrieked .     ten colon forty five colon sit for damn portrait .      vimes groaned .  the portrait with sir joshua .  he   d get into trouble for this .  he   d already missed two sittings .  but this dwarf thing was   important .      i won   t be able to make it     he mumbled .      then would you like to engage the handy to use bluenosetm integrated messenger service .         what does that do .     said vimes  with deep suspicion .  the succession of dis organizers he had owned had proved quite successful at very nearly sorting out all the problems that stemmed from owning them in the first place .      er   basically  it means me running with a message to the nearest clacks tower really fast     said the imp hopefully .      and do you come back .     said vimes  hope also rising .      absolutely .         thank you  no     said vimes .      how about a game of splong . tm  specially devised for the mark five .     pleaded the imp .     i have the bats right here .  no .  perhaps you would prefer the ever popular    guess my weight in pigs    .  or i could whistle one of your favorite tunes .  my ihumtm function enables me to remember up to one thousand five hundred of your all time           you could try learning to use it  sir     said angua  as vimes once again shut the lid on the protesting voice .      did use one     said vimes .      yup .  as a doorstop     rumbled detritus  behind him .      i   m just not at home with technomancy  all right .     said vimes .     end of discussion .  haddock  nip along to moon pond lane  will you .  present my apologies to lady sybil  who will be at sir joshua   s studio there .  tell her i   m very sorry  but this has come up and it needs careful handling .      well  it does  he thought  as they headed onwards .  it probably needs more careful handling than i   m going to give it .  well  to hell with that .  it comes to something if you have to tread carefully even to find out if there   s been a murder .       treacle street was just the kind of area the dwarfs colonized   on the edge of the less pleasant parts of town  but not all the way there .  you tended to notice the dwarf outposts .  a patchwork of windows testified to a two story house having been turned into a three story house while remaining exactly the same height  there was an excess of small ponies pulling small carts  and  of course  all the really short people wearing beards and helmets was a definite clue .   dwarfs dug down  too .  it was a dwarf thing .  up here  far from the river  they could probably get to sub basement level without being up to their necks in water .   there were a lot of them out and about this morning .  they weren   t particularly angry  insofar as vimes could tell when the available area of expression between eyebrows and mustache was a few square inches  but it wasn   t usual to see dwarfs just standing around .  they tended to be somewhere  working hard  usually for one another .  no  they weren   t angry  but they were worried .  you didn   t need to see faces to sense that .  dwarfs as a whole weren   t happy about newspapers  regarding such news as a lover of fine grapes would regard raisins .  they got their news from other dwarfs  to ensure that it was new and fresh and full of personality  and no doubt it grew all kinds of extras in the telling .  this crowd was waiting uncertainly for news that it was going to become a riot .   for now  it parted to let them through .  the presence of detritus caused a wake of muttering  which the troll cleverly decided not to hear .      feel that .     said angua  as they walked up the street .     through your feet .         i don   t have your senses  sergeant     said vimes .      it   s a constant thud  thud  underground     said angua .     i can feel the street shaking .  i think it   s a pump .         pumping out more cellars  maybe .     said vimes .  sounded like a big undertaking .  how far down could they go .  he wondered .  ankh morpork is mostly built on ankh morpork  after all .  there   s been a city here since forever .   it wasn   t just a random crowd  when you looked closely .  it was also a queue  along one side of the street  moving very slowly toward a side door .  they were waiting to see the grags .  please come and say the death words over my father   please advise me on the sale of my shop   please guide me in my business   i am a long way from the bones of my grandfathers  please help me stay a dwarf     this was not the time to be d   rkza .  strictly speaking  most ankh morpork dwarfs were d   rkza  it meant something like    not really a dwarf .     they didn   t live deep underground and only come out at night  they didn   t mine metal  they let their daughters show at least a few indications of femininity  they tended to be a little slipshod when it came to some of the ceremonies .  but the whiff of koom valley was in the air  and this was no time to be mostly a dwarf .  so you paid attention to the grags .  they kept you on the straight seam .   and  until now  that had been fine by vimes .  up until now  though  the grags in the city has stopped short of advocating murder .   he liked dwarfs .  they made reliable officers  and dwarfs tended to be naturally law abiding  at least in the absence of alcohol .  but they were all watching him .  he could feel the pressure of their gaze .   standing around watching people was  of course  ankh morpork   s leading industry .  the place was a net exporter of penetrating stares .  but these were the wrong kind .  the street felt not exactly hostile but alien .  and yet it was an ankh morpork street .  how could he be a stranger here .   maybe i shouldn   t have brought a troll  he thought .  but where does that lead .  pick your own copper from a chart .   two dwarfs were on guard outside hamcrusher   s house  they were more heavily armed than the average dwarf  insofar as that was possible  but it was probably the black leather sashes they wore that were doing the trick of keeping the mood subdued .  these declared to all who recognized them that they were working for deep down dwarfs and  as such  partook a little of the magic  mana  awe  or fear that they engendered in the average  backsliding dwarf .   they started to give vimes the look of all guards everywhere  which  in summary  is this  the default position is that you   re dead  only my patience stands in the way .  but vimes was ready for it .  any five hells you cared to name knew that he   d used it himself often enough .  he countered with the aloof expression of someone who didn   t notice guards .      commander vimes  city watch     he said  holding up his badge .     i need to see grag hamcrusher immediately .         he   s not seeing anyone     said one of the guards .      oh .  so he is dead  then .     said vimes .   he felt the answer .  he didn   t even have to see angua   s little nod  the dwarfs had been dreading the question  and were sweating .   to their shock and horror  and also somewhat to his own surprise  he sat down on the steps between them and pulled a packet of cheap cigars out of his pocket .      i won   t offer one to you lads  because i know that you aren   t allowed to smoke on duty     he said convivially .     i don   t allow my boys to do it .  the only reason i can get away with it is that there   s no one to tell me off  haha .     he blew a stream of blue smoke .     now  i am  as you know  head of the city watch .  yes .      the two dwarfs  staring straight ahead  nodded imperceptibly .      good     said vimes .     and that means you  that   s both of you  are impeding me in the execution of my duty .  that gives me  oooh  a whole range of options .  the one i   m thinking of right now is summoning constable dorfl .  he   s a golem .  nothing impedes him in the execution of his duty  believe me .  you   ll be picking bits of that door off the floor for weeks .  and i wouldn   t stand in his way  if i was you .  oh  and it   d be lawful  which means that if anyone puts up a fight it gets really interesting .  look  i   m only telling you this because i   ve done my share of guarding over the years  and there are times when looking tough works and there are times   and this  i suggest  is one of them   when going and asking the people inside what you should do next is a very good career move .         can   t leave our post     said one of the dwarfs .      don   t worry about that     said vimes  standing .     i   ll stand guard for you .         you can   t do that .      vimes bent down to the dwarf   s ear .      i am commander of the watch     he hissed  no longer mr .  friendly .  he pointed at the cobblestones .     this is my street .  i can stand where i like .  you are standing on my street .  it   s the public highway .  that means that there are about a dozen things i could arrest you for  right now .  that would cause trouble  right enough  but you would be bang in the middle of it .  my advice to you  one guard to another  is to hop off smartly and speak to someone highe   further up the ladder  okay .      he saw worried eyes peering out from between the rampant eyebrows and the luxuriant mustache  spotted the tiny little tells he   d come to recognize  and added     off you go  ma   am .      the dwarf hammered on the door .  the hatch slid back .  whispering transpired .  the door opened .  the dwarf hurried in .  the door closed .  vimes turned  took up station beside it  and stood to attention slightly more theatrically than necessary .   there were one or two outbreaks of laughter .  dwarfs they may be  but in ankh morpork people always wanted to see what would happen next .   the remaining guard hissed     we   re not allowed to smoke on duty .         oops  sorry     said vimes  and removed the cigar  tucking it behind his ear for later .  this got a few more chuckles .  let    em laugh  said vimes to himself .  at least they   re not throwing things .   the sun shone down .  the crowd stood still .  sergeant angua stared at the sky  her face carefully blank .  detritus had settled into the absolute  rock like stillness of a troll with nothing to do right now .  only ringfounder looked uneasy .  this probably was not a good time and place to be a dwarf with a badge  vimes thought .  but why .  all we   ve been doing in the last couple of weeks is trying to stop two bunches of idiots from killing one another .   and now this .  this morning was going to cost him an earful  he thought  although sybil never shouted when she told him off .  she just spoke sadly  which was a lot worse .   the bloody family portrait  that was the trouble .  it seemed to involve an awful lot of sittings  but it was a tradition in sybil   s family  and that was that .  it was more or less the same portrait  every generation  the happy family group against a panorama of their rolling acres .  vimes had no rolling acres  only aching feet  but as the inheritor of the ramkin wealth  he was  he   d learned  also the owner of crundells  a huge stately home out in the country .  he   d never even seen it yet .  vimes didn   t mind the countryside if it stayed put and didn   t attack  but he liked pavement under his feet and didn   t much care for being pictured as some kind of squire .  so far  his excuses for avoiding the interminable sittings had been reasonable  but it was a close run thing     more time passed .  some of the dwarfs in the crowd wandered off .  vimes didn   t move  not even when he heard the hatch in the door open for a moment and then slide back .  they were trying to wait him out .      tcha tcha rumptiddle tiddle tiddle tiddle tchum chum .      without looking down  maintaining the stolid thousand mile stare of a guard  vimes pulled the dis organizer out of his pocket and raised it to his lips .      i know you were turned off     he grunted .      pop up for alarms  remember .     said the imp .      how do i stop you doing that .         the correct form of words is in the manual  insert name here     said the imp primly .      where is the manual .         you threw it away     said the imp  full of reproach .     you always do .  that   s why you never use the right commands  and that is why i did not    go away and stick my head up a duck   s bottom    yesterday .  you have an appointment to see lord vetinari in half an hour .         i will be busy     muttered vimes .      would you like me to remind you again in ten minutes .         tell me  what part of    stick your head up a duck   s bottom    didn   t you understand .     vimes replied  and plunged the thing back into his pocket .   so   it had been half an hour .  half an hour was enough .  this was going to be drastic  but he   d seen the looks the dwarfs were giving detritus .  rumor was an evil poison .   as he stepped forward  ready to go and summon dorfl and all the problems that invading this place would entail  the door opened behind him .      commander vimes .  you may come in .      there was a dwarf in the doorway .  vimes could just make out his shape in the gloom .  and for the first time he noticed the symbol chalked on the wall over the door  a circle with a horizontal line through it .      sergeant angua will accompany me     he said .  the sign struck vimes as vaguely unsettling  it seemed to be a stamp of ownership that was rather more emphatic than  for example  a little plaque saying mon repos .      the troll will stay outside     said the figure flatly .      sergeant detritus will stand guard  along with corporal ringfounder     said vimes .   this restatement of fact seemed to pass muster  suggesting that the dwarf probably knew a lot about iron but nothing about irony .  the door opened further  and vimes stepped inside .   the hall was bare  except for a few stacked boxes  and the air smelled of   what .  stale food .  old  empty houses .  sealed up rooms .  attics .   the whole house is an attic  vimes thought .  the thud  thud from below was really noticeable here .  it was like a heartbeat .      this way  if you please     said the dwarf  and ushered vimes and angua into a side room .  again  the only furnishings were more wooden boxes and  here and there  some well worn shovels .      we do not often entertain .  please be patient     said the dwarf  and backed out .  the key clicked on the lock .   vimes sat down on a box .      polite     said angua .  vimes put one hand to his ear and jerked a thumb toward the damp  stained plaster .  she nodded  but mouthed the word    corpse    and pointed downwards .      sure .     said vimes .   angua tapped her nose .  you couldn   t argue with a werewolf   s nose .   vimes leaned back against a bigger box .  it was comfort itself to a man who   d learned to sleep leaning against any available wall .   the plaster on the opposite wall was crumbling  green with damp and hung with dusty old spiderwebs .  someone  though  had scratched a symbol in it so deeply that bits of the plaster had fallen out .  it was another circle  this time with two diagonal lines slashed through it .  some passion there  not what you   d expect around dwarfs .      you are taking this very well  sir     said angua .     you must know this is deliberate discourtesy .         being rude isn   t against the law  sergeant .     vimes pulled his helmet over his eyes and settled down .   the little devils .  play silly buggers with me  will they .  try to wind me up  will they .  don   t tell the watch  eh .  there are no no go areas in this city .  i   ll see to it they find that out .  oh yes .   there were more and more of deep downers in the city these days  although you very seldom saw them outside the dwarf areas .  even there  you didn   t see deep downers themselves  you just saw their dusty black sedan chairs being muscled through the crowds by four other dwarfs .  there were no windows  there was nothing outside that a deep downer could possibly want to see .   the city dwarfs regarded them with awe  respect  and  it had to be said  a certain amount of embarrassment  like some honored but slightly loopy relative .  because somewhere in the head of every city dwarf there was a little voice that said  you should live in a mine  you should be in the mountains  you shouldn   t walk under open skies  you should be a real dwarf .  in other words  you shouldn   t really be working in your uncle   s pigment and dye factory in dolly sisters .  however  since you were  you could at least try to think like a proper dwarf .  and part of that meant being guided by the deep downers  the dwarfs    dwarfs  who lived in caves miles below the surface and never saw the sun .  somewhere down there in the dark was true dwarfishness .  they had the knowing of it  and they could guide you     vimes had no problem with that at all .  it made as much sense as what most humans believed  and most dwarfs were model citizens  even at two thirds scale .   but deciding that murder could be kept in the family .  thought vimes .  not on my watch .   after ten minutes  the door was unlocked and another dwarf stepped inside .  he was dressed as what vimes thought of as    standard city dwarf     which meant basic helmet  leather  chain mail  and battle axe mining pick  but hold the spiky club .  he also had a black sash .  he looked flustered .      commander vimes .  what can i say .  i do apologize for the way you have been treated .      i bet you do .  aloud  vimes said     and who are you .         apologies again .  i am helmclever  and i am the   the nearest word is  perhaps     daylight face    .  i do those things that have to be done aboveground .  do come into my office  please .     he trotted off  leaving them to follow him .   the office was downstairs  in the stone walled basement .  it looked quite cozy .  crates and sacks were piled up against one wall .  there wasn   t much food in deep caves  after all  the simple life for dwarfs down below happened because of quite complex lives for a lot of dwarfs above .  helmclever looked like little more than a servant  making sure that his masters got fed  although he might have thought the job was rather grander than that .  a curtain in the corner probably concealed a bed  dwarfs did not go in for dainty living .   a desk was covered in paperwork .  beside it  on a small table  was an octagonal board covered in little playing pieces .  vimes sighed .  he hated games .  they made the world look too simple .      oh  do you play at all  commander .     said helmclever with the hungry look of a true enthusiast .  vimes knew the type  too .  show polite interest  and you   ll be there all night .      lord vetinari does .  it   s never interested me     said vimes .      hemclever   s not a common dwarf name .  you   re not related to the helmclevers in tallow lane  are you .      he   d meant it as no more than a bit of noncontroversial ice breaking  but he might as well have cursed .  helmclever looked down and mumbled     er  yes   but to a   grag  even a novice  all of dwarfdom is his   family .  it would not be   really not be       he faltered into silence  and then some other part of his brain took over .  he looked up  brightly .     some coffee  perhaps .  i shall fetch some .      vimes opened his mouth to say no  but didn   t .  dwarfs made good coffee  and there was a smell of it wafting from the next room .  besides  the nervousness radiating off helmclever suggested he   d been drinking a lot of it today .  no harm in encouraging him to have more .  it was something he told his officers  people got worried around coppers if the officer knew his stuff  and jittery people gave too much away .   while the dwarf was gone  he took in more of the room  and his eye spotted the words the koom valley codex on the spine of a book half concealed in the paperwork .   that bloody valley again  with added weirdness this time .  actually  sybil had bought a copy  along with most of reading population of the city  and had dragged him along to look at that poor man   s wretched picture in the royal art museum .  a painting with secrets .  oh yes .  and how come some mad young human artist a hundred years ago knew the secret of a battle fought thousands of years before .  sybil said that the book claimed he   d found something on the battlefield  but it was haunted  and voices drove him to believe he was a chicken .  or something .   when the mugs were brought in  with just a little spilled on helmclever   s desk because his hand was shaking  vimes said     i must see grag hamcrusher  sir .         i   m sorry  that is not possible .      the answer came out flat and level  as if the dwarf had been practicing .  but there was a flicker in his eyes  and vimes glanced up at a very large grille in the wall .   at this point  angua gave a little cough .  okay  thought vimes  someone   s listening .      mr .  helm   clever     he said     i have reason to suppose that a serious crime has been committed on ankh morpork soil .     he added     that is to say  under it .  but ankh morpork   s  anyway .      once again  helmclever   s strange calm gave him away .  there was a hunted look in his eyes .      i am sorry to hear it .  how may i assist you to solve it .      oh well  thought vimes  i did say i don   t play games .      by showing me the dead body you have downstairs     he said .   he was obscenely pleased at the way helmclever deflated .  time to press home     he took out his badge .      my authority  mr .  helmclever .  i will search this place .  i would prefer to do so with your permission .      the dwarf was trembling  with fear or anxiety or probably both .      you will invade our premises .  you cannot .  dwarf law           this is ankh morpork     said vimes .     all the way to the top  all the way to the bottom .  invasion is not the issue .  are you really telling me i cannot search a basement .  now take me to grag hamcrusher or whoever is in charge .  now .         i   i refuse your request .         it wasn   t a request .      and now we reach our own little koom valley  vimes thought  as he stared into helmclever   s eyes .  no backing down .  we both think we   re right .  but he   s wrong .   a movement made him glance down .  helmclever   s trembling finger had teased out the spilled coffee into a circle .  as vimes stared  the dwarf   s fingers drew two lines across the circle .  he looked back up  his eyes bulging with anger  fear   and just a hint of something else        ah .  commander vimes  is it .     said a figure in the doorway .   it might have been lord vetinari speaking .  it was that same level tone indicating that he had noticed you and you were  in some small way  a necessary chore .  but it was coming from another dwarf  presumably  although he wore a rigid  pointed black hood  which brought him up to the height of the average human .   elsewhere he was completely shrouded   and that was a well chosen word   in overlapping black leather scales  with just a narrow slit for the eyes .  were it not for the quiet authority of the voice  the figure in front of vimes could be mistaken for a very somber hogswatch decoration .      and you are    .     said vimes .      my name is ardent  commander .  helmclever  go about your chores .      as the    daylight face    scuttled off at speed  vimes turned in his seat and allowed his hand to brush across the sticky symbol  wiping it out .     and do you want to be helpful  too .     he said .      if i can be     said the dwarf .     please follow me .  it would be preferable if the sergeant did not accompany you .         why .         the obvious reason     said ardent .     she is openly female .         what .  so .  sergeant angua is very definitely not a dwarf     said vimes .     you can   t expect everyone to conform to your rules .         why not .     said the dwarf .     you do .  but could we just  together  for a moment  proceed to my office and discuss matters .         i   ll be fine  sir     said angua .     it   s probably the best way .      vimes tried to relax .  he knew he was letting himself get steamed up .  those silent watchers in the street had got through to him  and the look he   d gotten from helmclever needed some thinking about .  but        no     he said .      you will not make that small concession .     said ardent .      i am already making several big ones  believe me     said vimes .   the hidden eyes under the pointy cowl stared at him for a few seconds .      very well     said ardent .     please follow me .      the dwarf turned and opened a door behind him  stepping into a small  square room .  he beckoned them to follow and  when they were inside  pulled a lever .   the room shook gently  and the walls began to rise .      this is       ardent began .         an elevator     said vimes .     yes  i know .  i saw them when i met the low king in uberwald .      the dropping of the name did not work .      the low king is not   respected here     said ardent .      i thought he was the ruler of all dwarfs .     said vimes .      a common misconception .  ah  we have arrived .      the elevator stopped with barely a jerk .   vimes stared .   ankh morpork was built on ankh morpork .  everyone knew that .  they had been building with stone here ten thousand years ago .  as the annual flooding of the ankh brought more silt  so the city had risen on its wall until attics had become cellars .  even at basement level today  it was always said  a man with a pickaxe and a good sense of direction could cross the city by knocking his way through underground walls  provided he could also breathe mud .   what had this place been .  a palace .  the temple of a god who   d subsequently slipped everyone   s memory .  it was a big space  dark as soot  but there was a glow that managed to show beautiful vaulting in the roof above .  a strange glow .      vurms     said ardent .     from the deep caves in the mountains around llamedos .  we brought them with us  and they breed very fast here .  they find your silt quite nourishing .  i   m sure they shine more  too .      the glow moved .  it did not illuminate much  but it showed the shape of things  and it was heading toward the elevator  flowing over the wonderful ceiling .      they head for heat and movement  even now     said the hooded dwarf .      er   why .      ardent gave a little laugh .      in case you die  commander .  they think you are some rat or small deer that has tumbled into their cave .  nourishment is rare in the deeps .  every breath you exhale is food .  and when eventually you expire  they will   descend .  they are very patient .  they will leave nothing but bones .         i was not intending to expire here     said vimes .      of course not .  follow me  please     said ardent  leading them past a big  round door .  there were more doors on the other side of the room  and several gaping tunnel mouths .      how far down are we .         not far .  about forty feet .  we are good at digging .         in this city .     said vimes .     why aren   t we trying to breathe underwater .  and calling it water is giving it the best of it .         we are very good at keeping water out  too .  alas  it appears we are less good at keeping out samuel vimes .     the dwarf stepped into a smaller room  its ceiling thick with brilliant vurms  and motioned to a couple of dwarf sized chairs .     do sit down .  can i offer you refreshment .         no  thank you     said vimes .  he sat down gingerly on a chair that brought his knees up almost to his chin .  ardent sat down behind a small desk made of stone slabs and  to vimes   s amazement  took off his headgear .  he looked quite young  with a beard that was actually trimmed .  angua watched him  breathing slowly .      how far do all these tunnels run .     vimes said .      i don   t propose to tell you     said ardent levelly .      so you   re undermining my city .         oh  commander .  you   ve been to the caves in uberwald .  you   ve seen how dwarfs can build .  we are craftsmen .  do not think that your house is about to collapse .         but you   re not just building basements .  you   re mining .     said vimes .      in a sense .  we would say we are mining for holes .  space  commander  that is what we are digging for .  yes  we are mining for holes .  although our bores have found deep treacle  you will be interested to hear           you can   t do this .         can we not .  but we are doing it nevertheless     said ardent calmly .      you are burrowing under other people   s property .         rabbits burrow  commander .  we dig .  and  yes  we are .  how far down does ownership go  after all .  and how far up .      vimes looked at the dwarf .  calm down  he thought .  you can   t deal with this .  this is too big .  it   s something for vetinari to decide .  stick to what you know .  stick to what you can deal with .      i   m investigating reports of a death     he said .      yes .  grag hamcrusher .  a terrible misfortune     said ardent  with a calmness that was enraging .      i   ve heard it was a vicious murder .         that would be a fair description .         you admit it .     said vimes .      i   ll choose to assume that by that you mean    do i admit there has been a murder     commander .  yes .  there has .  and we are dealing with it .         how .         we are discussing the appointment of a zadkrdga     said  ardent  folding his hands .     that is    one who smelts .     one who finds the pure ore of truth in the dross of confusion .         discussing .  have you sealed off the scene of the crime yet .         the smelter may order that  commander  but we already know that the crime was committed by a troll .      ardent   s face now bore an expression of amused contempt that vimes longed to remove .   he said     how do you know this .  was it witnessed .         not as such .  but a troll   s club was found beside the body     said the dwarf .      and that   s all you have to go on .     vimes stood up .     i   ve had enough of this .  sergeant angua .         sir .     said angua  beside him .      let   s go .  we   re going to find the murder scene while there   s still any clues left to find .         you have no business in the lower areas .     snapped ardent  standing up .      how are you going to stop me .         how are you going to get past locked doors .         how are you going to find out who murdered hamcrusher .         i told you  a troll   s club was found .         and that   s it .     we found a club  so a troll did it .     is anyone going to believe that .  you   re prepared to start a war in my city with a piece of flimflam like that .  because  believe me  that   s what   s going to happen when this gets out .  try it and i   ll arrest you .         and start a war in your city .     said ardent .   dwarf and man glared at each other while they caught their breath .  on the ceiling above them  vurms congregated  feasting on spittle and rage .      why would anyone but a troll strike down the grag .     said ardent .      good .  you   re asking questions .     vimes leaned across the desk .     if you really want answers  unlock those doors .         no .  you cannot go down there  blackboard monitor vimes .      the dwarf could not have put more venom in the words    child murderer .      vimes stared .   blackboard monitor .  well  he had been  in that little street school  more than forty five years ago .  mum had insisted .  gods knew where she   d sprung the penny a day it cost  although most of the time dame slightly had been happy to accept payment in old clothes and firewood  or  preferably  gin .  numbers  letters  weights  measures  it was not what you   d call a rich curriculum .  vimes had attended for nine months or so  until the streets demanded he learn much harder and sharper lessons .  but  for a while  he   d been trusted to hand out the slates and clean the blackboard .  oh  the heady  strutting power of it  when you   re six years old .      do you deny it .     said ardent .     you destroy written words .  you admitted as much to the low king in uberwald .         it was a joke .     said vimes .      oh .  then you do deny it .         what .  no .  he was impressed by my titles  and i just threw that one in for   fun .         then you deny the crime .     ardent persisted .      crime .  i cleaned the blackboard so that new things could be written on it .  how is that a crime .         you did not care where those words went .     said ardent .      care .  they were just chalk dust .      ardent sighed and rubbed his eyes .      busy night .     said vimes .      commander  i understand that you were young and may not have realized what you were doing  but you must understand that to us you appear to be proud of being complicit in the most heinous of crimes  the destruction of words .         sorry .  rubbing out    a is for apple    is a capital crime .         one that would be unthinkable for a true dwarf     said ardent .      really .  but i have the trust of the low king himself     said vimes .      so i understand .  there are six venerable grags below us  commander  and in their eyes  the low king and his kind have strayed from the true seam .  he is     ardent rattled off a sentence in staccato dwarfish  too fast for vimes to catch it  and then translated     wishy washy .  dangerously liberal .  shallow .  he has seen the light .      ardent was watching him carefully .  think hard .  from what vimes could remember  the low king and his circle had been pretty crusty types .  but these people think they   re soppy liberals .      wishy washy .     he said .      indeed .  i invite you  therefore  to derive from that statement something of the nature of those i serve below .      ah  thought vimes .  there   s something there .  just a hint .  friend ardent is a thinker .      when you say    he has seen the light    you sound as if you mean    corrupted         he said .      something like that  yes .  different worlds  commander .  down here  it would be unwise to trust your metaphors .  to see the light is to be blinded .  do you not know that in the darkness  the eyes open wider .         take me to see these people down below     said vimes .      they will not listen to you .  they will not even look at you .  they have nothing to do with the world above .  they believe it is a kind of bad dream .  i have not dared tell them about your    newspapers     printed every day and discarded like rubbish .  the shock would kill them .      but dwarfs invented the printing engine  vimes thought .   obviously  they were the wrong kind of dwarf .  i   ve seen cheery throw stuff in the wastepaper basket  too .  it seems like nearly all dwarfs are the wrong sort  eh .      what exactly is your job  mr .  ardent .     said vimes .      i am their chief liaison with the world above .  the steward  you could say .         i though that was helmclever   s job .         helmclever .  he orders the groceries  relays my orders  pays the miners  and so on .  the chores  in fact     said ardent disdainfully .     he is a novice  and his job is to do what i tell him .  it is i who speaks to the grags .         you talk to bad dreams on their behalf .         you could put it that way  i suppose .  they would not let a proud word killer become a smelter .  the idea would be abominable .      they glared at each other .   once again  we end up in koom valley  vimes told himself .  they won   t        permission to make a suggestion .     said angua quietly .   two heads turned .  two mouths said     well .         the   smelter .  the seeker of the truth .  must they be a dwarf .         of course .     said ardent .      then what about captain carrot .  he   s a dwarf .         we know of him .  he is an   anomaly     said ardent .     his claim to dwarfishness is debatable .         but most dwarfs in the city accept that he   s a dwarf     said angua .     and he   s a copper  too .      ardent flopped back into his seat .     to your dwarfs here  yes  he is a dwarf .  he would be unacceptable to the grags .         there   s no dwarf law that says a dwarf can   t be more than six feet tall  sir .         the grags are the law  woman     ardent snapped .     they interpret laws that go back for tens of thousands of years .         well  ours don   t     said vimes .     but murder is murder anywhere .  the news has got out .  you   ve already got the dwarfs and the trolls simmering nicely  and this will bring it all right to the boil .  do you want a war .         with the trolls .  that is           no  with the city .  a place inside the walls where the law doesn   t run .  his lordship won   t accept that one .         you would not dare .     said the dwarf .      look into my eyes     said vimes .      there are far more dwarfs than there are watchmen     said ardent  but the amused expression had fled .      so what you are telling me is that law is just a matter of numbers .     said vimes  standing up .     i thought you dwarfs practically worshiped the idea of law .  is numbers all it is .  i   ll swear in more men  then .  trolls  too .  they   re citizens  just like me .  are you sure every dwarf is on your side .  i   ll raise the regiments .  i   ll have to .  i know how things are run in llamedos and uberwald  but they are not run like that here .  one law  mr .  ardent .  that   s what we   ve got .  if i let people slam their front door on it  i might as well shut down the watch .      vimes walked to the doorway .     that   s my offer .  now i   m going back to the yard           wait .      ardent sat staring at the desktop  drumming his fingers on it .      i do not have   seniority here     he said .      let me talk to your grags .  i promise to rub out no words .         no .  they will not talk to you .  they do not talk to humans .  they are waiting below .  they had word of your arrival .  they are frightened .  they do not trust humans .         why .         because you are not dwarfs     said ardent .     because you are   a sort of bad dream .      vimes put his hand on the dwarf   s shoulder .      then let   s go downstairs  where you can talk to them about nightmares     he said     and you can point out which one is me .      there was a long silence until ardent said     very well .  this is under protest  you understand .         i   ll be happy to make a note of that     said vimes .     thank you for your cooperative attitude     he added .   ardent stood up and produced a ring of complex keys from his robes .   vimes tried to keep track of the journey  but it was hard .  there were twists and turns  in dim tunnels that seemed all alike .  there was not a trace of water anywhere .  how far did the tunnels go .  how far down .  how far out .  dwarfs mined through granite .  they could probably stroll through river mud .   in fact  in most places  the dwarfs hadn   t so much mined as cleaned house  taking away the silt  tunneling from one ancient  dripping room to another .  and  somehow  the water went away .   there were things  glittering  possibly magical  half seen in dark archways as they passed .  and odd chanting .  he knew dwarfish  in a the axe of my aunt is in your head kind of way  and it didn   t sound like that at all .  it sounded like short words rattled out at very high speed .   and with every turn he felt the anger coming back .  they were being led in circles  weren   t they .  for no reason other than pique .  ardent forged ahead  leaving vimes to blunder along behind and occasionally bump his head .   his temper was bubbling .  this was nothing more than a bloody runaround .  the dwarf didn   t care about the law  about him  about the world above .  they undermine our city and they don   t obey our laws .  there had been a damn murder .  he admits it .  why am i putting up with this   this stupid playacting .   he was passing yet another tunnel mouth  but this one had a piece of board nailed across it .  he pulled out his sword  yelled     i wonder what   s down here .      smashed the board  and set off down the tunnel with angua following .      is this wise  sir .     she whispered  as they plunged along .      no .  but i   ve had it up to here with mr .  ardent     vimes growled .     i tell you  another twisty tunnel and i   ll be back here with the heavy mob  politics or not .         calm down  sir .         well  everything he says and does is an insult .  it makes my blood boil .     said vimes  striding onwards and ignoring the shouts of ardent behind him .      there   s a door ahead  sir .         all right  i   m not blind .  just half blind .     vimes snapped .   he reached out .  the big  round door had a wheel in its center  and dwarf runes chalked all over it .      can you read them  sergeant .         er      mortal danger .  flooding .  no entry .         said angua .     more or less  sir .  they   re pressure doors .  i   ve seen these used before  in other mines .         chained shut  too     said vimes  reaching out .     looks like solid iron   ow .         sir .         gashed my hand on a nail .     vimes rammed his hand into a pocket  where  without fail  sybil saw to it that a clean handkerchief was lodged on a daily basis .      a nail in an iron door  sir .     said angua  looking closely .      a rivet  then .  can   t see a thing in this gloom .  why they           you must follow me .  this is a mine .  there are dangers .     said ardent  catching up with them .      you still get flooding .     said vimes .      it is to be expected .  we know how to cope .  now  stay close to me .         i   ll be more inclined to do that  sir  if i thought were taking a direct route .     said vimes .     otherwise i might look for shortcuts .         we are nearly there  commander     said ardent  walking away .     nearly there .          aimless and hopeless  the troll wandered     his name was brick  although currently he couldn   t remember this .  his head ached .  it really ached .  it was der scrape that did it .  what did dey always say .  when you sinkin    to where you was cookin    up scrape  you was so low even der cockroaches had to bend down to spit on you .   last night   what had happenin    .  what bits did he see  what bits did he do  what bits in der thumpin     scaldin    cauldron of his brain were real .  the bit with der giant wooly elephants  dey prob   ly weren   t real .  he was pretty sure there weren   t any giant wooly elephants in dis city     cos if der were  he would   ve seen    em before  and dere   d be big steamin    turds in der streets an    similar  you wouldn   t miss    em     he was called brick because he had been born in the city  and trolls  being made of metamorphorical rock  ofter take on the nature of the local rocks .  his hide was a dirty orange  with a network of horizontal and vertical lines  if brick stood up close to a wall  he was quite hard to see .  but most people didn   t see brick anyway .  he was the kind of person whose mere existence is an insult to all decent folk  in their opinion .   dat mine wi    dem dwarfs  was dat real .  you go an    find a place to lie down and watch der pretty pichturs  suddenly you   re in dis dwarf hole .  that couldna bin real .  only   word on der street was dat some troll had got into a dwarf hole  yeah  and everyone was lookin    for dat troll an    not to shake him by der han      der word said der breccia wanted to find out real hard  and by der sound of it dey were not happy .  not happy that some dwarf who   d been puttin    der bad word on the clans was off   ed by a troll .  were dey mad .  actually  it didn   t matter if dey was mad or not     cos dey had ways of asking questions dat didn   t heal for months  so he better be keepin    out dere way .   on der oder hand   a dwarf wouldn   t know one troll from anoder  right .  and no one else had seen him .  so act normal  right .  he   d be fine .  he   d be fine .  anyway  it couldna bin him     it occured to brick   yeah  dat   s my name  knew it all der time   that he still had a bit of the white powder at the bottom of the bag .  all he needed to do now was find a startled pigeon and some alcohol  any alcohol at all  and he be fine .  yeah .  fine .  nothin    to worry about at all     yeah .       when vimes stepped out into the brilliant daylight  the first thing he did was draw a deep breath .  the second thing he did was draw his sword  wincing as his sore hand protested .   fresh air  that was the stuff .  he   d felt quite dizzy down there  and the tiny cut on his hand itched like mad .  he   d better get igor to take a look at it .  you could probably catch anything in the muck down there .   ah  that was better .  he could feel himself cooling down .  the air down there had made him feel really strange .   the crowd was a lot more like a mob now  but he saw at the second glance that it was what he thought of as a plum cake mob .  it doesn   t take many people to turn a worried  anxious crowd into a mob .  a shout here  a shove there  something thrown here   and with care  every hesitant  nervous individual is being drawn into a majority that does not  in fact  exist .   detritus was still standing like a statue  apparently oblivious to the growing din .  but ringfounder   damn .  he was arguing hotly with people at the front of the crowd .  you never argued .  you never got drawn in .      corporal ringfounder .     he bellowed .     to me .      the dwarf turned as a halfbrick sailed over the heads of the mob and clanged off his helmet .  he went over like a tree .   detritus moved so fast that he was halfway through the crowd before the dwarf hit the cobbles .  his arm dipped into the press of bodies and hauled up a struggling figure .  he spun around  thudded back through the gap that hadn   t had time to close yet  and was beside vimes before ringfounder   s helmet had stopped rolling .      well done  sergeant     said vimes out of the corner of his mouth .     did you have a plan for the next bit .         i   m more der tactical kind  sir     said detritus .   oh  well .  at time like this you didn   t argue  and you didn   t step back .  vimes pulled out his badge and held it up .      this dwarf is under arrest for assaulting a watch officer .     he shouted .     let us through  in the name of the law .      and  to his amazement  the crowd went quiet  like a lot of children when they sense that this time the teacher is really  really angry .  perhaps it was the words on the badge  he thought .  you couldn   t rub them out .   in the silence  another halfbrick dropped out of the free hand of the dwarf in detritus   s very solid custody .  years later  vimes would shut his eyes and still be able to recall the crunch it made when it hit the ground .   angua stood up  with the unconscious ringfounder in her arms .      he   s concussed     she said .     and i suggest  sir  that you turn around  just for a moment .      vimes risked a glance .  ardent   or  at least  a leather shrouded dwarf that could have been him   was standing in the shadows of the doorway .  he had the attention of the crowd .      we   re being allowed to go .     he said to angua  nodding to the figure .      i think the going is the thing  sir  don   t you .         you   ve got that right  sergeant .  detritus  keep a grip on that little bugger .  back to the nick  all of us .      the crowd parted to let them through  with barely a murmur .  the silence followed them all the way back to the watch house        where otto chriek of the times was waiting in the street  iconograph at the ready .      oh no  you don   t  otto     said vimes  as his squad approached .      i   m standing on the public highway  mr .  vimes     said otto meekly .     smile  please        and he took a picture of a troll officer holding a dwarf up in the air .   oh well  said vimes to himself  that   s page one sorted out .  and probably the bloody cartoon  too .       one dwarf in the cells  one in the tender  loving care of igor  vimes thought  as he trudged up the stairs to his office .  and it   s only going to get worse .  those dwarfs were obeying ardent  weren   t they .  what would they have done if the dwarf had shaken his head .   he landed in his chair so hard that it rolled back a foot .   he   d met deep down dwarfs before .  they   d been weird  but he   d been able to deal with them .  the low king was a deep downer  and vimes had got on with him well enough  once you accepted that the fairy tale dwarf in the hogfather beard was an astute politician .  he was a dwarf with a vision .  he dealt with the world .  ha     he   d seen the light .     but those in the new mine     he hadn   t seen them  even though they were sitting in a room made brilliant with the light of hundreds of candles .  that seemed odd  since the grags themselves were completely shrouded in their pointy black leather .  but maybe it was some mystic ceremony  and who   d look for sense there .  maybe you got a more holy dark in the midst of light .  the brighter the light the blacker the shadow .   ardent had spoken in a language that sounded like dwarfish  and out of the dark hoods had come answers and questions  all barked out in the same harsh  brief syllables .   at one point  vimes was asked to repeat the meat of his statement made up above  which had seemed too far away now .  he   d done so  and there   d been a long drawn out discussion in what he   d come to think of as deep dwarf .  and all the time he felt that eyes he could not see were watching him very hard indeed .  it didn   t help that his head had been aching like mad and there were shooting pains going up and down his arm .   and that was it .  had they understood him .  he didn   t know .  ardent had said that they agreed with considerable reluctance .  had they .  he hadn   t a clue  not a clue  to what had really been said .  would carrot be given access to a crime scene that had not been interfered with in any way .  vimes grunted .  huh .  what do you think  boys and girls .   he pinched the bridge of his nose  and then stared at his right hand .  igor had gone on at length about    tiny invithible biting creatureth    and used some vicious ointment that probably killed anything of any size or visibility .  it had stung like seven hells for five minutes  but the sting had gone and seemed to have taken the pain with it .  anyway   what mattered was that the watch was officially on this case .   his eye was caught by the top sheet of paperwork in his in tray .   he groaned as he picked it up .       to  his grace sir samuel vimes  commander of the watch  from  mr .  a .  e .  pessimal  inspector of the watch    your grace     i hope you will not mind giving me as soon as possible the answers to the following questions        what is corporal    nobby    nobbs for .  why do you employ a known petty thief .      i timed two officers in broad way earlier  and in the space of one hour they made no arrests .  why was this an economic use of their time .      the level of violence used by troll officers against troll prisoners appears excessive .  could you please comment upon this .        and so on .  vimes read on with his mouth open .  all right  the man wasn   t a copper   definitely not   but surely he had a fully functional brain .  oh  good grief  he   d even spotted the monthly discrepancy in the petty cash box .  would a .  e .  pessimal understand if vimes explained that nobby   s services over the years more than made up for the casual petty theft  which you accepted as a kind of mild nuisance .   would that be an economic use of my time .  i think not .   as he put the paper back in the tray  he spotted a sheet underneath  in cheery   s handwriting .  he picked it up and read it .   two dwarfs and one troll had handed in their badges this morning  citing    family reasons .     damn .  that was seven officers lost this week .  bloody koom valley  it got everywhere .  oh  it couldn   t be fun  heavens knew  being a troll holding the line against a bunch of your fellow trolls and defending a dwarf like the late hamcrusher .  it probably wasn   t any funner being a dwarf hearing that some troll street gang beat up your brother because of what that idiot had said .  some people would be asking  whose side are you on .  if you   re not with us  you   re against us .  huh .  if you not an apple  you   re a banana     carrot came in quietly and placed a plate on the desk .      angua told me all about it     he said .     well done  sir .         what do you mean  well done .     said vimes  looking at his healthy sandwich lunch .     i nearly started a war .         ah  but they didn   t know you were bluffing .         i probably wasn   t .     vimes carefully lifted the top of the bacon  lettuce  and tomato sandwich  and smiled inwardly .  good old cheery .  she knew what a vimes blt was all about .  it was about having to lift up quite a lot of crispy bacon before you found the miserable skulking vegetables .  you might never notice them at all .      i want you to take angua down there with you again     he said .     and   yes  lance constable von humpeding .  our little sally .  just the job for a vampire who fortuitously has arrived in the nick of time  eh .  let   s see how good she is .         just those two  sir .         er  yes .  they both have very good night vision  yes .     vimes looked down at his sandwich  and mumbled     we can   t take any artificial light down there .         a murder investigation in the dark  sir .         i had no choice .     said vimes hotly .     i know a sticking point when i see one  captain .  no artificial light .  well  if they want to play silly buggers  i   m their boy .  you know about mines  and both the ladies have got night vision built in .  well  the vampire has  and angua can practically see with her nose .  so that   s it .  do the best you can .  the place is full of those damn glow beetles .  they should help .         they   ve got vurms .     said carrot .     oh .  well  i know some tricks there  sir .         good .  they say a big troll did it and ran away .  make of that what you will .         there might be some protests about sally  sir     said carrot .      why .  will they spot she   s a vampire .         no  sir  i don   t think they           then don   t tell    em     said vimes .     you   re the   smelter  it   s up to you what  er  tools you use .  seen this .      he waved the report about the three officers he was trying not to think of as deserters .      yes  sir .  i was meaning to talk to you about that .  it might help if we changed the patrols a bit     said carrot .      how do you mean .         er   it would be quite easy to arrange the patrol schedules so that trolls and dwarfs don   t have to go on the beat together  sir .  um   some of the lads say they   d be a bit happier if we could        carrot let the sentence die away in the stony glare .      we   ve never paid any attention to an officer   s species when we do the roster  captain     said vimes coldly .     except for the gnomes  of course .         there   s your precedent  then       carrot began .      don   t be daft .  a typical gnome room is about twice the size of a shoebox  captain .  look  you can see this idea is nuts .  dangerous nuts  too .  we   d have to patrol troll with troll  dwarf  with dwarf and human with human           not necessarily  sir .  humans could patrol with either of the others .      vimes rocked his chair forward .     no  they couldn   t .  this is not about common sense  this is about fear .  if a troll sees a dwarf and a human patrolling together  he   ll think     there   s the enemy  two against one .     can   t you see where this is going .  when a copper   s in a tight corner and blows his whistle for backup  i don   t want him demanding that when it arrives it   s the right damn shape .     he calmed down a little  opened his notebook  and tossed it on the desk .     and talking of shapes  do you know what this means .  i spotted it in the mine  and a dwarf called helmclever scrawled it with some spilt coffee  and you know what .  i think he was only half aware that he   d done it .      carrot picked up the notebook and regarded the sketch solemnly for a moment .      mine sign  sir     he said .     it means    the following dark .             and what does that mean .         er   that things are pretty bad down there  sir     said carrot earnestly .     oh dear .     he put the notebook down slowly  as if half afraid that it might explode .      well  there has been a murder  captain     vimes pointed out .      yes  sir .  but this might mean something worse  sir .  mine sign is a very strange phenomenon .         there was a sign like it over the door  only there was just one line and it was horizontal     vimes added .      oh  that   d be the long dark rune  sir     said carrot dismissively .     it   s just the symbol for a mine .  nothing to worry about .         but this other one is .  is it anything to do with grags sitting in a room surrounded by lighted candles .      it was always nice to surprise carrot  and this time he looked amazed .     how did you work that out  sir .         it   s only words  captain     said vimes  waving a hand .         the following dark    doesn   t sound good .  time to stay brightly lit  maybe .  when i met them  they were surrounded by candles .  i thought maybe it was some kind of ceremony .         could be     carrot agreed  carefully .     thank you for this  sir .  i   ll go prepared .      as carrot reached the door  vimes added     one thing  captain .         yes  sir .      vimes didn   t look up from the sandwich  from which he was daintily separating fragments of the l and the t from the crispy b .      just remember you   re a copper  will you .     he said .       sally knew something was up as soon as she got back into the locker room  in her shiny new breastplate and soup bowl helmet .  coppers of various species were standing around trying to look nonchalant .  coppers are never any good at this at all .   they watched as she approached her locker .  she opened the door  therefore  with due care .  the shelf was full of garlic .   ah .  it starts  and so soon  too .  just as well she   d been prepared     here and there  behind her  she heard the faint coughs and throat clearings of people trying not to laugh .  and there was smirking going on  a smirk makes a subtle noise if you   re listening for it .   she reached into the locker with both hands and pulled out two big fat bulbs .  all eyes were on her  all coppers were motionless as she walked slowly around the room .   the reek of garlic was strong on one young constable  whose big grin was suddenly caked with nervousness at the corners .  he had the look about him of the kind of fool who   d do anything for a giggle .      excuse me  constable  but what is your name .     she said meekly .      er   fittly  miss           are these from you .     sally demanded .  she let her canines extend just enough to notice .         er  only a joke  miss           nothing funny about it     said sally sweetly .     i like garlic .  i love garlic .  don   t you .         er   yeah       said the unhappy fittly .      good     said sally .   with a speed that made him flinch  she rammed a bulb into her mouth and bit down heavily .   the crunching was the only sound in the locker room .   and then she swallowed .      oh dear  where are my manners  constable .     she said  holding out the other bulb .     this one   s yours        laughter broke out around the room .  coppers are like any other mob .  the table   s been turned  and this way around it   s funnier .  it   s a bit of a laugh  a bit of fun .  no harm done  eh .      come on  fittly     said someone .     it   s only fair .  she ate hers .     and someone else  as someone always does  began to clap and urge    eat .  eat .     others took it up  encouraged by the fact that fittly had gone bright red .      eat .  eat .  eat .  eat .  eat .  eat .  eat .  eat .  eat . eat . eat .         a man without an option  fittly grabbed the bulb  forced it into his mouth  and bit it hard  to the accompaniment of cheers .  a moment later  sally saw his eyes widen .      lance constable von humpeding .      she turned .  a young man of godlike proportions  was standing in the doorway .  unlike the armor of the other officers  his breastplate shone and the chain mail was quite devoid of rust .      everything all right .     the officer glanced at fittly  who   d dropped to his knees and was coughing garlic across the room  but somehow quite failed to see him .      er  fine  sir     said sally  puzzled  as fittly began to throw up .      we   ve met already .  everyone calls me captain carrot .  come with me  please .      out in the main office  carrot stopped and turned .     all right  lance constable   you had a bulb already prepared  right .  don   t look like that  there   s a vegetable barrow out in the square today .  it   s not hard to work out .         er   sergeant angua did warn me           so    .         so i carved a garlic out of a turnip  sir .         and the one you gave fittly .         oh  that was a carved turnip  too .  i try not to touch garlic  sir     said sally .  oh gods  this one really was attractive        really .  turnip .  he seemed to take it badly     said carrot .      i put a few fresh chili seeds in it     sally added .     about thirty  i think .         oh .  why did you do that .         oh  you know  sir     said sally  radiating innocence .     a bit of a laugh  a bit of fun .  no harm done  eh .      the captain appeared to consider this .      we   ll leave it at that  then     he said .     now  lance constable  have you ever seen a dead body .      sally waited to see if he was serious .  apparently  he was .      strictly speaking  no  sir     she said .       vimes fretted through the afternoon .  there was  of course  the paperwork .  there was always the paperwork .  the trays were only the start .  heaps of it were ranged accusingly along one wall  and gently merging .   he knew that he had to do it .  warrants  dockets  watch orders  signatures   that was what made the watch a police force rather than just a bunch of fairly rough fellows with inquisitive habits .  paperwork  you had to have lots of it  and it had to be signed by him .   he signed the arrests book  the occurrences book  even the lost property book .  lost property book .  they never had one of those in the old days .  if someone turned up complaining that they   d lost some small item  you just held nobby nobbs upside down and sorted through what dropped out .   but he didn   t know two thirds of the coppers he employed now   not know  in the sense of knowing when they   d stand and when they   d run  knowing the little giveaways that   d tell him when they were lying or scared witless .  it wasn   t really his watch anymore .  it was the city   s watch .  he just ran it .   he went through the station sergeant   s reports  the watch officers    reports  the sick reports  the disciplinary reports  the petty cash reports        duddle dum duddle dum duddle        vimes slammed the gooseberry down on the desk and picked up the small loaf of dwarf bread that for the last few years he   d used as a paperweight .      switch off or die     he growled .      now  i can see you   re slightly upset     said the imp  looking up at the looming loaf     but could i ask you to look at things from my point of view .  this is my job .  this is what i am .  i am  therefore i think .  and i think we could get along famously if you would only read the manu   please  no .  i really could help you .      vimes hesitated in mid thump  and then carefully put down the loaf .      how .     he said .      you   ve been adding up the numbers wrong     said the imp .     you don   t always carry the tens .         and how would you know that .     vimes demanded .      you mutter to yourself     said the imp .      you eavesdrop on me .         it   s my job .  i can   t switch my ears off .  i have to listen .  that   s how i know about the appointments .      vimes picked up the petty cash report and glanced at the messy columns of figures .  he prided himself on what he had  since infancy  called    sums .     yes  he knew he plodded a bit  but he got there in the end .      you think you could do better .     he said .      let me out and give me a pencil .     said the imp .  vimes shrugged .  it had been a strange day  after all .  he opened the little cage door .   the imp was a very pale green and translucent  little more than a creature made out of colored air  but it was able to grip the tiny pencil stub .  it ran up and down the column of figures in the petty cash book and  vimes was pleased to hear  it muttered to itself .      it   s out by three dollars and five pence     it reported after a few seconds .      that   s fine  then     said vimes .      but the money is not accounted for .         oh yes it is     said vimes .     it was stolen by nobby nobbs .  it always is .  he never steals more than four dollars fifty .         would you like me to make an appointment for a disciplinary interview .     said the imp hopefully .      of course not .  i   m signing it off now .  er   thank you .  can you add up the other dockets .      the imp beamed .      absolutely .      vimes left the imp scribbling happily and walked over to the window .   they don   t acknowledge our law and they undermine our city .  that   s not just a bunch of deep downers here to keep their fellow dwarfs on the straight seam .  how far do those tunnels go .  dwarfs dig like crazy .  but why here .  what are they looking for .  as sure as any hell you choose  there   s no treasure trove under this city  no sleeping dragon  no secret kingdom .  there   s just water and mud and darkness .   how far do they go .  how much   hold on  we know this  we know this  don   t we .  we know about numbers and figures in today   s watch        imp .     he said  turning around .      yes  insert name here .         you see that big pile of paper in the corner .     said vimes  pointing .     somewhere in there are the gate guard reports for the past six months .  can you compare them with last week   s .  can you compare the number of dunny wagons leaving the city .         dunny wagon not found in root dictionary .  searching slang dictionary   mip   mip   mip   dunny wagon  n .   cart for carrying night soil  see also honey wagon  treacle wagon  midnight special  gong wagon  and variants      said the imp .      that right     said vimes  who hadn   t heard the midnight special one before .     can you .         ooh  yes .     said the imp .     thank you for using the dis organizer mark five  the gooseberry  the most advanced           yeah  don   t mention it .  just look at the ones for the hubwards gate .  that   s closest to treacle street .         then i suggest you stand back  insert name here     said the imp .      why .      the imp leapt into the pile .  there was some rustling noises  a couple of mice scampered out   and the pile exploded .  vimes backed away hurriedly as papers fountained into the air  borne aloft on a very pale green cloud .   vimes had instigated record keeping at the gates not because he had a huge interest in the results  but because it kept the lads on their toes .  it wasn   t as if it was security duty .  ankh morpork was so wide open it was gaping .  but the cart census was handy .  it topped watchmen falling asleep at their posts  and it gave them an excuse to be nosy .   you had to move soil .  that was it .  this was a city .  if you were a long way from the river  the only way to do that was on a cart .  blast it  he thought  i should have asked the thing to see if there   s been any increase in stone and timber loads  too .  once you   ve dug a hole in mud  you   ve got to keep it open     the circling  swooping papers snapped back into piles .  the green haze shrank with a faint zzzzp noise  and there was the little imp  ready to burst with pride .      an extra one point one dunny carts a night over six months ago .     it announced .     thank you  insert name here .  cogito ergo sum  insert name here .  i exist  therefore i do sums .         right  yes  thank you     said vimes .  hmm .  a bit more than one cart a night .  they held a couple of tons  maximum .  you couldn   t make much of that .  maybe people living near that gate had been really ill lately .  but   what would he do  in the dwarfs    position .   he damn well wouldn   t send stuff out of the nearest gate  that   s what .  ye gods  if they were tunneling in enough places  they could dump it anywhere .      imp  could you       vimes paused .     look  don   t you have some kind of a name .         name  insert name here .     said the imp  looking puzzled .     oh  no .  i am created by the dozen  insert name here .  a name would be a bit stupid  really .         i   ll call you gooseberry  then .  so   gooseberry  can you give me the same figures for every city gate .  and also the numbers of timber and stone carts .         it will take some time  insert name here  but yes .  i should love to .         and while you   re about it  see if there were any reports of subsidence .  walls falling down  houses cracking  that sort of thing .         certainly  insert name here .  you can rely on me  insert name here .         snap to it  then .         yes  insert name here .  thank you  insert name here .  i think much better outside the box  insert name here .      zzzzp .  paper started to fly .   well  who   d have thought it  vimes wondered .  maybe the damned thing could be useful after all .   the speaking tube whistled .  he unhooked it and said     vimes .         i   ve got the evening edition of the times  sir     said the distant voice of sergeant littlebottom .  she sounded worried .      fine .  send it up .         and there   s a couple of people here who want to see you  sir .     now there was a guarded tone to her voice .      and they can hear you .     said vimes .      that   s right  sir .  trolls .  they insist on seeing you personally .  they say they have a message for you .         do they look like trouble .         every inch  sir .         i   m coming down .      vimes hung up the tube .  trolls with a message .  it was unlikely to be an invitation to a literary lunch .      er   gooseberry .     he said .   once again  the faint green blur coalesced into the beaming imp .      found the figures  insert name here .  just working on them .     it said  and saluted .      good  but get back in the box  will you .  we   re going out .         certainly  insert name here .  thank you for choosing the        vimes pushed the box into his pocket  and went downstairs .   the main office included not only the duty officer   s desk but also half a dozen smaller ones  where watchmen sat when they had to do the really tricky parts of police work  like punctuating a sentence correctly .  a lot of rooms and corridors opened into it .  a useful result of all this was that any action there attracted a lot of attention very quickly .   if the two trolls very conspicuously in the middle of the room had intended trouble  they   d picked a bad time .  it was between shifts .  currently  they were trying without success to swagger whilst standing still  watched with deep suspicion by seven or eight officers of various shapes .   they   d brought it on themselves .  they were baaad trolls .  at least  they   d like everyone to think so .  but they   d got it wrong .  vimes had seen bad trolls  and these didn   t come close .  they   d tried .  oh  they   d tried .  lichen covered their heads and shoulders .  clan graffiti adorned their bodies  one of them had even had his arm carved  which must have hurt  for that stone cool troll look .  since wearing the traditional belt of human or dwarf skulls would have resulted in the wearer   s heels leaving a groove all the way to the nearest nick  and monkey skulls left the wearer liable to ambush by dwarfs with no grounding in forensic anthropology  these trolls     vimes grinned .  these boys had done the best they could with  oh dear  sheep and goat skulls .  well done  boys  that   s really scary .   it was depressing .  the old time bad trolls didn   t bother with all that stuff .  they just beat you over the head with your own arm until you got the message .      well  gentlemen .     he said .     i   m vimes .      the trolls exchanged glances through the mats of lichen  and one of them lost .      midder chrysophrase he wanna see you     said carved arm sulkily .      is that so .     said vimes .      he wanna see you now     said the troll .      well  he knows where i live     said vimes .      yeah .  he does .      three words  smacking into the silence like lead .  it was the way the troll said them .  a suicidal kind of way .   the silence was broken by the steely sound of bolts being shot home  followed by a click .  the trolls turned .  sergeant detritus was taking the key out of the lock of the watch house   s big  thick  double doors .  then he turned around and his heavy hands landed on the trolls    shoulders .   he sighed .     boys     he said     if dere was a ph . d .  in bein    fick  youse wouldn   t be able to find a pencil .      the troll who   d uttered the not very veiled threat then made another mistake .  it must have been terror that moved his arms  or dumb machismo .  surely no one with a functioning brain cell would have selected that moment to move their arms into what  for trolls  was the attack position .   detritus   s fist moved in a blur  and the crack  as it connected with the troll   s skull  made the furniture rattle .   vimes opened his mouth   and shut it again .  trollish was a very physical language .  and you had to respect cultural traditions  didn   t you .  it wasn   t only dwarfs who were allowed to have them  was it .  besides  you couldn   t crack a troll   s skull even with a hammer and chisel .  and he threatened your family  his hind brain added .  he had it coming     there was a twinge of pain from the wound on his hand  echoed by the stab of a headache .  oh hells .  and igor said the stuff would work .   the stricken troll rocked for a second or two  and then went over forwards in one rigid movement .   detritus walked across to vimes  kicking the recumbent figure en passant .      sorry about dat  sir     he said  and his hand clanged on his helmet as he saluted .     dey got no manners .         all right  that   s enough     said vimes  and addressed the remaining  suddenly very alone messenger .     why does chrysophrase want to see me .         he wouldn   t tell der brothers fick that  would he       said detritus  grinning horribly at the troll .  there was no swagger left now .      all i know is  it   s about der killin    o    the horug     mumbled the troll  taking refuge in surliness .  at the sound of the word the eyes of every watching dwarf narrowed further .  it was a very bad word .      oh boy  oh boy  oh       detritus hesitated .      boy     said vimes out of the corner of his mouth .         boy .     said detritus triumphantly .     you are makin    friends like nobody   s business today .         where   s the meeting .     said vimes .      der pork futures warehouse     said the troll .     you is to come alone       he paused  awareness of his position dawning on him  and added     if you don   t mind .         go and tell your boss i might choose to wander that way  will you .     said vimes .     now get out of here .  let him out  sergeant .         an    take your rubbish home wid you     detritus roared .   he slammed the doors behind the troll  bent under the weight of his fallen comrade .      okay     said vimes  as tensions relaxed .     you heard the troll .  a good citizen wants to help the watch .  i   ll go and see what he   s got to        his eye caught the front page of the times  spread out on the desk .  oh hell  he thought wearily .  there we are  at a time like this  with a troll officer holding a dwarf with his feet off the ground .      it   s a good picture of detritus  sir     said sergeant littlebottom nervously .          the long arm of the law         vimes read aloud .     is that supposed to be funny .         probably it is to people who write headlines     said cheery .      hamcrusher murdered     vimes read .     watch investigating .         where do they get this .     he said aloud .     who tells them .  pretty soon i   ll have to read the times to find out what i   m doing today .     he flung the paper back on the desk .     anything important i need to know about right now .         sergeant colon says there   s been a robbery at the royal       cheery began  but vimes waved that away .      more important than robberies  i mean     he said .      er   another two officers have quit since i sent you that note  sir     said cheery .     corporal ringfounder and constable schist at chittling street .  both say it   s for  er  personal reasons  sir .         schist was a good officer     detritus rumbled  shaking his head .      sounds like he decided to be a good troll instead     said vimes .  he was aware of a stirring behind him .  he still had an audience .  oh well  time for the speech .      i know it   s hard for dwarf and troll officers right now     he said to the room at large .     i know that giving one of your own kind a tap with your truncheon because he   s trying to kick you in the fork might feel like you   re siding with the enemy .  it   s no fun for humans  either  but it   s worse for you .  the badge seems a bit heavy now  right .  you see your people looking at you and wondering whose side you   re on  yes .  well  you   re on the side of the people  which is where the law ought to be .  all the people  i mean  who   re out there beyond the mob  who   re fearful and puzzled and scared to go out at night .  now  funnily enough  the idiots who   re out there right in front of you getting their self defense in first are also the people  but since they don   t seem to remember that  well  you   re doing them a favor by cooling them off a bit .  hold on to that  and hold together .  you think that you should stay home to make sure your ol    mum is okay .  what good would you be against a mob .  together  we can stop things going that far .  this   ll go its course .  i know we   re all being run ragged  but right now i need everyone i can get  and in return there will be jam tomorrow and free beer  too .  maybe i   ll even be a little blind when i   m signing the overtime dockets  who knows .  got it .  but i want you all  whatever  whoever you are  to know this  i   ve got no patience with idiots who   ll drag a grudge across five hundred miles and a thousand years .  this is ankh morpork .  it   s not koom valley .  you know it   s going to be a bad night tonight .  well  i   ll be on duty .  if you are  too  then i   ll want to know that i can depend on you to watch my back as i   ll watch yours .  if i can   t depend on you  i don   t want to see you near me .  any questions .      there was an embarrassed silence  as there always is on such occasions .  then a hand went up .  it belonged to a dwarf .      is it true a troll killed the grag .     he asked .  there was a murmuring from the watchmen  and he went on  a little less timorously     well  he did ask .         captain carrot is investigating     said vimes .     at the moment  we are still in the dark .  but if indeed there has been a murder  then i will see that the murderer is brought to justice  no matter what size they are  what shape they are  who they are  or where they may be .  you have my guarantee on that .  my personal guarantee .  is that acceptable .      the general change in the atmosphere indicated that it was so .      good     he said .     now go out there and be coppers .  go on .      the room emptied of all except those still laboring over the knotty problem of where they should put the comma .      er   permission t   speak freely  sir .     said detritus  knuckling closer .   vimes stared at him .  when i first met you  you were chained to a wall like a watchdog and didn   t speak much beyond a grunt  he thought .  truly  the leopard can change his shorts .      yes  of course     he said .      you ain   t serious  are you .  you   re not going runnin    after a coprolite like chrysophrase  sir .         what   s the worst he can do to me .         rip off your head  grind you to mince  and make soup from your bones  sir     said detritus promptly .     an    if you was a troll  he   d have all your teeth knocked out an    make cuff links out of    em .         why   d he choose to do that now .  do you think he   s looking for a war with us .  that   s not his way .  he   s hardly going to kill me by appointment  is he .  he wants to talk to me .  it   s got to be to do with the case .  he might know something .  i don   t dare not go .  but i want you along .  scrounge up a squad  will you .      a squad would be sensible  he admitted to himself .  the streets were just too   nervous at the moment .  he compromised with detritus and a scratch band of whoever was doing nothing at the moment .  that was one thing you could say about the watch  it was representative .  if you based your politics on what other people looked like  then you couldn   t claim the watch was on the side of any shape .  that was worth hanging on to .   it seemed quieter outside  not so many people on the streets as usual .  that wasn   t a good sign .  ankh morpork could feel trouble ahead like spiders could feel tomorrow   s rain .       what was this .   the creature swam through a mind .  it had seen thousands of minds since the universe began  but there was something strange about this one .   it looked like a city .  ghostly  wavering buildings appeared through a drizzle of midnight rain .  of course  no two minds were alike     the creature was old  although it would be more accurate to say that it had existed for a long time .  when  at the start of all things  the primordial clouds of mind had collapsed into gods and demons and souls of all levels  it had been among those who had never drifted close to a major accretion .  so it had entered the universe aimlessly  without task or affiliation  a scrap of being blowing free  fitting in wherever it could  a sort of complicated thought looking for the right kind of mind .  currently   that is to say  for the past ten thousand years  it had found work as a superstition .   and now it was in this strange  dark city .  there was movement around it .  the place was alive .  and it rained .   for a moment  just then  it had sensed an open door  a spasm of rage it could use .  but just as it leapt to take advantage  something invisible and strong had grabbed it and flung it away .   strange .   with a flick of its tail  it disappeared into an alley .       the pork futures warehouse was   one of those things  the sort that you get in a city that has lived with magic for too long .  the occult reasoning  if such it could be called  was this  pork was an important commodity in the city .  future pork  possibly even pork as yet unborn  was routinely traded by the merchants .  therefore  it had to exist somewhere .  and the pork futures warehouse came into existence  icy cold within as the pork drifted backwards in time .  it was a popular place for cold storage   and for trolls who wanted to think quickly .   even here  away from the more troubled areas of the city  the people on the streets were   watchful .   and now they watched vimes and his motley squad pull up outside of the warehouse doors .      i reckon at least one of us should go in wid you     detritus rumbled  as protective as a mother hen .     chrysophrase won   t be alone  you can bet on dat .     he unslung the piecemaker  the crossbow he had personally built from a converted siege weapon  the multiple bolts of which tended to shatter in the air from the sheer stress of acceleration .  they could remove a door not simply from its frame but also from the world of objects bigger than a match stick .  its incredible inaccuracy was part of its charm .  the rest of the squad very quickly got behind him .      only you  then  sergeant     said vimes .     the rest of you  come in only if you hear screaming .  me screaming  that is .     he hesitated  and then pulled out the gooseberry  which was still humming to itself .     and no interruptions  understand .         yes  insert name here .  hmm hum hmm        vimes pulled open the door .  dead  freezing air poured out around him .  thick frost crackled under his feet .  instantly  his breath twinkled in clouds .   he hated the pork futures warehouse .  the semitransparent slabs of yet to be meat hanging in the air  accumulating reality every day  made him shiver for reasons that had nothing to to with temperature .  sam vimes considered crispy bacon to be a food group in its own right  and the sight of it traveling backwards in time turned his stomach the wrong way .   he took a few steps inside and looked around in the dank  chilly grayness .      commander vimes     he announced  feeling a bit of a fool .   here  away from the doors  freezing mist lay knee high on the floor .  two trolls waded through it toward him .  more lichen  he saw .  more clan graffiti .  more sheep skulls .      leave weapons here     one rumbled .      baaa .     said vimes  striding between them .   there was a click behind him  and the faint song of steel wires   under tension yet yearning to be free .  detritus had shouldered his bow .      you can try takin    dis one off   f me if you like     he volunteered .   vimes saw  further into the mist  a group of trolls .  one or two of them looked like hired grunt .  the others though   he sighed .  all detritus needed to do was fire that thing in this direction and quite a lot of the organized crime in the city would suddenly be very disorganized  as would be vimes if he didn   t hit the floor in time .  but he couldn   t allow that .  there were rules here that went deeper than the law .  besides  a forty foot hole in the warehouse wall would take some explaining .   chrysophrase was sitting on a frost crusted crate .  you could always tell him in a crowd .  he wore suits  when few trolls aspired to more that a few scraps of leather .   he even wore a tie  with a diamond pin .  and today he had a fur coat around his shoulders .  that had to be for show .  trolls liked low temperatures .  they could think faster when their brains were cool .  that   s why the meeting had been called here .  right  vimes thought  trying to stop his teeth from chattering  when it   s my turn it   s going to be in a sauna .      mr .  vimes .  good o    you to be comin        said chrysophrase jovially .     dese gentlemen are all high toned businessmen of my acquaintance .  i    spect you can put names to faces           yeah  the breccia     said vimes .      now den  mr .  vimes  you know dat don   t exist     said chrysophrase innocently .     we just band togeder to furder troll interests in der city via many charitable concerns .  you could say we are community leaders .  dere   s no call for name callin    .      community leaders  vimes thought .  there   d been a lot of talk about community leaders lately  as in    community leaders appealed for calm     a phrase the times used so often that the printers probably left it set in type .  vimes wondered who they were and how they were appointed  and  sometimes  if    appealing for calm    meant winking and saying    do not use those shiny new battle axes in that cupboard over there   no  not that one  the other one .     hamcrusher had been a community leader .      you said you wanted to talk to me alone     he said  nodding toward the shadowy figures .  some of them were hiding their faces .      dat is so .  oh  dese gennlemen behind me .  dey will be leaving us now     said chrysophrase  waving a hand at them .     dey   re just here so    you understand dat one troll  dat is yours truly  is speakin    for der many .  an     at de same time  your good sergeant dere  my ol    frien    detritus  is goin    outside for a smoke  would dat be der case .  dis conversation is between you an    me or it don   t happen .      vimes turned and nodded to detritus .  reluctantly  with a scowl at chrysophrase  the sergeant withdrew .  so did the trolls .  boots crunched over the frost  and then doors slammed shut .   vimes and chrysophrase looked at each other in literally frozen silence .      i can hear you teeth chattin        said chrysophrase .     dis place jus    right for troll  but for you it freezes der brass monkey  right .  dat why i bringed dis fur coat .     he shrugged it off and held it out .     dere jus    you and me here  okay .      pride was one thing  not being able to feel your fingers was another .  vimes wrapped himself in the fine  warm fur .      good .  can   t talk to a man whose ears are froze  eh .     said chrysophrase  pulling out a big cigar case .     firstly  i am hearin    where one of my boys was disrespectful to you .  i am hearin    how him suggestin    i am de kind of troll dat would get pers   nal  dat would raise a hand to your lovely lady an    your liddle boy who is growin    up so fine .  sometimes i am despairin    o    young trolls today .  dey show no respec    .  dey have no style .  dey lack finesse .  if you are wanting a new rockery in your garden  just say der word .         what .  just make sure i never clap eyes on him again     said vimes shortly .      dat will not be a problem     said the troll .  he indicated a small box  about a foot square  beside the crate .  it was far too small to contain a whole troll .   vimes tried to ignore it  but found this hard .      was that all you wanted to see me for .     he said  trying to stop his imagination playing its homemade horrors across his inner eyeballs .      smokin     mr .  vimes .     chrysophrase said  flipping open the case .     der ones on der left is okay for humans .  finest kind .         i   ve got my own     said vimes  pulling out a battered packet .     what is this about .  i   m a busy man .      chrysophrase lit a silvery troll cigar and took a long pull .  there was a smell like burning tin .      yeah  busy because dat ol    dwarf dies     he said  not looking at vimes .      well .         it was no troll done it     said chrysophrase .      how do you know .      now the troll looked directly at vimes .     if it was  i would have foun    out by now .  i bin askin    questions .         so are we .         i bin askin    questions more louder     said the troll .     i get lotsa answers .  sometimes i am gettin    answers to questions i ain   t even asked yet .      i bet you are  vimes thought .  i have to obey rules .      why should you care who kills a dwarf .     he said .      mister vimes .  i am a honest citizen .  it my public duty to care .     chrysophrase watched vimes   s face to see how this was playing  and grinned .     all dis stoopid koom valley t   ing is bad for bidness .  people are getting edgy  pokin    around  askin    questions .  i am sittin    dere gettin    nervous .  an    den i hear my ol    friend mister vimes is on der case and i am thinkin     dat mister vimes  he may be very insensitive to de nu unces of troll culture sometimes  but der man is straight as a arrow and der are on him no flies .  he will see where dis so called troll left his club behind an    he is laughin    his head off  it is so see through like glass .  some dwarf did it an    want to make de trolls look bad  kew eee dee .      he sat back .      what club .     said vimes quietly .      what   s dat .         i haven   t mentioned a club .  there was nothing in the paper about a troll club .         dear mister vimes  dat   s what der lawn ornaments is sayin        said chrysophrase .      and dwarfs talk to you  do they .     said vimes .   the troll looked thoughtfully at the roof  and blew out more smoke .      eventually     he said .     but dat   s jus    detail .  jus    between you an    me  here an    now .  we unnerstan    dese t   ings .  it is clear as anyt   ing dat der crazy dwarfs had a fight  or der ol    dwarf died o    bein alive too long  or              or you asked him a few questions .         no callin    for dat  mister vimes .  dat club is nothin    but a red dried swimmin    thing .  der dwarfs put it dere .         or a troll did the murder  dropped his club  and ran     said vimes .     or he was clever  and thought    no one would believe a troll would be so stupid as to leave his club  so if i do leave it  the dwarfs will get the blame .             hey  good job it so cold in here or i wouldn   t be followin    you .     chrysophrase laughed .     but den i ask  a troll gets into a nest o    dem lousy deep downers and lays out jus    one .  no way  hose  eh .  he   d whack as many of    em as he could  thud  thud .      he looked at vimes   s puzzlement and sighed .      see  any troll gettin    in dere  he   d be a mad troll to start wid .  you know how der kids are all wound up .  people bin feeding dem dat honor an    glory an    destiny stuff  dat coprolite rots your brain faster   n slab  faster even dan slide .  from what i am hearin

surprised .      oh  that .  i don   t play games     said vimes .     and on the subject of slab  you do run the biggest pipeline .  just between you and me  here and now .         nah  i   m out o    dat whole thing     said chrysophrase  waving his cigar dismissively .     you could say i am seein    der error o    my ways .  from now on it   s clean livin    straight down der middle .  property an    financial services  dat is der way forward .         glad to hear it .         besides  der kids are movin    in     chrysophrase went on .     sediment   ry trash .  and dey cuts slab w    bad

 be no trouble to no one  nice and quiet .  but slide make him feel like him der biggest  strongest troll in der worl     don   t need sleep  don   t need food .  after a few weeks  don   t need life .  dat ain   t for me .         yes  why kill your customers .     said vimes .      low blow  mister vimes  low blow .  nah  der new kids  half der time dey on slide deyselves .  too much fightin     too much of no respec    .     he narrowed his eyes and leaned forward .     i know names and places .         it   s your duty as a good citizen to tell me  then     said vimes .  ye gods  what does he think i am .  but i want those names .  slide sounds nasty .  right now we need battle crazy trolls like we need a hole in the head  which we   ll probably end up getting .      can   t tell you .  dat der problem     said chrysophrase .     dis ain   t der time .  you know what   s happening out dere .  if der stupid dwarfs want to fight  we   ll need every troll .  dat   s what i sayin .     i tellin    my people  give vimes a chance .  be good citizens  not rockin    around der boat .  people still listenin    to me an    my   associates .  but not for much longer .  i hope you on der case  mister vimes .         captain carrot is investigating right now     said vimes .   chrysophrase   s eyes narrowed again .      carrot ironfoundersson .     he said .     der big dwarf .  he a lovely boy  bright as a button  but to trolls dat won   t look so good  i tell you flat .         it doesn   t look that good to dwarfs  if it come to that     said vimes .     but it   s my watch .  i   ll not be told who i put on what case .         you trust him .     said chrysophrase .      yes .         okay  he a finker  he shiny .  but   ironfoundersson .  dwarf name .  dat a problem right dere .  but der name vimes   dat name means a lot .  can   t be bribed  he once arrested der patrician  not der sharpest knife in der drawer but honest like anything and he don   t stop digging .     chrysophrase caught vimes   s expression .     dat   s what dey say .  i wishin    vimes was on dis case     cos him like me  bare knuckle boy  he get at der truth soon enough .  and to him i say  no troll did dat t   ing  not like dat .      forget that he   s talking street troll  vimes told himself .  that   s just to seem like a good ol    troll .  this is chrysophrase .  he beat out most of the old style mobsters  who were pretty sharp players themselves  and he holds off the thieves    guild with one hand .  and that   s without sitting in a pile of snow .  you know he   s right .  but   not the sharpest knife in the drawer .  thank you so very much .   but captain carrot was shiny  was he .  vimes   s mind always looked for connections  and came up with     who is mr .  shine .      chrysophrase was absolutely still  apart from the greenish smoke spiraling up from the cigar .  then  when he spoke  his air was uncharacteristically jovial .      him .  oh  a story for kids .  kinda like a troll legend from der far off days o    long ahead     he said .       like a folk hero .         yeah  dat kinda t   ing .  kinda silly t   ing people talk about when times is tricky .  just a willie der wisp  not real .  dis is modern times .      and that seemed to be that .   vimes stood up .      all right  i   ve heard what you say     he said .     and now i   ve got a watch to run .      chrysophrase puffed his cigar and flicked the ash into the frost  where it sizzled .      you going back to der watch house by way o    turn again lane .     he said .      no  that   s well out of       vimes stopped .  there had been a hint of suggestion in the troll   s voice .      give my regard to der ol    lady at next door to der cake shop     said the troll .      er   i will  will i .     said vimes  nonplussed .     sergeant .      the door at the far end opened with a bang  and detritus ran in  crossbow at the ready .  vimes  aware that one of the troll   s few faults was an inability to understand all the implications of the term    safety catch     fought down a dreadful urge to dive for the ground .      time   s comin    when we all got to know where we standin        mused chrysophrase  as if talking to the audience of ghostly pork .     an    who is standin    next to us .      as vimes headed to the door  the troll added     give der coat to your lady  mister vimes .  wi    my compliments .      vimes stopped dead  and looked down at the coat over his shoulders .  it was of some silvery fur  beautifully warm  but not as warm as the rage rising within him .  he   d nearly walked out wearing it .  he   d come that close .   he shrugged it off and wrapped it into a ball .  quite probably several dozen small rare squeaky things had died to make this  but he could see to it that their deaths were not  in some small way  in vain .   he threw the bundle high in the air  yelled    sergeant .     and threw himself on the floor .  there was the instant slap of the bow  a sound as of a swarm of maddened bees  the plinkplinkplink of arrow fragments turning a circle of metal roof into a colander  and the smell of burnt hair .   vimes got to his feet .  what was falling around him was a kind of hairy snow .   he met chrysophrase   s gaze .      trying to bribe a watch officer is a serious offense     he said .   the troll winked .     honest like anyt   ing  i tell    em .  nice to have dis little talk  mister vimes .      when they were well outside  vimes pulled detritus into an alley  insofar as it was possible to pull a troll anywhere .      okay  what do you know about slide .     he said .   the troll   s red eyes gleamed .     i bin hearin    rumors .         head to treacle mine road and put a heavy squad together .  go to turn again lane  behind the scours .  there   s a wedding cake maker up there  i think .  you   ve got a nose for drugs .  poke it around  sergeant .         right .     said detritus .     you bin told somethin     sir .         let   s just say i think it   s an earnest of good intent  shall we .     said vimes .      dat   s good  sir     said the troll .     ernest who .         er   someone we know wants to show us what a good citizen he is .  get to it  okay .      detritus slung his crossbow over his shoulder for ease of carriage and knuckled off at high speed .  vimes leaned against the wall .  this was going to be a long day .  and now he     on the wall  just a little above head height  a troll had scored a rough sketch of a cut diamond .  you could tell troll graffiti easily   they did it with a fingernail and it was usually an inch deep in the masonry .   next to the diamond was scored  shine .      ahem     said a small voice in his pocket .  vimes sighed  and pulled out the gooseberry  while still staring at the word .      yes .         you said you didn   t want to be interrupted       said the imp defensively .      well .  what have you got to say .         it   s eleven minutes to six  insert name here     said the imp meekly .      good grief .  why didn   t you tell me .     vimes looked aghast .      because you said you didn   t want to be interrupted .     the imp quavered .      yes  but not       vimes stopped .  eleven minutes .  he couldn   t run it  not at this time of day .     six o   clock is   important     he muttered .      you didn   t tell me that .     said the imp  holding its head in its hands .     you just said no interruptions .  i   m really  really sorry        shine forgotten  vimes looked around desperately at the nearby buildings .  there wasn   t much use for clacks towers down here  where the slaughterhouse district met the docks  but he spotted the big semaphore tower atop the dock superintendent   s office .      get up there .     he ordered  opening the box .     tell them you   ve come from me and this is priority one  right .  they   re to tell pseudopolis yard where i   m starting from .  i   ll cross the river on misbegot bridge and head along prouts .  the officers at the yard will know what this is all about .  go .      the imp went from despair to enthusiasm in an instant .  it saluted .     yes indeed  sir .  the bluenosetm integrated messenger service will not let you down  insert name here .  i shall interface right away .     it leapt down and became a disappearing blur of very pale green .   vimes ran down to the dockside and began to race upriver  past the ships .  the docks were always too crowded  and the road was an obstacle course of bales and ropes and piles of crates  with an argument every ten yards .  but vimes was a runner by nature  and knew all the ways to make progress in the city   s crowded streets .  he dodged and leapt  jinked and weaved  and  where necessary  barged .  a rope tripped him up  he rolled upright .  a stevedore bumped into him  vimes laid him out with an uppercut and speeded up in case the man had chums around .   this was important     a shiny  four horse carriage swung out of monkey street  with two footmen clinging to the back of it .  vimes speeded up in a desperate burst  grabbed a handhold  pulled himself up between the astonished footmen  dragged himself across the swaying roof  and dropped down on the seat beside the young driver .      city watch     he announced  flashing his badge .     keep going straight ahead .         but i   m supposed to turn left onto       the young man began .      and give it a touch of the whip  if you please     said vimes  ignoring him .     this is important .         oh  right .  death defying high speed chase  is it .     said the coachman  enthusiasm rising .     right .  i   m the boy for that .  you   ve got your man right here  sir .  d   you know  i can make this carriage go along for fifty yards on two wheels .  only old miss robinson won   t let me .  right side or left side  just say the word .  hyah .  hyah .         look  just       vimes began  as the whip cracked overhead .      o   course  getting the horses to run along on two legs was the trick .  actually  it   s more of a hop  you might say     the coachman went on  turning his hat around for minimum wind resistance .     here  want to see my wheelie .         not especially     said vimes  staring ahead .      the hooves don   t    arf raise sparks when i do me wheelie  i can tell you .  hyah .      the scenery was blurring .  ahead was the cut through leading to two pint dock .  it was normally covered by a swing bridge        normally .   it was swung now .  vimes could see the masts of a ship being warped out of the dock and into the river .      oh  don   t you bother about that  sir     yelled the coachman beside him .     we   ll go along the quay and jump it .         you can   t jump a two master with a four horse carriage  man .         i bet you can if you aim between the masts  sir .  hyah .  hyah .      ahead of the coach  men were running for cover .  behind it  the footmen were seeking other employment .  vimes pushed the boy back into his seat  grabbed a handful of reins  put both feet against the brake lever  and hauled .   the wheels locked .  the horses began to turn .  the coach slid  the metal rims of the wheels sending up sparks and the throaty scream of metal .  the horses turned some more .  the coach began to swing  dragging the horses with it  whirling them out like fairground mounts .  their hooves made trails of fire across the cobblestones .   at this point  vimes let go of everything  gripped the underside of the seat with one hand  held on to the rail with the other  shut his eyes  and waited for all the noise to die away .   blessedly  it did .  only one little sound remained  a petulant banging on the coach roof  caused  probably  by a walking stick .  a querulous  elderly female voice could be heard saying     johnny .  have you been driving fast again  young man .         a bootlegger   s turn .     johnny breathed  looking at a team of four steaming horses now facing back the way they   d come .     i am impressed .      he turned to vimes  who wasn   t there .   the men moving the ship had dropped their ropes and run at the sight of coach and four spinning down the road toward them .  the dock entrance was narrow .  a man could easily scramble up a rope onto the deck  run across the ship  and let himself down on the cobbles on the other side and this  a man had just done .   speeding along  vimes could see that misbegot bridge was going to be a struggle .  an overloaded hay wagon had wedged itself between the rickety houses that lined the bridge  ripped out part of someone   s upper story  and had shed some of its load in the process .  there was a fight going on between the carter and the unimpressed owner of the new bungalow .  valuable seconds were spent struggling over and through the hay until he was hurrying through the backed up traffic to the other end of the bridge .  ahead of him was the wide thoroughfare known as prouts  full of vehicles and uphill all the way .   he wasn   t going to make it .  it must be gone five to six already .  the thought of it  the thought of that little face        mister vimes .      he turned .  a mail coach had just pulled out onto the road behind him and was coming up at a trot .  carrot was sitting beside the driver and waving frantically at him .      get on the step  sir .     he yelled .     you don   t have much time .      vimes started to run and  as the coach drew level  jumped onto the door   s step and hung on .      isn   t this the mail coach to quirm .     he shouted  as the driver urged the horses into a canter .      that   s right  sir     said carrot .     i explained it was a matter of extreme importance .      vimes redoubled his grip .  the mail coaches had good horses .  the wheels  not very far away from him  were already a blur .      how did you get here so quick .     he yelled .      shortcut through the apothecary gardens  sir .         what .  that little walk by the river .  that   s never wide enough for a coach like this .         it was a bit of a squeeze  sir  yes .  it got easier when the coach lamps scraped off .      vimes took in the state of the coach   s side .  the paintwork was scored all along it .      all right     he shouted     tell the driver i   ll meet the bills  of course .  but it   ll be wasted  carrot .  park lane   ll be jam packed at this time of day .         don   t worry  sir .  i should hang on very tight if i were you  sir .     shouted carrot  above the rising wind .   vimes heard the whip crack .  this was a real mail coach .  mailbags don   t care if they   re comfortable .  he could feel the acceleration .   park lane would be coming up very soon .  vimes couldn   t see much  because the wind of their flight was making his eyes water  but up ahead was one of the city   s most fashionable traffic jams .  it was bad enough at any time of day  but early evening was particularly horrible  owing to the ankh morpork belief that right of way was the prerogative of the heaviest vehicle or the gobbiest driver .  there were minor collisions all the time  which were inevitably followed by both vehicles blocking the junction while the drivers got down to discussing road safety issues with reference to the first weapon they could get their hands on .  and it was into this maelstrom of jostling horses  scurrying pedestrians  and cursing drivers that the mail coach was heading  apparently  at a full gallop .   he shut his eyes and then  hearing a change in the sound of the wheels  risked opening them again .   the coach flew across the junction .  vimes had a momentary glimpse of a huge line  fuming and shouting behind a couple of immovable troll officers  before they were spinning on down toward scoone avenue .      you closed the road .  you closed the road .     he yelled as they plunged on .      and kings way  sir .  just in case     carrot shouted down .      you closed two major roads .  two whole damn roads .  in the rush hour .         yes  sir     said carrot .     it was the only way .      vimes hung on  speechless .  would he have dared to do that .  but that was carrot all over .  there was a problem  and now it   s gone .  admittedly  the whole city is probably solid with wagons by now  but that   s a new problem .   he   d be home in time .  would a minute have mattered .  no  probably not  although his young son appeared to have a very accurate internal clock .  possibly even two minutes would be okay .  three minutes  even .  you could go to five  perhaps .  but that was just it .  if you could go to five minutes  then you   d go to ten  then half an hour  a couple of hours   and not see your son all evening .  so that was that .  six o   clock  prompt .  every day .  read to young sam .  no excuses .  he   d promised himself that .  no excuses .  no excuses at all .  once you had a good excuse  you opened the door to bad excuses .   he had nightmares about being too late .   he had a lot of nightmares about young sam .  they involved empty cots and darkness .   it had all been too   good .  in a few short years  he  sam vimes  had gone up in the world like a balloon .  he was a duke  he commanded the watch  he was powerful  he was married to a woman whose compassion  love  and understanding he knew a man such as he did not deserve  and he was as rich as creosote .  fortune had rained its gravy  and he   d been the man with the big bowl .  and it had all happened so fast .   and then young sam had come along .  at first it had been fine .  the baby was  well  a baby  all lolling head and burping and unfocused eyes  entirely the preserve of his mother .  and then  one evening  his son had turned and looked directly at vimes  with eyes that for his father outshone the lamps of the world  and fear had poured into sam vimes   s life in a terrible wave .  all this good fortune  all this fierce joy   it was wrong .  surely the universe could not allow this amount of happiness in one man  not without presenting a bill .  somewhere a big wave was cresting  and when it broke over his head it would wash everything away .  some days  he was sure he could hear its distant roar     shouting incoherent thanks  he leapt down as the coach slowed  flailed to stay upright  and skidded into his driveway .  the front door was already opening when he raced toward it  scattering gravel  and there was willikins holding up the book .  vimes grabbed it and pounded up the stairs as  down in the city  the clocks began to mark various approximations of the hour of six o   clock .   sybil had been adamant about not having a nursemaid .  vimes  for once  had been even more adamant that they got one  and a head cavern girl for the pedigree dragon pens outside .  a body could only do so much  after all .  he   d won .  purity  who seemed a decent type  had just finished settling young sam into his cot when vimes staggered in .  she gave him about one third of a curtsy before she caught his pained expression and remembered last week   s impromptu lecture on the rights of man  and then she hurried out .  it was important that no one else was here .  this moment in time was just for the sams .   young sam pulled himself up against the cot   s rails  and said    da .     the world went soft .   vimes stroked his son   s hair .  it was funny  really .  he spent the day yelling and shouting and talking and bellowing   but here  in this quiet time smelling  thanks to purity  of soap  he never knew what to say .  he was tongue tied in the presence of fourteen month old baby .  all the things he thought of saying  like    who   s daddy   s little boy  then .     sounded horribly false  as though he   d got them from a book .  there was nothing to say nor  in this soft pastel room  anything that needed to be said .   there was a grunt from under the cot .  dribble the dragon was dozing there .  ancient  fireless  with ragged wings and no teeth  he clambered up the stairs every day and took up station under the cot .  no one knew why .  he made little whistling noises in his sleep .   the happy silence enveloped vimes  but it couldn   t last .  there was the reading of the picture book to be undertaken .  that was the meaning of six o   clock .   it was the same book  every day .  the pages of said book were rounded and soft where young sam had chewed them  but to one person in this nursery this was the book of books  the greatest story ever told .  vimes didn   t need to read it anymore .  he knew it by heart .   it was called    where   s my cow .      the un identified complainant has lost their cow .  that was the story  really .   page one started promisingly       where   s my cow .   is that my cow .   it goes baa .   it is a sheep .   no  that   s not my cow .     then the author began to get to grips with their material       where   s my cow .   is that my cow .   it goes naaaay .   it is a horse .   no  that   s not my cow .     at this point  the author had reached an agony of creation and was writing from the racked depths of their soul .       where   s my cow .   is that my cow .   it goes hruuugh .   it is a hippopotamus .   no  that   s not my cow .     this was a good evening .  young sam was already grinning widely and crowing along with the plot .   eventually  the cow would be found .  it was that much of a page turner .  of course  some suspense was lent by the fact that all other animals were presented in some way that could have confused a kitten who perhaps had been raised in a darkened room .  the horse was standing in front of a hat stand  as they so often did  and the hippo was eating at a trough against which was an upturned pitchfork .  seen from the wrong direction  the tableau might look for just one second like a cow     young sam loved it  anyway .  it must have been the most cuddled book in the world .   nevertheless  it bothered vimes  even though he   d got really good at the noises and would go up against any man in his rendition of the hruuugh .  but is this a book for a city kid .  when would he ever hear these noises .  in the city  the only sound those animals would make was    sizzle .     but the nursery was full of the conspiracy  with bah lambs and teddy bears and fluffy ducklings everywhere he looked .   one evening  after a trying day  he   d tried the vimes street version       where   s my daddy .   is that my daddy .   he goes    bugrit .  millennium hand and shrimp .      he is foul ol    ron .   no  that   s not my daddy .     it had been going really well when vimes heard a meaningful little cough from the doorway  wherein stood sybil .  next day  young sam  with a child   s unerring instinct for this sort of thing  said    buglit .     to purity .  and that  although sybil never raised the subject even when they were alone  was that .  from then on sam stuck rigidly to the authorized version .   he recited it tonight  while wind rattled the windows  and this little nursery world  with its pink and blue peace  its creatures who were ever so very soft and wooly and fluffy  seemed to enfold them both .  on the nursery clock  a little wooly lamb rocked the seconds away .   when he not quite awoke  in twilight  with ragged strands of dark sleep filling his mind  vimes stared in incomprehension at the room .  panic filled him .  what was this place .  why were there all these grinning animals .  what was lying on his foot .  who was this doing the asking  and why was he wrapped in a blue shawl with ducks on it .   blessed recollection flowed in .  young sam was fast asleep  with vimes   s helmet clutched like a teddy bear  and dribble  always on the lookout for somewhere warm to slump  had rested his head on vimes   s boot .  already the leather was covered with goo .   vimes carefully retrieved his helmet  gathered the shawl around him  and wandered down into the big front hall .  he could see a light on under the door of the library  and so  still slightly muzzy  he pushed his way in .   two watchmen stood up .  sybil turned in her chair by the fire .  vimes felt the ducks slither down his shoulders  slowly  and end up in a heap on the floor .      i let you sleep  sam     said lady sybil .     you didn   t get in this morning until after three .         everyone   s double shifting  dear     said sam  daring carrot and sally to even think about telling anyone they   d seen the boss wearing a blue shawl covered in ducks .     i   ve got to set a good example .         i   m sure you intend to  sam  but you look like a horrible warning     said sybil .     when did you last eat .         i had a lettuce  tomato  and bacon sandwich  dear     he said  endeavoring by tone of his voice to suggest that the bacon had been a mere condiment rather than a slab barely covered by the bread .      i expect you jolly well did     said sybil  rather more accurately conveying the fact that she didn   t believe a word of it .     captain carrot has something to tell you .  now  you sit down and i   m going to see what   s happened to dinner .      when she bustled out in the direction of the kitchens  vimes turned to the watchmen and debated for a moment whether to give that sheepish little grin and eye roll that between men means    women  eh .     and decided not to  on the basis that the watchmen consisted of lance constable von humpeding  who   d think he was a fool  and captain carrot  who wouldn   t know what it meant .   he settled instead on    well .         we did the best we could  sir     said carrot .     i was right .  that mine is a very unhappy place .         murder scenes usually are  yes .         actually  i don   t think we found the murder scene  sir .         didn   t you see the body .         yes  sir .  i think .  really  sir  you had to be there               i don   t think i can go through with this     angua had hissed as she headed along treacle street again .      what   s wrong .     said carrot .  angua jerked a thumb over her shoulder .      her .  vampires and werewolves  not good company .         but she   s a black ribboner     carrot protested mildly .     she doesn   t           she doesn   t have to do anything .  she just is .  for one of us  being around a vampire is like the worst bad hair day you can imagine .  and believe me  a werewolf knows what a real bad hair day is .         is it the smell .     said carrot .      well  that   s not good  but it   s more than that .  they   re so   poised .  so perfect .  i get near her and i feel   hairy .  i can   t help it  it goes back thousands of years .  it   s the image .  vampires are always so   cool  so in control  but werewolves are  well  shambling animals .  underdogs .         but that   s not true .  a lot of black ribbboners are totally neurotic  and you   re so sleek and           not when i   m around vampires .  they trigger off something .  look  stop trying to be logical about it  will you .  i hate it when you get logical on me .  why didn   t mister vimes hold out .  all right  all right  i   m on top of it .  but it   s hard  that   s all .         i   m sure it   s not easy for her  either       carrot began .   angua gave him a look .  but that   s him  she thought .  he really does think like that .  it   s just that he doesn   t know when saying something like that is a really bad idea .  not easy for her .  when was it ever easy for me .  at least she probably doesn   t have to stash changes of clothes around the city .  okay  going cold bat can   t be nice  but we get cold bat every month .  and when do i ever rip out a throat .  i hunt chickens .  and i pay for them in advance .  does she suffer from plt .  i don   t think so .  oh gods  and it   s already well past waxing gibbous tonight .  i can feel my hair growing .  bloody vampires .  they make such a big thing about not being murderous bloodsuckers anymore .  they get all the sympathy .   even his .   all this flashed past in a second .  she said     let   s just get down there and get it done and get out  shall we .      there was still a crowd hanging around near the entrance .  among them was otto chriek  who gave carrot a little shrug .   there were still guards on duty  too  but it was clear that someone had been talking to them .  they nodded to the squad when they arrived .  one of them even opened the door  very politely .   carrot beckoned the other watchmen closer .      everything we say will be overheard  understand .     he said .     everything .  so be careful .  and remember   as far as they are concerned  you can   t see in the dark .      he led the way inside  to where helmclever stood  beaming and edgy .      welcome  head banger     said the dwarf .      er  if we are using morkporkian  i would prefer captain carrot     said carrot .      as you wish  smelter     said the dwarf .     the elevator awaits .      as they descended  carrot said     what powers this  please .         a device     said helmclever  pride breaking out over his nervousness .      really .  you have many devices .     said carrot .      an axle and an average bar .         an average bar .  i   ve only every heard of them .         we are fortunate .  i will be happy to show it to you .  it is invaluable for food preparation     helmclever gabbled .     and down below we have a number of cubes  of varying powers .  nothing may be withheld from the smelter .  i am ordered to show you everything you wish to see and tell you everything you wish to know .         thank you     said carrot as the elevator stopped in blackness speckled with the corpse glow of vurms .     how large are your diggings here .         i cannot tell you that     said helmclever quickly .     i do not know .  ah  here is ardent .  i will go back up           no  helmclever  remain with us  please     said a darker shadow in the gloom .     you should see this  too .  good day to you  captain carrot and       angua detected an element of distaste       ladies .  please follow me .  i am sorry for the lack of light .  perhaps your eyes will adapt .  i will be happy to describe to you any object that you touch .  now i will lead you to the place where the dreadful occurrence   occurred .      angua looked around as they were led along the tunnel  noting that carrot had to walk with his knees slightly bent .  head banger  eh .  funny  you never mention that to the lads .   every dozen yards or so  ardent would stop in front of a round door  invariably with the vurms clustered around it  and turn a wheel .  the doors creaked when they opened  and they opened with a ponderousness that suggested they were heavy .  here and there in the tunnels were   things  mechanical things  hanging from the wall and clearly there with a purpose .  vurms glowed around them .  she hadn   t got a clue what the objects were for  but carrot greeted them with enthusiastic glee  like a schoolboy .      you have air bells and water boots  mr .  ardent .  i   ve only ever heard of them .         you were raised in the good rock of copperhead  were you not  captain .  mining in this wet plain is like digging tunnels in the sea .         and the iron doors are quite watertight  are they .         yes  indeed .  airtight  too .         remarkable .  i should like to visit again  when this wretched business is over .  a dwarf mine under the city .  it   s quite hard to believe .         i   m sure that could be arranged  captain .      and that was carrot at work .  he could sound so innocent  so friendly  so   stupid  in a puppy dog kind of way  and then he suddenly became this big block of steel and you walked right into it .  by the smell of it  sally was watching him with interest .   be sensible  angua told herself .  don   t let the vampire get to you .  don   t start believing you   re stupid and hairy .  think clearly .  you do have a brain .   surely people could go mad  living in this murk .  angua found it easier to close her eyes .  down here  her nose worked better without distraction .  darkness helped .  with her eyes shut  various faint colors danced across her brain .  without the stink of the damned vampire  though  she would have been able to pick up a lot more .  the stench poisoned every sensation .  hold on  don   t think like that  you   re just letting your mind do the thinking for you   hang on  that   s wrong     there was a faint outline in the corner of the next chamber  which was quite large .  it looked like   an outline .  a chalk outline .  a glowing chalk outline .      i understand this is the approved method .     said ardent .     you will be aware of night chalk  captain .  it is made of crushed vurm .  the glow persists for about a day .  on the floor here you will see  or rather  you will feel the club that dealt him his deathblow .  just under your hand  captain .  there is blood on it .  i regret the darkness  but we kept the vurms out .  they would have feasted  you understand .      angua saw carrot  outlined in his permanent smell of soap  feel his way across the space .  his hand touched another metal door .      where does this go  sir .     he said  tapping it .      to the outer chambers .         was it open at the time the troll attacked the grag .      you really think a troll did .  angua wondered .      i believe so     said ardent .      then i would like it open now  please .         i cannot agree to that request  captain .         i did not intend it to be a request  sir .  after it has been opened  i will need to know who was in the mine at the time the troll broke in .  i will need to speak to them  and to whoever discovered the body .  hara   g  j   kargra .      for angua  the smell of ardent changed .  under all those layers  the dwarf was suddenly uncertain .  he   d walked right into it .  he hesitated for several seconds before replying .      i will   endeavor to meet your reque   your requirements  smelter     he said .     i will leave you now .  come  helmclever .         grz dava   j .     said carrot .     k   zakra   j .  d   j h   ragna ra   d   j .      ardent stepped forward  uncertainty growing  and held out both hands  palms down .  for a moment  until his sleeves slipped  angua saw a faintly glowing symbol on his right wrist .  every deep downer had a draht as unique evidence of identity  in a world of shrouded figures .  she   d heard they were made by tattooing vurm blood under the skin .  it sounded painful .   carrot took his hands for a moment  and then let go .      thank you     he said  as if the dwarfish interlude had not taken place .  the two dwarfs hurried away .   in the thick darkness  the watchmen were left alone .      what was all that about .     said angua .      just reassuring him     said carrot cheerfully .  he reached into a pocket .     now we   ve arrived  let   s have some light in here  shall we .      angua smelled his hand move vigorously across the wall once or twice  as if he was painting .  there arose an aroma of   pork pie .      soon be brighter     he said .      captain carrot  this wasn   t where       sally began .      all in good time  lance constable     said carrot firmly .     for now  we just observe .         but i must tell you           later on  lance constable     said carrot a little louder .  vurms were flowing around the open door they   d arrived by  and across the stone .     by the way  er  sally   will you be all right if we view the body .      that   s right  angua thought  think of her .  i   ve dealt with blood every day .  walk a mile in my nostrils .      old blood will not be a problem  sir     said sally .     there   s some in here .  but there   s           i expect they   ve set up a morgue     said carrot quickly .     the death rites are quite complex .      morgue .  a home away from home for you  my dear .  snarled angua   s inner wolf .   the vurms were spreading out now  crawling across the wall with a purpose .   she crouched down  to bring her nose nearer to the floor .  i can smell dwarfs  lots of dwarfs  angua thought .  hard to smell trolls  especially underground .  blood on the club  like a flower .  dwarf smell on the club  but there   s dwarf smell everywhere .  i can smell   hang on  that   s familiar     the floor mostly smelled of slime and loam .  carrot   s footprints showed up  and so did hers .  there was a lot of dwarf smell  and she could still just make out the smell of their concern .  this is where they found the body  then .  but this patch of mud here  this was different .  it had been trodden into the floor  but it smelled just like the heavy clay from up around quarry lane .  who lived in quarry lane .  most of the trolls in ankh morpork .   a clue .   she smiled in the dwindling darkness .  and the trouble with clues  as mister vimes always said  was that they were so easy to make .  you could walk around with a pocket full of the bloody things .   the darkness was disappearing because the light was growing .  angua looked up .   there was a huge  bright symbol on the wall where carrot had touched it .  he dragged some meat across it  she thought .  they   ve turned up for the feast     ardent came back in  with helmclever trailing after him .   he got as far as     the door here can be opened again but  alas  we       and stopped .   they were happy vurms .  by the standards of greeny white glow  they were brilliant .   behind carrot there was now a gently glowing circle  with two diagonal lines slashed through it .  both dwarfs stared at it as if in shock .      well  let   s take a look  shall we .     said carrot  apparently oblivious to all this .         we  alas  the water   water   not entirely watertight   the other doors   the troll caused flooding       ardent murmured  not taking his eyes off the glow .      but you say we can go through here  at least .     said carrot politely  pointing to the sealed door .      er   yes .  yes .  certainly .      the steward hurried forward and produced a key .  the wheel  unlocked  turned easily .  angua was acutely aware of how the muscles on carrot   s bare arms glistened and pumped as he pulled the metal door open .   oh no  not yet  surely .  she ought to have at least another day .  it was the vampire  that   s what it was  standing there looking so innocent .  bits of her body wanted her to become a wolf  right now  to defend herself     there was a pillared room on the other side of the door .  it smelled damp and unfinished .  there were vurms on the ceiling  but the floor was muddy and squelched underfoot .   angua could make out another dwarf door across the room  and there was one on either side as well .      we take spoil to a heap on the waste ground outside     said ardent .     we  er  believe the troll got in that way .  it was an unpardonable oversight .     he still sounded uneasy .      and the troll was not seen .     said carrot  kicking at the mud .      no .  these chambers are finished .  the diggers are elsewhere  but they came as soon as they could .  we believe the grag had come up here for solitude .  to die at the random hand of an abomination .         lucky for the troll  wasn   t it  sir .     said angua sharply .     he just happened to wander in and stumble across hamcrusher .      carrot   s boot struck something metallic .  he kicked some more mud away .      you   ve laid rails .     he said .     you must be shifting a lot of spoil  sir .         better to push than to carry     said ardent .     now  i have arranged for           hold on  what   s this .     said carrot .  he squatted down and pulled at something pale .     it   s a piece of bone  by the look of it .  on a string .         there are plenty of old bones     said ardent .     now  i        it came free with a gloop  and grinned at them in the sickly light .      it doesn   t look very old  sir     said carrot .   just one breath was enough for angua .      it   s a sheep skull     she said .     about three months dead .     oh  another clue  she added to herself .  nice and convenient for us to find  too .      could have been dropped by the troll     said carrot .      a troll .     said ardent  backing away .   it wasn   t the reaction angua had expected .  ardent had been nervous already  but now  under all those wrappings  he was on the verge of panic .      you did say a troll had attacked the grag  sir .     said carrot .      but we never   i never saw that before .  why didn   t we find it .  did it come back .         all the doors are sealed  sir     said carrot patiently .     aren   t they .         but have we sealed it in here with us .     it was practically a shriek .      you   d know  sir  wouldn   t you .     said carrot .     trolls sort of  well  stand out .         i must fetch guards .     said ardent  backing away toward the single open door .     it could be anywhere .         then you could be heading right toward it  sir     said angua .   ardent stopped dead for a moment  and then uttered a little whimper and ran into the dark  helmclever on his heels .      well  how do we all think that went .     said angua  with a horrible smile .     and what was that you said to him in dwarfish      you know i am a dwarf in the brotherhood of all dwarfs    .         erm     with emphatic certainty you know me .  i observe the rites of the dwarf .  what who am i .  i am the brothers united         said sally carefully .      well done  lance constable .     said carrot .     that was an excellent translation .         yes  did you bite someone clever .     said angua .      i am a black ribboner  sergeant     said sally meekly .     and i   m naturally good at languages .  while we   re alone  captain  can i mention something else .         certainly     said carrot  trying the wheel on one of the closed doors .      i think a lot of things are wrong here  sir .  there was something very strange about the way ardent reacted to that skull .  why would he think the troll was still here  after all that time .         a troll getting into a dwarf mine can do a lot of damage before it   s stopped     said carrot .      ardent really wasn   t expecting that skull  sir     said sally  pressing on .     i heard his heart racing .  it terrified him .  er   something more  sir .  there   s lots of city dwarfs here .  dozens .  i can feel their hearts  too .  there are six grags .  their hearts beat very slowly .  and there are other dwarfs  too .  strange ones  and only a few of them .  maybe ten .         that   s useful to know  lance constable  thank you very much .         yes  i don   t know how we managed before you came     said angua .  she walked quickly over to the other side of the dank room so that they wouldn   t see her face .   she needed fresh air  not the pervasive  clinging  old root cellar reek of this place .  her head was full of shouting .  the temperance league .     not one drop    .  did anyone believe that for one minute .  but everyone wanted to fall for it  because vampires could be so charming .  of course they were .  it was part of being a vampire .  it was the only way to get people to stay the night in the dreadful castle .  everyone knew a leopard couldn   t change his shorts .  but no  stick on a stupid black ribbon and learn the words for    lips that touch ichor shall never touch mine    and they fall for it every time .  but werewolves .  well  they were just sad monsters  weren   t they .  never mind that life was a daily struggle with the inner wolf  never mind that you had to force yourself to walk past every lamppost  never mind that in every petty argument you had to fight back the urge to settle it all with just one bite .   never mind that  because everyone knew that a creature that was a wolf and a human combined was a kind of dog .  they were expected to behave .   part of her was shouting that this wasn   t so  that this was just plt and the known effects of a vampire   s presence  but somehow  now  with the smells around her becoming so strong that they were approaching solidity  she did not want to listen .  she wanted to smell the world  she was practically climbing into her own nose .   after all  that was why she was in the watch  wasn   t it .  for her nose .   new smell  new smell     sharp blue gray of lichen  the browns and purples of old carrion  undertones of wood and leather   even as a full wolf  she   d never tasted the air so forensically as this .  something else  sharp  chemical   the air was full of the smell of damp and dwarfs  but these little traces ran through it like a piccolo hornpipe through a requiem  and formed one thing        troll     she croaked .     troll .  troll with skull belt and head locks .  on slab  or something like it .  troll .     angua was almost barking at the far door now .     open the door .  this way .      she was barely needing her eyes now  but there on the metal of the door  in charcoal  someone had drawn a circle with two diagonal lines through it .   suddenly carrot was by her side .  at least he had the decency not to say    are you sure .     as he rattled the big wheel .  the door was locked .      i don   t think there   s water behind this     he said .      oh  really .     angua managed .     you know that was just   to keep us out .      carrot turned .  running toward them was a squad of dwarfs .  they were heading for the door as though quite oblivious to the presence of the watchmen .      don   t let them go through first .     said angua through gritted teeth .     trail is   faint .      carrot drew his sword with one hand and held up his badge with the other .      city watch .     he roared .     lower your weapons  please .  thank you .      the squad slowed  which meant that  in the nature of these things  those at the back piled into the hesitant ones in front .      this is a crime scene .     carrot announced .     i am still the smelter .  mr .  ardent  are you there .  do you have guards on the other side of this door .      ardent pushed through the throng of dwarfs .      no  i believe not     he said .     is the troll still behind it .      carrot glanced at sally  who shrugged .  vampires had never developed the ability to listen for troll hearts .  there was no point .      possibly  but i don   t think so     said carrot .     please unlock it .  we might yet find a trail .         captain carrot  you know that the safety of the mine must always come first .     said ardent .     of course you must give chase .  but first we will open the door  and make certain there is no danger behind it .  you must concede us that .         let them     hissed angua .     it   ll be a clearer scent .  i   ll be okay .      carrot nodded  and whispered back     well done .      under her flesh  she felt her tail want to wag .  she wanted to lick his face .  it was the dog part of her doing the thinking .  you   re a good dog .  it was important to be a good dog .   carrot pulled her aside as a couple of dwarfs approached the door purposefully .      but it   s long gone     she murmured as two more dwarfs came up behind the first two .     the scent   s twelve hours old  at least           what are they doing .     said carrot  half to himself .  the two new dwarfs were covered from head to toe in leather  like ardent  but wore chain mail over the top of it  their helmets were quite unadorned  but covered the whole face and head  with only a slit for the eyes .  each dwarf carried a large black pack on his back and held a lance in front of him .      oh no     said carrot     surely not here        at a word of command  the door was swung open  revealing only darkness beyond .   the lances spat flame  long yellow tongues of it  and the black dwarfs walked slowly along behind them .  smoke  heavy and greasy  filled the air .   angua fainted .       darkness .   sam vimes struggled up the hill  tired to the bone .   it was warm  warmer than he   d expected .  sweat stung his eyes .  water splashed under his feet and made his boots slip .  and  ahead  up the slope  a child was screaming .   he knew he was shouting .  he would hear the breath wheezing in his throat  could feel his lips moving  but he couldn   t hear the words he was reciting over and over again .   the darkness felt like cold ink .  tendrils of it dragged at his mind and his body  slowing him down  dragging him back     and now they came at him with flames     vimes blinked  and found himself staring at the fireplace .  the flames flicked peacefully .   there was the swish of a dress as sybil came back into the room  sat down  and picked up her darning .   he watched her dully .  she was darning his socks .  they had maids in this place and she darned his socks .  it wasn   t as if they didn   t have so much money that he could have a new pair of socks every day .  but she   d picked up the idea that it was a wifely duty  and so she did it .  it was comforting  in a strange sort of way .  it was only a shame that she wasn   t  in fact  any good at mending holes  so sam ended up with sock heels that were huge welts of criss crossing wool .  he wore them anyway  and never mentioned it .      a weapon that fires flame     he said slowly .      yes  sir     said carrot .      dwarfs have weapons that fire flame .         the deep downers use them to explode pockets of mine gas     said carrot .     i never expected to see them here .         it   s a weapon if some bastard points it at me .     said vimes .     how much gas did they expect to find in ankh morpork .         sir .  even the river catches fire in a hot summer .         okay  okay .  i   ll grant you that     vimes conceded unwillingly .     make sure the word gets out  will you .  anyone seen aboveground with one of those things  we   ll shoot first and there will be no point in asking questions afterwards .  good grief  that   s all we need .  have you got anything more to tell me  captain .         well  afterwards we did get to see hamcrusher   s body     said carrot .     what can i say .  on his wrist the draht that identifies him  and his skin was pale .  there was a terrible wound on the back of his head .  they say it   s hamcrusher .  i can   t prove it .  what i can say is that he didn   t die where they said he did  or when they said he did .         why .     said vimes .      blood  sir     said sally .     there should have been blood everywhere .  i looked at the wound .  what that club hit over the head was already a corpse  and he wasn   t killed in that tunnel .      vimes took several slow breaths .  there was so much bad stuff here you needed to take it one horror at a time .      i   m worried  captain     he said .     do you know why .  it   s because i   ve got a feeling that very soon i   m going to be asked to confirm that there   s evidence that a troll did the deed .  which  my friend  will be like announcing the outbreak of war .         you did ask us to investigate  sir     said carrot .      yes  but i didn   t expect you to come back with the wrong result .  the whole thing stinks .  that clay from quarry lane was planted  wasn   t it .         it must have been .  trolls don   t clean their feet much  but walking mud all the way .  not a chance .         and they don   t leave their clubs behind  either     growled vimes .     so it   s a setup  right .  but it turns out there really was a troll .  was angua sure .         positive  sir     said carrot .     we   ve always trusted her nose before .  sorry  sir  she had to go and get some fresh air .  she was straining her senses as it was  and she got a lungful of that smoke .         i can imagine     said vimes .  hell   s bells  he thought .  we were right on the point where i could tell vetinari that it looked like some kind of half baked inside job faked to look as though a troll did it  and we find out there was a troll .  huh   so much for relying on the evidence .   sally coughed politely .     ardent was shocked and frightened when the captain found the skull  sir     she said .     it wasn   t an act .  i   m certain of it .  he was near collapse with terror .  so was helmclever  the whole time .         thank you for that  lance constable     said vimes gravely .     i suspect i shall feel the same way when i go out there with a mega phone and shout    hello  boys  welcome to the replay of koom valley .  hey  let   s hold it right here in the city .             i don   t think you should actually put it like that  sir     said carrot .      well  yes  i   ll probably try to be a bit more subtle  since you mention it     said vimes .      and it   d be at least the sixteenth battle referred to as koom valley     carrot went on     or seventeen  if you include the one in vilinus pass  which was more of a fracas .  only three of them were in the original koom valley  the one immortalized in rascal   s painting .  it   s said to be quite accurate .  of course  it took him years .         an amazing work     said sybil  not looking up from her darning .     it used to belong to my family before we gave it to the museum  you know .         isn   t progress a wonderful thing  captain .     said vimes  pouring as much sarcasm into his tone as possible  since carrot was so bad at recognizing it .     when we have our koom valley  our friend otto will be able to take a color iconograph of it in a fraction of a second .  wonderful .  it   s been a long time since this city was last burned to the ground .      he ought to be springing into action .  once upon a time  he would have done .  but now  perhaps he should take these precious moments to work out what he should do before he sprang .   vimes tried to think .  don   t think of it all as one big bucket of snakes .  think of it as one snake at a time .  try to sort it out .  now  what needs to be done first .   everything .   all right  try a different approach .      what are these mine signs all about .     he said .     that helmclever sort of drew one at me .  i saw one on the wall  too .  and you drew one .            the following dark        said carrot .     yes .  it was scrawled all over the place .         what does it mean .         dread  sir     said carrot earnestly .     a warning of terrible things to come .         well  if one of those little sods so much as surfaces with one of those flame weapons in his hand  that will be true .  but   you mean they scrawl it on walls .      carrot nodded .     you have to understand about a dwarf mine  sir .  it   s a kind of           emotional hothouse  was how vimes understood it  although no dwarf would ever describe it that way .  humans would have gone insane living like that  cramped together  no real privacy  no real silence  seeing the same faces every day for years on end .  and since there were a lot of pointy weapons around  it   d only be a matter of time before the ceilings dripped blood .   dwarfs didn   t go mad .  they stayed thoughtful and somber and keen on their job .  but they scrawled mine sign .   it was like an unofficial ballot  voting by graffiti  showing your views on what was going on .  in the confines of a mine  any problem was everyone   s problem  stress leapt from dwarf to dwarf like lightning .  the signs grounded it .  they were an outlet  a release  a way of showing what you felt without challenging anyone  because of all the pointy weapons  .   the following dark  we await what follows with dread .  another translation might mean  in effect  repent  ye sinners .      there are hundreds of runes for darkness     said carrot .     some of them are part of ordinary dwarfish  of course  like the long dark .  there   s plenty like that .  but some are           mystical .     vimes suggested .      unbelievably mystical  sir .  there   s books and books about them .  and the way dwarfs think about books and words and runes   well  you wouldn   t believe it  sir .  w   they think the world was written  sir .  all words have enormous power .  destroying a book is worse than murder to a deep downer .         i   ve rather gathered that     said blackboard monitor vimes .      some deep downers believe that the dark signs are real     carrot went on .      well  if you can see the writing on the wall       vimes began .      real like alive  sir     said carrot earnestly .     like they exist somewhere down in the dark under the world  and they cause themselves to be written .  there   s the waiting dark   that   s the dark that fills a new hole .  the closing dark   i don   t know about that one  but there   s an opening dark  too .  the breathing dark  that   s rare .  the calling dark  very dangerous .  the speaking dark  the catching dark .  the secret dark  i   ve seen that .  they   re all fine .  but the following dark is a very bad sign .  i used to hear the older dwarfs talking about that .  they said it could make lamps go out  and much worse things .  when people start drawing that sign  things have got very bad .         this is all very interesting  but           everyone in the mine is nervous as heck  sir .  tense like wires .  angua said she could smell it  but so could i  sir .  i grew up in a mine .  when something is wrong  everyone catches it .  on days like that  sir  my father used to stop all mining operations .  you get too many accidents .  frankly  sir  the dwarfs are mad with worry .  the following dark signs are everywhere .  it   s probably the miners they   ve hired since they came here .  they feel that something is very wrong  but the only thing they can do about it is sign .         well  their top grag has been killed           i can feel the atmosphere in a mine  sir .  any dwarf can .  and that one is rancid with fear and dread and horrible confusion .  and there   s worse things in the deeps than the following dark .      vimes had a momentary vision of vengeful darkness rising through caves like a tide  faster than a man could run        which was stupid .  you couldn   t see dark .   hold on  though   sometimes you could .  back in the old days  when he was on nights all the time  he   d known all the shades of darkness .  and sometimes you got darkness so thick that you almost felt you had to push your way through it .  those were nights when horses were skittish  and dogs whined  and down in the slaughterhouse district the animals broke out of their pens .  they were inexplicable  just like those nights that were quite light and silvery even though there was no moon in the sky .   he   s learned  then  not to use his little lantern .  light only ruined your vision  it blinded you .  you stared into the dark until it blinked .  you stared it down .      captain  i   m getting a bit lost here     said vimes .     i didn   t grow up in a mine .  are these signs drawn up because dwarfs think bad things are going to happen and want to ward them off  or think the mine deserves the bad things happening  or because they want the bad things to happen .         can be all three at once     said carrot  wincing .     it can get really intense when a mine goes bad .         oh  good grief .         oh  it can be awful  sir .  believe me .  but no one would ever draw the worst of the signs and want it to happen .  just the drawing wouldn   t be enough  anyway .  you have to want it to happen with your very last breath .         and which one is that .         oh  you don   t want to know  sir .         no  i did ask     said vimes .      no .  you really don   t want to know  sir .  really .      vimes was about to start yelling  but he stopped to think for a moment .      actually  no  i don   t think i do     he agreed .     this is all about hysteria and mysticism .  it   s just weird folklore .  dwarfs believe it .  i don   t .  so   how did you get the vurms to form that sign .         easy  sir .  you just smear the wall with a piece of meat .  that   s a feast for vurms .  i wanted to shake ardent up a bit .  make him nervous  like you taught me .  i wanted to show him i knew about signs .  i am a dwarf  after all .         captain  this is probably not the time to break it to you  but           oh  i know people laugh  sir .  a six foot dwarf .  but being a human just means being born to human parents .  that   s easy .  being a dwarf doesn   t mean being born to dwarfs  though it   s a good start .  it   s about certain things you do .  certain ceremonies .  i   ve done them .  so i   m a human and a dwarf .  the deep downers find it a bit hard to deal with that .         it   s mystic again  is it .     said vimes wearily .      oh yes  sir .     carrot coughed .  vimes recognized that particular cough .  it meant that bad news was on the captain   s mind and he was wondering how to shape it to fit the available not going totally postal space in vimes   s head .      out with it  captain .         er   this little chap turned up     said carrot  opening his hand .  the gooseberry imp sat up .      i ran all the way  insert name here     it said proudly .      we spotted it jogging along the gutter     said carrot .     it wasn   t hard to see  glowing pale green like that .      vimes pulled the gooseberry box out of his pocket and put it on the floor .  the imp climbed inside .      ooh  that feels so good     it said .     don   t talk to me about rats and cats .         they chased you .  but you   re a magical creature  aren   t you .     said vimes .      they don   t know that .     said the imp .     now  what was it   oh  yes .  you asked me about the night soil removal .  over the past three months the extra honey wagon load has averaged forty tons a night .         forty tons .  that   d fill a big room .  why didn   t we know about it .         you did  insert name here .     said the imp proudly .     but they were leaving from every gate  you see  and probably no guard ever spotted more than one or two extra carts .         yes  but they turned in reports every night .  why didn   t we spot it .      there was an awkward pause .   the imp coughed .     um   no one read the reports  insert name here .  they appear to be what we in the trade call write only documents .         wasn   t anyone supposed to be reading them .     vimes demanded .   there was another thundering silence .      i rather think you were  dear     said sybil  paying attention to her darning .      but i   m in charge .     vimes protested .      yes  dear .  that   s the point  really .         but i can   t spend all my time shuffling bits of paper .         then get someone else to do it  dear     said sybil .      can i do that .     said vimes .      yes  sir     said carrot .     you   re in charge .      vimes looked at the imp  which gave him a willing grin .      can you go through all of my in tray              floor       murmured sybil .         and tell me what   s important .         happy to  insert name here .  only one question  insert name here .  what is important .         well  the fact that the honey wagons are carting a whole lot more muck out of the city is pretty damn important  don   t you think .         i wouldn   t know  insert name here     said the imp .     i do not  in fact  think as such .  but i surmise that  if i had drawn your attention to such a fact a month ago  you would have told me to stick my head up a duck   s bottom .         that   s true     said vimes  nodding .     i probably would .  captain carrot .         sir .     said carrot  sitting up straight .      what   s the situation on the street .         well  troll gangs have been wandering around the city all day .  dwarfs  too .  now a lot of the dwarfs are hanging around in the square  sir  and a fair number of trolls are congregating in the plaza of broken moons .         how many are we talking about here .     said vimes .      about a thousand  all told .  they   ve been drinking  of course .         just in the mood for a fight  then .         yes  sir .  just drunk enough to be stupid but too sober to fall over     said carrot .      interesting observation  captain     said vimes thoughtfully .      yes  sir .  the word is that they   ll start at nine .  arrangements have been made  i gather .      then i think before it gets dark there should be a load of coppers in the cham  right between them  don   t you .     said vimes .     get the word out to the watch houses .         i   ve done that  sir     said carrot .      and get some barricades sorted out .         all arranged  sir .         and call out the specials .         i put the word out an hour ago  sir .      vimes hesitated .     i   ve got to be there  captain .         we should have enough men  sir     said carrot .      but you won   t have enough commander     said vimes .     if vetinari hauls me over the coals tomorrow because there was a major riot in the city center  i don   t want to tell him i was having a quiet evening at home .     he turned to his wife .     sorry  sybil .      lady sybil sighed .     i think i shall have to have a word with havelock about the hours he makes you keep     she said .     it   s not doing you any good  you know .         it   s the job  dear .  sorry .         it   s just as well i got the cook to make up a flask of soup  then .         you did .         of course .  i know you  sam .  and there   re some sandwiches in a bag .  captain carrot  you are to make sure he eats the apple and the banana .  dr .  lawn says he must eat at least five pieces of fruit or vegetables every day .      vimes stared woodenly at carrot and sally  trying to project the warning that the first officer to crack a smile or even mention this to anyone  ever ever ever  would have a very hard time of it indeed .      and  incidentally  tomato ketchup is not a vegetable     sybil added .     not even the dried stuff    round the top of the bottle .  well  what are you all waiting around for .             there   s something i didn   t want to mention in front of her ladyship     said carrot as they hurried down to the yard .     er    hitherto is dead  sir .         who   s hitherto .         lance constable horace hitherto  sir .  got walloped on the back of the head last night .  when we were at that meeting .  when there was that  er     disturbance    .  got sent to the free hospital .         oh  gods       said vimes .     it seems like a week ago .  he   d only been with us a couple of months .         they said at the hospital his brain died  sir .  i   m sure they did their best .      did we do ours .  vimes wondered .  but it was a bloody melee  and the cobblestone came out of nowhere .  could have hit me  could have hit carrot .  hit the kid  instead .  what   ll i tell his parents .  killed in the line of duty .  but his duty shouldn   t have been to stop one lot of idiot citizens murdering another lot of idiot citizens .   it   s all got out of hand .  there aren   t enough of us .  and now there   s a few less .      i   ll go and see his mum and dad tomor       he began  and sluggish memory shifted at last .     does   didn   t he have a brother in the watch .         yessir     said carrot .     lance constable hector hitherto  sir .  they joined together .  he   s down at chittling street .         then get hold of his sergeant and tell him hector is not allowed on the street tonight  okay .  i want him introduced to the joys of filing .  in a cellar  if possible .  and wearing a very thick helmet .         i understand  sir     said carrot .      how   s angua .         i think she   ll be fine after having a lie down  sir .  the mine really got to her .         i   m really  really sorry about that       sally began .      not your fault  lance constable   sally     said vimes .     it was mine .  i know about the vampire and werewolf thing  but i needed you both to be down there .  it   s just one of those decisions  okay .  i suggest you take the evening off .  no  that   s an order .  you   ve done very well on your first day .  off you go .  get your head down   or whatever .      they watched her out of sight before continuing down the street .      she is very good  sir     said carrot .     she picks things up fast .         yes  very fast .  i can see she   s going to be useful     said vimes thoughtfully .     doesn   t that strike you as odd  captain .  up she pops  just when we need her .         she has been here for a couple of months  though     said carrot .     and the league vouches for her .         a couple of months is about the same time as hamcrusher   s been here  too     said vimes .     and if you wanted to find things out  we   re not a bad outfit to join .  we   re official prodnoses .         sir  you don   t think           oh  i   m sure she   s a black ribboner  but i don   t think a vampire comes all the way from uberwald to play the cello .  still  as you say  she does a good job .     vimes stared at nothing for a moment and then said thoughtfully     doesn   t one of our specials work for the clacks company .         that   d be andy hancock  sir     said carrot .      oh gods .  you mean two swords .         that   s him  sir .  very keen lad .         yes  i saw the dockets .  normally a training dummy lasts for months  captain .  you   re not supposed to chop through three in half an hour .         he   ll be down at the yard now  sir .  do you want a word with him .     said carrot .      no .  you have a word with him .      vimes lowered his voice .  so did carrot .  there was whispering .  then carrot said     is that strictly legal  sir .         i don   t see why not .  let   s find out  shall we .  we haven   t had this little conversation  captain .         understood  sir .      ye gods  it was so much better when there was just four of us up against that bloody great dragon  vimes thought as they walked on .  of course  we nearly got burned alive a few times  but at least it wasn   t complicated .  it was a damn great dragon .  you could see it coming .  it didn   t get political on you .   it had started to rain a fine  invasive rain by the time they arrived at pseudopolis yard .  vimes had  with extreme reluctance  to hand it to carrot .  he certainly could organize .  the place was bustling .  wagonloads of yellow and black barricades were being trundled out of the old lemonade factory .  watchmen were pouring in from every street .      i really pushed the boat out on this one  sir     said carrot .     i thought it was important .         well done  captain     said vimes as they stood like islands in the flood .     but i think there is a little matter of forward planning you may have overlooked           really  sir .  i thought i   ve covered everything     said carrot  looking puzzled .   vimes slapped him on the back .      probably not this one     he said .  and added  but only to himself  because you  captain  are not a bastard .       bewildered and aimless  the troll wanders through the world     brick   s head really gonged .  he didn   t want to be doing dis  but he   d fallen into bad company .  he often fell into bad company  he reflected  although sometimes he had to look all day to find it     cos brick was a loser   s loser .  a troll without a clan or a gang  and who is considered thick even by other trolls  has to take any bad company he can find .  in this case  he   d met totally slag an    hardcore an    big marble  an    it had been easier to fall in wi    dem dan decide not to  an    dey   d met up wi    more trolls an    now     look at it like dis  he thought as he trudged along  singin    gang songs a bit behind the beat  because he didn   t know the words   all right  being in der middle of dis mob o    trolls ain   t    lyin    low     dat is a fact .  but totally slag had said the word wuz dat der watch wuz also after der troll who   d been down dat mine  right .  an     if you fink about it  der best place to hide a troll  right  is a big bunch of trolls .     cos the watch   d be pokin    around in der cellars where der real mean trollz hung out  dey wouldn   t be lookin    here .  an    if dey did  an    were puttin    der finger on him  den all dese brother trolls would help him out .   he wasn   t too certain about that last bit  in his heart of hearts .  his possibly negative iq  complete absence of street cred  and  above all  his permanent inclination to snort  suck  swallow  or bite anything that promised to make his brain sparkle  meant that he had been turned down even by the tenth egg street can   t fink of a name gang  rumored to be so dense that one of their members was a lump of concrete on a piece of string .  no  it would be hard to imagine any troll caring much what happened to brick .  but right now dey were brothers  and der only game in town .   he nudged the skull necklaced  graffiti ornamented  lichen covered  huge club   dragging troll marching stoically alongside him .      resplect  bro .     he said  clenching a scabby fist .      whyn   t you go and ghuhg yerself  brick  you little piece of coprolite       the troll muttered .      right off .     said brick cheerfully .       the main office was packed  but vimes fought his way through by shoving and shouting until he reached the duty desk  which was under siege .      it looks worse than it is  sir .     shouted cheery over the din .     detritus and constable bluejohn are in the cham right now  along with all three golem officers .  we   ve started getting the line in place .  both the mobs are too busy getting themselves worked up .         good work  sergeant .      cheery leaned down and lowered her voice .  vimes had to hang on to the tall desk to stop himself being carried away by the throng .      fred colon   s signing up the specials in the old lemonade factory  sir .  and mr .  de worde of the times is looking for you .         sorry  sergeant  didn   t catch that last bit .     said vimes loudly .     the lemonade factory  right .  okay .      he turned around and almost tripped over mr .  a .  e .  pessimal  who was holding a neat clipboard .      ah  your grace  there   s just a few small matters i   d like to discuss with you     said the gleaming little man .   vimes   s mouth dropped open .      and you think this is a good time  do you .     he managed as he was jostled by an officer carrying a bundle of swords .      well  yes  i   ve turned up a number of little financial and procedural problems     said a .  e .  pessimal calmly     and i think it   s vitally important that i understand exactly what        vimes  grinning horribly  grabbed him by the shoulder .      yes .  right .  absolutely .     he shouted .     my dear mr .  pessimal  what have i been thinking of .  you should understand .  come with me  please .      he half dragged the bewildered man out through the back door  lifted him out of the way of a trundling cart as he negotiated the crowded yard  and hustled him into the old factory yard  where the specials were being kitted up .   technically  they were the citizen   s militia  but  as fred colon had remarked  it was    better to have them in here pissing themselves than outside pissing on you .     the special constables were men   mostly   who could be coppers in times of dire need but were generally disqualified from formal watch membership by reason of shape  profession  age  or  sometimes  brain .   a lot of the professionals didn   t like them  but vimes had lately taken the view that when push came to shove it was better to have your fellow citizens shoving alongside you and  that being the case  you might as well teach them how to hold a sword right  lest the arm they clumsily removed was yours .   vimes pulled a .  e .  pessimal through the press of bodies until he found fred colon  who was handing out one size doesn   t fit anybody helmets .      new man for you  fred     he said loudly .     mr .  a .  e .  pessimal  plain a .  e .  if he ever makes friends .  he   s the government inspector .  kit him out  full fig  and don   t forget the riot shield .  a .  e .  here wants to understand coppering  so he   s kindly volunteered to be an acting constable on the barricades with us .     over the top of a .  e .  pessimal   s head he gave fred a big wink .      oh  er  right     said fred  and his face  in the flickering light of the flares  acquired the innocent smile of one about to make someone   s life a little pot of bubbling dread .  he leaned over the trestle table .      know how to use a sword  acting constable pessimal .     he said  and dropped a helmet on the man   s head  where it spun .      well  i didn   t exactly       the inspector began as a very elderly sword was shoved across the planks  followed by a heavy truncheon .      a shield  then .  any good with a shield .     said fred  pushing a large such item after the sword .      actually  i didn   t mean      said a .  e .  pessimal  trying to hold both the sword and the truncheon and dropping both  and then the sword and the truncheon and the shield and dropping all three .      any good at running a hundred yards in ten seconds .  in this .     fred went on .  a ragged chain mail coat dropped slowly off the table like a parcel of snakes and landed on a .  e .  pessimal   s bright little shoes .      uh  i don   t think           standing still and going to the toilet really  really quickly .     said fred .     oh well  you   ll learn soon enough .      vimes turned the man around  picked up thirty five pounds of rust eaten chain mail  and dropped it into his arms  causing a .  e .  pessimal to bend double .     i   ll introduce you to some of the citizens who will be fighting alongside you tonight  shall i .     he said as the little man hobbled after him .     this is willikins  my butler .  no sharpened pennies in your cap tonight  willikins .         no  sir     said willikins  staring at the struggling a .  e .  pessimal .      glad to hear it .  this is acting constable pessimal  willikins .     vimes winked .      honored to meet you  acting constable  sir     said willikins gravely .     now that sir is with us i am sure the miscreants will just melt away .  has sir by any chance gone sir on one with a troll before .  no .  a little advice  sir .  the important thing is to get in front of them and dodge the first blow .  they always leave themselves open and sir may then step smartly forward and select sir   s target of choice .         er  what if   if i   m not in front of one when it tries to hit me .     a .  e .  pessimal said  hypnotized by the description and dropping the sword again .     what if it is  in fact  behind me .         ah  well  i am afraid that in that case sir has to go back and start all over again  sir .         and   er   how do i do that .         being born is traditionally the first step  sir     said willikins  shaking his head .   vimes gave him a nod  and moved the trembling pessimal on through the chattering crowd  while the fine rain fell and the mists rose and the torches flickered .      good evening  sir .     said a cheerful voice  and there  yes  was special constable hancock  an amiable bearded man with an amiable smile and more cutlery about his person than was good for vimes   s mental health .  that was the trouble with some of the specials .  they really got into it .  they bought their own gear  and it was always better than watch issue .  some of them clanged even more than dwarfs  with patent handcuffs and complicated night sticks and comfy padded helmets and pencils that wrote underwater and  in the case of special constable hancock  two curved agatean swords strapped across his back .  those who   d dared to venture into the training yard when he was using them said they looked rather impressive .  vimes had heard that an agatean ninja could give a fly a shave and a haircut in mid flight  but this didn   t make him feel any better .      oh  hello   andy     he said .     i think           captain carrot   s had a word with me     said special constable hancock  giving him a huge wink .     i   ll see to it .         oh  good     said vimes  horribly aware that he   d put himself in a tricky position vis    vis suggesting that maybe one sword might be enough .  the man was going to do them a favor  after all .     er   you   ll be up against the trolls  at least to start with     he said .     just remember that there   s our people around you  will you .  remember special constable piggle  eh .         but  in fairness  it was a clean cut  sir .     said hancock .     igor said he   d never done such an easy reattachment .         nevertheless  it   s truncheons only tonight  andy  unless i give any other order  okay .         understood  commander vimes .  i   ve just got a new truncheon  as a matter of fact .      some sixth sense made vimes say     oh  really .  may i see .         right here  sir .     hancock pulled out what looked to vimes like two truncheons  joined together with a length of chain .      they   re agatean numknuts  sir .  no sharp edges at all .      vimes gave them an experimental swing and hit his own elbow .  he handed them back quickly .     rather you than me  lad .  still  i suppose they   ll make a troll stop and think .      mr .  pessimal was staring in horror  not least because wayward wood had just missed him .      oh  this is mr .  pessimal  andy     said vimes .     he   s finding out how we do things .  mr .  hancock is one of our   keenest special constables  mr .  pessimal .         nice to met you  mr .  pessimal .     said hancock .     if you need any weapons catalogs  i   m your man .      vimes moved on quickly  just in case the man drew those swords again  and ran up against a slightly more reassuring figure .      and here we have mr .  boggis     he said .     good to see you .  mr .  boggis is president of the guild of thieves  mr .  pessimal .      mr .  boggis saluted proudly .  he had accepted a chain mail jacket from fred  but no power in the world would have parted him from his brown bowler hat .  any power nevertheless inclined to try would in any case have to contend with the narrow eyed  stony jawed men on either side of him  who had eschewed any weapons or armor .  one of them was cleaning his fingernails with a cutthroat razor .  in a strange but very definite way  they looked much more dangerous even than special constable hancock .      and also vinnie    no ears    ludd and harry    can   t remember his nickname    jones  i see     vimes went on .     you   ve brought your bodyguards  mr .  boggis .         vinnie and harry like to get out in the fresh air  mister vimes     said mr .  boggis .     and i see you   ve got your own bodyguard  then .     he beamed down on a .  e .  pessimal and then grinned at vimes .     you have to watch them little bantam fighters  mister vimes  they can have the nose off your face quicker   n wink .  i can tell a killing cove when i see one  eh .  best of luck to you  mr .  pessimal .      vimes bustled the astonished man away before mr .  boggis was killed on the spot by the god of overacting  and almost walked into the one special who could be guaranteed not to talk too much .      and here  mr .  pessimal  here we have the university librarian     he said     good man in a melee  eh .         but that   that   s not a man .  that   s an orangutan  pongo pongo  native of bhangbhangduc and nearby islands .         ook .     said the librarian  patting a .  e .  pessimal on the head and handing him a banana skin .      well done  a .  e .  .     said vimes .     not many people get that right .      and so vimes dragged the inspector back through the crowd of damp  armored men  introducing him right and left .  then he pushed him into a corner and  to faint stunned protestations  dragged the mail shirt over his head .      you stick close behind me  mr .  pessimal     he said as the man tried to move .     it could get a bit sticky later on .  the trolls are up in the plaza and the dwarfs are down in the square  and both of    em are drinking up enough courage to have a good scrap .  that   s why we   ll be lining up in the cham  right between    em  the thin brown streak  haha .  the dwarfs favor battle axes  the trolls go in for clubs .  our weapon of first resort will be our truncheons  and our weapon of last resort is our feet .  that is to say  we   ll run like hell .         but  but  you have swords .     a .  e .  pessimal managed .      we have swords  acting constable .  yes  that is a fact  but poking holes in citizens is watch brutality  and we don   t want any of that now  do we .  let   s get going  i wouldn   t like you to miss anything .      he harried the man again  out into the street and the stream of watchmen heading for the cham .  apart from them  the street was empty .  ankh morpork people had an instinct for staying indoors when there were too many battle axes and spiky clubs out there .   the cham was simply a very  very wide road  once intended for ceremonial parades  a hangover from the days when the city had much to be ceremonious about .  drizzle filled it now and did not do much more than wet the pavements and reflect the light of the flares along the barricades .   barricades   well  that   s what they were called on the watch inventory .  ha .  lengths of wood painted in black and yellow stripes and mounted on trestles were not barricades  not to anyone who   d been behind a real one  which was built of rubbish and furniture and barrels and fear and bowel knotting defiance .  no  these simple things were the physical symbol of an idea .  it was a line in the sand .  it said  thus far  and no further .  it said  this is where the law is .  step over this line and you   ve gone beyond the law .  step over this line  with your massive axes and huge morningstars and heavy  heavy spiky clubs  and we few  we happy few who stand here with our wooden truncheons  we   ll   we   ll        well  you just better not step over the line  okay .   the yellow and black edges of the law had been set about twelve feet apart  giving plenty of room for two lines of watchmen standing back to back  facing outwards .   vimes dragged mr .  pessimal into the center of the cham  between the lines  and let him go .      any questions .     he said as latecomers jostled past them to take up their positions .   the little man stared toward the distant plaza  where the trolls had lit a big fire  and then turned to look the other way  at the square  where the dwarfs had lit several fires .  there was the sound of distant singing .      oh  yes  we   ll get the singing first .  at this point  it   s all about getting the blood pounding  you see     vimes added helpfully .     songs about heroes  great victories  killing your enemies and drinking out of their warm skulls  that sort of thing .         and then  er  they   ll attack us .     said a .  e .  pessimal .      well  not as such     vimes conceded .     they   ll try to attack the other bunch  and we   re in the way .         they won   t go around  perhaps .     said a .  e .  pessimal hopefully .      i doubt it .  they won   t be in the mood for narrow alleys .  they   ll be thinking in straight lines .  charge and yell  they   ll say  that   s the way .         ah  there   s the university over there .     said a .  e .  pessimal  as if noticing the huge bulk of unseen university for the very first time .     surely the wizards could              magic their weapons out of their hands  possibly leaving them with all their fingers .  magic them into the cells .  turn them all into ferrets .  and what then  mr .  pessimal .     vimes lit a cigar  cupping the match in his hand so that the flame made his face glow briefly .     shall we follow where magic leads us .  wave a wand  eh  to find out who   s guilty  and what of .  magic men good .  the innocent would have nothing to fear  d   you think .  i wouldn   t bet tuppence  mr .  pessimal .  magic   s a little bit alive  a little bit tricky .  just when you think you   ve got it by the throat  it bites you in the arse .  no magic in my watch  mr .  pessimal .  we use good  old fashioned policing .         but there are lots of them  commander .         about a thousand altogether  i reckon     said vimes placidly .     plus who knows how many more out there who   ll whale in if we let it get out of hand .  this is just the hotheads and the gangs right now .         b but can   t you just  er  leave them to it .         no  mr .  pessimal  because that   d be what we in the watch call    complete and utter bloody chaos     and it will not stop  and it will get bigger very quickly .  we have to finish it right now  so        there was a thud from the direction of the plaza .  it was loud enough to echo around the buildings .      what was that .     a .  e .  pessimal said  looking around hurriedly .      oh  that was to be expected     said vimes .   pessimal relaxed very slightly .      it was .         yes  it   s the gahanka  the troll war beat     said vimes .     they say that within ten minutes of hearing it  you   re dead .     behind pessimal  detritus grinned  the torchlight turning his diamond teeth into rubies .      is that true .         i shouldn   t think so     said vimes .     and now please excuse me for a while  acting constable pessimal  i   ll leave you in the good hands of sergeant detritus while i talk to my men .  stiffen their sinews  that sort of thing .      he moved away quickly .  he told himself he shouldn   t be doing this to the inspector  who was just a clerk in the wrong place and probably wasn   t a bad man .  the trouble was  the trolls up in the plaza probably weren   t bad trolls  and the dwarfs down in the square probably weren   t bad dwarfs  either .  people who probably weren   t bad could kill you .   the troll beat boomed around the city as vimes reached fred colon .      i see they   re giving us the ol    gahanka then  mister vimes     said the sergeant  with nervous cheerfulness .      yep .  they   ll be charging pretty soon  i expect .     vimes screwed up his eyes  trying to see figures around the distant glow .  trolls didn   t charge fast  but when they charged  it was like a wall getting nearer .  extending a hand and shouting    halt    in a firm  authoritative voice probably would not be sufficient .      you thinking about another barricade  mister vimes .     said fred .      hmm .     said vimes  dismissing the mental picture of himself laminated to the street .      barricades  sir     colon prompted .     more   n thirty years ago .      vimes gave a curt nod .  oh yes  he remembered the glorious revolution .  it hadn   t really been a revolution  and had been glorious only if you thought an early grave was glorious .  men had died there  too  because of other men who  bar one or two  probably weren   t bad        yes     he said .     and it seems like only yesterday .     every day  he thought  it seems like only yesterday .      remember ol    sergeant keel .  he pulled off a few tricks that night .     sergeant colon   s voice  like a .  e .  pessimal   s  had a curiously hopeful tone .   vimes nodded .      i suppose you wouldn   t have one or two up your sleeve  too  sir .     fred went on  the hope now naked and unashamed .      you know me  fred  always willing to learn     said vimes vaguely .  he strolled on  nodding to watchmen he knew  slapping others on the back  and trying not to get trapped in anyone   s gaze .  every face was in some way a reflection of the face of fred colon .  he could practically see their thoughts  while the thud of five hundred clubs hitting the stone in unison banged on the eardrums like a hammer .   you have got it sorted  haven   t you  mister vimes .  we   re not really going to be stuck here like the meat in a sandwich  right .  it   s a trick  yes .  it is a trick  isn   t it .  sir .   i hope it is  vimes thought .  but  one way or another  the watch has to be here .  that   s the bloody truth of it .   something had changed in the rhythm of the gahanka .  you had to be listening  but some of the clubs were hitting the ground just ahead or just after the beat .  ah .   he reached cheery and carrot  who were staring at the distant fires of the dwarfs .      we think we might be getting a result  sir     said carrot .      i damn well hope so .  what   s happening with the dwarfs .         no so much singing  sir     cheery reported .      glad to hear it .         we could handle them  though  couldn   t we  sir .     said carrot .     with the golem officers on our side  too .  if it came to it .      of course we couldn   t  vimes   s mind supplied  not if they mean it .  what we could is die valiantly .  i   ve seen men die valiantly .  there   s no future in it .      i don   t want it to come to it  captain       vimes stopped .  a deeper shadow had moved among the shadows .      what   s the password .     he said quickly .   the shadowy figure  who was cloaked and hooded  hesitated .      pathword .  excthuthe me  i   ve got it written down thome where       it began .      okay  igor  come on in     said carrot .      how did you know it wath me  thur .     said igor  ducking under the barricade .      your aftershave     said vimes  winking at the captain .     how did it go .         jutht as you thaid  thur     said igor  pushing his hood back .     inthidentally  thur  i have thcrubbed the thlab well and my couthin igor ith thtanding by to lend a hand .  in cathe of any little acthidenth  thur           thank you for thinking of that  igor     said vimes  as if igors ever thought of anything else .     i hope it won   t be needed .      he looked up and down the cham .  the rain was falling harder now .  just once  the copper   s friend had turned up when he really needed it .  rain tended to dampen martial enthusiasm .      anyone seen nobby .     he said .   a voice from the shadows said     here  mister vimes .  been here five minutes .         why didn   t you sing out  then .         couldn   t remember the password  sir .  i thought i   d wait    til i heard igor say it .         oh  come on in .  did it work .         better   n you   d imagine  sir .     said nobby  rain pouring down his cloak .   vimes stood back .     okay  lads  then this is it .  carrot and cheery  you head for the dwarfs  me and detritus will take the trolls .  you know the drill .  lines to advance slowly  and no edged weapons .  i repeat  no edged weapons until it   s that or die .  let   s do this like coppers  okay .  on the signal .      he hurried back up the line of barricades as fast as the stir ran along the ranks of the watchmen .   detritus was waiting stoically .  he grunted when vimes arrived .      clubs have jus    about stopped  sir     he reported .      i heard  sergeant .     vimes took off his oiled leather cloak and hung it on the barricade .  he needed his arms free .      by the way  how did it go in turn again lane .     he said  stretching and breathing deeply .      oh  wonnerfui  sir     said detritus happily .     six alchemists an    fifty pound o    fresh slide .  in an    out  quick an    sweet  all banged up in the tanty .         didn   t know what hit    em  eh .     said vimes .   detritus looked mildly offended at this .     oh no  sir     he said .     i made sure they knew i hit    em .      and then vimes spotted mr .  pessimal  still where he had left him  his face a pale disc in the shadows .  well  enough of that game .  maybe the little tit would have learned something  standing here in the rain  waiting to be caught between a couple of screaming mobs .  maybe he   d had time to wonder what it was like to spend your life going through moments like that .  a bit harder than pushing paper  eh .      if i was you  i   d just wait here  mr .  pessimal     he said as kindly as he could manage .     this might be a bit rough in parts .         no  commander     said a .  e .  pessimal  looking up .      what .         i have been paying attention to what has been said  and intend to face the foe  commander     said a .  e .  pessimal .      now see here  mr .  pessi   er  see here  a .  e .      said vimes  putting his hand on the little man   s shoulder .  he stopped .  a .  e .  pessimal was trembling so much that his chain mail was faintly jingling .  vimes persevered .     look  go on home  eh .  this isn   t where you belong .     he patted the shoulder a few times  totally nonplussed .      commander vimes .     snapped the inspector .      er  yes .    a .  e .  pessimal turned up to vimes a face wetter than the drizzle rightly accounted for .      i am an acting constable  am i not .         well  yes  i know i said that  but i did not expect you to take it seriously           i am a serious man  commander vimes .  and there is no place i would rather be now than here .     acting constable pessimal said  his teeth chattering .     and no time i   d rather be here than now .  let   s do this  shall we .      vimes looked at detritus  who shrugged his massive shoulders .  something was happening here  in the mind of a little man whose back he could probably break with one hand .      oh  well  if you say so     he said hopelessly .     you heard the inspector  sergeant detritus .  let   s do this  shall we .      the troll nodded  and turned to face the distant troll encampment .  he cupped his hands and bellowed a string of trollish  which bounced off the buildings .      something we can all understand  perhaps .     said vimes as the echoes died away .   a .  e .  pessimal stepped forward  taking a deep breath .      c   mon if you think you   re hard enough .     he screamed wildly .   vimes coughed .     thank you  mr .  pessimal     he said weakly .     i imagine that should do it .          the moon was somewhere beyond the clouds  but angua didn   t need to see it .  carrot once had a special watch made for her birthday .  it was a little moon that turned right around  black side and white side  every twenty eight days .  it must have cost him a lot of money  and angua now wore it on her collar  the one item of clothing that she could wear all month around .  she couldn   t bring herself to tell him she didn   t need it .  you knew what was happening .   it was hard to know much else right now  because she was thinking with her nose .  that was the problem with the wolf times  the nose took charge .   currently  angua was searching the alleys around treacle street  spiraling out from the dwarf mine .  she prowled onwards in a world of color  smells overlaid one another  drifting and persisting .  the nose was also the only organ that can see backwards in time .   she   d already visited the spoil heap on the waste ground .  there was the smell of troll there .  it had got out that way  but there was no point in following a trail that cold .  hundreds of street trolls wore lichen and skulls these days .  but the foul  oily stuff  that was a smell that was clinging to her memory .  the little devils must have some other ways in  right .  and you had to move the air around in a mine  right .  so some trace of that oil would find its ways out along with the air .  they probably wouldn   t be strong  but she didn   t need them to be .  a trace of it was all she needed .  it would be more than enough .   as she padded through the alleys  and leapt walls into midnight yards  she kept clenched in her jaws the little leather bag that was a friend to any thinking werewolf  such a creature being defined as one who remembers that your clothes don   t magically follow you .  the bag held a lightweight silk dress and a large bottle of mouthwash  which angua considered to be the greatest invention of the last hundred years .   she found what she was looking for behind broad way  it stood out against the familiar organic smells of the city as a tiny black ribbon of stench that left zigzags in the air as breezes and the passage of carts had dragged it this way and that .   she began to move with more care .  this wasn   t an area like treacle street  people with money lived here  and they often spent that money on big dogs and disproportionate response signs in their driveways .  as it was  she heard the rattle of chains and the occasional whine as she slunk along .  she hated being attacked by large  ferocious dogs .  it always left a mess and the mouthwash was afterwards never strong enough .   the thread of stink was floating through the railings of empirical crescent  one of the city   s great architectural semi precious gems .  it was always hard to find people prepared to live there  however  despite the general desirable nature of the area .  tenants seldom stayed for more than a few months before moving hurriedly  sometimes leaving all their possessions behind .    she sailed over the railing with silence and ease and landed on all fours on what had once been gravel path .  residents in the crescent seldom did much gardening  since even if you planted bulbs you could never be sure whose garden they   d come up in .   angua followed her nose to a patch of rampant thistles .  some molding bricks in a circle marked what must have been an old well .   the oily stink was heavy here  but there was a fresher  far more complex smell that raised the hairs on angua   s neck .   there was a vampire down there .   someone had pulled away the weeds and debris  including the inevitable rotting mattress and decomposing armchair .   sally .  what was she doing here .   angua pulled a brick out of the rotted edging and let it drop .  instead of a splash  there was a clear  wooden thump .   oh well .  she went back to human to get down  claws were fine  but some things were better done by monkeys .  the sides were  of course  slimy  but so many bricks had fallen out over the years that the descent turned out to be easier than she   d expected .  and it was only about sixty feet deep  built in the days when it was widely believed that any water that supported so many little whiskery swimming things must be healthy .   there were fresh planks in the bottom .  someone   and surely it could only have been the dwarfs   had broken into the well down here  and laid a couple of planks across it .  they had dug this far  and stopped .  why .  because they   d reached the well .   there was dirty water  or water like liquid  just under the planks .  the tunnel was a bit wider here  and dwarfs had been here   she sniffed   a day ago  no more .  yes .  dwarfs had been here  had fished around  and had then all left at once .  they hadn   t even bothered to tidy up .  she could smell it like a picture .   she crept forward  the tunnels mapping themselves in her nostrils .  they weren   t nicely finished  like the tunnels ardent moved in .  they were rougher  with lots of zigzags and blind alleys .  rough planks and balks of timber held back the fetid mud of the plains  which was nevertheless oozing through everywhere .  these tunnels weren   t built to last  they were there for a quick and definitely dirty job  and all they had to do was survive until it was done .   so   the diggers had been looking for something  but weren   t sure where it was until they were within  what  about twenty feet of it  when they   d   smelled it .  detected it .  the last stretch to the well was dead straight .  by then  they knew where they were going .   angua crept on  almost bending double to clear the low ceiling until she gave up and went back to wolf .  the tunnel straightened out  with the occasional side passage that she ignored  although they smelled long .  the vampire smell was still an annoying theme in the nasal symphony  and it came close to drowning the reek of foul water oozing from the walls .  here and there  vurms had colonized the ceiling .  so had bats .  they stirred .   and then there was another scent as she passed a tunnel opening .  it was quite faint  but it was unmistakably the whiff of corruption .  a fresh death     three fresh deaths .  at the end of a short side tunnel were the bodies of two  no  three dwarfs  half buried in mud .  they glowed .  vurms had no teeth  carrot had told her .  they waited until the prospective meal became runny of its own accord .  and  while they waited for the biggest stroke of luck ever to have come their way  they celebrated .  down here  in a world far away from the streets  the dwarfs would dissolve in light .   angua sniffed .   make that very fresh        they found something     said a voice behind her .     and then it killed them .      angua leapt .       the leap wasn   t intentional .  her hindbrain arranged it all by itself .  the front brain  the bit that knew that sergeants should not attempt to disembowel lance constables without provocation  tried to stop the leap in mid air  but by then simple ballistics were in charge .  all she managed was a mid air twist  and struck the soft wall with her shoulder .   wings fluttered a little way off  and there was a drawn out organic sound  a sound that conveyed the idea that a slaughterhouse man was having some difficulty with a tricky bit of gristle .      you know  sergeant     said the voice of sally  as if nothing had happened     you werewolves have it easy .  you stay one thing and you don   t have any problems with body mass .  do you know how many bats i have to become for my body weight .  more than a hundred and fifty  that   s how many .  and there   s always one  isn   t there  that gets lost or flies the wrong way .  you can   t think straight unless you get your bats together .  and i   m not even going to touch on the subject of reassimilation .  it   s like the biggest sneeze you can think of .  backwards .      there was no point in modesty  not down here in the dark .  angua forced herself to change back  every brain cell piling in to outvote tooth and claw .  anger helped .      why the hell are you here .     she said  when she had a mouth that worked .      i   m off duty     said sally  stepping forward .     i thought i   d see what i could find .     she was totally naked .      you couldn   t have been so lucky .     angua growled .      oh  i don   t have your nose  sergeant     said sally  with a sweet smile .     but i was using a hundred and fifty pretty good flying ones  and they can cover a lot of ground .         i thought vampires could rematerialize their clothes     said angua accusingly .     otto chriek can .         females can   t .  we don   t know why .  it   s probably part of the whole underwired nightdress business .  that   s where you score again  of course .  when you   re in one hundred and fifty bat bodies  it   s quite hard to remember to keep two of them carrying a pair of pants .     sally looked up at the ceiling  and sighed .     look  i can see where this is going .  it   s going to be about captain carrot  isn   t it           i saw the way you were smiling at him .         i   m sorry .  we can be very personable .  it   s a vampire thing .         you were so keen to impress him  eh .         and you aren   t .  he   s the kind of man anyone would want to impress .      they watched each other warily .      he is mine  you know     said angua  feeling the nascent claws strain under her fingernails .      you   re his  you mean .     said sally .     you know it works like that .  you trail after him .         i   m sorry .  it   s a werewolf thing .     angua yelled .      hold it .     sally thrust both hands in front of her in a gesture of peace .     there   s something we   d better sort before this goes any further .         yeah .         yes .  we   re both wearing nothing  we   re standing in what  you may have noticed  is increasingly turning into mud  and we   re squaring up to fight .  okay .  but there   s something missing  yes .         and that is    .         a paying audience .  we could make a fortune .     sally winked .     or we could do the job we came here to do .      angua forced her body to relax .  she should have been saying that .  she was the sergeant  wasn   t she .      all right  all right     she said .     we   re both here  okay .  let   s leave it at that .  were you saying that these dwarfs were killed by some   thing from the well .         possibly .  but if they were  it used an axe     said sally .     take a look .  scrape some of the mud away .  it   s been oozing over them since i arrived .  that   s probably why you missed it     she added generously .   angua hauled one dwarf out of the shining slime .      i see     she said  letting the body fall back .     this one hasn   t been dead two days .  not much effort made to hide them  i see .         why bother .  they   ve stopped pumping out these tunnels  the props look pretty temporary  the mud   s coming back .  besides  who   d be stupid enough to come down here .      a piece of wall slithered down  with a sticky  organic  cow pat sort of noise .  little plops and trickles filled the tunnel .  ankh morpork   s underworld was stealthily reclaiming its own .   angua closed her eyes and concentrated .  the slime reek  the vampire   s smell  and the water that was now ankle deep all jostled for attention  but this was competition time .  she couldn   t let a vampire take the lead .  that would be so   traditional .      there were other dwarfs     she murmured .     two   no  three   er  four more .  i   m getting   the black oil .  distant blood .  down the tunnel .     she stood up so sharply that she nearly hit her head on the tunnel roof .     c   mon .         it   s getting a bit unsafe           we could solve this .  come on .  you can   t be afraid of dying .      angua plunged away .      and you think spending a few thousand years buried in sludge is likely to be fun .     shouted sally  but she was talking only to dripping mud and fetid air .  she hesitated a moment  groaned  and followed angua .   further along the main tunnel there were more passages branching off .  on either side  rivers of mud  like cool lava  were already flowing out of them .  sally splashed past something that looked like a huge copper trumpet  turning gently on the current .   the tunnel was better built here than the ones nearer the well .  and there  at the end of it  was a pale light  and angua  crouched by one of the big  round dwarf doors .  sally paid her no attention .  she barely glanced at the dwarf slumped with his back against the bottom of the door .   instead  she stared at the symbol scrawled large on the metal .  it was big and crude  and might be a round  staring eye with a tail  and it gleamed with the greeny white glow of vurms .      he wrote it in his blood     said angua  without looking up .     they left him for dead  but he was only dying  you see .  he managed to make it to here  but the killers had shut the door .  he scratched at it  smell here  and he   s worn away his fingernails .  then he made that sign in his own warm blood and sat here  holding the wound shut  watching the vurms turn up .  i   d say he   s been dead for eighteen hours or so .  hmm .         i think we should get out of here right now     said sally  backing away .     do you know what that sign means .         i know it   s mine sign  that   s all .  do you know what it means .         no  but i know it   s one of the really bad ones .  it   s not good seeing it here .  what are you doing with that body .     sally backed away further .      trying to find out who he was     said angua  searching the dwarf   s clothing .     it   s the sort of thing we do in the watch .  we don   t stand around getting worried about drawings on the wall .  what   s the problem .         right now .     said the vampire .     he   s   oozing a bit           if i can stand it  so can you .  you see a lot of blood in this job .  don   t attempt to drink it  that   s my advice     said angua  still rummaging .     ah   he   s got a rune necklace .  and       she pulled a hand out of the dead dwarf   s jerkin     can   t make this out very well  but i can smell ink  so it may be a letter .  okay .  let   s get out of here .     she stood up .     did you hear me .         the sign was written by someone dying     said sally  still keeping her distance .      well .         it   s probably a curse .         so .  we didn   t kill him     said angua  getting to her feet with some difficulty .   they looked down at the liquid mud now rising to their knees .      do you think it cares .     said sally matter of factly .      no  but i think there may be another way out in that last tunnel we passed     said angua  looking back along the tunnel .   she pointed .  scuttling along with blind determination  a line of vurms marched along the dripping roof almost as fast as the mud flowed down below .  they were heading into the side tunnel in a glowing stream .   sally shrugged .     it   s worth a try  yes .      they left  and the sound of their splashing soon died away .   slowly the mud rose  rustling in the gloom .  the trail of vurms gradually disappeared overhead .  the vurms that made the sign remained though  because such a feast as this was worth dying for .   their glow winked out  one insect at a time .   the darkness beneath the world caressed the sign  which flamed red and died .   darkness remained .       on this day in       the painter methodia rascal tried putting the thing under a heap of old sacks  in case it woke up the chicken  and finished the last troll  using his smallest brush to paint the eyeballs .       it was five a . m .  rain rustled out the sky  not hard  but with a gentle persistence .   in sator square  and in the plaza of broken moons  it hissed on the white ash of the bonfires  occasionally exposing the orange glow  which would briefly sizzle and spit .   a family of gnolls were sniffing around  each one dragging his or her little cart .  a few officers were keeping an eye on them .  gnolls weren   t choosy about what they collected  provided it didn   t actually struggle  and even then there were rumors .   but they were tolerated .  nothing cleaned up the place like a gnoll .   from here  they looked like little trolls  each with a huge compost heap on its back .  that represented everything it owned  and mostly what it owned was rotten .   sam vimes winced at the pain in his side .  just his luck .  two coppers injured in the entire damn affair  and he had to be one of them .  igor had done his best  but broken ribs were broken ribs  and it   d be a week or two before the suspicious green ointment made much difference .  his hand twinged in sympathy with them  too .   still  he enjoyed a bit of a warm glow about the whole thing .  they had used good  old fashioned policing  and since good  old fashioned policemen are invariably outnumbered  he   d employed the good  old fashioned police methods of cunning  deceit  and any damn weapon you could lay your hands on .   it had hardly been a fight at all .  the dwarfs had mostly been sitting and singing gloomy songs  because they fell over when they tried to stand up  or had tried to stand up and were now lying down and snoring .  the trolls were  on the other hand  mostly upright  but went over when you pushed them .  one or two  a little clearer in the head than the others  had put up a ponderous and laughable fight but had fallen to that most old fashioned of police methods  the well placed boot .  well  most of them had .  vimes shifted to ease the aching in his side  he should have seen that one coming .   but all   s well that ends well  eh .  no deaths at all  and just to put a little cherry on the morning cake  he had in his hand an early morning edition of the times  in which a leading article deplored the gangs stalking the city and wondered if the watch was    up to the job    of cleaning up the streets .   well  yes  i think we are  you pompous twerp .  vimes struck a match on a plinth and lit a cigar in recognition of a petty but darkly satisfying triumph .  gods knew they needed one .  the watch had taken a pounding over the whole damn koom valley thing  and it was good to hand the lads something to be proud of for a change .  all in all  it was definitely a result     he stared at the plinth .  he didn   t remember what statue had once been there .  it celebrated generations of graffiti artists now .   a piece of troll graffiti adorned it now  obliterating everything done by the artists who used mere paint .  he read   mr .  shine .   him diamond .   mine sign  city scrawl  he thought .  thing go bad  and people are moved to write on the walls      commander .      he turned .  captain carrot  armor gleaming  was hurrying toward him  his face  as usual  radiating an expression of a hundred percent pure keen .      i thought i told everyone not on prisoner duty to get some sleep  captain .     said vimes .      just clearing up a few things  sir     said carrot .     lord vetinari sent a message down to the yard .  he wants a report .  i thought i   d better tell you  sir .         i was just thinking  captain     said vimes expansively .     should we put up a little plaque .  something simple .  it could say something like battle of koom valley not fought here  grune the  th  year of the prawn .  could we get them to do a bloody stamp .  what do you think .         i think you need to get some sleep yourself  commander     said carrot .     and technically  it isn   t koom valley until saturday .         of course  monuments to battles that didn   t take place might be stretching things a bit  but a stamp           lady sybil really worries about you  sir .     carrot broadcast concern .   the fizz in vimes   s head subsided .  as if awakened by the reference to sybil  the debtors of his body queued up to wave their overdue ious  feet   dead tired and in need of a bath  stomach   gurgling  ribs   on fire  back   aching  brain   drunk on its own poisons .  bath  sleep  eat   good ideas .  but still must do things        how   s our mr .  pessimal .     he said .      igor   s fixed him up  sir .  he   s a bit amazed at all the fuss .  now  i know i can   t order you to go and see his lordship           no  you can   t  because i am a commander  captain     said vimes  still fuzzily intoxicated on exhaustion .         but he can and he has  sir .  and your coach will be waiting for you outside the palace when you come out .  that   s lady sybil   s orders  sir     said carrot  appealing to higher authority .   vimes looked up at the ugly bulk of the palace .  suddenly  clean sheets seemed such a sweet idea .      can   t face him like this     he murmured .      i had a word with secretary drumknott  sir .  hot water  a razor  and a big cup of coffee will be waiting in the palace .         you thought of everything  carrot           i hope so  sir .  now off you           but i thought of something  eh .     said vimes  swaying cheerfully .     better dead drunk than just dead  eh .         it was a classic ruse  sir     said carrot reassuringly .     one for the history books .  now  off you go  sir .  i   m going to have a look for angua .  she hasn   t slept in her bed .         but at this time of the month           i know  sir .  she hasn   t slept in her basket  either .          in a dank cellar that once was an attic and was now half full of mud  the vurms poured out of a small hole where wooden planks had long since worn away .   a fist punched up .  soggy timber split and crumbled .   angua pulled herself up into this new darkness  then reached down to help sally  who said     well  here   s another fine mess .         let   s hope so     said angua .     i think we need to go up at least one more level .  there   s an archway here .  come on .      there had been too many dead ends  forgotten stinking rooms and false hopes  and altogether too much slime .   after a while  the smell became almost tangible  and then it managed to become just another part of the darkness .  the women wandered and scrambled from one dripping  fetid room to another  testing the muddy walls for hidden doors  searching for even a pinprick of light in the ceilings hanging with interesting but horrible growths .   now they heard music .  five minutes wading and slithering brought them to a blocked in doorway  but since it had been filled by the more modern ankh morpork mortar of sand  horse dung  and vegetable peelings  several bricks had already fallen out .  sally removed most of the rest with one punch .      sorry about that     she said .     it   s a vampire thing .      the cellar behind the demolished wall had some barrels in it  and looked as though it was regularly used .  there was a proper door  too .  rather dull  repetitive music filtered down from between the boards .  there was a trapdoor in them .      o kay     said angua .     there   s people up there  i can smell them           i count fifty seven hearts beating     said sally .  angua gave her a look .      you know  that   s one particular talent i   d keep to myself  if i was you     she said .      sorry  sergeant .         it   s not the sort of thing people want to hear     angua went on .     i mean  i personally am quite capable of crushing a man   s skull in my jaws  but i don   t go around telling everyone .         i shall make a note of it  sergeant     said sally  with a meekness that was quite possibly feigned .      good .  now   what do we look like .  swamp monsters .         yes  sergeant .  your hair looks dreadful .  just like a great lump of green slime .         green .         i   m afraid so .         and my emergency dress is back down there somewhere     said angua .     it   s past dawn  too .  can you  er  go bats now .         in daylight .  one hundred and fifty disoriented bits of me .  no .  but you could get out as a wolf  couldn   t you .         i   d kind of prefer not to be a slime monster coming through the floor  if it   s all the same to you     said angua .      yes  i can see that .  it does not pay to advertise .     sally flicked away a lump of nameless ooze .     ugh  this stuff is foul .         so  the best we can hope for is that when we make a run for it  no one will recognize us     said angua  pulling a lump of wobbly green stuff from her hair .     at least we   oh  no           what   s wrong .     said sally .      nobby nobbs .  he   s up there .  i can smell him .     she pointed urgently at the boards overhead .      you mean corporal nobbs .  the little   man with the spots .     said sally .      we   re not under a watch house  are we .     said angua  looking around in panic .      i don   t think so .  someone   s dancing  by the sound of it .  but look  how can you smell one human in the middle of all   this .         it never leaves you  believe me .     the smell of old cabbage  acne ointment  and nonmalignant skin disease became transmuted  in corporal nobbs  into a strange odor that lay across the nose like a saw blade on a harp .  it wasn   t bad  as such  but it was like its host  strange  ubiquitous  and hellishly difficult to forget .      well  he   s a fellow officer  isn   t he .  won   t he help us .     said sally .      we are naked  lance constable .         only technically .  this mud really sticks .         i mean underneath the mud .     said angua .      yes  but if we had clothes on we   re be naked underneath them  too .     sally pointed out .      this is not the time for logic .  this is the time for not seeing nobby grinning at me .         but he   s seen you when you   re wolf shaped  hasn   t he .     said sally .      so .     snapped angua .      well  technically you   re naked then  aren   t you .         never tell him that .          nobby nobbs  a shadow in the warm red gloom  nudged sergeant colon .      you don   t have to keep your eyes shut  sarge     he said .     it   s all legit .  it   s an artistic celebration of the female body  tawneee says .  anyway  she   s got clothes on .         two tassels and a folded hanky is not clothes  nobby     said fred  sinking down in his seat .  the pink pussycat club .  now  fair   s fair  he   d been in the army and watch  and you couldn   t spend all that time in uniform without seeing a thing or two   or three  now he came to recollect   and it was true  as nobby had pointed out  that the ballerinas down at the opera house didn   t leave a lot to the imagination  at least not to nobby   s  but when all was said and done  ballet had to be art  even though it was a bit short on plinths and urns  on account of being expensive to look at  and moreover  ballerinas didn   t whizz around upside down .  and the worst of it was  he   d already spotted two people he knew in the audience .  fortunately they hadn   t seen him  which was to say that whenever he   d sneaked a glance their way  they were looking in completely the opposite direction .      now this bit is really hard     whispered nobby conversationally .      er   is it .     fred colon closed his eyes again .      oh  yes .  it   s the triple corkscrew           look  don   t the management object to you coming in here .     fred managed  shifting even further down in his seat .      oh  no .  they like having a watchman in     said nobby  still watching the stage .     they say it makes people behave .  anyway  i only come in so   s i can walk betty home .         betty being    .         tawneee   s actually only her pole name     nobby said .     she says no one would be interested in an exotic dancer with a name like betty .  she says it sounds like she   d be better with a bowl of cake mixture .      colon shut his eyes  trying to banish a mental conjunction of the bronzed lithe figure on stage and a bowl of cake mixture .      i think i could do with a breath of fresh air     he groaned .      oh  not yet  sarge .  broccolee   s on next .  she can touch the back of her head with her foot  you know           i don   t believe that .     said fred colon .      she can  sarge  i   ve seen           i don   t believe there   s a dancer called broccoli .         well  she did used to be called candi  sarge  but then she heard that broccoli is better for you           corporal nobbs .      the sound appeared to be coming from under the table .   nobby stared at fred colon  and then looked down .      yes .     he ventured  with caution .      this is sergeant angua     said the floor .      oh .     said nobby .      what is this place .     the voice continued .      the pink pussycat club  sergeant     said nobby obediently .      oh  gods .     there was some conversation down below  and then the voice said     are there women up there .         yes  sergeant .  er   what are you doing down there  sarge .         giving you orders  nobby     said the voice from below .     are there women up there .         yes  sarge .  lots .         good .  please ask one to come down into the beer cellar .  we   ll need a couple of buckets of warm water and some towels  got that .      nobby was aware that the musicians had stopped playing and tawneee had paused in mid   drop and split .  everyone was listening to the talking floor .      yes  sergeant     said nobby .     i   ve got it .         and some clean clothes .  and       there was subterranean whispering       make that several buckets of water .  and a scrubbing brush .  and a comb .  and another comb .  and more towels .  oh  and two pairs of shoes  size six and   four and a half .  really .  okay .  and is fred colon with you  or is that a stupid question .      fred cleared his throat .      i   m here  sergeant     he reported .     but i only came along to           good .  i want to borrow a set of your stripes .  i   ve got a bad feeling about the next few hours and i don   t want anyone to forget i   m a sergeant .  got that  the pair of you .         it   s full moon     fred whispered to nobby  as one man to another  and then he said aloud     yes  sergeant .  this may take a while           no .  it won   t .  because you   ve got a werewolf and a vampire down here  understand .  i   m having a really bad hair day and she   s got a toothache .  we come up in ten minutes looking human or we come up anyway .  what .     there was more whispering .     why a beetroot .  why in gods    names is a girly show likely to contain a beetroot .  what .  okay .  will an apple do .  nobby  lance constable von humpeding needs an apple  urgently .  or something else that she can bite .  now  jump to it .          coffee was only a way of stealing time that should by rights belong to your slightly older self .  vimes drank two cups  and had a wash and at least an attempt at a shave  which made him feel quite human if he ignored the sensation that parts of his head were stuffed with warm cotton wool .  at last  deciding that he felt as good as he was going to  and could probably handle quite long questions  he was ushered into the oblong office of the patrician of ankh morpork .      ah  commander     said lord vetinari  looking up after a considered interval and pushing aside some paperwork .     thank you for coming .  it seems that congratulations are in order .  so i am told .         and why   s that  sir .     said vimes  putting on his special  blank  talking to vetinari face .      come now  vimes .  yesterday it looked as if we would be having a species war right in the middle of the city  and suddenly we are not .  those gangs were quite fearsome  i gather .         most of    em were asleep or squabbling among themselves by the time we arrived  sir .  we just had to tidy them away     vimes volunteered .      yes indeed     said vetinari .     it was quite astonishing  really .  do sit down  by the way .  it really is not necessary for you to stand in front of me like a corporal on a charge .         don   t know what you mean  sir     said vimes  collapsing gratefully into a chair .      you don   t .  i was referring  vimes  to the speed with which both parties managed to incapacitate themselves with strong liquor at the same time    .         i wouldn   t know anything about that  sir .     that was an automatic reaction  it made life simpler .      no .  it appears  vimes  that while steeling themselves for the fracas to come  both the trolls and the dwarfs came into possession of what i assume they thought was beer    .         they had been on the pi   been drinking all day  sir     vimes pointed out .      indeed  vimes  and possibly that is why the dwarf contingent were less than cautious in drinking copiously from beer that has been considerably   fortified .  areas of sator square  i gather  still smell faintly of apples  vimes .  one could come to believe  therefore  that what they were drinking was  in fact  a mixture of strong beer and scumble  which is  as you know  distilled from apples           uh  mostly apples  sir     said vimes helpfully .      quite .  the cocktail is known as fluff  i believe .  as to the trolls  one might speculate that it would be very hard to find anything to make their beer even more dangerous than it palpably is  but i wonder if you have heard  vimes  that an admixture of various metallic salts produces a drink known as luglarr  or    big hammer    .         can   t say i do  sir .         vimes  some of the flagstones in the plaza have actually been etched by the stuff .         sorry about that  sir .      vetinari drummed his fingers on the table .      what would you do if i asked you an outright question  vimes .         i   d tell you a downright lie  sir .         then i will not do so     said vetinari  smiling faintly .      thank you  sir .  nor will i .         where are your prisoners .         we spread them around the watch house yards     said vimes .     as they wake up  we hose    em clean  take their names  give    em a receipt for their weapon and a hot drink  and push    em out into the street .         their weapons are culturally very important to them  vimes     said vetinari .      yeah  sir  i know .  i myself have a strong cultural bias against getting my brains bashed in and my knees cut off     said vimes  stifling a yawn and wincing as his ribs objected .      indeed .  were there any casualties in the battle .         none that won   t heal .     vimes grimaced .     i have to report that mr .  a .  e .  pessimal sustained a broken arm and multiple bruises  though .      vetinari actually looked taken aback .      the inspector .  what was he doing .         er   attacking a troll  sir .         i   m sorry .  mr .  a .  e .  pessimal attacked a troll .         yessir .         a .  e .  pessimal .     vetinari repeated .      that   s the man  sir .         a whole troll .         yessir .  with his teeth  sir .         mr .  a .  e .  pessimal .  you are sure .  small man .  very clean shoes .        yessir .      vetinari grabbed a helpful question from the gathering throng .     why .      vimes coughed .     well  sir               the troll mob was a tableau .  trolls stood or sat or lay where they had been when the big hammer had struck .  there were a few slow imbibers who put up a bit of a fight  and one who had stuck with a bottle of looted sherry put up a spirited last drop stand until golem constable dorfl picked him up bodily and bounced him on his head .   vimes walked through it all  as the squad dragged or rolled slumbering trolls into neat lines to await the wagons .  and then     the day was not improving for brick .  he   d drunk a beer .  well  maybe more   n one .  where was der harm in dat .   and now  dere  right in front of him  wearing one o    dem helmets an    everyting  was  yeah  could be a dwarf  insofar as the fizzing  sizzling pathways of his brain were capable of deciding anything at all .  what der hell  they decided  it wasn   t a troll and dat was what it was all about  right .  an    here was his club  right here in his han        instinct caused vimes to turn as a troll opened red eyes  blinked  and began to swing a club .  too slowly  too slowly in the suddenly frozen time  he tried to dive away  and he felt the club smash into his side and lift him  lift him up and tip him onto the ground .  he could hear shouting as the troll lumbered forward  club raised again to make vimes at one with the bedrock .   brick became aware that he was being attacked .  he stopped what he was doing and  with sparks going fwizzle .  in his brain  looked down his right knee .  some little gnome or somethin    was attacking him wi    a blunt sword and kickin    an    screamin    like a mad t   ing .  he put it down to the drink  like der feelin    that his ears were givin    off flames  an    brushed der fing away with a flip of his hand .   vimes  helpless  saw a .  e .  pessimal tumble across the plaza  and watched the troll turn back to the clubbing at hand .  but detritus  arriving behind it now  pulled it around with one shovelsized hand and here came the detritus fist  like the wrath of gods .   for brick  everything went dar            you wish me to believe     said lord vetinari     that mr .  a .  e .  pessimal single handedly attacked a troll .         both hands  sir     said vimes .     and feet  too .  and tried to bite it  we think .         isn   t that certain death .     said vetinari .      that didn   t seem to worry him  sir .      vimes had last seen a .  e .  pessimal being bandaged by igor and smiling in a semiconscious way .  watchmen were dropping in all the time to say things like    hi  big man .     and slap him on the back .  the world had turned for a .  e .  pessimal .      might i inquire  vimes  why one of my most conscientious and most decidedly civilian clerks was in a position to do this .      vimes shifted uncomfortably .     he was inspecting .  learning all about us  sir .      he gave vetinari a look that said  if you take this any further  i will have to lie .   vetinari returned one that said  i know .      you yourself are not too badly injured .     the patrician said aloud .      just a few scratches  sir     said vimes .   vetinari gave him a look that said  broken ribs  i   m certain of it .   vimes returned one that said  nothing .   vetinari wandered over to the window and stared down at the waking city .  he didn   t speak for some time  and then let out a sigh .      such a shame  i think  that so many of them were born here     he said .   vimes stuck with saying nothing .  it generally sufficed .      perhaps i should have taken action against that wretched dwarf     vetinari went on .      yes  sir .         you think so .  a wise ruler thinks twice before directing violence against someone because he does not approve of what they say .      once again  vimes did not comment .  he himself directed violence daily and with a certain amount of enthusiasm against people  because he didn   t approve of them saying things like    give me all your money    or    what are you going to do about it  copper .     but perhaps rulers had to think differently .  instead  he said     someone else didn   t  sir .         thank you for that  vimes     said the patrician  turning around sharply .     and have you found out who they are yet .         investigations are continuing  sir .  last night   s affair got in the way .         is there any evidence that it was a troll .         there is   puzzling evidence  sir .  we are   assembling a jigsaw  you might say .     except that we haven   t got any of the edges and it   d help if we had the lid of the box  he added to himself .  and  because vetinari   s face bore a hungry look  vimes continued aloud     if you   re expecting me to pull a magic rabbit out of my helmet  sir  it   ll be a cooked one .  the dwarfs are certain it was a troll .  there   s a thousand years of history telling them .  they don   t need proof .  and the trolls don   t think it was a troll but probably wish it was .  this isn   t about a murder  sir .  something inside    em   s gone click  and it   s time for all good men   well  you know what i mean   to fight koom valley all over again .  something else is going on in that mine  i know it .  something bigger than murder .  all those tunnels   what are they for .  all those lies   i can smell lies  and the place is full of them .         much hangs on this  vimes     said vetinari .     it   s bigger than you know .  i have this morning had a clacks from the rhys rhysson  the low king .  all politicians have their enemies  of course .  there are  shall we say  factions that disagree with him  his policy toward us  his conciliatory approaches to the troll clans  his stance on the whole wretched ha   ak thing   and now there are stories about a troll killing a grag and  yes  rumors that the watch has threatened the dwarfs        vetinari held up a pale hand as vimes opened his mouth to protest .      we need to know the truth  vimes .  commander sam vimes   s truth .  it may count for more than you think .  in the plains  certainly  and much further .  people know about you  commander .  descendant of a watchman who believed that if a corrupted court will not behead an evil king  then the watchman should do it himself           it was only one king     vimes protested .     it waasn   t a habit .         sam vimes once arrested me for treason     said vetinari calmly .     and sam vimes once arrested a dragon .  sam vimes stopped a war between nations by arresting two high commands .  he   s an arresting fellow  sam vimes .  sam vimes killed a werewolf with his bare hands  and carries law with him  like a lamp           where did all that come from .         watchmen across half the continent will say that sam vimes is as straight as an arrow  can   t be corrupted  won   t be turned  never took a bribe .  listen to me .  if rhys falls  the next low king will not be one who is prepared to talk to the trolls .  can i make it simple for you .  those clans whose leaders have been dealing with rhys will in all likelihood feel they have been made fools of  overthrow said leaders  and replace them with trolls too belligerent and stupid to be fools .  and there will be a war  vimes .  it   ll come here .  it won   t be a gang crumble such as you thwarted last night .  we won   t be able to hold fast or stand aloof .  because we have our own fools  vimes  as i   m sure you know  who   ll insist we pick sides .  koom valley will be everywhere .  find me a murderer  vimes .  hound them down and bring them into the daylight .  troll or dwarf or human  it doesn   t matter .  then at least we shall have the truth  and can make use of it .  it is rumor and uncertainty that is our enemy now .  the low king   s throne trembles  vimes  and thus do the foundations of the world .      vetinari paused  and carefully squared up the paperwork in front of him  as if he now felt he   d gone too far .      however  obviously i do not wish to put you under any kind of pressure     he finished .   in vimes   s confused  lukewarm brain  one word bobbed to the surface .      crumble .     he said .   lord vetinari   s secretary leaned down and whispered into his master   s ear .      ah  i believe i meant    rumble         said vetinari brightly .   vimes was still trying to cope with the international news digest .      all this over one murder .     he said  trying to stifle a yawn .      no  vimes .  you said it yourself  all this over thousands of years of tension and politics and power struggles .  in recent years  things have gone in certain ways  causing power to shift .  there are those who would like it to shift back  even if it returns on a tide of blood .  who cares about one dwarf .  but if his death can be turned into a casus belli       here lord vetinari looked at vimes   s sleepy eyes and went on        that is  a reason for war  then suddenly he is the most important dwarf in the world .  when did you last get some proper sleep  vimes .      vimes muttered something about    not long ago .         go and have some more .  and then find me the murderer .  quickly .  good day to you .      not just thrones trembling  vimes managed to think .  your chair is wobbling a bit  too .  pretty soon some people will be saying  who let all these dwarfs in here .  they undermine our city and they don   t obey our laws .  and the trolls .  we used to chain    em up like guard dogs  and now they   re allowed to walk around threatening real people .   they   d be gathering now  the plotters  the people who chatted quietly in the corner at parties  the people who know how to fashion opinions into knives .  last night   s little fray had been turned into a joke that had probably dismayed the party people  but you couldn   t do it twice .  once things began to spread  once a few humans had been killed  you wouldn   t need to talk behind closed doors anymore .  the mob would scream on your behalf .   they undermine our city and they don   t obey our laws     he climbed in the coach on legs that were only marginally under his control  muttered an instruction to head for pseudopolis yard  and fell asleep .       it was still nighttime in the city of endless rain .  it was never not nighttime .  no sun rose here .   the creature lay coiled in its alley .   something was seriously wrong .  it had expected resistance .  there was always resistance  and it always overcame it .  but even now  when the invisible bustle of the city had slowed  there was no way in .  time and again it   d be sure that it had found a point of control  some tide of rage it could use  and time and again it   d be slammed back here  into this dark alley where the gutters overflowed .   this was not the usual kind of mind .  the creature struggled .  but no mind had ever beaten it yet .  there was always a way         through the ruin of the world the troll staggers     brick lurched out of dolly sisters watch house  clutching his head with one hand and  in the other  holding the bag that contained as many of his teeth as detritus had been able to find .  the sergeant had been very decent about dat  brick thought .  detritus had also explained to him exactly what would have happened to him had his second blow hit the human  graphically indicating that finding brick   s teeth would have been secondary to finding a head to put them in .   he   d gone on to say  though  that there might be a place in the watch for any troll who could still stand up after a head full of big hammer  and maybe brick might like to conduct his future behavior with an eye to this .   so  brick thought  insofar as the term could be applied to any brain activity within two days of big hammer  der future was looking so bright dat he had to walk along wid his eyes almost shut  although dat was probably der big hammer again .   but     he   d heard the other trolls talking .  and the watchmen  too .  all dis stuff about a troll killing a dwarf down in dat new mine .  now  brick was still certain he hadn   t killed no dwarf  even after half an ounce of scrape .  he   d gone over and over it in what currently remained of his mind .  trouble was  der watch had all dese tricks dese days  dey could tell what a guy had for dinner just by looking at his plate .  an    he   d lost a skull down dere  too  he was sure o    dat .  like  dey could jus    sniff it and know it was him .  except it wasn   t him  right .     cos dey said der troll dropped his club  an    brick still had his club     cos he hit dat top watchman wi    it  so maybe that was what dey called an ally by .  yes .  despite the cerebral gurgling noise of the big hammer draining away from his higher brain functions  brick suspected that it wasn   t .  an    anyway  if dey lookin    for a troll what done der deed  and dey find out i was dere  lost a skull an    everytin    an    i say  okay  i was dere but i never walloped no dwarf  de   ll say  ho yus  pull der other one  it is havin    bells on .   right here  and right now  brick was feeling a very lonely troll .   dere was nothin    for it .  dere was only one person who could help him w    dis one .  it was too much t   inkin    for one troll .   slinking through alleys  pressed against walls  keeping his head down  avoiding every living creature  brick sought out mr .  shine .       angua decided to go straight to pseudopolis yard rather than a closer watch house .  that was hq  after all  and besides  she always kept a spare uniform in her locker .   what was annoying was that sally walked so easily in six inch heels .  that was vampires for you .  she had taken hers off and was carrying them  it was that or turn an ankle .  the pink pussycat club had a fairly limited choice of footwear .  there wasn   t much to choose from in the way of clothing  either  if by clothing you meant something that actually made an attempt to cover anything .   angua had been rather surprised that the stage wardrobe had included a female watch outfit  but with skimpy papier m  ch   armor and a skirt that was much too short to be any protection .  tawneee had explained  rather carefully  that men sometimes liked to see a pretty girl in armor .  to angua  who   d found that men she was apprehending never looked very pleased to see her  this was food for thought .   she   d settled for a sequined gold dress  which just didn   t work .  sally had picked something simple and cut to the thigh  in blue  which  of course  had become stunning the moment she   d put it on .  she looked fabulous .   so when angua strode into the main office  slamming the big doors back  and there was a derisory wolf whistle  the unwise watchman found himself being pushed backwards until he was slammed against the wall .  he felt two sharp points pressed against his neck as angua growled     you want a wolf  do you .  say no  sergeant angua .         no  sergeant angua .         you don   t .  i was probably mistaken then  was i .     the points pressed a little harder .  in the man   s mind  steely talons were about to pierce his jugular .      couldn   t say for sure  sergeant angua .         my nerves are a tad stretched right now .     angua howled .      hadn   t noticed  sergeant angua .         we   re all a little bit on edge at the moment  wouldn   t you say .         that   s ever so true  sergeant angua .      angua let the man   s boot reach the ground .  she put two black  shiny  and noticeably pointed heels into his unresisting hands .      could you do me a really big favor  please  and take these back up to the pink pussycat club .     she said sweetly .     they belong to someone called sherilee  i think .  thank you .      she turned and looked over to the duty desk  where carrot was watching her with his mouth open .  well aware of the stir she was causing  she walked up to the desk past an audience of shocked faces and threw a muddy necklace down onto the open incident book .      four dwarfs murdered by other dwarfs  down in the long dark     she said .     i   ll bet my nose on it .  that belonged to one of them .  he   d also got this .     a muddy envelope was dropped by the necklace .     it   s pretty slimy  but you can read it .  mister vimes is going to go postal .     she looked up into the blue eyes of carrot .     where is he .         sleeping on a mattress in his office     said carrot  and shrugged .     lady sybil knew he wouldn   t go home  so she got willikins to make up a bed down here .  are you two all right .         fine  sir     said sally .      i was getting very worried       carrot began .      four dead dwarfs  captain     said angua .     city dwarfs .  that   s what you should be worrying about .  three half buried  this one crawled away .      carrot picked up the necklace and read the runes .      lars legstrong     he said .     i think i know the family .  are you sure he was murdered .         throat cut .  it   d be hard to call it suicide .  but he took some time to die .  he made it to one of their damn doors  which they   d locked shut  and scrawled one of their signs on it in his own blood .  then he sat down and waited to die in the dark .  in the damn dark  carrot .  they were working dwarfs .  they had shovels and wheelbarrows .  they were down there doing a job  and when they weren   t needed anymore they got the chop .  hacked down and left for the mud .  he might even still have been alive down there when mister vimes and i went in .  behind their bloody thick door  dying by inches .  and do you know what this means .      she pulled a folded piece of card out of her bodice and passed it over .      a drinks menu .     said carrot .      open it     snapped angua .     i   m sorry it   s written in lipstick  it was all we could find .      carrot flipped it open .     another dark symbol .     he said .     i don   t think i know this one .      there were other dwarf officers in the office .  carrot held up the symbol .      does anyone here know what this means .      a few helmeted heads shook  and a few dwarfs backed away  but a deep voice from the doorway said     yes  captain carrot .  i suspect i do .  does it look like an eye with a tail .         yes   er   sir .     said carrot  staring .  a shadow moved .      it was drawn in the dark .  by a dying dwarf .  in his own blood .  it is the summoning dark  captain  and it will be moving .  good morning to you .  i am mr .  shine .      carrot   s jaw dropped as the watchmen turned to look at the newcomer .  he loomed in the doorway  almost as broad as he was tall  in a black cloak and hood that hid any possible feature .      the mr .  shine .     he said .      regrettably so  captain  and can i charge you to see that no one in this room leaves for a few minutes after i do .  i like to keep my movements   private .         i didn   t think you were real  sir .         believe me  young man  i wish it were possible to keep you in that happy state     said the hooded figure .     however  my hand is forced .      mr .  shine stepped forward  pulling a rangy figure into the room .  it was a troll  whose look of sullen defiance did not quite manage to conceal knee knocking terror .      this is brick  captain .  i deliver him back into the personal custody of your sergeant detritus .  he has information of use to you .  i have heard his story .  i believe him .  you must move fast .  the summoning dark may already have found a champion .  what else   oh yes  be sure not to keep that symbol in a dark place .  keep light around it at all times .  and now  if you will excuse the theatricals        the black robe twitched .  hard  white  blinding light filled the room for a second .  when it had gone  so had mr .  shine .  all that was left was a large  round stone on the stained floor .   carrot blinked  and then pulled himself together .      all right  you heard     he said to the suddenly animated room at large .     no one is to follow mr .  shine  understood .         follow him  captain .     said a dwarf .     we   re not mad  you know .         dat   s right     said a troll .     dey say he can reach inside o    you an    stop your heart .         mr .  shine .     said angua .     is he what they   ve been writing about on the walls .         it looks like that     said carrot shortly .     and he said we don   t have much time .  mr    .  brick  was it .      while chrysophrase   s trolls had contrived to swagger while standing still  brick just managed to huddle all alone .  you usually need two to huddle  but here was a troll trying to hide behind himself .  no one could hide behind brick  for a troll  he was stick thin to the point of knobbliness .  his lichen was cheap and matted  not the real thing at all  probably the stuff they made up out of broccoli stalks in the back alleys of quarry lane .  his belt of skulls was a disgrace  some of them were clearly the papier m  ch   kind that could be bought from any joke shop .  one had a red nose .   he looked around nervously  and there was a thud as his club dropped from his fingers .      i   m in deep copro  right .     he said .      certainly we need to talk to you     said carrot .     do you want a lawyer .         no  i ate already .         you eat lawyers .     said carrot .   brick gave him an empty stare until sufficient brain had been mustered .      what d   y   call dem fings  dey kinda crumble when you eat dem .     he ventured .   carrot looked at detritus and angua  to see if there was going to be any help there .      could be lawyers     he conceded .      dey go soggy if you dips    em in somfing     said brick  as if undertaking a forensic examination .      more likely to be biscuits  then .     carrot suggested .      could be .  inna packet wi    all paper on .  yeah  biscuits .         what i meant     said carrot     was when we talk to you  do you want someone to be on your side .         yes please .  everyone     said brick promptly .  to be the center of attention in a room full of watchmen was his worst nightmare .  no  hold on  what about dat time when he had dat bad slab wot had bin cut wi    ammonium nitrate .  whooo .  good bye lobes .  yep .  den dis was his second worst nightmar   no  come to fink of it  dere was dis time when he had dat stuff wot hardcore jacked off   f one eyed goddam  whee  yes .  who knows where dat has bin .  all dem dancin    teef .  so dis was his   hey  wait  remember dat time you got lunched on scrape an    your arms flew away .  okay  dat was bad  so maybe dis was his   wait  wait  of course  can   t be forgetting der day when you got baked on sliver and blew powdered zinc up you nose an    thought you   d thrown up your feet .  aargh  here come dat time again when you   d  aargh no  when you   d  aargh     brick had got as far as his nineteenth worst nightmare before carrot   s voice cut through the snakes .      mr .  brick .         er   is dat still me .     said brick nervously .  he could really  really do some slab right now        generally your advocate is one person     said carrot .     we   re going to have to ask you some difficult questions .  you   re allowed to have someone to help you .  perhaps you have a friend we could fetch .      brick pondered this .  the only people he could think of in this context were totally slag and big marble  although more correctly they fell into the category of    people dat don   t fro fings at me much and let me glom a bit o    slab sometimes    right now  these did not seem ideal qualifications .   he pointed to sergeant detritus .      him     he said .     he helped me find my teef .         i   m not sure a serving officer is       carrot began .      i   ll volunteer for the role  captain     said a little voice .  carrot peered over the edge of the desk .      mr .  pessimal .  i don   t think you should be out of bed .         uh   i am  in fact  acting lance constable  captain     said a . e .  pessimal  politely yet firmly .  he was on crutches .      oh .  er   right     said carrot .     but  i still think you shouldn   t be out of bed .         nevertheless  justice must be served     said a .  e .  pessimal .   brick bent down and peered closely at the inspector .     it   s dat gnome from last night     he said .     don   t want him .         you can   t think of anyone .     said carrot .   brick thought again  and at last brightened up .      yeah  i can     he said .     easy .  someone to help me answer der questions  right .         that   s right .         well  easy peas .  if you can fetch that dwarf i saw down in dat new dwarf mine last night  he   d help me .      the room went deadly quiet .      and why would he do that .     said carrot carefully .      he could tell you why he was hitting dat other dwarf onna head     said brick .     i mean  i don   t know .  but i    spect he won   t wanna come on account of me bein    a troll  so i   ll stick with the sergeant  if it    all der same to you .         i think this is going too far  captain .     said a .  e .  pessimal .   in the silence that followed this  carrot   s voice sounded very loud .      i think this  mr .  pessimal  is the point where we wake up commander vimes .          there was an old military saying that fred colon used to describe total bewilderment and confusion .  an individual in that state  according to fred     couldn   t tell if it was arsehole or breakfast time .      this had always puzzled vimes .  he wondered what research had been done .  even now  with his mouth tasting of warmed over yesterday and everything curiously sharp in his vision  he thought he   d be able to tell the difference .  only one was likely to include a cup of coffee  for a start .   he had one now  ergo  it was breakfast time .  actually  it was near lunchtime  but that would have to do .   the troll known to everyone else and occasionally to himself as brick was seated in one of the big troll cells  but in deference to the fact that no one could decide if he was a prisoner or not  the door had been left unlocked .  the understanding was that  provided he didn   t try to leave  no one would stop him leaving .  brick was engulfing his third bowl of mineral rich mud that  to a troll  was nourishing soup .      what is scrape .     vimes said  leaning back in the room   s one spare chair and staring at brick as a zoologolist might eye a fascinating but highly unpredictable new species .  he   d put the stone book from the mysterious mr .  shine on the table by the bowl  to see if it got any reaction  but the troll paid it no attention .      scrape .  you don   t see it much dese days now dat slab   s so damn cheap     rumbled detritus  who was watching his new find with a proprietorial air  like a mother hen watching a chick who was about to leave the nest .     it what you    scrape up     see .  it few bits o    drain grade slab boiled up in a tin wi    alcohol and pigeon droppin   s .  it what der street trolls make when dey is short o    cash an      what is it dey   s short of  brick .      the moving spoon paused .     dey is short o    self respec     sergeant     he said  as one might who   d had the lesson shouted into his ear for twenty minutes .      by io  he got it .     said detritus  slapping the skinny brick on the back so hard that the young troll dropped his spoon into the steaming gloop .     but dis lad has promised me all dat is behind him and he is damn straight now  on account o    havin    joined my one step program .  ain   t dat so  brick .  no more slab  scrape  slice  slide  slunkie  slurp  or sliver for dis boy  right .         yes  sergeant     said brick obediently .      sergeant  why do the names of all troll drugs start with s .     said vimes .      ah  it make dem easier to remember  sir     said detritus  nodding sagely .      ah  of course .  i hadn   t spotted that     said vimes .     has sergeant detritus explained to you why he calls it a one step program  brick .         er      cos he won   t let me put a foot wrong  sir .     said brick  as if reading it off a card .      an    brick here   s got something else to say to you  haven   t you  brick .     said the maternal detritus .     go on  tell mister vimes .      brick looked down at the table .     sorry i tried to kill you  mister vimes     he whispered .      well  we   ll see about that  shall we .     said vimes  for something better to say .     by the way  i think you meant mister vimes  and i prefer it if only people who   ve fought alongside me call me mister vimes .         well  technic   ly brick has fought       detritus began  but vimes put down his coffee mug firmly .  his ribs were aching .      no     in front of    is not the same thing as    alongside     sergeant     he said .     it really isn   t .         not really his fault  sir  it was more a case o    mis taken identity     detritus protested .      you mean he didn   t know who i was .     said vimes .     that didn   t seem to           nosir .  he didn   t know who he was  sir .  he thought he was a bunch o    lights and fireworks .  trust me  sir  i reckon i can make something o    this one .  please .  sir  he was out o    his brain on big hammer and still he was walkin    about .      vimes stared at detritus a moment  and then looked back at brick .      mr .  brick  tell me how you got into the mine  will you .     he said .      i told the other polisman       brick began .      now you tell mister vimes .     growled detritus .     right now .      it took a little while  with pauses for bits of brick   s mind to shunt into position  but vimes assembled it like this   the wretched brick had been cooking up scrape with some fellow gutter trolls in an old warehouse in the maze of streets behind park lane  had blundered down into the cellar looking for a cool place to watch the display  and the floor had given way under him .  by the sound of it  he   d fallen a long way  but to judge by the troll   s natural state  he probably floated down like a butterfly .  he   d ended up in a tunnel     like a mine  y   know  wi    ali wood holdin    der roof up     and had wandered along it in the hope that it led back to the surface or something to eat .   he didn   t start to worry until he came out into a far grander tunnel  and the words    dwarfs    finally reached a bit of his brain with nothing to do but listen .   a troll in a dwarf mine goes on the rampage .  it was one of those givens  like a bull in a china shop .  but brick seemed refreshingly free of hatred toward anyone .  provided the world supplied enough things beginning with s to make his head go    bzzz .      and the city had no shortage of these  he didn   t much care about what else it did .  brick  down in the gutter  had even dropped below that horizon .  no wonder chrysophrase   s shakedown hadn   t corralled him .  brick was something you stepped over .   it might even have occurred to brick  standing there in the dark with the sound of dwarf voices in the distance  to be afraid .  and then he   d seen  through a big round doorway  one dwarf hold up another and hit it over the head .  it was cave gloomy  but trolls had good night vision  and there were always the vurms .  the troll hadn   t made out details and was not particularly interested in seeing any .  who cared what dwarfs did to one another .  so long as they didn   t do it to him  he didn   t see a problem .  but when the dwarf that had done the bashing started to shout  then there was a problem  large as life .   a big metal door right by him had slammed open and hit him in the face .  when he peered out from behind it  it was to see several armed dwarfs running past .  they weren   t interested in what might be behind the door  not yet .  they were doing what people do  which is run toward the source of the shouting .  brick  on the other hand  was only interested in getting as far away from the shouting as possible  and  right here  was an open door .  he took it and ran  not stopping until he was out in the fresh night air .   there had been no pursuit .  vimes wasn   t surprised .  you needed a special kind of mind to be a guard .  it was one that was prepared to be in a body that stood and looked at nothing very much for hours on end .  such a mind did not command high wages .  such a mind  too  would not be likely to start a search by looking in the tunnel it just arrived by .  it would not be the sharpest knife in the drawer .   and so  aimlessly  without intent  malice  or even curiosity  a wandering troll had wandered into a dwarf mine  spotted a murder through a drug addled perception  and wandered out again .  who could plan for anything like that .  where was the logic .  where was the sense .   vimes looked at the watery  fried egg eyes  the emaciated frame  the thin dribble of gods knew what from a crusted nostril .  brick wasn   t telling lies .  brick had enough trouble dealing with things that weren   t made up .      tell mister vimes about the big wukwuk     detritus prompted .      oh  yeah     said brick .     dere was dis big wukwuk in der cave .         i think i   m missing a vital point here     said vimes .      a wukwuk is what you make wi    charcoal an    niter an    slab     said the sergeant .     all rolled up in paper  like a cigar  you know .  he said it was           we call dem wukwuks    cos dey looks like   you know  a wukwuk     said brick  with an embarrassed grin .      yes  i   m getting the picture     said vimes wearily .     and did you try to smoke it .         nosir .  it was big     said brick .     all rolled up in their cave  jus    by the manky ol    tunnel i fell into .      vimes tried to fit this into his thinking  and left it out for now .  so   a dwarf did it .  right .  and right now he believed brick  although a bucket of frogs would make a better witness .  no sense in pushing him further right now  anyway     okay     he said .  he reached down and came up with the mysterious stone that had been left on the floor of the office .  it was about eight inches across  but curiously light .     tell me about mr .  shine  brick .  friend of yours .         mr .  shine is everywhere .     said brick fervently .     him diamond .         well  half an hour ago he was in this building     said vimes .     detritus .         sir .     said the sergeant  a guilty look spreading across his face .      what do you know about mr .  shine .     said vimes .      er   he a bit like a troll god       detritus muttered .      don   t get many gods in here  as a rule     said vimes .     someone   s pinched the secret of fire  have you seen my golden apple .  it   s amazing how often we don   t get that sort of thing in the crime book .  he   s a troll  is he .         kinda like a   a king     said detritus  as if every word was being dragged from him .      i thought trolls didn   t have kings these days     said vimes .     i thought every clan ruled itself .         right  right     said detritus .     look  mister vimes  he mr .  shine  okay .  we don   t talk about him much .     the troll   s expression was a mixture of misery and defiance .  vimes decided to go for a weaker target .      where did you find him  brick .  i just want to           he came callin    to help you .     snarled detritus .     what you doin     mister vimes .  why you go on askin    questions .  wi    the dwarfs you have pussy feet  must not upset    em  oh no  but what you do if dey was trolls  eh .  kick down der door  no problem .  mr .  shine bring you brick  give you good advice  an    you talk like he bein    a bad troll .  i   m hearin    now where captain carrot  he tellin    the dwarfs he the two brothers .  you fink that make me happy .  we know dat lyin    ol    dwarf lie  yes .  we groan at it lyin     yes .  you want to see mr .  shine  you show humble  you show respec     yes .      this is koom valley again  thought vimes .  he   s never seen detritus this angry  at least at him .  the troll was just there  reliable and dependable .  at koom valley  two tribes had met  and no one blinked .      i apologize     he said  blinking .     i didn   t know .  no offense was meant .         right .     said detritus  his huge hand thumping on the table .   the spoon jumped out of brick   s empty soup bowl .  the mysterious rock ball rolled across the table  with an inevitable little trundling noise  and cracked open on the floor .   vimes looked down at two neat halves .      it   s full of crystals     he said .  then he looked closer .  there was a piece of paper in one broken  glittering hemisphere .   he picked it up and read  pointer   pickles  crystals  minerals   tumbling supplies  no .    tenth egg street  ankh morpork .   vimes put this down carefully  and picked up the two pieces of the stone .  he pushed them together  and they fitted with the merest hairline crack .  there was no sign that any glue had ever been used .   he looked up at detritus .      did you know that was going to happen .     he said .      no     said the troll .     but i fink mr .  shine did .         he   s given me his address  sergeant .         yeah .  so maybe he want you to visit     detritus conceded .     dat is a honor  all right .  you don   t find mr .  shine  mr .  shine find you .         how did he find you  mr .  brick .     said vimes .   brick gave detritus a panicky look .  the sergeant shrugged .      he pick me up one day .  gimme food     brick mumbled .     he show me where to come for more .  he tole me t   keep off   f the stuff  too .  but           yes    .     vimes prompted .   brick waved a pair of scarred  knobbly arms in a gesture that said  far more coherently than he could  that there was the whole universe on one side and brick on the other  and what could anyone do against odds like that .   and so  he   d been handed over to detritus  vimes thought .  that evened the odds somewhat .   he stood up  and nodded to detritus .      should i take anything  sergeant .      the troll thought about this .     no     he said     but maybe dere   s some finkin    you could leave behind .          i should be in charge of the mine raid  thought vimes .  we might be starting a war  after all  so i   m sure people would like to think that someone high up was there when it happened .  so  why do i think it   s more important that i see the mysterious mr .  shine .       captain carrot had been busy .  the city dwarfs liked him .  so he   d done what vimes could not have done  or at least have done well  which was take a muddy dwarf necklace to a dwarf home down in new cobblers and explain to two dwarf parents how it had been found .  things had happened quite fast after that  and one other reason for the speed was that the mine was shut .  guards and workers and dwarfs seeking guidance on the path of dwarfdom had turned up  to be met with locked doors .  money was owing  and dwarfs got very definite about things like that .  a lot of the huge body of dwarf lore was about contracts .  you were supposed to get paid .   no more politics  vimes told himself .  someone killed four of our dwarfs  not some crazy rabble rouser  and left them down there in the dark .  i don   t care who they are  they   re going to be dragged into the light .  it   s the law .  all the way to the bottom  all the way to the top .   but it   s going to be done by dwarfs .  dwarfs will go to that well  and dig out that mud again  and bring up the proof .   he walked into the main office .  carrot was there  along with half a dozen dwarf officers .  they looked grim .      all set .     said vimes .      yes  sir .  we   ll meet the others at empirical crescent .         you   ve got enough diggers .         all dwarfs are diggers  sir     said carrot solemnly .     there   s timber on the way  and winching gear  too .  some of the miners joining us helped dig that tunnel  sir .  they knew those lads .  they   re a bit bewildered and angry .         i   ll bet .  they believe us  then  do they .     said vimes .      er   more or less  sir .  if the bodies aren   t there  though  we   re going to have some explaining to do .         very true .  didn   t your lads know what they were digging for .         no  sir .  they just got orders from the dark dwarfs .  and different squads dug in different directions .  a long way in different directions .  as far as money trap lane and ettercap street  they think .         that   s a big slice of the city .         yessir .  but there was something odd .         do go on  captain     said vimes .     we   re good at odd .         every so often everyone had to stop work  and the foreign dwarfs listened at the walls with a big  er  thing  like an ear trumpet .  sally found something like that when she was down there .         they were listening .  in soggy mud .  listening for what .  singing worms .         the dwarfs don   t know  sir .  trapped miners  they thought .  i suppose it makes sense .  a lot of the digging is through old stonework  so i suppose it   s possible that other miners could be trapped somewhere that   s got air .         not to last for weeks  though  surely .  and why dig in different directions .         it   s a puzzle  sir  there   s no doubt about it .  but we   ll get to the bottom of it soon enough .  everyone   s very keen .         good .  but play down the watch side  will you .  this is a bunch of concerned citizens trying to find their loved ones after a reported mining disaster  okay .  the watchmen are just helping them out .         you mean    remember i   m a dwarf     sir .         thank you for that  carrot .  yes  exactly     said vimes .     and now i   m off to see a legend with a name like a can of polish .      as he went out  he noticed the summoning dark symbol .  the pussycat club drinks menu had been put with some care on a shelf by the window  where it got maximum light .  it glowed .  maybe this was because frosted hot lips rose had been designed to be seen across a crowded bar in poor light  but it seemed to float above the oh so funny sticky cocktail names like just sex  pussy galore  and no brainer  making them look faded and unreal .   someone   several ones  by the look of it   had lit candles in front of it  for when night came .   it mustn   t be kept in the dark  vimes thought .  i wish i wasn   t .       pointer and pickles was dusty .  dust was the keynote of the shop .  vimes must have passed it a thousand times  it was that kind of shop  the kind you walked past .  dust and dead flies filled the little window  which nevertheless offered dim views of large lumps of rock  covered with dust  beyond .   the bell over the door gave a dusty jangle as vimes entered the gloomy interior .  the noise died away  and there was a definite feeling that this marked the end of the entertainment for today .   then a distant shuffling was born in the heavy silence .  it turned out to belong to a very old woman who appeared  at first sight  to be as dusty as the rocks she  presumably  sold .  vimes had his doubts even about that .  shops like this one often looked upon the selling of merchandise as  in some way  a betrayal of a sacred trust .  as if to underline this  she was carrying a club with a nail in it .   when she was close enough for conversation  vimes said     i   ve come here to           do you believe in the healing power of crystals  young man .     snapped the woman  raising the club threateningly .      what .  what healing power .     said vimes .   the old woman gave him a cracked smile  and dropped the club .      good     she said .     we like our customers to take their geology seriously .  we   ve got some trollite in this week .         good  but  in fact  i           it   s the only mineral that travels backwards in time  you know .         i   m here to see mr .  shine     vimes managed .      mr .  who .     said the old woman  putting a hand to her ear .      mr .  shine .     said vimes  confidence already draining out of him .      never heard of him  dear .         he  er  gave me this     said vimes  showing her the two pieces of stone egg .      amethyst geode  very nice specimen  i   ll give you seven dollars     said the old woman .      are you  er  pickles or pointer .     said vimes  as a last resort .      i   m miss pickles  dear .  miss point        she stopped .  her expression changed  became slightly younger and considerably more alert .      and i   m miss pointer  dear     she said .     don   t worry about pickles  she just runs the body when i   ve got other things to do .  are you commander vimes .      vimes stared .     are you telling me you   re two people .  with one body .         yes  dear .  it   s supposed to be an illness  but all i can say is we   ve always got along well .  i   ve never told her about mr .  shine .  can   t be too careful .  come this way  do .      she led the way through the dusty crystals and slabs into the back of the shop  where there was a wide corridor lined with shelves .  crystals of all sizes sparkled down at him .      of course  trolls have always been of interest to geologists  being made of metamorphorical rock     said miss pointer miss pickles conversationally .     you   re not a rock hound yourself  commander .         i   ve had the occasional stone thrown at me     said vimes .     i   ve never bothered to check what kind it was .         ha .  such a shame we   re on loam here     said the woman as the sound of quiet voices drew nearer .  she opened a door and stood aside .     i rent them the room     she said .     do go in .      vimes looked at the top few treads of a flight of stairs  heading down .  oh goody  he thought .  we   re going underground again .  but there was warm light coming up  and the voices were louder .   the cellar was large and cool .  there were tables everywhere  with a couple of people at each one  bent over a checkered board .  a games room .  the players were dwarfs  trolls  and humans  but what they had in common was concentration .  unconcerned faces glanced toward vimes  who had paused  halfway down the stairs  and then looked back to the game at hand .   vimes continued down to floor level .  this had to be important  right .  mr .  shine had wanted him to see it .  people   men  trolls  dwarfs   playing games .  occasionally  a couple of players would look up at each other  share a glance  and shake hands .  then one of them would go off to a new table .      what do you notice  mister vimes .     said a deep voice behind him .  vimes forced himself to turn slowly .   the figure sitting in the shadows beside the stairway was shrouded entirely in black .  he looked a good head taller than vimes .      they   re all young .     he ventured  and added     mr .  shine .         exactly .  more youngsters tend to come along in the evenings  too .  do take a seat  sir .         why have i come to see you  mr .  shine .     said vimes  sitting down .      because you want to find out why you have come to see me     said the dark figure .     because you   re wandering in the dark .  because mister vimes  with his badge and his truncheon  is full of rage .  more full than usual .  take care of that rage  mister vimes .      mystic  thought vimes .     i like to see whom i   m talking to     he said .     what are you .         you would not see me if i removed this hood     said mr .  shine .     as for what i am  i   ll ask you this  would it be true to say that captain carrot  while very happy to be a watch officer  is the rightful king of ankh morpork .         i have trouble with the term    rightful         said vimes .      so i understand .  it may well be that this is one reason why he hasn   t yet chosen to declare himself     said mr .  shine .     but no matter .  well  i am the rightful   excuse me   and indisputable king of the trolls .         really .     said vimes .  it wasn   t much of a reply  but his options at this point were limited .      yes .  and when i say   indisputable     i mean what i say  mister vimes .  hidden human kings have to resort to magic swords or legendary feats to reclaim their birthright .  i do not .  i just have to be .  you are aware of the concept of metamorphorical rock .         you mean the way trolls look like certain types of rock .         indeed .  schist  mica  shale  and so on .  even brick  poor young brick .  no one knows why this is  and they have expended thousands of words in saying so .  oh  to hell with it  as you would say .  you deserve a glimpse .  protect your eyes .  i  mister vimes        a black robed arm was extended  a black velvet glove removed .  vimes shut his eyes in time  but the inside of his lids blazed red .         am diamond     said mr .  shine .   the glare faded a little .  vimes risked opening his eyes a bit  and made out a hand  every flexing finger sparkling like a prism .  the players glanced up  but they   d seen this before .      frost forms quite quickly     said mr .  shine .  when vimes dared to peek  the hand glittered like the heart of winter .      you   re hiding out from jewelers .     he managed  taken aback .      hah .  in fact  this city is indeed a very good place for people who don   t wish to be seen  mister vimes .  i have friends here .  and i have talents .  you   d find me quite hard to see if i wished to be unseen .  i am also  frankly  intelligent  and intelligent all the time .  i don   t need the pork futures warehouse .  i can regulate the temperature of my brain by reflecting all heat .  diamond trolls are very rare  and when we do appear  kingship is our destiny .      vimes waited .  mr .  shine  who was now pulling his glove back on  appeared to have an agenda .  the wisest thing was to let him talk until it all made sense .      and do you know what happens when we become kings .     said mr .  shine  now safely shrouded once more .      koom valley .     vimes suggested .      well done .  the trolls unite  and we have the same tired old war  followed by centuries of skirmishing .  that is the sad  stupid history of the trolls and the dwarfs .  and this time  ankh morpork will be caught up in it .  you know that the troll and dwarf population here has grown enormously under vetinari .         all right  but if you   re king  can   t you just make peace .         just like that .  it   ll need much more than that .     the hood of the robe shook sadly .     you really know very little about us  mister vimes .  you see us down on the plains  shambling around  talkin    like dis .  you don   t know about the history chant  or the long dance  or stone music .  you see the hunched troll dragging his club .  that   s what the dwarfs did for us  long ago .  they turned us  in your minds  into sad  brainless monsters .         don   t look at me when you say that     said vimes .     detritus is one of my best officers .      there was silence .  the mr .  shine said     shall i tell you what i think the dwarfs were looking for  mister vimes .  something of theirs .  it is a thing that talks .  and they found it  and i think what it had to say directly caused five deaths .  i believe i know how to find the secret of koom valley .  in a few weeks  everyone will be able to .  but by then  i think  it will be too late .  you must solve it  too  before the war sweeps up all of us .         how do you know all this .     said vimes .      because i   m magical     said the voice from the hood .      oh  well  if that   s the way you   re       vimes began .      patience  commander     said mr .  shine .     i just   simplified .  accept  instead  that i am very   smart .  i have an analytical mind .  i   ve studied the histories and lore of my hereditary enemy .  i have friends who are dwarfs .  quite knowledgeable dwarfs .  quite   powerful dwarfs  who wish for an end to this stupid feud as much as i do .  and i have a love of games and puzzles .  the codex was not a terrible challenge .         if it   s going to help me find the murderers of those dwarfs in the mine then you should tell me what you know .         why trust what i say .  i am a troll  i   m partisan  i might wish to direct your thoughts down the wrong path .         maybe you   ve already .     said vimes hotly .  he knew he was making a fool of himself  it only made him angrier .      good  that   s the spirit .     said mr .  shine .     test all that i   ve told you .  where would we be if commander vimes relied on magic  eh .  no  the secret of koom valley must be found by observation and questioning and facts  facts  facts .  possibly i   m helping you find them a little quicker than you might otherwise do .  you just have to think about what you know  commander .  and  in the meantime  shall we play a little game .      mr .  shine picked up a box by his chair and upended it over the table .      this is thud  mister vimes     he said  as little stone figures bounced over the board .     dwarfs versus trolls .  eight trolls and thirty two dwarfs  forever fighting their little battles on a cardboard koom valley .     he began to place the pieces  black gloved hands moving with un trollish speed .   vimes pushed back his chair .     nice to meet you  mr .  shine  but all you are giving me is riddles and           sit down  commander .     the quite voice had a schoolteacher harmonic to it that folded vimes   s legs under him .     good     said mr .  shine .     eight trolls  thirty two dwarfs .  dwarfs always start .  a dwarf is small and fast and can run as many squares as possible in any direction .  a troll   because we   re stupid and drag our clubs  as everyone knows   can only move one square in any direction .  there are other types of moving  but what do you see so far .      vimes tried to concentrate .  it was hard .  this was a game  it wasn   t real .  besides  the answer was so obvious that it couldn   t be the right one .      it looks like the dwarfs must win every time     he ventured .      ah  natural suspicion  i like that .  in fact  among the best players  the bias is slightly in favor of the trolls     said mr .  shine .     this is largely because a troll can  in the right circumstances  do a lot of damage .  how are your ribs  by the way .         all the better for you asking     said vimes sourly .  he   d forgotten them for twenty blessed minutes  now they ached again .      good .  i   m glad brick has found detritus .  he has a good brain if he can be persuaded to stop frying it every half an hour .  back to our game   advantages to either side do not matter  in fact  because a complete game consists of two battles .  in one  you must play the dwarfs .  in the other  you must play the trolls .  as you may expect  dwarfs find it easy to play the dwarf side  which needs a strategy and mode of attack that comes easy to a dwarf .  something similar applies to the trolls .  but to win  you must play both sides .  you must  in fact  be able to think like your ancient enemy .  a really skilled player   well  take a look  commander .  look toward the back of the room  where my friend phyllite is playing against nils mousehammer .      vimes turned .      what am i looking for .     he said .      whatever you see .         well  that troll over there is wearing what looks like a large dwarf helmet           yes  one of the dwarf players made it for him .  and he speaks quite passable dwarfish .         he   s drinking out of a horn  like the dwarfs do           he had to have one made in metal .  troll beer would melt ordinary horn .  nils can sing quite a lot of the troll history chant .  look at gabbro  over there .  good troll boy  but he knows all there is to know about dwarf battle bread .  in fact  i believe that   s a boomerang croissant on the table next to him .  purely for ceremonial purposes  of course .  commander .         hmm .     said vimes  turning his head .     what .     a slightly built dwarf at one of the tables was watching him with interest  as though he was some kind of fascinating monster .   mr .  shine chuckled .     to study the enemy  you have to get under his skin .  when you   re under his skin  you start to see the world through his eyes .  gabbro is so good at playing from the dwarf viewpoint that his troll game is suffering  and he wants to go to copperhead to learn from some of the dwarf thudmeisters there .  i hope he does  they   ll teach him how to play like a troll .  none of these lads here were out getting fighting drunk last night .  and thus we wear down mountains .  water dripping on a stone  dissolving and removing .  changing the shape of the world  one drop at a time .  water dripping on a stone  commander .  water flowing underground  bubbling up in unexpected places .         i think you   re going to need a bit more of a gush     said vimes .     i don   t think a bunch of people playing games is going to break down a mountain anytime soon .         it depends on where the drops fall     said mr .  shine .     in time  they may wash away a valley  at least .  you should ask yourself  why was i so keen to get into that mine .         because there had been a murder .         and that was the only reason .     said the shrouded mr .  shine .      of course .         and everyone knows what gossips dwarfs are     said mr .  shine .     well  i am sure you will do your best  commander .  i hope you find the murderer before the dark catches up with them .         mr .  shine  some of my officers have lit candles around that damn symbol .         good thinking  i   d say .         so you really believe that it   s some kind of a threat .  how come you know so much about dwarf signs  anyway .         i have studied them .  i accept the fact of their existence .  some of your officers believe .  most dwarfs do  somewhere in their gnarly little souls .  i respect that .  you can take a dwarf out of the dark  but you can   t take the dark out of a dwarf .  those symbols are very old .  they have real power .  who knows what old evil lurks in the deep darkness under the mountains .  there   s no darkness like it .         you can take the mickey out of a copper  too     said vimes .      ah  mister vimes  you have had a busy day .  so much happening  so little time to think .  take time to reflect on all you know  sir .  i am a reflecting kind of person .         commander vimes .     the voice came from miss pointer miss pickles  halfway up the stairs .     there is a big troll asking after you .         what a shame     said mr .  shine .     that will be sergeant detritus .  not good news  i suspect .  if i had to guess  i   d say that the trolls have sent around the taka taka .  you must go  mister vimes .  i   ll be seeing you again .         i don   t think i   ll see you     said vimes .  he stood up  and then hesitated .      one question  right .  and no funny answers  if you don   t mind     he said .     tell me why you helped brick .  why should you care about a slushed out gutter troll .         why should you care about some dead dwarfs .     said mr .  shine .      because someone has to .         exactly .  good bye  mr .  vimes .      vimes hurried up the stairs and followed miss pointer miss pickles out into the shop .  detritus was standing among the mineral specimens  looking uncomfortable  like a man in a morgue .      what   s happening .     said vimes .   detritus shifted uneasily .      sorry  mister vimes  but i was der only one dat knew where       he began .      yes  okay .  is this about the taka taka .         how did you know about dat  sir .         i don   t .  what is the taka taka .         it der famous war club of der trolls     said detritus .  vimes  with the image of the peace club of the trolls downstairs still in his mind  couldn   t stop himself .      you mean you subscribe and get a different war every month .     he said .  but that sort of thing was wasted on detritus .  he treated humor as some human aberration that had to be overcome by talking slowly and patiently .      no  sir .  when der taka taka is sent a round the clans  it a summon ing to war     he said .      oh damn .  koom valley .         yes  sir .  an    i   m hearing dat der low king and der uberwald dwarfs is already on der way to koom valley  too .  der street is full of it .         er   bingle bingle bingle    .     said a small and very nervous voice .   vimes pulled out the gooseberry and stared at it .  at a time like this        well .     he said .      it   s twenty nine minutes past five  insert name here     said the imp nervously .      so .         on foot  at this time of day  you will need to leave now to be home at six o   clock     said the imp .      der patrician want to see you and dere   s clackses arrivin    and everythin        said detritus insistently .   vimes continued to stare at the imp  which looked embarrassed .      i   m going home     he said  and started walking .  dark clouds were rolling in overhead  heralding another summer storm .      dey   ve foun    der three dwarfs near der well  sir     said detritus  lumbering after him .     looks like it was other dwarfs what killed    em  sure enough .  the ol    grags have gone .  captain carrot   s put guards on every exit he can find        but they dig  vimes thought .  who knows where all the tunnels go .         and he wants permission to break open der big iron doors in treacle street     detritus went on .     dey can get at the last dwarf dat way .         what are the dwarfs saying about it .     said vimes  over his shoulder .     the living ones  i mean .         a lot of dem saw the dead dwarfs brought up     said detritus .     i fink most of dem would hand him der crowbar .      let   s hear it for the mob  vimes thought .  grab it by its sentimental heart .  besides  the storm is beginning .  why worry about an extra raindrop .      okay     he said .     tell him this .  i know otto will be there with his damn picture box  so when that door is wrenched open  it   s going to be dwarfs doing it  okay .  a picture full of dwarfs .         right  sir .         how is young brick .  will he swear a statement .  does he understand about that .         i reckon he could  sir .         in front of dwarfs .         he will if i ask him  sir     said detritus .     dat i can promise .         good .  and get someone to put out a message on the clacks  to every city watch and village constable between here and the mountains .  tell them to look out for a party of dark dwarfs .  they   ve got what they came for and they   re doing a runner  i know it .         you want they should try to stop    em .     the sergeant asked .      no .  no one should try it .  say they   ve got weapons that shoot fire .  just let me know where they   re headed .         i   ll tell dem dat  sir .      and i   m going home  vimes repeated to himself .  everyone wants something from vimes  even though i   m not the sharpest knife in the drawer .  hell  i   m probably a spoon .  well  i   m going to be vimes  and vimes reads where   s my cow .  to young sam at six o   clock .  with the noises done right .   he went home at a brisk walk  using all the little shortcuts  his mind sloshing backwards and forwards like thin soup  his ribs nudging him occasionally to say yes  they were still here and twinging .  he arrived at the door just as willikins was opening it .      i shall tell her ladyship you are back  sir     he called out as vimes hurried up the stairs .     she is mucking out the dragon pens .      young sam was standing up in his cot  watching the door .  vimes   s day went soft and pink .   the chair was littered with the favored toys of the hour   a rag ball  a little hoop  a wooly snake with one button eye .  vimes pushed them onto the rug  sat down  and took off his helmet .  then he took off his damp boots .  you didn   t need to heat a room after sam vimes had taken his boots off .  on the wall  the nursery clock ticked  and with every tick and tock a little sheep jumped back and forth over a fence .   sam unfolded the rather chewed  rather soggy book .      where   s my cow .     he announced  and young sam chuckled .  rain rattled on the window .       where   s my cow .   is that my cow .        a    thing    that talks  he thought as his mouth and eyes took over the task at hand .  i   m going to have to find out about that .  why   d it make dwarfs want to kill one another .       it goes baa .   it is a sheep .        why did we go into that mine .  because we heard there   d been a murder  that   s why .       no  that   s not my cow .        everyone knows that dwarfs gossip .  it was stupid to tell them to keep it from us .   that   s the deep downers for you  they think they just have to say a thing and it   s true .       where   s my cow .        water dripping on a stone .       is that my cow .     where did i see one of those thud boards recently .       it goes naaaay .     oh  yes  helmclever .  he was very worried  wasn   t he .       it is a horse .     he had a board .  he said he was a keen player .       no  that   s not my cow .     that was a dwarf under pressure if ever i saw one  he looked as if he was dying to tell me something         where   s my cow .     that look in his eyes         is that my cow .     i was so angry .  don   t tell the watch .  what did they expect .  you   d have thought he would have known         it goes hruuugh .     he knew i   d go postal .       it is a hippopotamus .     he wanted me to be angry .       no  that   s not my cow .     he damn well wanted me to be angry .   vimes snorted and crowed his way through the rest of the zoo  missing out not one bark or squeak  and tucked up his son with a kiss .   there was the sound of tinkling glass from downstairs .  oh  someone   s dropped a glass  said his front brain .  but his back brain  which had steered him safely through these mean streets for more than fifty years  whispered  like hell they did .   purity would be up in her room .  cook had the evening off .  sybil was out feeding the dragons .  that left willikins .  butlers didn   t drop things .   from below  there was a quiet    ugh     and then the thud of something hitting meat .   and vimes   s sword was on the hook at the other end of the hall  because sybil didn   t like him wearing it in the house .   as quietly as possible  he sought around for something  anything  that could be turned into a weapon .  regrettably  they had  when choosing toys for young sam  completely neglected the whole area of hard things with sharp edges .  bunnies  chickies  and piggies there were in plenty  but   ah .  vimes spotted something that would do  and wrenched it free .   moving soundlessly on thick  over darned socks  he crept down the stairs .   the door to the wine cellar was open .  vimes didn   t drink these days  but guests did  and willikins  in accordance with some butlerian duty to generations only just or as yet unborn  cared for it and bought the occasional promising vintage .  was there the crackle of glass being trodden on .  okay  did the stairs creak .  he   d find out .   he reached the vaulted  damp cellar  and stepped carefully out of the light filtering down from the hall .   now he could smell it   the faint reek of black oil .   the little bastards .  and they could see in the dark  too  right .   he reached into his pocket and fumbled for his matches  while his heart thudded in his ears .  his fingers closed over a match  he took a deep breath     one hand grasped his wrist  and  as he swung madly at the darkness with the hind leg of a rocking horse  this  too  was wrested from him .  instinctively  he kicked out  and there was a grunt .  his arms were released  and from somewhere near the floor  the voice of willikins  rather strained  said     excuse me  sir  i appear to have walked into your foot .         willikins .  what the hell   s been happening .         some dwarfish gentlemen called while you were upstairs  sir     said the butler  unfolding slowly .     through the cellar wall  in fact .  i regret to say that i found it necessary to deal somewhat strictly with them .  i fear one might be dead .      vimes peered around .     might be dead .  is he still breathing .         i do not know  sir .     willikins applied a match  with great care  to a stub of candle .     i heard him gurgling  but he appears to have stopped .  i   m sorry to say that they came upon me when i was leaving the ice store  and i was forced to defend myself with the first thing that came to hand .         which was    .         the ice knife  sir     said willikins levelly .  he held up eighteen inches of sharp  serrated steel  designed to slice ice into convenient blocks .     the other gentleman i have lodged on a meat hook  sir .         you didn   t       vimes began  horrified .      only through his clothing  sir .  i am sorry to have laid hands on you  but i feared the wretched oil might have been inflammable .  i hope i got all of them .  i would like to take this opportunity to apologize for the mess        but vimes was gone and already halfway up the cellar steps .  in the hall  his heart stopped .   a short dark figure was at the top of the stairs and disappearing into the nursery .   the broad  stately staircase soared in front of him  a stairway to the top of the sky .  he ran up it  hearing himself screaming        i   ll kill i   ll killyoukillyoukillyoukillkillkill i   ll kill you kill i   llkill you       the terrible fury choked him  the rage and dreadful fear set his lungs on fire  and still the stairs unrolled .  there was no end to them .  they climbed forever  while he was falling backwards  into hell .  but hell buoyed him up  gave wings to his rage  lifted him  sent him back     and then  his breath now nothing more than one long  profane scream  he reached the top step     the dwarf came out of the nursery doorway  backwards and fast .  he hit the railings and crashed through them onto the floor below .  vimes ran on  sliding on the polished wood  skidding as he swung into the nursery  dreading the sight of        young sam  sleeping peacefully .  on the wall  the little lamb rocked the night away .   sam vimes picked up his son  wrapped in his blue blanket  and sagged to his knees .  he hadn   t drawn breath all the way up the stairs  and now his body cashed its checks  sucking in air and redemption in huge  racking sobs .  tears boiled out of him  shaking him wretchedly     through the running  wet blur  he saw something on the floor .  there  on the rug  was the rag ball  the hoop  and the wooly snake  lying where they   d fallen .   the ball had rolled  more or less  into the middle of the hoop .  the snake lay half uncoiled  its head resting on the edge of the circle .   together  in this weak nursery light  they looked at first glance like a big eye with a tail .      sir .  is everything all right .      vimes looked up and focused on the red face of willikins  out of breath .      er   yeah   what .    yeah   fine   thanks     he managed  summoning his scattered senses .     fine  willikins .  thank you .         one must   ve got past me in the dark           huh .  yeah  very remiss of you  then     said vimes  getting to his feet but still clutching his son to him .     i   d just bet most butlers    round here would have taken out all three with one swipe of their polishing cloth  right .         are you all right  sir .  because           but you went to the shamlegger school of butlering .     vimes giggled .  his knees were trembling .  part of him knew what this was all about .  after the terror came that drunken feeling  when you were still alive and suddenly everything was funny .     i mean  other butlers just know how to cut people dead with a look  but you  willikins  you know how to cut them dead with           listen  sir .  he   s got outside  sir .     said willikins urgently .     so is lady sybil .      vimes   s grin froze .      shall i take the young man  sir .     willikins said  reaching .   vimes backed away .  a troll with a crowbar and a tub of grease would not have wrested his son from him .      no .  but give me that knife .  and go and make sure purity is all right .      clutching young sam to him  he ran back downstairs  across the hall  and out into the garden .  it was stupid  stupid  stupid .  he told himself that later .  but right now sam vimes was thinking only in primary colors .  it had been hard  hard  to go into the nursery in the face of the images that thronged his imagination .  he was not going to go through that ever again .  and the rage flowed back  easily  under control now .  smooth like a river of fire .  he   d find them all  all of them  and they would burn     the main dragon shed could only be reached now by dodging around three big cast iron flame deflector shields  put in place two months ago  dragon breeding was not a hobby for sissies or people who minded having to repaint the whole side of the house occasionally .  there were big iron doors at either end  vimes headed toward one at random  ran into the dragon shed  and bolted the door behind him .   it was always warm in there  because the dragons burped all the time  it was that or explode  which occasionally did happen .  and there was sybil  in full dragon keeping gear  walking calmly between the pens with a bucket in each hand  and behind her the doors at the other end were opening  and there was a short  dark figure  and there was a rod with a little pilot flame on the end  and        look out .  behind you .     vimes yelled .   his wife stared at him  turned around  dropped the buckets  and started to shout something .   and then the flame blossomed .  it hit sybil in the chest  splashed across the pens  and went out abruptly .  the dwarf looked down and began to thump the pipe desperately .   the pillar of flame that was lady sybil said  in an authoritative voice that brooked no disobeying      lie down  sam .  right now .     and sybil dropped to the sandy floor as  all down the lines of pens  dragon heads rose on long dragon necks .   their nostrils were flaring .  they were breathing in .   they   d been challenged .  they   d been offended .  and they   d just had their supper .      good boys     said sybil  from the floor .   twenty six streams of answering dragon fire rose to the occasion .  vimes  lying on the floor so that his body shielded young sam  felt the hairs crisp on the back of his neck .   this wasn   t the smoky red of the dwarf fire  this was something only a dragon   s stomach could cook up .  the flames were practically invisible .  at least one of them must have hit the dwarf   s weapon  because there was an explosion and something went through the roof .  the dragon pens were built like a fireworks factory  the walls were very thick  and the roof was as thin as possible  to provide a faster exit to heaven .   when the noise had died to an excited hiccuping  vimes risked looking up .  sybil was also getting to her feet  a little clumsily  because of all the special clothing every dragon breeder wore .    the iron of the far doors glowed around the black outline of a dwarf .  a little way in front of them  two iron boots were cooling from white heat in a puddle of molten sand .   metal went plink .   lady sybil reached up with heavy gloved hands  patted out some patches of burning oil on her leather apron  and lifted off her helmet .  it landed on the sand with a thud .      oh  sam       she said softly .      are you all right .  young sam is fine .  we   ve got to get out of here .         oh  sam           sybil  i need you to take him .     vimes said  speaking slowly and clearly to get through the shock .     there could be others out there .      lady sybil   s eyes focused .      give him to me     she ordered .     and you take raja .      vimes looked where she was indicating .  a young dragon with floppy ears and an expression of mildly concussed good humor blinked at him .  he was a golden wouter  a breed with a flame so strong that one of them had once been used by thieves to melt their way into a bank vault .   vimes picked him up carefully  and still winced .  ye gods  the ache in his hand had gone all the way to the elbow        coal him up     sybil commanded .   good old sybil  he told himself as he fed anthracite into raja   s eager gullet .  her female forebears had valiantly backed up their husbands as distant embassies were besieged  had given birth on a camel back or in the shade of a stricken elephant  had handed around little gold wrapped chocolates while trolls were trying to break into the compound  or had merely stayed at home and nursed such bits of husbands and sons that made it back from endless little wars .  the result was a species of woman who  when duty called  turned into solid steel .   vimes flinched as raja burped .      that was a dwarf  wasn   t it .     said sybil  cradling young sam .     one of those deep down ones you see about .         yes .         why did it try to kill me .      when people are trying to kill you  it means you   re doing something right .  it was a rule sam had lived by .  but this   even a real stone killer like chrysophrase wouldn   t have tried something like this .  it was insane .  they will burn .  they will burn        i think they   re frightened of what i   m going to find out     said vimes .     i think it   s all gone wrong for them  and they want to stop me .      could they have been that stupid .  he wondered .  a dead wife .  a dead child .  could they think that would mean for one moment that i   d stop .  as it is  when i catch up with whoever ordered this  and i will  i hope there   s someone there to hold me back .   they will burn for what they did .      oh  sam       murmured sybil  the iron mast falling for a moment .      i   m sorry .  i never expected this     said vimes .  he put the dragon down and held her carefully  almost fearfully .  the rage had been so strong  he felt he might grow spikes  or snap into shards .  and the headache was coming back  like a lump of lead nailed just over his eyes .      whatever happened to all that  you know  hi ho  hi ho  and being kind to poor lost orphans in the forest  sam .     sybil whispered .      willikins is in the house     he said .     purity is as well .         let   s go and find them  then     said sybil .  she grinned  a little damply .     i wish you wouldn   t bring your work home with you  sam .         this time it followed me     said vimes grimly .     but i intend to tidy it up  believe me .      they shall bur   no .  they shall be hunted down to any hole they hide in and brought back to face justice .  unless  oh please .   they resist arrest     purity was standing in the hall  alongside willikins .  she was holding a trophy klatchian sword  without much conviction .  the butler had augmented his weaponry with a couple of meat cleavers  which he hefted with a certain worrying expertise .      my gods  man  you   re covered in blood .     sybil burst out .      yes  your ladyship     said willikins smoothly .     may i say in mitigation that it is not  in fact  mine .         there was a dwarf in the dragon house     said vimes .     any sign of any others .         no  sir .  the ones in the cellar had an apparatus for projecting fire  sir .         the dwarf we saw had one too     said vimes  adding     it didn   t do him any good .         indeed  sir .  i apprised myself of its use  sir  and tested my understanding by firing it down the tunnel they had arrived by until it ran out of igniferous juice  sir .  just in case there were more .  it is for this reason  i suspect  that the shrubbery at number five is on fire .      vimes hadn   t met willikins when they were both young .  the cockbill street roaring lads had a treaty with shamlegger street  thus allowing them to ignore that flank while they concentrated on stopping the territorial aggression of the pigsty hill dead marmoset gang .  he was glad he hadn   t fetched up against young willikins .      they must have come up for air there     he said .     the jeffersons are on holiday .         well  if they   re not ready for that sort of thing  they shouldn   t be growing rhododendrons     said sybil matter of factly .     what now  sam .         we   re staying the night at pseudopolis yard     said vimes .     don   t argue .         ramkins have never run away from anything     sybil declared .      vimeses have run like hell all the time     said vimes  too diplomatic to mention the aforesaid ancestors who came home in pieces .     that means you fight where you want to fight .  we   re all going to go and get the coach  and we   re all going down to the yard .  when we   re there  i   ll send people back to pick up our stuff .  just for one night  all right .         what would you like me to do with the visitors  sir .     said willikins  with a sidelong glance at lady sybil .     one is indeed dead  i am afraid .  if you recall  i must have stabbed him with the ice knife i happened to be innocently holding  having been cutting ice for the kitchen     he added  poker faced .      put him on the roof of the coach     said vimes .      the other one also appears to be dead  sir .  i   d swear he was fine when i tied him up  sir  because he was cursing me in their lingo .         you didn   t tie him up too hard  did       vimes began  and gave up on it .  if willikins wanted someone dead  he wouldn   t have taken a prisoner .  it must have been a surprise  breaking into a cellar and meeting something like willikins .  anyway  to hell with them .      just   died .     he said .      yes  sir .  do dwarfs naturally salivate green .         what .         there is green around his mouth  sir .  could be a clue  in my opinion .         all right  put him on the roof of the coach  too .  let   s go  shall we .      vimes had to insist that sybil traveled on the inside .  usually  she got her own way and he was happy to give it to her  but the unspoken agreement was that when he really insisted  she listened .  it   s a married couple thing .   vimes rode beside willikins  and got him to stop halfway down the hill where a man was selling the evening edition of the times  still damp from the press .   the picture on the front page was of a mob of dwarfs .  they were pulling open one of the mine   s big  round metal doors  it was hanging off its hinges .  in the middle of the group  hands gripping the edge of the frame and muscles bulging  was captain carrot .  gleaming  with his shirt off .   vimes grunted happily  folded up the paper  and lit a cheroot .  the shaking in his legs was barely noticeable now  the fires of that terrible rage banked but still glowing .      a free press  willikins .  you just can   t beat it     he said .      i   ve often heard you remark as much  sir     said willikins .       the entity slithered through the rainy streets .  confounded again .   it was getting through  it knew it .  it was being heard .  and yet every time it tried to follow the words  it was thrown back .  bars had blocked its way  doors that had been open locked themselves as it approached .  and what was this .  some kind of low class soldier .  by now it would have had berserkers biting their shields in half .   that was not the main problem  though .  it was being watched .  and that had never happened before .       there was a crowd of dwarfs milling around outside the yard .  they did not look belligerent   that is to say  any more than a species the members of which  by custom and practice  wear a big heavy helmet  mail  iron boots  and carry an axe all the time can fail to look belligerent   but they did look lost and bewildered and unsure why they were there .   vimes got willikins to drive in through the coach arch and take the bodies of the attackers down to igor  who knew about things like people dying with green mouths .   sybil  purity  and young sam were hustled away to a clean office .  interesting thing  vimes thought as he watched cheery and a group of dwarf officers fuss over the child  even now   in fact  especially now  given the way the tension had made everyone revert to old certainties   he wasn   t sure how many female dwarf officers he had .  it was a brave female dwarf who advertised the fact  in a society where the wearing of even a decent  floor length leather and chain mail dress instead of leggings positioned you on the moral map at the far side of tawneee and her hardworking coworkers at the pussycat club .  but introduce a gurgling kid into the room  and you could spot them instantly  for all their fearsome clang and beards you could lose a rat in .   carrot pushed his way through the crowd and saluted .      a lot   s been happening  sir .         my word  has it .     said vimes  with manic brightness .      yessir .  everyone was pretty   angry when we brought the dead dwarfs up  and what with one thing and another  opening the big door in treacle street was pretty popular .  all the deep downers have gone  except one           that   d be helmclever     said vimes  heading for his office .   carrot looked surprised .     that   s right  sir .  he   s in a cell .  i   d like you to have a look at him  if you don   t mind .  he was crying and moaning and trembling in a corner  with lit candles all    round him .         more candles .  afraid of the dark .     vimes suggested .      could be  sir .  igor says the trouble   s in his head .         don   t let igor try to give him a new one .     said vimes quickly .     i   ll go down there as soon as i can .         i   ve tried talking to him  but he just looks blank  sir .  how did you know he was the one we found .         i   ve got some edges and some bits that are an interesting shape     said vimes  sitting down at his desk .  when carrot looked blank  he went on     of the jigsaw puzzle  captain .  but there are lots of bits of sky .  however  i think i might be nearly there  because i think i   ve been handed a corner .  what talks underground .         sir .         you know  the dwarfs were listening for something underground .  you wondered if someone was trapped  right .  but is there   i don   t know   something dwarf made that talks .      carrot   s brow wrinkled .      you   re not talking about a cube  are you  sir .         i don   t know .  am i .  you tell me .         the deep downers have some in their mine  sir  but i   m sure there   s none buried here .  they   re generally found in hard rocks .  anyway  you wouldn   t listen for one .  i   ve never heard of them talking when they are found .  some dwarfs have spent years learning how to use just one of them .         good .  now  what is a cube .     said vimes  glancing at his in tray .  oh  good .  there weren   t any memos from a .  e .  pessimal .      it   s  um   it   s like a book  sir .  which talks .  a bit like your gooseberry  i suppose .  most of them contain interpretations of dwarf lore by ancient lawmasters .  it   s very old   magic  i suppose .         suppose .     said vimes .      well  technomantic devices look like things that are built  you know  out of           captain  you   ve lost me again .  what are devices and why do you pronounce the capital d .         cubes are a type of device  sir .  no one knows who made them or for what original purpose .  they might be older than the world .  they   ve been found in volcanoes and the deepest rocks .  the deep downers have most of them .  they come in all sorts of           hold on  you mean that when they   re dug up  there   s dwarf voices from millions of years ago .  surely dwarfs haven   t been           no  sir .  dwarfs put them on later .  i   m not too well up on this .  i think when they   re first found  they mostly have natural noises  like moving water or birdsong or rocks moving  that sort of thing .  the grags found out how to get rid of those to make room for words  i think .  i did hear about one that was the sounds of a forest .  ten million years of sounds  in a cube less than two inches across .         and they   re valuable  these things .         unbelievably valuable  especially the cubes .  worth mining through a mountain of granite  as we say   er  that   s a dwarf    we     not a copper    we     sir .         so  digging through a few thousand of tons of ankh morpork muck would be worth it  then .         for a cube .  yes .  is that what all this is about .  but how would it get here .  the average dwarf might never see one in his whole life .  only grags and great chieftains use them .  and why would it be talking .  all dwarf ones can only be brought to life by a key word .         search me .  what do they look like .  apart from being cubical  i assume .         i   ve only ever seen a few  sir .  they   re  oh  up to six inches on a side  look like old bronze  and they glitter .         green and blue .     said vimes sharply .      yes  sir .  they had a few in the mine in treacle street .         i think i saw them     said vimes .     and i think they   ve got one more .  voices from the past  eh .  how come i   ve never heard of them before .      carrot hesitated .     you   re a very busy man  sir .  you can   t know everything .      vimes detected just a soup  on of a smidgen of a reproach there .      are you saying i   m a man of narrow horizons  captain .         oh no  sir .  you   re interested in every aspect of police work and criminology .      sometimes it was impossible to read captain carrot   s face .  vimes didn   t bother to try .      i   m missing something     he said .     but this is about koom valley  i know it .  look  what is the secret of koom valley .         i don   t know  sir .  i don   t think there is one .  i suppose the big secret would be which side attacked first .  you know  sir  both sides say they were ambushed by the other side .         does that sound very interesting to you .     said vimes .     would it matter much now .         who started it all .  i should say so  sir .     said carrot .      but i thought they   d been scrapping since time began .         yes .  but koom valley was the first official one  sir .         who won .     said vimes .      sir .         it   s not a difficult question  is it .  who won the first battle of koom valley .         i suppose you could say it was rained off  sir     said carrot .      they stopped a grudge march like that because of a bit of rain .         for a lot of rain  sir .  a thunderstorm just sat there in the mountains above it .  there were flash floods  full of boulders .  the fighters were knocked off their feet and washed away  some were struck by lightning           it quite ruined the whole day     said vimes .     all right  captain  do we have any idea where the bastards have gone .         they had an escape tunnel           i bet they did .            and collapsed it after them .  i   ve got men digging           stand them down .  they could be in a safe house  they could have got out in a cart  hell  they could all be wearing helmets and chain mail and passing for city dwarfs .  enough of that .  we   ve been running people ragged .  let them go for now .  i think we   ll be able to find them again .         yes  sir .  the grags left so fast  sir  that they left some other devices .  i have secured them for the city .  they must have been very frightened .  they just took the cubes and ran .  are you all right  sir .  you look a bit flustered .         actually  captain  i feel inexplicably cheerful .  would you like to hear how my day went .          the showers in the watch house were the talk of the city .  vimes had paid for them himself  after vetinari made an acidic comment about the cost .  they were a bit primitive and were really no more than watering can heads connected to a couple of water tanks on the next floor  but after a night in ankh morpork   s underworld  the thought of being really clean was very attractive .  even so  angua hesitated .      this is wonderful     said sally  turning gently under a spray .     what   s wrong .         look  i   m just dealing with it  all right .     snapped angua  standing just beyond the spray .     it   s full moon  okay .  the wolf is a bit strong .      sally stopped scrubbing .      oh  i see     she said .     is it the whole b . a . t . h .  thing .         you just had to say that  didn   t you     said angua  and forced herself to step onto the tiles .      well  what do you do normally .     said sally  handing her the soap .      cold water  and pretend it   s rain .  don   t you dare laugh .  change of subject  right now .         all right .  what did you think of nobby   s girlfriend .     said sally .      tawneee .  friendly .  good looking           try perfect physical beauty .  astonishing proportions .  a walking classic .         well   yes .  pretty much     angua conceded .      and all that is nobby nobbs   s girlfriend .         she seems to think so .         you   re not telling me she deserves nobby .     said sally .      look  verity pushpram doesn   t deserve nobby  and she   s got a weird squint  arms like a stevedore  and cooks shellfish for a living     said angua .     that   s how things are .         is she his old girlfriend .         he used to say so .  as far as i know  the physical side of the relationship consisted of her hitting him with a wet fish whenever he went near her .      angua squeezed the last of the slime out of her hair .  it was tough stuff to loose .  as it was  some of it was fighting not to go down the plug hole .   that was enough .  she didn   t like to spend too much time in the s . h . o . w . e . r .  another six or so sessions  and the smell would have quite gone away .  the important thing now was to remember to use a towel and not to shake herself dry .      you think i went down there to impress captain carrot  don   t you     said sally  behind her .   angua stopped  her head wrapped in toweling .  oh well  it was going to happen sooner or later        no     she said .      your heartbeat says otherwise     sally said meekly .     don   t worry .  i wouldn   t have a chance .  his heart beats faster every time he looks at you  and yours skips a beat every time you see him .      okay  then  this is it  said the wolf who was never far away  this is where we sort it out  claw against fang   no .  don   t listen to the wolf .  but it would help  wouldn   t it  if this stupid bitch stopped listening to the bat        stay out of people   s hearts     she growled .      i can   t .  you can   t switch off your nose  can you .  can you .      the moment of the wolf had passed .  angua relaxed a little .  his heart beat faster  did it .      no     she said .     i can   t .         has he ever seen you without your uniform .      ye gods  thought angua  and headed for her clothes .      well   of course       she mumbled .      i meant wearing something else .  like   a dress .     sally went on .     come on .  every copper spends some time out of uniform .  that   s how you know you   re off duty .         but it   s pretty much a      job for us .     said angua     there   s always           you mean it is for him  because he likes it that way  and so you go along with it .     said the vampire  and that one got through all angua   s defenses .      it   s my life .  why should i listen to advice from a vampire .         because you   re a werewolf     said sally .     only a vampire would dare to give it  right .  you don   t have to be at his heel all the time .         look  i   ve been through all this  understand .  it   s a werewolf thing .  we are what we are .         i   m not .  you don   t get the black ribbon just for signing the pledge  you know .  and it doesn   t mean you stop craving blood .  you just don   t do anything about it .  at least you can go out at night and chase chickens .      there was a stony silence .  then angua said     you know about the chickens .         yes .         i pay for them  you know .         i   m sure you do .         and it   s not as though it   s every night .         i   m sure it isn   t .  look  do you know there are people out there who will volunteer to be a vampire   s   dinner companion .  providing it   s all done with style .  and we are considered weird .     she sniffed .     by the way  what did you wash your hair in .         willard brothers    good girl .     flea shampoo     said angua .     it brings out the gloss     she added defensively .     look  i want to get this clear  right .  just because we spent hours wading around under the city  and  okay  maybe saved each other   s lives once or twice  it does not mean we   re friends  okay .  we just happened to   be there at the same time .         you do need some time off     said sally .     i was going to buy a drink for tawneee anyway  to say thanks  and cheery wants to tag along .  how about it .  we   ve been stood down for now .  time out for a little fun .      angua struggled with a seething snake   s nest of emotions .  tawneee had been very kind  and far more helpful than you might expect from someone wearing six inches of heel and four square inches of clothing .      come on     said sally encouragingly .     i don   t know about you  but it   s going to take a bit of effort to get the taste of that mud out of my mouth .         oh  all right .  but this doesn   t mean we   re bonding .         fine .  fine .         i   m not a bondage kind of person     angua added .      yes  yes     said sally .     i can see that .          vimes sat and stared at his notebook .  he   d got    talking cube    written down and circled .   out of the corner of his ear  he could hear the sounds of the city watch rising from below  the bustle in the yard of the old lemonade factory  where the specials were assembling again  just in case  the rattle of the hurry up wagon  the general murmur of voices coming up through the floor     after some thinking  he wrote    old well    and circled that  too .   he   d scrumped plums in the gardens of empirical crescent with all the other kids .  half the houses were empty  and no one cared much .  yes  there had been a well  but it had long been full up to the top with garbage  even then .  grass was growing on the top .  they only found the bricks because they looked for them .   so  let   s say that anything buried right at the bottom  where the dwarfs had headed  had been dumped  oh  more than fifty  sixty years ago     you seldom saw a dwarf in ankh morpork even forty years ago  and they weren   t anything like rich or powerful enough to own a cube .  they were hard workers  seeking   just possibly   a better life .  so  what human would throw away a talking box worth a mountain of gold .  he   d have to be bloody mad     vimes sat rigidly  staring at the scrawls on the page .  in the distance  detritus was barking a command at someone .   he felt like a man crossing a river on stepping stones .  he was nearly halfway across  but the next stone was just a bit too far and could only be reached with serious groinal stress .  nevertheless  his foot was waving in the air  and it was that or a soaking     he wrote     rascal .     then he circled the word several times  the pencil biting into the cheap paper .   rascal must have been to koom valley .  let   s say he found a cube there  who knows how .  just lying there .  anyway  he brings it home .  he paints his picture and goes mad  but somewhere along  the cube starts talking to him .   vimes wrote    special word .     he drew a circle around it so hard that his pencil broke .   maybe he can   t find the word for    stop talking    .  anyway  he chucks it down a well     he tried to write    did rascal ever live in empirical crescent .      and then gave up and tried to remember it .   anyway   then he dies and  afterwards  this damn book is written .  it doesn   t sell many copies  but recently it   s republished and   ah  but now there   re lots of dwarfs in the city .  some of them read it  and something tells them that the secret is in this cube .  they want to find out where it is .  how .  damn .  doesn   t the book say the secret of koom valley is in the painting .  okay .  maybe he   somehow painted some kind of code into the painting to say where the cube was .  but so what .  what was so bad to hear that you killed the poor devils who heard it .   i think i   m looking at this wrong .  it   s not my cow .  it   s a sheep with a pitchfork .  unfortunately  it goes quack .   he was getting lost now  going all over the place  but he   d got a toe on the opposite stone and he felt he made some progress .  but to what  exactly .   i mean  what would really happen if there was real proof that  say  the dwarfs ambushed the trolls .  nothing that isn   t happening already  that   s what .  you can always find an excuse that your side will accept  and who cares what the enemy thinks .  in the real world  it wouldn   t make any difference .   there was a very faint knock at the door  the sort that you use if you secretly hope it won   t be answered .  vimes sprang from his chair and pulled it open .   a .  e .  pessimal stood there .      ah  a .  e .      said vimes  going back to his desk and laying down his pencil .     come on in .  what can i do for you .  how   s the arm .         er   could you spare a moment of your time  your grace .      your grace  thought vimes .  well  he hadn   t the heart to object  this time .   he sat down again .  a .  e .  pessimal was still wearing the chain mail shirt with the specials badge on it .  he didn   t look very shiny .  brick   s swipe had bowled him across the plaza like a ball .      er       a .  e .  pessimal began .      you   ll have to start as a lance constable  but a man of your talents ought to make it to sergeant within a year .  and you can have your own office     said vimes .   a .  e .  pessimal shut his eyes .     how did you know .     he breathed .      you attacked a boozed up troll with your teeth     said vimes .        there   s a man born for the badge     i thought to myself .      and that   s what you   ve always wanted  right .  but you were always too small  too weak  too shy to be a watchman .  i can buy big and strong anywhere .  right now i need a man who knows how to hold a pencil without breaking it .      you   ll be my adjutant     he went on .     you   ll handle all my paperwork .  you   ll read the reports  you   ll try to figure out what   s important .  and so you can learn what is important  you   ll have to do at least two patrols a week .      a tear was running down a .  e .  pessimal   s cheek .     thank you  your grace     he said hoarsely .   if a .  e .  pessimal had enough chest to stick out  it would be sticking .      of course  you   ll need to finish your report on the watch first     vimes added .     that is a matter between you and his lordship .  and now  if you will excuse me  i really must get on .  i look forward to seeing you working for me  lance constable pessimal .         thank you  your grace .         oh  and you won   t call me    your grace         said vimes .  he thought for a moment  and decided that the man had earned this  all in one go  and added         mister vimes    will do .      and so we make progress  he said to himself  after a .  e .  pessimal had floated away .  and his lordship won   t like it  so  as far as i can see  there   s no downside .  quis custodiet ipsos custodes  er  qui custodes custodient .  was that right for    who watches the watcher that watches the watchmen    .  probably not .  still   your move  my lord .   he was just puzzling over his notebook again when the door opened without an introductory knock .   sybil entered  with a plate .      you   re not eating enough  sam     she announced .     and the canteen here is a disgrace .  it   s all grease and garbage .         that   s what the men like  i   m afraid     said vimes guiltily .      i   ve cleaned out the tar in the tea urn  at least     sybil went on  with satisfaction .      you cleaned out the tea urn .     said vimes in a hollow voice .  it was like being told that someone had wiped the patina off a fine old work of art .      yes  it was like tar in there .  there really wasn   t much proper food in the store  but i managed to make you a bacon  lettuce  and tomato sandwich .         thank you  dear .     vimes cautiously lifted a corner of the bread with his broken pencil .  there seemed to be too much lettuce  which was to say  there was some lettuce .      there   s a lot of dwarfs come to see you  sam     said sibyl  as if this was preying on her mind .   vimes stood up so fast that his chair fell over .      is young sam all right .     he said .      yes  sam .  they   re city dwarfs .  you know them all  i think .  they say they want to talk to you about        but vimes was already clattering down the stairs  drawing his sword as he did so .   the dwarfs were clustered nervously by the duty sergeant   s desk .  they had that opulence of metalwork  sleekness of beard  and thickness of girth that marked them out as dwarfs who were doing very well for themselves  or who had been right up until now .   vimes appeared in front of them like a whirlwind of wrath .   you scum  you rat sucking little worm eaters .  you heads down little scurriers in the dark .  what did you bring to my city .  what were you thinking .  did you want the deep downers here .  did you dare deplore what hamcrusher said  all that bile and ancient lies .  or did you say     well  i don   t agree with him  of course  but he   s got a point    .  did you say     oh  he goes too far  but it   s about time somebody said it    .  and now have you come here to wring your hands and say how dreadful  it was nothing to do with you .  who were the dwarfs in the mobs  then .  aren   t you community leaders .  were you leading them .  and why are you here now  you ugly  sniveling grubbers .  is it possible  is it possible  that now  after that bastard   s bodyguards tried to kill my family  you   re here to complain .  have i broken some code  trodden on some ancient toe .  to hell with it .  to hell with you .   he could feel the words straining  fighting to get out  and the effort of restraining them filled his stomach with acid and made his temples throb .  just one whine  he thought .  just one pompous moan .  go on .      well .     he demanded  rubbing his aching hand .   the dwarfs have perceptibly moved backwards .  vimes wondered if they   d read his thoughts  they   d echoed in his brain loudly enough .   a dwarf cleared his throat .     commander vimes       he began .      you   re pors strongingthearm  aren   t you .     vimes demanded .     one half of burleigh   stronginthearm .  you make crossbows .         yes  commander  and           remove your weapons .  all of them .  all of you .     vimes snapped .   the room fell silent .  out of the corner of his eye  vimes saw a couple of dwarf officers  who had at least been pretending to be engaged in paperwork  rising from their seats .   he was being dangerously stupid  part of him knew  but right now he wanted to hurt a dwarf and he wasn   t allowed to do it with steel .  most of the battle stuff they wore was simply for clang in any case  but a dwarf would sooner drop his drawers than put aside his axe .  and these were serious city dwarfs  with seats in the guilds and everything .  ye gods  he was going too far .   he managed to grunt     all right  keep your battle axes .  leave everything else at the desk .  you   ll get a receipt .      for a moment  quite a long moment  he thought  no  he hoped they would refuse .  but one of them  somewhere in the group  said     i think we must do this for the commander .  these are difficult times .  we must learn to fit them .      vimes went up to his office  hearing the clinks and clangs behind him  and landed so violently in his chair that this time a wheel snapped off .  the receipt was a nasty touch .  he was quite pleased with it .   on his desk  on a little stand that sybil had made for it  was his official baton of office .  it was  in fact  the same size as the ordinary coppers    truncheons  but turned out of rosewood and silver instead of lignum vitae or oak .  it still had plenty of weight  though .  certainly enough to leave the words protecter of thee kinge   s piece printed back to front on a dwarf skull .   the dwarfs were ushered in  looking slightly less heavy .   just one word  vimes thought as the acid swirled .  one damn word .  go on .  just breathe wrong .      very well  what can i do for you .     he said .      uh  i   m sure you know all of us     pors began  trying to smile .      probably .  the dwarf next to you is grabpot thundergust  who has just launched the new ladies    secrets range of perfumes and cosmetics .  my wife uses your stuff all the time .      thundergust  in traditional chain mail  a three horned helmet  and with an enormous axe strapped across his back  gave vimes an embarrassed nod .  vimes   s gaze moved on .      and you are setha ironcrust  proprietor of the chain of bakeries of the same name  and you are surely gimlet gimlet  owner of two famous dwarf delicatessens and the newly opened yo rat .  in attic bee street .     vimes looked around the office  dwarf after dwarf  until he got back to the front row and a dwarf of fairly modest dress by dwarf standards  who had been watching him intently .  vimes had a good memory for faces  and had seen this one recently  but couldn   t place it .  perhaps it had been behind a well flung halfbrick        you  i don   t think i know     he said .      oh  we haven   t exactly been introduced  commander     said the dwarf cheerfully .     but i   m very interested in the theory of games .         or mr .  shine   s thud academy .  vimes thought .  the dwarf   s voice sounded like the one that had  he   d admit it  been of diplomatic help downstairs .  he wore a simple  plain  round helmet  a plain leather shirt with some basic mail on it  and his beard was clipped to something tidier than the general dwarfish gorse bush effect .  compared to the other dwarfs  this one looked   streamlined .  vimes couldn   t even see an axe .      indeed .     he said .     well  in fact  i don   t play    em  so what   s your name .         bashfull bashfullsson  commander .  grag bashfullsson .      quietly  vimes picked up his truncheon and rolled it in his fingers .      not underground  then .     he said .      some of us move on  sir .  some of us think that darkness isn   t a depth  it   s a state of mind .         that   s nice of you     said vimes .  oh  friendly and forward looking  are we now .  where were you yesterday .  but now i   ve got all the aces .  those bastards murdered four city dwarfs .  they broke into my home  tried to kill my wife .  and now they   ve had it away on their toes .  wherever they   ve gone  they   re going dow   coming up .   he put the truncheon back on its stand .     as i said  what can i do for you   gentlemen .      he got the sense that they were all turning  physically or mentally  to bashfullsson .  i see  he thought  it seems that what we have here is a dozen monkeys and one organ grinder  eh .      how can we help you  commander .     said the grag .   vimes stared .  you could have stopped them  that   s how you could have helped .  don   t give me those somber faces .  maybe you didn   t say    yes    but you sure as hell didn   t say    no .     loud enough .  i owe you not one damned thing .  don   t come to me for your bloody absolution .      right now .  by going out into the street  walking up to the biggest troll you can see  and shaking him warmly by the hand  maybe .     said vimes .     or just going out into the street .  quite frankly  i   m busy  gentlemen  and the middle of a horse race is not the time to be mending fences .         they   ll be heading for the mountains     said bashfullsson .     they   ll steer clear of uberwald and lancre .  they won   t be sure of meeting friends there .  that means going into the mountains via llamedos .  lots of caves there .      vimes shrugged .      we can see you   re annoyed  mister vimes     said stronginthearm .     but we           i   ve got two dead assassins in the morgue     said vimes .     one of    em died of poison .  what do you know about that .  and i   m commander vimes  thank you .         it   s said they take a slow poison before they go on an important mission     said bashfullsson .      no turning back  eh .     said vimes .     well  that   s interesting .  but it   s the living that concern me right now .     he stood up .     i have to go and see a dwarf in the cells who does not want to talk to me .         ah  yes .  that would be helmclever     said bashfullsson .     he was born here  commander  but went off to study the mountains more than three months ago  against his parents    wishes .  i   m sure he never intended anything like this .  he was trying to find himself .         well  he can start looking in my cells     said vimes crisply .      may i be there when you question him .     said the grag .      why .         well  for one thing  it may prevent rumors that he was mistreated .         or start them .     said vimes .  who watches the watchmen .  he asked himself .  me .   bashfullsson gave him a cool look .     it could   calm the situation  sir .         i don   t habitually beat up prisoners  if that   s what you   re suggesting     said vimes .      and i am sure you would not wish to do so tonight .      vimes opened his mouth to shout the grag out of the building  and stopped .   because the cheeky little sod had got it right slap bang on the money .  vimes had been on the edge since leaving the house .  he   d felt a tingling across his skin  and a tightness in his gut  and a sharp  nasty little headache .  someone was going to pay for all this   this   this thisness  and it didn   t need to be a screwed up bit player like helmclever .   and he was not certain  not certain at all  what he   d do if the prisoner gave him any lip or tried to be smart .  beating people up in little rooms   he knew where that led .  and if you did it for a good reason  you   d do it for a bad one .  you couldn   t say    we   re the good guys    and do bad guy things .  sometimes the watching watchman inside every good copper   s head could use an extra pair of eyes .   justice had to be seen to be done  so he   d see it done up good and proper .      gentlemen     he said  keeping his eye on the grag but talking to the room at large     i know all of you  you all know me .  you   re all respected dwarfs with a stake in this city .  i want you to vouch for mr .  bashfullsson  because i   ve never met him before in my life .  come on  gimlet  i   ve known you for years  what do you say .         they killed my son     said ironcrust .   a knife dropped into vimes   s head .  it slipped down his wind pipe  sliced his heart  cut through his stomach  and disappeared .  where the rage had been  there was a chill .      i   m sorry  commander     said bashfullsson quietly .     it   s true .  i don   t think gunder ironcrust was interested in the politics  you understand .  he just took a job at the mine because he wanted to feel like a real dwarf and work with a shovel for a few days .         they left him to the mud     said ironcrust  in a voice that was eerily without emotion .     any help you need  we will give .  any help .  but when you find them  kill them all .      vimes could think of nothing more to say than    i will catch them .     he didn   t say  kill them .  no .  not if they surrender  not if they don   t come at me armed .  i know where that leads .      then we will leave and let you get about your business     said stronginthearm .     grag bashfullsson is known to us  indeed .  a little modern  perhaps .  a little young .  not the kind of grag we grew up with  but   yes  we   d vouch for him .  good night  commander .      vimes stared at his desk as they filed out .  when he looked up  the grag was still there  with a patient little smile .      you don   t look like a grag .  you look like just another dwarf     said vimes .     why haven   t i heard of you .         because you are a policeman  perhaps .     said bashfullsson meekly .      okay  i take the point .  but you   re not a deep downer .      bashfullsson shrugged .     i can think deep thoughts .  i was born here  commander  just like helmclever .  i don   t believe i need a mountain over my head in order to be a dwarf .      vimes nodded .  a local lad  not some mountain graybeard .  got a quick brain  too .  no wonder the leaders like him .     all right  mr .  bashfullsson  you can tag along     he said .     but it   s on two conditions  okay .  condition one  you   ve got five minutes to lay your hands on a thud set .  i think you can do that .         i think i can  too     said the dwarf  smiling faintly .     and the other condition .         how long will it take you to teach me to play .     said vimes .      you .  you   ve never played it at all .         no .  a certain troll showed me the game a little while ago  but i   ve never played games since i grew up .  i used to be good at tiddley rats  when i was a nipper  though .         well  a few hours should be       bashfullsson began .      we don   t have time     said vimes .     you   ve got ten minutes .          the drinking had started in the bucket  in gleam street .  this was the coppers    pub .  mr .  cheese  the owner  understood about coppers .  they liked to drink somewhere where they wouldn   t see anything that reminded them they were a copper .  fun was not encouraged .   it was tawneee who suggested that they moved to thank gods it   s open .   angua wasn   t really in the mood  but she hadn   t the heart to say no .  the plain fact was that while tawneee had a body that every other woman should hate her for  she compounded the insult by actually being very likable .  this was because she had the self esteem of a caterpillar and  as you found out after any kind of conversation with her  about the same amount of brain .  perhaps it all balanced out  perhaps some kindly god had said to her     sorry  kid  you are going to be thicker than a yard of lard  but the good news is  that   s not going to matter .      and she had a stomach made of iron  too .  angua found herself wondering how many hopeful men had died trying to drink her under the table .  alcohol didn   t seem to go to her brain at all .  maybe it couldn   t find it .  but she was pleasant  easygoing company  if you avoided allusion  irony  sarcasm  repartee  satire  and words longer than    chicken .      angua was tetchy because she was dying for a beer  but the young man behind the bar thought that    a pint of winkles    was the name of a cocktail .  given the drinks on offer  perhaps this was not surprising .      what .     said angua  reading the menu     is a screaming orgasm .         ah     said sally     looks like we got to you just in time  girl .         no     sighed angua as the others laughed  that was such a vampire response .     i mean what   s it made of .            almont    wahlulu  bearhuggers whiskey cream  and vodka     said tawneee  who knew the recipe for every cocktail ever made .      and how does it work .     said cheery  craning to see over the top of the bar .   sally ordered four  and turned back to tawneee .      so   you and nobby nobbs  eh .     she said .     how about that .     three sets of ears flared .   the other thing you got used to in the presence of tawneee was silence .  everywhere she went  went quiet .  oh  and the stares .  the silent stares .  and sometimes  in the shadows  a sigh .  there were goddesses who   d kill to look like tawneee .      he   s nice     said tawneee .     he makes me laugh and he keeps his hands to himself .      three faces locked in expressions of concentrated thought .  in angua   s case  one was  this is nobby we   re talking about .  there are so many questions that we are not going to ask .      has he shown you the tricks he can do with his spots .     she said .      yes .  i thought i   d widdle myself .  he   s so funny .      angua stared into her drink .  cheery coughed .  sally studied the menu .      and he   s very dependable     said tawneee .  and  as if dimly aware that this was still not sufficient  she added sadly     if you must know  he   s the first boy who   s ever asked me out .      sally and angua breathed out together .  light dawned .  ah  that was the problem .  and this one   s a baaaad case .      i mean  my hair   s all over the place  my legs are too long  and i know my bosom is far too       tawneee went on  but sally had raised a quietening hand .      first point  tawneee           my real name   s betty     said tawneee  blowing a nose so exquisite that the greatest sculptor in the world would have wept to carve it .  it went blort .      first point  then   betty     sally managed  struggling to use the name     is that no women under forty five           fifty     angua corrected .      right  fifty   no woman under fifty uses the word    bosom    to name anything connected to her .  you just don   t do it .         i didn   t know that     tawneee sniffed .      it   s a fact     said angua .  and  oh dear  how to begin to explain the jerk syndrome .  to someone like tawneee  on whom the name betty stuck like rocks to a ceiling .  this wasn   t just a case of the jerk syndrome  this was it  the quintessential  classic  pure platonic example that should be stuffed and mounted and preserved as a teaching aid for students in the centuries to come .  and she was happy with nobby .      what i   ve got to tell you now is       she began  and faded in the face of the task     is   look  shall we have another drink .  what   s the next cocktail on the menu .      cheery peered at it .      pink  big and wobbly     she announced .      classy .  we   ll have four .          fred colon peered through the bars .  he was  on the whole  a pretty good jailer  he always had a pot of tea on the go  he was  as a general rule  amiably disposed to most people  he was too slow to be easily fooled  and he kept the cell keys in a tin box in the bottom drawer on his desk  a long way out of reach of any stick  hand  dog  cunningly thrown belt  or trained klatchian monkey spider .    he was a bit worried about this dwarf .  you got all sorts in jail  and they often yelled a bit  but with this one he didn   t know what was worse  the sobbing or the silence .  he   d put on candlestick on a stool by the bars  too  because the dwarf carried on alarmingly if there wasn   t enough light .   he stirred the tea reflectively and handed the mug to nobby .      we   ve got a rum    un here  i reckon     he said .     a dwarf that   s scared of the dark .  not right in the head  then .  wouldn   t touch his tea and biscuit .  what do you think .         i think i   ll have his biscuit     said nobby  reaching over to the plate .      why   re you down here  anyway .     said fred .     i   m surprised you ain   t out there a ogling of young women .         tawneee   s going out boozing with the girls tonight     said nobby .      ah  you want to warn her about that sort of thing     said fred colon .     you know what it   s like in the center when the pubs and clubs empty .  there   s throwin    up and yellin    and unladylike behavior and takin    their vests off and i don   t know what .     s called       he scratched his head       minge drinking .         she   s only gone out with angua and sally and cheery  sarge     said nobby  taking another biscuit .      ooo  you wanna watch that  nobby .  women gangin    up on man       fred paused .     a vampire and a werewolf out on the razzle .  take my tip  lad  stay indoors tonight .  and if they start behaving in        he stopped as the sound of sam vimes   s voice came down the spiral stone steps  followed closely by its owner .      so  i   ve got to stop them forming a block  right .         if you   re playing the troll side  yes     said a new voice .     a tight group of dwarfs is bad news for trolls .         troll shove  dwarfs throw .         right .         and the central rock  no one can jump that  right .     said vimes .      yes .         i still think the dwarfs have it all their own way .         we shall see .  the important thing        vimes stopped when he saw nobby and colon .      okay  lads  i   ll talk to the prisoner now     he said .     how is he .      fred indicated the hunched figure on the narrow bunk in the corner cell .      captain carrot tried talking to him for nearly half an hour  and you know he   s got a way with people     he said .     didn   t get as much as a sentence out of him .  i read him his rights but don   t ask me if he understood    em .  he didn   t want his tea and biscuit  at any rate .  that   s rights   and  b     he added  looking bashfullsson up and down .     he gets right  c only if we   ve got teatime assortment .         can he walk .     said vimes .      he sort of shuffles  sir .         fetch him out  then     said vimes  and  seeing fred   s inquiring look at bashfullsson  he went on     this gentleman is here to make sure we don   t use the rubber truncheon  sergeant .         didn   t know we had one  mister vimes     said fred .      we haven   t     said vimes .     no point in hitting    em with something that bounces  eh .     he added  looking at bashfullsson  who smiled  once again  his strange little smile .   one candle burned on the table .  for some reason  fred had seen fit to put another one on a stool near the one occupied cell .      isn   t it a bit dark in here  fred .     said vimes as he pushed aside the debris of mugs and old newspapers that covered most of the table .      yessir .  the dwarfs came and nicked some of our candles to put    round their heathe   that nasty sign     said fred  with a nervous look at bashfullsson .     sorry  sir .         i don   t know why we can   t just burn it     grumble vimes  setting out the thud board .      that would be dangerous  now that the summoning dark is in the world     said bashfullsson .      you believe in that stuff .     said vimes .      believe .  no     said the grag .     i just know it exists .  the troll pieces go all    round the central stone  sir     he added helpfully .   populating the board with its little warriors took some time  but so did the arrival of helmclever .  with fred colon steering him gently by a shoulder  he walked like someone in a dream  his eyes turned up so that they mostly showed the whites .  his iron boots scraped on the flagstones .   fred pushed him gently into a chair and put the second candle beside him .  like magic  the dwarf   s eyes focused on the little stone armies to the exclusion of everything else in the jail .      we   re playing a game  mr .  helmclever     said vimes quietly .     and you can choose your side .      helmclever reached out with a trembling hand and touched a piece .  a troll .  a dwarf had chosen to play as the trolls .  vimes gave the hovering bashfullsson a questioning glance  and got another smile in return .   okay  you got as many of the little sods as possible in a defensive huddle  right .  vimes   s hand hesitated  and shifted a dwarf across the board .  the click as he placed it was echoed by the one made by the movement of helmclever   s next troll .  the dwarf looked sleepy  but his hand had moved with snake speed .      who killed the four mining dwarfs  helmclever .     said vimes softly .     who killed the boys from the city .      dull eyes looked at him  and then  meaningfully  at the board .  vimes moved a dwarf at random .      the dark soldiers     helmclever whispered as a little troll clicked smartly into place .      who ordered it .     again the look  again a dwarf placed at random followed by a troll that was moved so fast that the two pieces seemed to hit the board together .      grag hamcrusher ordered it .         why .     click click .      they had heard it speaking .         what was it that spoke .  was it a cube .     click click .      yes .  it was dug up .  it said it spoke with the voice of b   hrian bloodaxe .      vimes heard a gasp from bashfullsson  and caught fred colon   s eye .  he jerked his head toward the cell block door  and mouthed a couple of words .      wasn   t he a famous dwarf king .     said vimes .  click click .      yes .  he commanded the dwarfs at koom valley     said helmclever .      and what did this voice say .     said vimes .  click click .  and a third click from behind vimes as fred colon locked the door and stood in front of it  looking impassive .      i do not know .  ardent said was about the battle .  he said it was lies .         who killed grag hamcrusher .     click click .      i do not know .  ardent called me to the meeting and said there was terrible fighting among the grags .  ardent said one of them killed him in the dark  with a mining hammer  but none knew who .  they were all struggling together .      all dressed alike  vimes thought .  just shapes  if you can   t see their wrists        why did they want to kill him .     click click .      they had to stop him destroying the words .  he was screaming and hitting the cube with the hammer .         there are   sensitive areas on a cube  and it is possible that if they are touched in the wrong order  all the sound will vanish     whispered bashfullsson .      i should think the hammer would do the trick whatever it hit .     said vimes  turning his head .      no  commander .  devices are immensely tough .         they must be .      vimes turned back to helmclever .      it   s wrong to destroy lies  but it   s okay to kill the miners .     he said .  click .   he heard the hiss of bashfullsson   s intake of breath .  well  yes  perhaps that could have been better put .  there was no answering move .  helmclever hung his head .      it was wrong to kill the miners     he whispered .     and why not destroy lies .  but it is wrong to think these thoughts  so i   i said nothing .  the old grags were angry and upset and confused  so ardent took charge .  he said one dwarf killing another underground  everyone knew that was no business of humans .  he said he could make it all right .  he said everyone must listen to him .  he told the dark guards to take the body to the new outer chamber .  and   he told me to fetch my club        vimes glanced at bashfullsson and mouthed the word    club .     he got an emphatic nod in return .   helmclever sat hunched in silence  and then raised one hand slowly and moved a troll .  click .   click click .  click click .  click click .  vimes tried to spare a few brain cells for the game while his mind raced and tried to piece the random information spilling out of helmclever .   so   it all starts when they come here looking for this magic cube  which can speak        why did they come to the city .  how did they know the cube was here .     click click .      when i went to begin my training  i took a copy of the codex .  arden confiscated it  but then they called me to a meeting and said it was very important and they would honor me by letting me go with them to the city .  ardent told me it was a great opportunity .  grag hamcrusher had a mission  he said .         they hadn   t even known about the painting .         they lived under a mountain .  they believe that humans are not real .  but ardent is smart .  he said there were always rumors that something had come out of koom valley .      i bet he is smart  vimes thought .  so they come here  do a little light pastoral work and rabble rousing  and search for the cube in a very dwarfish way .  they find it .  but the poor bastards who were doing the digging hear what it   s got to say .  well  everyone knows dwarfs gossip  so the dark guards make sure these four don   t have a chance to .   click click .  click click .   then friend hamcrusher doesn   t like what he hears  either .  he wants to destroy this thing .  in the struggle in the dark  one of the other grags does the world a favor and fetches him a crack on the noggin .  but  whoops  big mistake  because the mob is going to miss him and his jolly urging to wholesale troll slaughter .  you know how dwarfs gossip  and you can   t kill    em all .  so while it   s still just us together in the dark  we need a plan .  forward  mr .  ardent  who says    i know .  we   ll take the corpse out to a tunnel that a troll just might have got into  and bash its head in with a club .  a troll did it .  what right thinking dwarf could possibly believe anything else .      click click .      why the candles .     said vimes .     the old grags had been sitting in brilliant candlelight when i saw them .     click click .      the grags ordered it     helmclever whispered .     they feared what might come for them in darkness .         and what was it that might come .     click     helmclever   s hand stopped in mid air .  for several seconds  nothing moved in the little circle of yellow light except the candle flames themselves  in the darkness beyond  the shadows craned to hear .      i   cannot say     whispered the dwarf .  click .  click click   click   click .   vimes glared at the board .  where   d that troll come from .  helmclever had wiped three dwarfs off the board in one go .      ardent said there   s always a troll .  a troll got into the mine     said helmclever .     the grags said yes  that must have been it .         but they knew the truth .     click click   click   click .  three more dwarfs gone  just like that        truth is what a grag says it is     said helmclever .     the sunlight world is a bad dream anyway .  ardent said no one was to speak about it .  he said i was to tell all the guards   about the troll .      blame it on a troll  vimes thought .  for a dwarf  that came naturally .  a big troll did it and ran away .  this isn   t just a can of worms  it   s a nest of bloody vipers .   he stared at the board .  bloody hell .  i   m running into a wall here .  what am i left with .  brick saw a dwarf hitting another dwarf  but that wasn   t the murder   that was ardent or someone giving hamcrusher   s dead body that distinctive  bashed by a troll look .  i   m not actually certain that   s a major crime .  the murder was done in the dark by one of six dwarfs  and the other five might not even know who did it .  okay  maybe i can say they conspired to conceal a crime   hold on        but it wasn   t ardent who said that the watch should not be told     he said .     that was you  wasn   t it .  did you want me to be angry  mr .  helmclever .     he moved a dwarf .  click .   helmclever looked down .   since no answer was forthcoming  vimes captured the wandering troll and placed it beside the board .      i did not think you would come .     helmclever   s voice was barely audible .     hamcrusher was   i think   i didn   t   ardent said you wouldn   t worry  because the grag was such a danger .  he said the grag had ordered the miners to be killed  and so now it was ended .  but i thought it   i   it wasn   t right .  things were wrong .  i heard you were full of pride .  i had to get you   interested .  he   he           you thought i wouldn   t be .  a troll is accused of murdering a dwarf  at a time like this  and i wouldn   t be interested .     said vimes .      ardent said that you would not be  because no humans were involved .  he said you would not care what happens to dwarfs .         he ought to get out in the fresh air more .      helmclever   s eyes and nose were running now  and dripping on the board .  a storm stops the battle  vimes thought .  then the dwarf lifted his head and wailed .     it was the club the troll mr .  shine gave me for winning five games in a row     he wailed .     he was my friend .  he said i was as good as a troll  so i should have a club .  i told ardent it was a war trophy .  but he took it and bashed that poor dead body .      water dripping on a stone  vimes thought .  and it depends on where the drops fall  right  mr .  shine .  what good has it done this poor devil .  he wasn   t in the right job to have doubt enter his life .      all right  mr .  helmclever  thank you for this     he said  sitting back .     there is just one thing  though .  do you know who sent those dwarfs to my house .         what dwarfs .      vimes stared into the weeping  red rimmed eyes .  their owner was either telling the truth or the stage had missed a major talent .      they came to attack me and my family     he said .      i   did hear ardent talking to the captain of the guard     helmclever murmured .     something about   a warning           a warning .  do you call       vimes began and stopped when he saw bashfullsson shaking his head .  right .  right .  no point in taking it out on this one .  he   s had all the stuffing knocked out of him in any case .      they are very frightened now     helmclever said .     they don   t understand the city .  they don   t understand why trolls are allowed here .  they don   t understand people who don   t   understand them .  they fear you .  they fear everything  now .         where have they gone .         i don   t know .  ardent said they would have gone now anyway  because they   ve got the cube and the painting     said helmclever .     he said the painting will show where there are more lies  and those can be destroyed .  but they fear most of all the summoning dark  commander .  they can feel it coming for them .         it   s only a drawing     said vimes .     i don   t believe in it .         i do     said helmclever calmly .     it is in this room .  how does it come .  it comes in darkness and in vengeance and in disguise .      vimes felt his skin twitch .  nobby looked around the grimy stone walls .  bashfullsson sat bolt upright in his chair .  even fred colon shifted uneasily .   this is just mystic stuff  vimes told himself .  it   s not even human mystic stuff .  i don   t belive in it .  so why does it feel a bit chilly in here .   he coughed .     well  once it knows they   ve gone  i expect it   ll head out after them .         and it will come for me     said helmclever in the same calm voice .  he folded his hands in front of him .      why .  you didn   t kill anybody     said vimes .      you don   t understand .  they   they   when they killed the miners  one was not all the way dead  and  and  and we could hear him hammering on the door with his fists  and i stood in the tunnel and listened to him die and i wished him dead so that the noise would stop  but  but  but when it did  it went on in my head  and i could  i could  i could have turned the wheel but i was afraid of the dark guards who have no souls  and because of that the darkness will take mine        the little voice died away .   there was a nervous cough from nobby .      well  thank you again     said vimes .  good grief  they really messed up his head  poor little sod .   and i   ve got nothing  he thought .  i might get ardent on a charge of falsifying evidence .  i can   t put brick in the witness box  because i   ll simply be proving that there was a troll in the mine .  all i   ve got is young helmclever here  who   s clearly unfit to testify .   he turned to bashfullsson  and shrugged .     i think i   d like to keep our friend here tonight  for his own good .  i can   t imagine there   s anywhere else for him to go .  the statement he made is  of course  covered by        now his voice trailed off as his memory nudged him .  he turned back in his chair to glare at the sorrowful helmclever .      what painting .     he said .      the painting of the battle of koom valley by methodia rascal     said the dwarf  not looking up .     it   s very big .  they stole it from the museum .         what .     said fred colon  who was making tea in the corner .     it was them .         what .  you know about this  fred .     vimes demanded .      we  yes  mister vimes  we did a report           koom valley  koom valley  koom valley .     roared vimes  slapping his hand down on the table so hard that the candlesticks jumped into the air .     a report .  what the hell good   s a report .  have i got time these days to read reports .  why doesn   t someone tell me these thi        one candlestick rolled on to the floor and went out .  vimes grabbed for the other as it reached the edge of the table  but it spun away from his fingers and landed wick first on the flagstones .   darkness fell like an axe .   helmclever groaned .  it was a heartfelt  soul creaking groan  like a death rattle from a living mouth .      nobby .     screamed vimes .     light a godsdamn match right now and that   s a godsdamn order .      there was a frantic scrabbling in the dark  and then a match head was a sudden supernova .      well  bring it here  man .     he shouted to nobby .     get those candles lit .      helmclever was still staring at the table  where the ill tempered thump had scattered the remains of the game .   vimes glanced down at the game board as the candle flames grew .   if you were the kind to see things  you   d say that the trolls and dwarfs had fallen in a rough circle around the central rock  while a few more dwarfs had rolled away in a line .  you   d say  in fact  that from above  they formed the shape of a round eye .  with a tail .   helmclever gave a little sigh and slipped sideways onto the floor .   vimes stood up to help him  and then remembered just in time about politics .  he forced himself to back away  hands in the air .      mr .  bashfullsson .     he said .     i can   t touch him .  please .      the grag nodded  and knelt down by the dwarf .      no pulse  no heartbeat     he announced after a few seconds .     i   m sorry  commander .         then it looks as though i   m now in your hands     said vimes .      indeed .  in the hands of a dwarf     said the grag  standing up .     commander vimes  i will swear that helmclever was treated with nothing but concern and courtesy while i was here .  and perhaps with more kindness from you than a dwarf might have a right to expect .  his death is not on your hands .  the summoning dark called him .  dwarfs will understand .         well  i don   t .  why   d it kill him .  what did the poor bugger do .         i think it   s more true to say that the fear of the summoning dark killed him     said the grag .     he left a miner trapped  heard his cries in the dark  and did nothing .  to all dwarfs  that is a terrible crime .         as bad as wiping away a word .     said vimes sourly .  he felt more shaken up than he   d care to admit .  he shouldn   t have slapped the table like that  but he   d been so angry .  now his hand hurt more than ever .      some would say it is far worse .  his own guilt and fear killed helmclever .  it   s as if he had his own summoning dark in his head     said bashfullsson .     in a way  perhaps  we all have  commander .  or something similar .         you know  your religion really messes people up     said vimes .      not in comparison to what they do to one another     said bashfullsson  calmly folding the dead dwarf   s hands across his chest .     and it is not a religion  commander .  tak wrote the world and the laws  and then he left us .  he does not require that we think of him  only that we think .      he stood up .     i shall explain the situation to my fellows  commander .  incidentally  i would ask you to take me with you to koom valley .         did i say i was going to koom valley .     said vimes .      all right     said the grag calmly .     let   s say  then  that should the mood take you to go to koom valley  you will take me .  i know the place  i know the history  i even know quite a lot about mine sign  especially the major darknesses .  i may be useful .         you demand all that just for telling the truth .     said vimes .      as a matter of fact  no .  j   ds hasfak    ds        i bargain with no axe in my hand .     i will tell the truth whatever you decide     said bashfullsson .     however  since you are not going to koom valley  commander  i will not press you .  it was only an idle thought .          fun .  what is it good for .   it   s not pleasure  joy  delight  enjoyment  or glee .  it   s a hollow  cruel  vicious little bastard  a word for something sought with a hilarious couple of wobbly antennae on your head and the words i want it .  on your shirt  and it tends to leave you waking up with your face stuck to the street .   somehow  angua had acquired a magenta feather boa .  it wasn   t her .  it wasn   t anyone .  it had just turned up .  the sheer fakery of it made her more gloomy .  something was nagging at the back of her mind  and it annoyed her that she didn   t know what it was .   they had ended up in biers  as she knew they would .  it was the undead bar  although it tolerated anyone who wasn   t too normal .   it certainly tolerated tawneee .  she just didn   t get it  did she .  the reason why men never talked to her .  the trouble was  thought angua  that nobby wasn   t actually a bad   person .  as such .  as far as she knew  he   d always been faithful to miss pushpram  which was to say that when it came to being hit with a fish and then pelted with clams  he never thought of any other girl but her .  he actually had quite a romantic soul  but it was encased in what could only be called   nobby nobbs .   sally had accompanied tawneee to the ladies     which was always wise in biers .  now angua was staring at yet another cocktail menu  painted on a board above the bar  in a very shaky script  by igor .    he   s done his best to flow with the zeitgeist  or would have done if he   d known what the word meant  but had totally failed to grasp the subtleties of the modern cocktail bar  so that the drinks on offer included    havin you teef smashed in by a big stinky fist  head nailed to the door  kick inna fork  like big lump of steel hammer fru you ears  neck bolt    actually  the neck bolt wasn   t too bad  angua had to admit .         s   cuse me     said cheery  teetering on a bar stool     but what was all that about tawneee .  i could see you and sally nodding to each other .         that .  oh  it   s the jerk syndrome .     angua remembered who she was talking to  and added     er   dwarfs probably don   t have that .  it means   sometimes a woman is so beautiful that any man with half a brain isn   t going to think of asking her out  okay .  because it   s obvious that she   s far too grand for the likes of him .  are you with me .         i think so .         well  that   s tawneee .  and  for the purposes of this explanation  nobby has not got half a brain .  he   s so used to women saying no when he asks them out that he   s not afraid of being blown off .  so he asks her  because he figures  why not .  and she  who by now thinks there   s something wrong with her  is so grateful she says okay .         but she likes him .         i know .  that   s where it all gets strange .         it   s much simpler for dwarfs     said cheery .      i expect it is .         but probably not as much fun     said cheery  looking crestfallen .   tawneee was returning .  angua ordered three neck bolts while cheery hopefully negotiated for a screaming orgasm .  and then  with occasional assistance from sally  angua explained to tawneee the facts of   well   everything .   it took some while .  you had to keep changing the shape of sentences to get them to fit into the currently available space in tawneee   s brain .  angua clung to the idea  though  that the girl couldn   t be that stupid .  she worked in a strip club  didn   t she .      i mean  why do you think men pay to watch you onstage .     she asked .      because i   m very good     said tawneee promptly .     when i was ten  i got the dancer of the year award in miss deviante   s ballet and tap class .         tap dancing .     said sally  grinning .     hey  why don   t you try that onstage .      angua closed her mind to the image of tawneee tap dancing .  the club would probably burn to the ground .      er   let me try this another way       she said .     and i   m telling you this as another woma   female        tawneee listened intently  and even the way in which she looked puzzled was unfair to the rest of her sex .   when angua had finished  she watched the angelic expression hopefully .      so what you   re saying  right     said tawneee     is that walking out with nobby is like going into a big posh restaurant and only eating the bread roll .         exactly .     said angua .     you   ve got it .         but i never really meet men .  granny told me not to act like a floozy .         and you don   t think that working at       angua began  but sally cut in .      sometimes you need to flooze regularly     she said .     haven   t you ever just gone into a bar and had a drink with a man .         no .         right     said sally .  she drained her glass .     i don   t like these neck bolts .  let   s go somewhere else and       she paused     open your mind to poshibiliteesh .          it was odd  having sybil in pseudopolis yard .  it had been one of the ramkin family homes before she   d given it to the watch .  she   d been a girl there .  it had been her home .   some apprehension of this crept into the chipped and stained souls of the watchmen .  men not known for the elegance of their manners found themselves automatically wiping their feet as they came in  and respectfully removing their helmets .   they spoke differently  too  slowly and hesitantly  anxiously scanning the sentence ahead for expletives to delete .  someone even found a broom and swept up  or at least moved the dirt to a less obvious place .   upstairs  in what had been up until then the cash office  young sam slept peacefully in a makeshift bed .  one day  vimes hoped  he would be able to tell him that on one special night he   d been guarded by four troll watchmen .  they   d been off duty but volunteered to come in for this  and were just itching for some dwarfs to try anything .  sam hoped the boy would be impressed  the most other kids could hope for was angels .   vimes had commandeered the canteen  because it had a big enough table .  he   d spread out a map of the city .  a lot of the rest of the planking was occupied by pages from the koom valley codex .   this wasn   t a game  this was a puzzle .  a sort of  yes  jigsaw puzzle .  and he ought to be able to do it  he reasoned  because he already had nearly all the corners .      ettercap street  money trap lane  crybaby alley  scuttle butt court  the jeebies  pellicool steps     he said .     tunnels everywhere .  they were lucky to find it after only three or four .  mr .  rascal must have had lodgings in half the streets in the area .  including empirical crescent .         but hwhy .     said sir reynold stitched .     i mean  hwhy dig tunnels everyhwhere .         tell him  carrot     said vimes  drawing a line across the city .   carrot cleared his throat .     because they were dwarfs  sir  and deep downers at that     he said .     it wouldn   t occur to them not to dig .  and mostly it   d be just a matter of clearing out buried rooms  in any case .  that   s a stroll  to a dwarf .  and they were laying rails  so they could take the spoil out anywhere they wanted .         yes  but sureleah       sir reynold began .      they were listening out for something talking at the bottom of an old well     said vimes  still bending over the map .     what chance that   d still be visible .  and people can get a bit iffy when a bunch of dwarfs turn up and start digging holes in the garden .         it   d be very slow  sureleah .         well  yes  sir .  but it would be in the dark  under their control  and secret     said carrot .     they could go anywhere they wanted .  they could zigzag around if they weren   t certain  they could home in with their listening tube  and they   d never have to speak to a human or see daylight .  dark  controllable  and secret .         deep downers in a nutshell     said vimes .      this is very exciting .     said sir reynold .     and they dug into the cellars of my museum .         over to you  fred     said vimes  carefully drawing a line across the map .      er  right     said fred colon .     er   nobby an    me found out where only a couple of hours ago     he said  thinking it wisest not to add    after mister vimes yelled at us and made us tell him every last detail and then sent us back and told us what to look for .     what he did add was     they were pretty clever  sir .  the mortar even looked dirty .  i bet you   re saying to yourself  ahah  sir .         i am .     said sir reynold  bewildered .     i hwould normalleah say    my goodness .             i expect you   re saying to yourself  ahah  how were they able to build up the wall again after they   d got the muriel out  sir  and we reckon           hwell  i imagine one dwarf stayed behind to make good  lay low  as you hwould say  and hwandered out in the morning     said sir reynold .     there hwere people going in and out all the time .  hwe hwere looking for a big painting  after all  not a person .         yessir .  we reckon one dwarf stayed behind to make good  lay low  and wandered out in the morning .  there were people going in and out all the time .  you were looking for a big painting  after all  not a person     said fred colon .  he   d been very pleased to come up with that theory  so he was going to say it out loud no matter what .   vimes tapped the map .     and here  sir reynold  is where a troll called brick fell through another cellar floor into their tunnel     he said .     he also told us he saw something in the main mine  which sounds very much like the rascal .         but  alas  you have not found it     said sir reynold .      i   m sorry  sir .  it   s probably long gone out of the city .         but hwhy .     said the curator .     they could have studied it in the museum .  hwe   re very interactive these days .         interactive .     said vimes .     what do you mean .         hwell  people can   look at the pictures as much as they hwant     said sir reynold .  he sounded a little annoyed .  people shouldn   t ask that kind of question .      and the pictures do what  exactly .         er   hang there  commander     said sir reynold .     of course .         so what you mean is  people can come and look at the pictures  and the pictures  for their part  are looked at .         rather like that  yes     said the curator .  he thought for a moment  aware that this probably wasn   t sufficient  and added     but dynamicaleah .         you mean the people are moved by the pictures  sir .     said carrot .      yes .     said sir reynold  with huge relief .     hwell done .  that   s just hwhat happens .  and hwe   ve had the rascal on public display for years .  hwe even have a stepladder  in case people hwant to examine the mountains .  sometimes people come in hwith a bee in their bonnet that one of the hwarriors is pointing to some bareleah visible cave or something .  frankleah  if there hwas some secret  i hwould have found it by now .  there hwas no point to the theft .         unless someone had found the secret and didn   t want anyone else to find it     said vimes .      that hwould be rather a coincidence  hwouldn   t it  commander .  it   s not that anything has just changed recentleah .  mr .  rascal didn   t turn up and paint another mountain .  and  although i hate to say this  just destroying the painting hwould have been enough .      vimes walked around the table .  all the bits  he thought  i must have all the bits by now .   let   s start with this legend of a dwarf turning up  nearly dead  weeks after the battle  babbling about treasure .   all right  then it might have been this talking cube thing  vimes thought .  he survived the battle  hid out somewhere  and he   s got this thing and it   s important .  he   s got to get it somewhere safe   no  maybe he   s got to get people to listen to it .  and  of course  he doesn   t take it with him     cos there   s still likely to be trolls wandering the area and right now they   ll be in a mood to club first and try to think up some questions later .  he needs some bodyguards .   he gets as far as some humans  but when he   s leading them back to the place where it   s hidden  he finally dies .   forward two thousand years .  would a cube last that long .  hell  they bob up in molten lava .   so it   s lying there .  methodia rascal comes along  looking for   a nice view  or something  and he looks down and there it is .  well  i   ll have to accept that he did  because he found it and got it talking  who knows how .  but he couldn   t stop it .  he drops it down the well .  the dwarfs find it .  they listen to the box  but hate what they hear .  they hate it so much that hamcrusher has four miners killed just because they heard it  too .  so why the painting .  it shows what the box is talking about .  where the box is .  if you   ve got the box in your hand  isn   t that it .   anyway  who says it was the voice of bloodaxe doing the speaking .  it could be anybody .  why would you believe what it said .   he was aware of sir reynold talking to carrot           said to your sergeant colon here  the painting is set several miles from hwhere the actual battle hwas fought .  it   s in entireleah the hwrong part of koom valley .  that   s just about the one thing both sides are agreed on .         so why did he set it there .     said vimes  staring at the table as if hoping to draw a clue from it by willpower alone .      who knows .  it   s all koom valley .  there are about two hundred and fifty square miles of the place .  i imagine he just chose somewhere that looked dramatic .         would you chaps like a cup of tea .     said lady sybil  from the door .     i felt a bit at a loose end  so i made a pot .  and you should be getting your head down  sam .      sam vimes looked panicky  a figure of authority caught once again in a domestic situation .      oh  lady sybil  they took the rascal .     said sir reynold .     i know it belonged to your family .         my grandfather said it was just a damn nuisance     said sybil .     he used to let me unroll it on the floor of the ballroom .  i used to name all the dwarfs .  we looked for the secret  because he said there was hidden treasure  and the painting showed you where it was .  of course  we never found it  but it kept me quiet on rainy afternoons .         oh  it hwasn   t great art     said sir reynold .     and the man hwas quite mad  of course .  but somehow it spoke to people .         i wish it   d say something to me     said vimes .     you really don   t need to make tea for people  dear .  one of the officers           nonsense .  we must be hospitable     said sybil .      of course  people tried to copeah it     said the curator  accepting a cup .     oh dear  they hwere terrible .  a painting fifteah feet long and ten feet deep is really quite impossible to copy hwith any kind of accuraceah           not if you lay it out on the ballroom floor and get a man to make you a pantograph     said sybil  pouring tea .     this teapot is really a disgrace  sam .  worse than the urn .  doesn   t anyone ever clean it out .      she looked up at their faces .      did i say something wrong .     she said .      you made a copy of the rascal .     said sir reynold .      oh  yes .  the whole thing  on a scale of one to five     said sybil .     when i was fourteen .  it was a school project .  we were doing dwarf history  you see  and  well  since we owned that painting  it was too good to miss .  you know what a pantograph is  don   t you .  it   s a very simple way of making larger or smaller copies of a painting  using geometry  some wooden levers  and a sharp pencil .  actually  i did it as five panels ten feet square  that   s full size  to make sure i got all the detail  and then i did the one fifth scale version to display it as poor mr .  rascal wanted it displayed .  i got full marks from miss turpitude .  she was our math teacher  you know  she wore her hair in a bun with a pair of compasses and a ruler stuck in it .  she used to say that a girl who knew how to use a set square and protractor would go a long way in life .         what a shame you no longer have it .     said sir reynold .      why should you say that  sir reynold .     said sybil .     i   m sure i   ve still got it somewhere .  i had it hanging up from the ceiling of my room for some time .  let me think   did we take it with us when we moved .  i   m sure       she looked up brightly .     ah  yes .  have you even been up to the attics here  sam .         no .     said vimes .      now   s the time  then .             i   ve never been on a girls    night out before     said cheery as they walked  a little uncertainly  through the nighttime city .     was that last bit supposed to happen .         what bit was that .     said sally .      the bit where the bar was set on fire .         not usually     said angua .      i   ve never seen men fight over a woman before     cheery went on .      yeah  that was something  wasn   t it .     said sally .  they   d dropped tawneee off at her home .  she   d been in quite a thoughtful frame of mind .      and all she did was smile at a man     said cheery .      yes     said angua .  she was trying to concentrate on walking .      it   d be a bit of a shame for nobby if she lets that go to her head  though     said cheery .   save me from talkative druks   drinks   drunks  angua thought .  she said     yes  but what about miss pushpram .  she   s thrown some quite expensive fish at nobby over the years .         we   ve struck a blow for womanhood     sally declared loudly .     shoes  men  coffins   never accept the first one you see .         oh  shoes     said cheery .     i can talk about shoes .  has anyone seen the new yan rockhammer solid copper slingbacks .         er   we don   t go to a metalworker for our footwear  dear     said sally .     oh   i think i   m going to be sick           serves you right for drinking   vine     said angua maliciously .      oh ha ha     said the vampire  from the shadows .     i   m perfectly fine with sarcastic pause    vine     thank you .  what i shouldn   t have drunk was sticky drinks with names made up by people with less sense of humor than  uh  excuse me   oh  noooo           are you all right .     said cheery .      i   ve just thrown up a small  hilarious  paper umbrella           oh dear .         and a sparkler           is that you  sergeant angua .     said a voice in the gloom .  a lantern was opened  and lit the approaching face of constable visit .  as he approached  she could just make out the thick wad of pamphlets under his other arm .      hello  washpot     she said .     what   s up .            looks like a twist of lemon       said a damp voice from the shadows .      mister vimes sent me to search the dens of iniquity and low places of sin for you     said visit .      and the literature .     said angua .     by the way  the words    nothing personal    could have so easily been added to that last sentence .         since i was having to tour the temples of vice  sergeant  i thought i could do om   s holy work at the same time     said visit  whose indefatigable evangelical zeal triumphed over all adversity .   sometimes whole bars full of people would lie down on the floor with the lights out when they heard he was coming down the street .   there were sounds of retching from the darkness .          woe unto those who abuseth the vine         said constable visit .  he caught the expression on angua   s face and added    no offense meant .         we   ve been through all that     moaned sally .      what does he want  washpot .     said angua .      it   s about koom valley again .  he wants you back at the yard .         but we were stood down .     sally complained .      sorry     said visit cheerfully     i reckon you   ve been stood up again .         the story of my life     said cheery .      oh  well  i suppose we   d better go     said angua  trying to disguise her relief .      when i say    the story of my life     obviously i don   t mean the whole story     mumbled cheery  apparently to herself  as she trailed behind them into a world blessedly without fun .       the ramkins never threw anything away .  there was something worrying about their attics  and it wasn   t just that they had a faint aroma of long dead pigeons .   the ramkins labeled things .  vimes have been into the big attics in scoone avenue to fetch down the rocking horse and the cot and a whole box of elderly but much loved soft toys smelling of mothballs .  nothing that might ever be useful again was thrown away .  it was carefully labeled and put in the attic .   brushing aside cobwebs with one hand and holding up a lantern with the other  sybil led the way past boxes of men   s boots  various  risible puppets  string   glove  model the ater and scenery .  maybe that was the reason for their wealth  they had bought things that were built to last  and now they seldom had to buy anything at all .  except food  of course  and even then vimes would not have been surprised to see boxes labeled apple cores  various  or leftovers  need eating up .       ah  here we are     said sybil  lifting aside a bundle of fencing foils and lacrosse sticks .  she pulled a long  thick tube out into the light .      i didn   t color it in  of course     she said as it was manhandled back to the stairs .     that would have taken forever .      getting the heavy bundle down to the canteen took some effort and a certain amount of shoving  but eventually it was lifted onto the table and the crackling scroll removed .   while sir reynold unrolled the big ten foot squares and enthused  vimes pulled out the small scale copy that sybil had created .  it was just small enough to fit on the table  he weighed down one end with a crusted mug and put a saltcellar on the other .   methodia   s notes made sad reading .  difficult reading  too  because a lot of them were half burned  and in any case rascal   s handwriting was what might have been achieved by a spider on a trampoline during an earthquake .   the man was clearly as mad as a spoon  writing notes that he wanted to keep secret from the chicken  sometimes he   d stop writing in mid note if he thought the chicken was watching .  apparently  he was a very sad sight to see until he picked up a brush  whereupon he would work quite quietly and with a strange glow to his features .  and that was his life  one huge oblong of canvas .  methodia rascal  born  painted famous picture  thought he was a chicken  died .   given that the man couldn   t touch bottom with a long stick  how could you make sense out of anything he wrote .  the only note that seemed concise  if horrible  was the one generally accepted as his last  since it was found under his slumped body .  it read     awk .  awk .  it comes .  it comes .     he   d choked on a throatful of feathers .  and on the canvas  the last of the paint was still drying .   vimes   s eye was caught by the message numbered  arbitrarily          i thought it was a guiding omen  but it screams in the night .     an omen of what .  and what about      .     the dark  in the dark  like a star in chains .     vimes had made a note of that one .  he   d made a note of many others  too .  but the worst thing about them   or the best  if you were keen on mysteries   was that they could mean anything .  you could pick your own theory .  the man was half starved and in mortal dread of a chicken that lived in his head .  you might as well try to make sense of raindrops .   vimes pushed them aside and stared at the careful pencil drawing .  even at this size  it was confusing .  up front  faces were so large that you could see the pores on a dwarf   s nose .  in the distance  sybil had meticulously copied figures that were a quarter of an inch high .   axes and clubs were being waved  spears were being pointed  there were charges and countercharges and single combats .  across the whole length of the picture  dwarfs and trolls were locked in ferocious battle  hacking and smashing     he thought  who   s missing .      sir reynold  could you help me .     he said quietly  lest the nascent thought turn tail and run .      yes  commander .     said the curator  hurrying over .     doesn   t ladeah sybil do the most exquisite           she   s very good  yes     said vimes .     tell me   how did rascal know all this stuff .         there were many dwarf songs about it  and some troll stories .  oh  and some humans hwitnessed it .         so rascal could have read about it .         oh  yes .  apart from the fact that he put it in the wrong part of the valley  he   d got it down quite accurately .      vimes didn   t take his gaze off the paper battle .      does anyone know why he put it in the wrong place  then .     he said .      there are several theories .  one is that he hwas deceived by the fact that the dead dwarfs hwere cremated at that end of the valley  but after the storm that hwas hwhere many of the bodies ended up .  there was also a great deal of dead hwood for bonfires .  but i believe he chose that end because the view is so much better .  the mountains are so dramatic .      vimes sat down  staring at the sketch  willing it to yield its secret .   everyone will know the secret in a few weeks  mr .  shine had said .  why .      sir reynold  was anything going to happen to the painting in the next couple of weeks .     he said .      oh  yes     said the curator .     hwe hwould have installed it in its new room .         anything special about that .         i did tell your sergeant  commander     said the curator a little reproachfully .     it is circular .  rascal always intended it to be seen in the round  as it hwere .  so that the viewer could be there .      and i   m nearly there  too  vimes thought .      i think the cube told the dwarfs something about koom valley     he said  in a faraway voice  because he felt as though he was already in the valley .     it told them that the place where it was found was important .  even rascal thought it was important .  they needed a map  and rascal painted one  even if he didn   t know it .  fred .         yessir .         the dwarfs weren   t bothered about damaging the bottom of the painting because it doesn   t contain anything important .  it   s just people .  people move around .         but  hwith respect  commander  so do all those boulders     said sir reynold .      they don   t matter .  no matter how much the valley has changed  this picture will work     said vimes .  the glow of understanding lit his brain .      but even the rivers moved over the years  and any amount of boulders have rolled down from the mountains     said sir reynold .     i   m told the area looks nothing like that now .         even so     said vimes  in the same dreamy voice     this map will work for thousands of years .  it doesn   t mark a rock or a hollow or a cave  it just marks a spot .  i can pinpoint it .  that is  if i had a pin .         i have one .     sir reynold said triumphantly  reaching to his lapel .     i spotted it in the street yesterday  and of course hwe all know the old saying     see a pin and pick it up  and all day long               yes  thank you     said vimes  taking it .  he walked to the end of the table and picked up one end of the painting  and dragged it back down the length of the table  the heavy paper flapping after him .   he pinned the two ends together  held up the circle he had made  and lowered it over his head .      the truth is in the mountains     he said .     for years you   ve been looking at a line of mountains .  it   s really a circle of mountains .         but i knew that .     said sir reynold .      in a way  sir  but you probably didn   t understand it until now  yes .  rascal was standing somewhere important .         hwell  yes .  but it hwas a cave  commander .  he specifically mentions a cave .  that   s hwhy people have searched along the valley hwalls .  the painting   s set right in the middle  near the river .         then there   s something we still don   t know .     said vimes  annoyed that a big moment had so quickly become a small one .     i   ll find out what it is when i get there .      there .  he   d said it .  but he   d known that he was going to go  known for   how long .  it seemed like forever  but had it seemed like forever yesterday .  this afternoon .  he could see the place in his mind   s eye .  vimes at koom valley .  he could practically taste the air .  he could hear the roaring of the river  which ran as cold as ice .      sam       sybil began .      no  this has got to be sorted out     vimes said quickly .     i don   t care about the stupid secret .  those deep downers murdered our dwarfs  remember .  they think the painting is a map they can use  and that   s why they   re going there .  i   ve got to go after them .         look  sam  if       sybil tried .      we can   t afford a war between the trolls and the dwarfs  dear .  that business the other night was just a dumb gang fight .  a real war in ankh morpork would wreck the place .  and somehow it   s all tied up with this .         i agree .  i want to come  too .     sybil screamed .      besides  i   ll be perfectly safe if   what .     vimes gaped at his wife while his mental gears ripped into reverse .     no  it   s too dangerous .         sam vimes  i   ve dreamed of visiting koom valley all my life  so don   t you think for one moment you   re gallivanting off to see it and leave me at home .         i don   t gallivant .  i   ve never gallivanted .  i don   t know how to vant .  i don   t even have a galli .  but there   s going to be a war there soon .         then i shall tell them we   re not involved .     said sybil calmly .      that won   t work .         then it won   t work in ankh morpork  either     said sybil  with the air of some player cunningly knocking out four dwarfs in one go .     sam  you know you   re going to lose this .  there   s no point in arguing .  besides  i speak dwarfish .  we   ll take young sam  too .         no .         so that   s all sorted  then     said sybil  apparently struck by sudden deafness .     if you want to catch up with the dwarfs  i suggest we leave as soon as possible .      sir reynold turned to her with his mouth open .      but  ladeah sybil  armies are already massing there .  it   s no place for a ladeah .      vimes winced .  sybil had made up her mind .  this was going to be like watching that dwarf being flamed by dragons  all over again .   lady sybil   s bosom  which she was allowed to have  expanded as she took a deep breath  it seemed to lift her slightly off the ground .      sir reynold     she said  with a side order of ice .     in the year of the lice  my great grandmother once cooked  personally  a full dinner for eighteen in a military redoubt that was entirely surrounded by bloodthirsty klatchians  and she felt able to include sorbet and nuts .  my grandmother  in the year of the quiet monkey  defended our embassy in pseudopolis against a mob  with no assistance but that offered by a gardener  a trained parrot  and a pan of hot cooking fat .  my late aunt  when our coach was once held up at bowpoint by two desperate highwaymen  gave them such a talking to that they actually ran away crying for their mothers  sir reynold  their mothers .  we are no strangers to danger  sir reynold .  may i also remind you that quite probably half the dwarfs who fought at koom valley were ladies .  no one told them to stay at home .      so that   s settled  then  thought vimes .  we   damn .      captain .     he said .     send someone to find that dwarf grag bashfullsson  will you .  tell him commander vimes presents his compliments and will indeed be leaving first thing in the morning .         er   right  sir .  will do     said carrot .   how did he know i   d be going .  vimes wondered .  i suppose it was inevitable .  but he could have hung us out to dry if he   d said we   ve mistreated that dwarf .  and he   s one of mr .  shine   s pupils  i   ll bet on it .  good idea to keep an eye on him  perhaps         when did lord vetinari sleep .  presumably  the man must get his head down at some point  vimes had reasoned .  everyone slept .  catnaps could get you by for a while  but sooner or later you need a solid eight hours  right .   it was almost midnight  and there was vetinari at his desk  fresh as a daisy and chilly as morning dew .      are you sure about this  vimes .         carrot can look after things .  they   ve quietened down  anyway .  i think most of the serious troublemakers have headed for koom valley .         a good reason  one might say  for you not to go .  vimes  i have   agents for this sort of thing .         but you wanted me to hunt them down  sir .     vimes protested .      in koom valley .  at this time .  taking a force there now could have far reaching consequences  vimes .         good .  you told me to drag them into the light .  as far as they   re concerned  i am far reaching consequences .         well  certainly     said vetinari  after staring at vimes for longer than was comfortable .     and when you have boldly reached so far  you will need friends .  i shall make sure the low king is at least aware of your presence .         don   t worry  he   ll find out soon enough     growled vimes .     oh  yes .         i have no doubt he will .  he has his agents in our city  just as i have in his .  so i will do him the courtesy of telling him formally what he will in any case know .  that is called politics  vimes .  it is a thing we try to do in the government .         but   spies .  i thought we were chums with the low king .         of course we are     said vetinari .     and the more we know about each other  the friendlier we shall remain .  we   d hardly bother to spy on our enemies .  what would be the point .  is lady sybil happy to let you go .         she   s coming with me .  she insists .         is that safe .         is here safe .     said vimes  shrugging .     we had dwarfs coming up through the damn floor .  don   t worry  she and young sam will be kept out of harm   s way .  i   ll take fred and nobby .  and i want to take angua  sally  detritus  and cheery  too .  multi species  sir .  that always helps the politics .         and the summoning dark .  what about that  vimes .  oh  don   t look at me like that .  it   s common talk among the dwarfs .  one of the dying dwarfs put a curse on everyone who was in the mine  i   m told .         i wouldn   t know about that  sir     said vimes  resorting to the wooden expression that so often saw him through .     it   s mystic .  we don   t do mystic in the watch .         it   s not a joke  vimes .  it   s very old magic  i understand .  so old  indeed  that most dwarfs have forgotten that it is magic .  and it   s powerful .  it will be tracking them .         i   ll just look out for a big floaty eye with a tail  then  shall i .     said vimes .     that should make it easy .         vimes  i know you must be aware that the symbol is not the thing itself     said the patrician .      yessir .  i know .  but magic has no place in coppering .  we don   t use it to find culprits .  we don   t use it to get confessions .  because you can   t trust the bloody stuff  sir .  it   s got a mind of its own .  if there   s a curse chasing these bastards  well  that   s its business .  but if i reach    em first  sir  then they   ll be my prisoners and it   ll have to get past me .         vimes  archchancellor ridcully tells me he believes it may be a quasidemonic entity that is untold millions of years old .         i   ve said my piece  sir     said vimes  staring at a point just above lord vetinari   s head .     and it is my duty to catch up with these people .  i believe they may be able to help me with my inquiries .         but you have no evidence  vimes .  and you are going to need very solid evidence .         right .  so i want to bring them back here  eyeballs on a string or not .  them and their damn guards .  so   s i can inquire .  someone will tell me something .         and it   ll also be to your personal satisfaction .     said vetinari sharply .      is this a trick question  sir .         well done  well done     said vetinari softly .     lady sybil is a remarkable woman  vimes .         yessir .  she is .      vimes left .   after a while  vetinari   s chief clerk  drumknott  entered the room on velvet feet and placed a cup of tea in front of vetinari .      thank you  drumknott .  you were listening .         yes  sir .  the commander seemed very forthright .         they invaded his home  drumknott .         quite  sir .      vetinari leaned back  and stared at the ceiling .      tell me  drumknott  are you a betting man at all .         i have been known to have the occasional    little flutter     sir .         given  then  a contest between an invisible and very powerful quasidemonic thing of pure vengeance on the one hand  and the commander on the other  where would you wager  say   one dollar .         i wouldn   t  sir .  that looks like one that would go to the judges .         yes     said vetinari  staring thoughtfully at the closed door .     yes  indeed .          i don   t use magic  thought vimes  walking through the rain toward unseen university .  but  sometimes  i tell lies .   he avoided the main entrance and headed as circumspectly as possible for wizards    passage  where  halfway down  university access for all was available via several loose bricks .  generations of rascally drunk student wizards had used them to get back in late at night .  later on  they   d become very important and powerful wizards  with full beards and fuller stomachs  but had never lifted a finger to have the wall repaired .  it was  after all  traditional .  nor was it usually patrolled by the lobsters   who believed in tradition even more than the wizards .   on this occasion  though  one was lurking in the shadows  and jumped when vimes tapped him on the shoulder .     oh  it   s you commander vimes  sir .  it   s me  sir  wiggleigh  sir .  the archchancellor is waiting for you in the gardener   s hut  sir .  follow me  sir .  mum   s the word  eh  sir .      vimes trailed after wiggleigh across the dark  squelchy lawns .  oddly  though  he didn   t feel so tired now .  days and days of bad sleep and he felt quite fresh  in a fuzzy sort of way .  it was the smell of the chase  that   s what it was .  he   d pay for it later .   wiggleigh  looking both ways with a conspiratorial air that would have attracted instant attention had anyone been watching  opened the door of the garden shed .   there was a large figure waiting inside .      commander .     it bellowed happily .     what larks  eh .  very cloak and dagger .      only heavy rain could possibly muffle the voice of archchancellor ridcully when he was feeling cheerful .      could you keep it down a bit  archchancellor .     said vimes  shutting the door quickly .      sorry .  i mean  sorry     said the wizard .     do take a seat .  the compost sacks are quite acceptable .  well  er   how may i help you  sam .         can we agree for now that you can   t .     said vimes .      intriguing .  do continue     said ridcully  leaning closer .      you know i won   t have magic used in the watch     vimes went on .  as he sat down in the semidarkness  a coiled up hosepipe ambushed him from above  as they do  and he had to wrestle it to the shed floor .      i do  sir  and i respect you for it  although there are those that think you are a damn silly fool .         well       vimes said  trying to put    damn silly fool    behind him     the fact is  i must get to koom valley very fast .  er   very fast indeed .         one might say   magically fast .     said ridcully .      as it were     said vimes  fidgeting .  he really hated having to do this .  and what had he sat on .      mmm     said ridcully .     but without  i imagine  any significant hocus pocus .  you appear uncomfortable  sir .      vimes triumphantly held up a large onion .     sorry     he said  tossing it aside .     no  definitely no pocus .  possibly a little hocus .  i just need an edge .  they   ve got a day   s start on me .         i see .  you will be traveling alone .         no  there will have to be eleven of us .  two coaches .         my word .  and disappearing in a puff of smoke to reappear elsewhere is           out of the question .  i just need           an edge     said the wizard .     yes .  something magical in its cause but not in its effect .  nothing too obvious .         and no chance of anyone being turned into a frog or anything like that     said vimes quickly .      of course     said ridcully .  he clapped his hands together .     well  commander  i   m afraid we can   t help you .  meddling in things like this is not what wizarding is all about .     he lowered his voice and went on     we will particularly not be able to help you if you have the coaches  empty  around the back in  oh  call it about an hour .         oh .  er   right     said vimes  trying to catch up .     you   re not going to make them fly or anything  are you .         we   re not going to do anything  commander .     said ridcully jovially  slapping him on the back .     i thought that was agreed .  and i think also that you should leave now  although  of course  you have  in fact  not been here .  and neither have i .  i say  this spying business is pretty clever  eh .      when vimes was gone  mustrum ridcully sat back  lit his pipe  and  as an afterthought  used the last of the match to light the candle lantern on the potting table .  the gardener could get pretty acerbic if people messed about with his shed  so perhaps he ought to tidy up a bit     he stared at the floor  where a tumbled hosepipe and a fallen onion made what looked  at a casual glance  like a large eyeball with a tail .       the rain cooled vimes down .  it had cooled down the streets  too .  you have to be really keen to riot in the rain .  besides  news of last night had got around .  no one was sure  of course  and such were the effects of fluff and big hammer that a large if elementary school of thought had been left uncertain about what really happened .  they woke up feeling bad  right .  something must have happened .  and tonight the rain was setting in  so maybe it was better to stay in the pub .   he walked through the wet  whispering darkness  mind ablaze .   how fast could those dwarfs travel .  some of them sounded pretty old .  but they   d be tough and old .  even so  the roads in that direction were none too good  and a body could only stand so much shaking .   and sybil was taking young sam .  that was stupid  except that it   wasn   t stupid  not after dwarfs had broken into your home .  home was where you had to feel safe .  if you didn   t feel safe  it wasn   t home .  against all common sense  he agreed with sybil .  home was where they were together .  she   d already sent off an urgent clacks to some old chum of hers who lived near the valley  she seemed to think it was going to be some kind of family outing .   there was a group of dwarfs hanging around on a corner  heavily armed .  maybe the bars were all full  or maybe they needed cooling down  too .  no law against hanging around  right .   wrong  growled vimes as he drew nearer .  come along  boys .  say something wrong .  lay hold of a weapon .  move slightly .  breathe loudly .  give me something that could be stretched to    in self defense .     it   d be my word against yours  and believe me  lads  i   m unlikely to leave you capable of saying a single damn thing .   the dwarfs took one clear look at the approaching vision  haloed in torchlight and mist  and took to their heels .   right .       the entity known as the summoning dark sped through streets of eternal night  past misty buildings of memory that wavered at its passage .  it was getting there  it was getting there .  it was having to change the habits of millennia  but it was finding ways in  even if they were no bigger than keyholes .  it had never had to work this hard before  never had to move this fast .  it was   exhilarating .   but always  when it paused by some grating or unguarded chimney  it heard the pursuit .  it was slow  but it never stopped following .  sooner or later  it would catch up .       grag bashfullsson lodged in a subdivided cellar in cheap street .  the rent wasn   t much  but he had to admit that neither was the accommodation  he could lie on his very narrow bed and touch all four walls or  rather  three walls and a heavy curtain that separated his little space from that of the family of nineteen dwarfs that occupied the rest of the cellar .  but meals were included  and they respected his privacy .  it was something  to have a grag as a lodger  even if this one seemed rather young and showed his face .  it still impressed the neighbors .   on the other side of the curtain  children were squabbling  a baby was crying  and there was the smell of rat and cabbage casserole .  someone was sharpening an axe .  and someone else was snoring .  for a dwarf in ankh morpork  solitude was something that you had to cultivate on the inside .   books and papers filled the space that wasn   t bed .  bashfullsson   s desk was a board laid across his knees .  he was reading a battered book  its cover cracked and moldy  and the runes passing under his eye said     it has no strength in this world .  to fulfill any purpose  the dark must find a champion  a living creature it can bend to its will        bashfullsson sighed .  he   d read the phrase a dozen times  hoping he could make it mean something other than the obvious .  he copied the words into his notebook anyway .  then he put the notebook in his satchel  swung the satchel onto his back  went and paid toin footstamper two weeks    rent in advance  and stepped out into the rain .       vimes didn   t remember going to sleep .  he didn   t remember sleeping .  he surfaced from darkness when carrot shook him awake .      the coaches are in the yard  mister vimes .         fwisup .     murmured vimes  blinking in the light .      i   ve told people to load them up  sir  but           but what .     vimes sat up .      i think you   d better come and see  sir .          when vimes stepped out into the damp dawn  two coaches were indeed standing in the yard .  detritus was idly watching the loading  while leaning on the piecemaker .   carrot hurried over when he saw the commander .      it   s the wizards  sir     he said .     they   ve done something .      the coaches looked normal enough to vimes  and he said so .      oh  they look fine     said carrot .  he reached down and put his hand on the doorsill  and added     but they do this .      he lifted the laden coach over his head .      you shouldn   t be able to do that     said vimes .      that   s right  sir     said carrot  lowering the coach gently onto the cobbles .     it doesn   t get any heavier with people inside  either .  and if you come over here  sir  they   ve done something to the horses  too .         any idea what they   ve done  captain .         none whatsoever  sir .  the coaches were just outside the university .  haddock and i drove them down here .  very light  of course .  it   s the harnesses that are worrying me .  see here  sir .         i see the leather   s very thick     said vimes .     and what   re all these copper knobs .  something magical .         could be  sir .  something happens at thirteen miles an hour .  i don   t know what .     carrot patted the side of the coach  which slid away .      the thing is  sir  i don   t know how much of an edge this gives you .         what .  surely a weightless coach would           oh  it   ll help  sir  especially on the inclines .  but horses can only go so fast for so long  sir  and once they   ve got the coach moving  it   s a rolling weight and not so much of a problem .         thirteen miles an hour     vimes mused .     hmm .  that   s pretty fast .         well  the mail coaches are getting nine or ten miles an hour average on many runs now     said carrot .     but the roads will get a lot worse when you get near koom valley .         you don   t think it   ll take wing  do you .         i think the wizards would have said so if it was going to do something like that  sir .  but it   s funny you should mention it  because there   s seven broomsticks nailed underneath each coach .         what .  why don   t they just float out of the yard .         magic  sir .  i think they just compensate for the weight .         good grief  yes .  why didn   t i think of that .     said vimes sourly .     and that   s why i don   t like magic  captain .     cos it   s magic .  you can   t ask questions  it   s magic .  it doesn   t explain anything  it   s magic .  you don   t know where it comes from  it   s magic .  that   s what i don   t like about magic  it does everything by magic .         that   s the significant factor  sir  there   s no doubt about it     said carrot .     i   ll just see to the last of the packing  if you   ll excuse me        vimes glared at the coaches .  he probably shouldn   t have brought in the wizards  but where was the choice .  oh  they could probably have sent sam vimes all that way in a puff of smoke and the blink of an eye  but who   d actually arrive there  and who   d come back .  how would he know if it was him .  he was certain that people were not supposed to disappear like that .   sam vimes had always been  by nature  a pedestrian .  that   s why he was also going to take willikins  who knew how to drive .  he   d also demonstrated to vimes his ability to throw a common fish knife so hard that it was quite difficult to pull out of the wall .  at times like this  vimes liked to see a skill like that in a butler           s   cuse me  sir     said detritus  behind him .     could i have a word  pers   nal .         yes .  of course     said vimes .      i  er  hope what i said yesterday inna cells wasn   t goin    too           can   t remember a word of it     said vimes .   detritus look relieved .     thank you  sir .  er   i want to take young brick with us  sir .  he   s got no kin here  doesn   t even know what clan he is .  he   ll only get messed up again if i take my eye off   f him .  an    he   s never seen der mountains .  never been ouside der city  even .      there was a pleading look in the troll   s eyes .  vimes recollected that his marriage to ruby was happy but childless .      well  we don   t seem to have a weight problem     he said .     all right .  but you   re to keep an eye on him  okay .      the troll beamed .     yessir .  i   ll see you don   t regret it  sir .         breakfast  sam .     called sybil  from the doorway .  a nasty suspicion gripped vimes  and he hurried over to the other coach  where carrot was strapping on the last bag .      who packed the food .  did sybil pack the food .     he said .      i think so  sir .         was there   fruit .     said vimes  probing the horror .      i believe so  sir .  quite a lot .  and vegetables .         some bacon  surely .     vimes was nearly begging .     very good for a long journey  bacon .  it travels well .         i think it   s staying at home today     said carrot .     i have to tell you  sir  that lady sybil has found out about the bacon sandwich arrangement .  she said to tell you the game was up  sir .         i am the commander around here  you know     said vimes  with as much hauteur as he could muster on an empty stomach .      yes  sir .  but lady sybil has a very quiet way of being firm  sir .         she has  hasn   t she     said vimes as they strolled toward the building .     i   m a very lucky man  you know     he added  just in case carrot may have got the wrong impression .      yes  sir .  you are indeed .         captain .      they turned .  someone was hurrying through the gate .  he had two swords strapped to his back .      ah  special constable hancock     said carrot  stepping forward .     do you have something for me .         er   yes  captain .     hancock looked nervously at vimes .      this is official business  andy     said vimes reassuringly .      not much to give you  sir .  but i asked around  and a young lady sent at least two self coded droppers to bonk in the last week .  that means it goes to the main tower there and gets handed over to whoever turns up with the right authorization .  we don   t have to know who they are .         well done     said carrot .     any description .         young lady with short hair is the best i could get .  signed the message    aicalas .          vimes burst out laughing .     well  that   s about it .  thank you  special constable hancock  very much .         crime and the clacks is going to be a growing problem     said carrot sadly  when they were alone again .      quite likely  captain     said vimes .     but here and now we know that our sally is not being straight with us .         we can   t be certain it   s her  sir     said carrot .      oh no .     said vimes happily .     this quite cheers me up .  it   s one of the lesser known failings of the vampire .  no one knows why they do it .  it goes with having big windows and easily torn curtains .  a sort of undeath wish  you might say .  however clever they are  they can   t resist thinking that no one will recognize their name if they spell it backwards .  let   s go .      vimes turned back to head into the building  and noticed a small  neat figure standing patiently by the door .  it had the look of someone who was quite happy to wait .  he sighed .  i bargain without an axe in my hand  eh .      breakfast  mr .  bashfullsson .     he said .          this is all rather fun     said sybil an hour later as the coaches headed out of the city .     do you remember when we last went on holiday  sam .         that wasn   t really a holiday  dear     said vimes .  above them  young sam swung back and forth in a little hammock  cooing .      well  it was very interesting  all the same     said sybil .      yes  dear .  werewolves tried to eat me .      vimes sat back .  the coach was comfortably upholstered and well sprung .  at the moment  while it threaded through the traffic  the magical loss of weight was hardly noticeable .  would it mean anything .  how fast could a bunch of old dwarfs travel .  if they really had taken a big wagon  the coaches would catch them tomorrow  when the mountains were still a distant prospect .  in the meantime  at least he could get some rest .   he pulled out a battered volume titled walking in the koom valley  by eric wheelbrace  a man who apparently had walked on just about everything bigger than a sheep track in the near ramtops .    it had a sketch map  the only actual map of the valley vimes had seen .  eric wasn   t a half bad sketch artist .   koom valley was   well  koom valley was basically a drain  that   s what it was  nearly thirty miles of soft limestone rock edged by mountains of harder rock  so what you had would have been a canyon if it wasn   t so wide .  one end was almost on the snowline  the other merged into the plains .   it was said that even clouds kept away from the desolation that was koom valley .  maybe they did  but that didn   t matter .  the valley got the water anyway  from meltwater and the hundreds of waterfalls that poured over its walls from the mountains that cupped it .  one of those falls  the tears of the king  was half a mile high .   the koom river didn   t just rise in this valley .  it leapt and danced in this valley .  by the time it was halfway down this valley  it was a crisscrossing of thundering waters  forever merging and parting .  they carried and hurled great rocks  and played with whole fallen trees from the dripping forests colonizing the scree that had built up against the walls .  they gurgled into holes and rose again  miles away  as fountains .  they had no mapable course   a good storm higher up in the mountains could bring house sized rocks and half a stricken woodland down in the flood  blocking the sinkholes and piling up dams .  some of these could survive for years  becoming little islands in the leaping waters  growing little forests and little meadows and colonies of big birds .  then some key rock would be shifted by a random river  and within an hour  it would all be gone .   nothing that couldn   t fly lived in the valley  at least for long .  the dwarfs had tried to tame it  back before the first battle .  it hadn   t worked .  hundreds of trolls and dwarfs had been swept up in the famous flood  and many had ever been found again .  koom valley had taken them all into its sinkholes and chambers and caverns  and had kept them .   there were places in the valley where a man could drop a colored cork into a swirling sinkhole and wait for more than twenty minutes before it bobbed up on a fountain less than a dozen yards away .   eric himself had seen this trick done by a guide  vimes read  who   d demanded half a dollar for the demonstration .  oh yes  people visited the valley  human sightseers  poets and artists looking for inspiration in the ragged  uncompromising wildness .  and there were human guides who   d take them up there  for a hefty price .  for a few extra dollars  they   d tell the history of the place .  they   d tell you how the wind in the rocks  and the roaring of the waters  carried the sounds of ancient battle  continuing in death .  they   d say  maybe all those trolls and dwarfs the valley took are still fighting  down there in the dark maze of caves and thundering torrents .   one admitted to eric that when he was a boy  during a cool summer when the meltwaters were pretty low  he   d roped down into one of the sinkholes  because  like all such stories  the history of koom valley wouldn   t have been complete without rumors of vast treasures swept down into the dark  and had himself heard  above the sound of the water  battle noises and the shouting of dwarfs  no sir  honestly sir  it chilled my blood so it did  sir  why  thank you very much  sir     vimes sat up in his seat .   was that true .  if that man had gone a little further  would he have found the little talking cube that methodia rascal had been unlucky enough to take home .  eric had dismissed it as an attempt to scrounge another dollar  and probably it was  but   no  the cube would surely have been long gone by then .  even so .  it was an intriguing thought .   the driver   s hatch slid back .      outside the city  sir  clear road ahead     willikins reported .      thank you .     vimes stretched  and looked across at sybil .     well  this is where we find out .  hang on to young sam .         i   m sure mustrum wouldn   t do anything dangerous  sam     said sybil .      i don   t know about that     said vimes  opening the door .     i   m sure he wouldn   t mean to .      he swung himself out and hauled himself on the roof of the coach  with a helping hand from detritus .   the coach was moving well .  the sun was shining .  on either side of the highway  the cabbage fields lent their gentle perfume to the air .   vimes settled down beside the butler .      okay     he said .     everyone holding on to something .  good .  let    em go .      willikins cracked the whip .  there was a mild jolt as the horses stretched  and vimes felt the coach speed up .   and that seemed to be it .  he   d expected something a little more impressive .  they were gradually going faster  yes  but that in itself didn   t seem very magical .      i reckon about twelve miles an hour now  sir     said willikins .     that   s pretty good .  they   re running well without        something was happening to the harnesses .  the copper discs were sparking .      look at der cabbages  sir .     detritus shouted .   on either side of the road  cabbages were bursting into flames and rocketing out of the ground .  and still the horses went faster .      it   s about power .     yelled vimes  above the wind .     we   re running on cabbages .  and the        he stopped .  the rear two horses were rising gently in the air .  as he stared  the lead pair rose  too .   he risked turning in his seat .  the other coach was keeping up with them  he could clearly see fred colon   s pink face  staring ahead in rigid terror .   when vimes turned back to look ahead  all four horses were off the ground .   and there was a fifth horse  larger than the other five  and transparent .  it was visible only because of the dust and the occasional glint of light off an invisible flank  it was  in fact  what you got if you took away a horse but left the movement of a horse  the speed of a horse  the   spirit of a horse  that part of a horse which came alive in the rushing of the wind .  the part of a horse that was  in fact  horse .   there was hardly any sound now .  perhaps sound was unable to keep up .      sir .     said willikins quietly .      yes .     said vimes  his eyes streaming .      it took us less than a minute to go that last mile .  i timed us between milestones  sir .         sixty miles in an hour .  don   t be daft  man .  a coach can   t go that fast .         just as you say  sir .      a milestone flashed past .  out of the corner of his ear  willikins heard vimes counting under his breath until  before very long  another stone fell away behind them .      wizards  eh .     said vimes weakly  staring ahead again .      indeed  sir     said willikins .     may i suggest that once we are through quirm  we head straight across the grass country .         the roads up there are pretty bad  you know     said vimes .      so i believe  sir .  however  that will not  in fact  matter     said the butler  not taking his eyes off the unrolling road ahead .      why not .  if we try to go at speed over those rough           i was referring obliquely  sir  to the fact that we are not precisely touching the ground anymore .      vimes  clinging with care to the rail  looked over the side .  the wheels were turning idly .  the road  just below them  was a blur .  ahead of them  the spirit of the horse galloped serenely onwards .      there   s plenty of coaching inns around quirm     he said .     we could  er  stop for lunch .         late breakfast  sir .  mail coach ahead  sir .  hold tight .      a tiny square block on the road ahead was getting bigger quite fast .  willikins twitched on the reins  vimes had a momentary vision of rearing horses  and the mail coach was a dwindling dot  soon hidden by the smoke of flaming brassicas .      dem milestones is goin    past real fast now     detritus observed in a conversational tone of voice .  behind him  brick lay flat on the roof of the coach with his eyes shut tight  having never before been in a world where the sky went all the way to the ground  there were brass rails around the top of the coach  and he was leaving fingerprints in them .      could we try braking .     said vimes .     look out .  haycart .         that only stops the wheels spinning  sir .     yelled willikins as the cart went by with a whoom and fell back into the distance .      try pulling on the reins a little .         at this speed  sir .      vimes slid back the hatch behind him .  sybil had young sam on her knee  and was pulling a wooly jumper over his head .      is everything all right  dear .     he ventured .   she looked up and smiled .     lovely  smooth ride  sam .  aren   t we going rather fast  though .         er   could you please sit with your back to the horses .     said sam .     and hold on tight to young sam .  it might be a bit   bumpy .      he watched her shift seats .  then he shut the hatch  and yelled to willikins .      now .      nothing seemed to happen .  in vimes   s mind  the milestones were already going zip   zip as they flashed past .   then the flying world slowed  while in the fields on either side hundreds of burning cabbages leapt toward the sky  trailing oily smoke .  the horse of light and air disappeared  and the real horses dropped gently to the road  going from floating statues to beasts in full gallop without a stumble .   he heard a brief scream as the rear coach tore past and swerved into a field full of cauliflowers  where  eventually  it squelched to a flatulent halt .  and then there was stillness  except for the occasional thud of a falling cabbage .  detritus was comforting brick  who   d not picked a good day to go cold turkey  it was turning out to be frozen roc .   a skylark  safely above cabbage range  sang in the blue sky .  below  except for the whimpering of brick  all was silent .   absentmindedly  vimes pulled a half cooked leaf off his helmet and flicked it away .      well  that was fun     he said  his voice a little distant .   he got down carefully and opened the coach door .      everyone all right in here .     he said .      yes .  why have we stopped .     said sybil .      we ran out of   er  well  we just ran out     said vimes .     i   d better go and check that everyone else is all right        the milestone nearby proclaimed that it was but two miles to quirm .  vimes fished out the gooseberry as a red hot cabbage smacked into the road behind him .      good morning .     he said brightly to the surprised imp .     what is the time  please .         er   nine minutes to eight  insert name here     said the imp .      so that would mean a speed slightly above one mile a minute     mused vimes .     very good .      moving like a sleepwalker  he walked into the field on the other side of the road and followed the trail of stricken  steaming greens until he reached the other coach .  people were climbing out of it .      everyone okay .     he said .     breakfast today will be boiled cabbage  baked cabbage  fried cabbage       he stepped smartly aside as a steaming cauliflower hit the ground and exploded       and cauliflower surprise .  where   s fred .         looking for somewhere to throw up     said angua .      good man .  we   ll take a minute or two to rest here  i think .      with that  sam vimes walked back to the milestone  sat down next to it  put his arms around it  and held on tight until he felt better .       you could catch up with the dwarfs long before they   re near koom valley .  good grief  at the speed we did earlier you   d have to watch out in case you smash into the back of them .   vimes   s thoughts nagged at him as willikins drove the coach  at a very sedate speed  out of quirue and then  on a clear stretch of road  unleashed the hidden horsepower until they were bowling along at forty miles every hour .  that seemed quite fast enough .   no one was hurt  after all .  you could get to koom valley by nightfall .   yes  but that was not the plan .   okay  he thought  but what was the plan  exactly .  well  it helped that sybil knew more or less everybody  or at least everybody who was female  of a certain age  and who had been to the quirm college for young ladies at the same time as sybil .  there appeared to be hundreds of them .  they all seemed to have names like bunny or bubbles  they kept in touch meticulously  they   d all married influential or powerful men  they all hugged one another when they met  and went on about the good old days in form  b or whatever  and if they acted together  they could probably run the world or  it occurred to vimes  might already be doing so .   they were ladies who organize .   vimes did his best  but he could never keep track of them .  a web of correspondence held them all together  and he marveled at sybil   s ability to be concerned over the problems of a child  whom she   d never met  of a woman she hadn   t seen in twenty five years .  it was a female thing .   so they would be staying in the town near the foot of the valley  with a lady currently known only as bunty  whose husband was the local magistrate .  according to sybil  he had his own police force .  vimes translated this  in the privacy of his head  as    he   s got his own gang of thuggish  toothless  evil smelling thief takers    since that was what you generally got in these little towns .  still  they might be useful .   beyond that   there was no plan .  he intended to find the dwarfs and capture and drag as many as possible back to ankh morpork .  but that was an intention  not a plan .  it was a firm intention  though .  five people had been murdered .  you couldn   t just turn your back on that .  he   d drag    em back and lock them up and throw everything at    em and see what stuck .  he doubted it they had many friends now .  of course  it   d get political  it always did  but at least people would know that he   d done all he could  and it was the best he could do .  with any luck  it would stop anyone else getting funny ideas .   and then there was the damn secret  but it occurred to him that if he did find it  and it simply was proof that the dwarfs ambushed the trolls or the trolls ambushed the dwarfs or they both ambushed each other at the same time  well  he might as well drop it down a hole .  it really wouldn   t change anything .  and it was unlikely to be a pot of gold  people didn   t take a lot of money onto battlefields  because there wasn   t very much to spend it on .   anyway  it had been a good start .  they   d clawed some time  hadn   t they .  they could keep up a cracking pace and change horses at every staging inn  couldn   t they .  why was he trying to persuade himself .  it made sense to slow down .  it was dangerous to go fast .      if we keep up this pace  we might get there the day after tomorrow  right .     he said to willikins as they rattled on between stands of young maize .      if you say so  sir     said willikins .  vimes noted the hint of diplomacy .      you don   t think so .     he said .     come on  you can speak your mind .         well  sir  those dwarfs want to get there fast  d   you think .     said willikins .      i expect so .  i don   t think they want to hang around .  so .         so i   m just puzzled that you think they   ll be using the road  sir .  they could use broomsticks  couldn   t they .         i suppose so     vimes conceded .     but the archchancellor would have told me if they   d done that  surely .         begging your pardon  sir  but what business would it be of his .  they wouldn   t have to bother the gentlemen at the university .  everyone knows the best broomsticks are made by the dwarfs  up at copperhead .      the coach rolled on .   after a while  vimes inquired  in the voice of one who has been thinking deeply     they   d have to travel at night  though .  they   d be spotted otherwise .         very true  sir     said willikins  staring ahead .   there was more thoughtful silence .      do you think this thing could jump fences .     said vimes .      i   m game to give it a try  sir     said willikins .     i think the wizards put some thought into all this .         and how fast do you think it could go  for the sake of argument .     said vimes .      dunno  sir .  but i   ve got a feeling it might be pretty fast .  a hundred miles in an hour  maybe .         you really think so .  that means we could be halfway there in a couple of hours .         well  you did say you wanted to get there fast  sir     said willikins .   this time  the silence went on longer  before vimes said     all right  stop somewhere .  i want to make sure that everyone knows what we   re going to do .         happy to do that  sir     said willikins .     it   ll give me a chance to tie my hat on .          what vimes remembered most of all about that journey    and there was so much of it he wanted to forget   was the silence .  and the softness .   oh  he could feel the wind in his face  but it was only a breeze  even when the ground was a flat green blur .  the air was shaping itself around them .  when vimes experimentally held up a piece of paper a foot above his head  it blew away in an instant .   the corn exploded  too .  as the coach approached  the green shoots grew out of the ground as if dragged  and then burst like fireworks .   the corn belt was giving way to cattle country  when willikins said     you know  sir  this thing steers itself .  watch .      he lowered the reins as a patch of woodland approached .  the scream had hardly formed in vimes   s throat before the coach curved around the woodland and then swung delicately back onto its original course .      don   t do that again  please .     said vimes .      all right  sir  but it   s steering itself .  i don   t think i could make it run into anything .         don   t try .     vimes said quickly .     and i swear i saw a cow explode back there .  keep us away from towns and people  will you .      behind the coach  turnips and rocks leapt into the air and bounced away in the opposite direction .  vimes hoped they wouldn   t get into trouble about that .    the other thing that vimes noticed was the landscape ahead was strangely bluish  while behind them it had a relatively red tint .  he didn   t like to point this out  though  in case it sounded strange .   they had to stop twice to get directions  and were twenty miles from koom valley at half past five .  there was a coaching inn .  they sat out in its yard .  no one spoke much .  apart from the speed hungry willikins  the only people not shaken by the journey were sybil and young sam  who seemed quite happy  and detritus  who had watched the world skim past with every sign of enjoyment .  brick was still facedown on the coach roof  holding tight .      ten hours     said fred colon .     and that included lunch and stoppin    to be sick .  i can   t believe it           i don   t fink people are s   posed to go this fast     nobby moaned .     i fink my brain   s still back home .         well  if we   re going to have to wait for it to catch up  nobby  i   ll buy a house here  shall i .     said fred .   nerves were frayed  brains were jogging behind   this is why i don   t like magic  thought vimes .  but we   re here  and it   s amazing how the inn   s beer helped recovery .      we might even be able to have a quick look at koom valley before it gets dark     he ventured  to general groaning .      no  sam .  everyone needs a meal and a rest .     said sybil .     let   s go into town like proper people  nice and slowly  and everyone will be fresh for tomorrow .         lady sybil is right  commander     said bashfullsson .     i wouldn   t advise going up to the valley at night  even at this time of the year .  it   s so easy to get lost .         in a valley .     said vimes .      oh yes  sir     cheery chimed in .     you   ll see why  sir .  and mostly  if you get lost  you die .      on the sedate journey into town  and because it was six o   clock  vimes read where   s my cow .  to young sam .  in fact  it became a communal effort .  cheery obliged by handling the chicken noises  an area in which vimes felt he was somewhat lacking  and detritus delivered a hruuugh .  that rattled the windows .  grag bashfullsson  against all expectation  managed a very passable pig .  to young sam  watching with eyes like saucers  it was indeed the show of the year .       bunty was surprised to see them so soon  but ladies who organize are seldom thrown by guests arriving unexpectedly early .   it turned out bunty was berenice waynesbury  n  e mouse father  which must have come as a relief  with a daughter who was married and lived just outside quirm and a son who   d had to go to fourecks in a hurry over a complete misunderstanding but was now into sheep in a big way and she hoped sybil and of course his grace would be able to stay until saturday because she   d invited simply everybody and wasn   t young sam simply adorable   and so on  right up to       and we   ve cleaned out one of the stables for your trolls    said with a happy smile .   before sybil or vimes could say a word  detritus had removed his helmet and bowed .      t   ank you very much  missus     he said gravely     you know  sometimes people forget to clean dem out first .  it   s dem little touches dat mean a lot .         why  thank you     said bunty .     how charming .  i   ve  er  never seen a troll wearing clothing before           i can take dem off if you like     said detritus .  at which point  sybil took bunty gently by the arm and said     let me introduce you to everybody else        mr .  waynesbury  the magistrate  wasn   t the venal pocket liner vimes had expected .  he was thin  tall  and didn   t say a great deal  and spent his time at home in a study filled with law books  pipes  and fishing tackle  he dispensed justice in the mornings  fished during the afternoon  and charitably forgave vimes for his total lack of interest in dry flies .   the local town of ham on koom made a good living off the river .  when the koom hit the plains  it widened and slowed and was more full of fish than a tin of sardines .  marshes spread out on either side  too  with deep and hidden lakes that were the home and feeding ground of innumerable birds .   oh   and there were the skulls  too .      i am the coroner as well     he told vimes as he unlocked a cupboard in his desk .     we get a few bones washed down here every spring .  mostly tourists  of course .  they really will not take advice  alas .  but sometimes we get things that are of more   historical interest .     he put a dwarf skull on the leather desktop .      about a hundred years old     he said .     from the last big battle  a hundred years ago .  we get the occasional piece of armor  too .  we put it all in the charnel house  and occasionally the dwarfs or the trolls come with a cart to sort through it and carry it away .  they take it very seriously .         any treasure .     said vimes .      hah .  not that i get told about .  but i   d hear about it if there was anything big .     the magistrate sighed .     every year people come to search for it .  sometimes they are lucky .         they find gold .         no  but they get back alive .  the others .  they wash up out of the caves  in the fullness of time .     he selected a pipe from a rack on his desk and began to fill it .     i   m amazed that anyone feels it necessary to take weapons up the valley .  it   ll kill you on a whim .  will you take one of my lads  commander .         i have my own guide     said vimes  and then added     but thank you .      mr .  waynsbury puffed his pipe .      as you wish  of course     he said .     i shall watch the river  in any case .          angua and sally had been put in the same bedroom .  angua tried to feel good about that .  the woman wasn   t to know .  anyway  it was nice to get between clean sheets  even if the room had a slightly musty smell .  more must  less vampire  she thought  look on the bright side .   in the darkness  she opened one eye .   someone had moved silently across the room .  they   d made no noise but  nevertheless  their passage had stirred the air and changed the texture of the subtle night sounds .   they were at the window now .  it was bolted shut  and a faint noise was probably the bolt being slipped back .   it was easy to tell when the window itself was opened  new scents flooded in .   there was a creak that possibly only a werewolf would have heard  followed by a sudden rustling of many leathery wings .  little leathery wings .   angua shut her eye again .  the little minx .  maybe sally just didn   t care anymore .  no point in trying to follow her  though .  she debated the wisdom of shutting the window and bolting the door  just to see what excuses sally came up with  but dismissed it .  no good telling mister vimes yet  either  what could she prove .  it   d all be put down to the werewolf vampire thing         and now koom valley stretched away ahead of vimes  and he could see why he hadn   t made plans .  you couldn   t make plans for koom valley .  it   d laugh at them .  it would push them away  like it pushed away roads .      of course  you   re seeing it at its best at this time of year     said cheery .      by    best    you mean    .     vimes prompted .      well  it   s not actually trying to murder us  sir .  and there   s the birds .  and when the sun   s right  you get some wonderful rainbows .      there were lots of birds .  insects bred like mad in the wide  shallow pools and dams that littered the floor of the valley in late spring .  most of them would be dry by the late summer  but for now koom valley was a smorgasbord of things that went bzz .  and the birds had come up from the plains to feast on all of it .  vimes wasn   t good at birds  but they mostly looked like swallows  millions of them .  there were nests on the nearest cliff  a good half mile away  and vimes could hear the chattering from here .  and where trees and rocks had piled up in dams  saplings and green plants had sprouted .   below the narrow track the party had taken  water gushed from half a dozen caves and joined together for one wild waterfall into the plain .      it   s all so   so alive     said angua .     i was expecting just barren rock .         dat   s what it like up at der battle place     said detritus  spray glistening on his skin .     my dad took me up dere when we were comin    to der city .  he showed me dis kind o    rocky place  hit me on der head  and said     remember .             remember what .     said sally .      he didn   t say .  so i just  you know  gen   rally remembered .      i didn   t expect this  vimes thought .  it   s so   chaotic .  oh  well  let   s get clear of the cliff wall  at least .  all these bloody great boulders must have got here from somewhere .      i can smell smoke     angua announced after a while as they made their way unsteadily across the debris strewn track .      campfires from up the valley     said cheery .     early arrivals  i expect .         you mean people queue up for a place in the battle .     said vimes .     watch this boulder  it   s slippery .         oh  yes .  the fighting doesn   t start until koom valley day .  that   s tomorrow .         damn  i lost track .  will it affect us down here .      bashfullsson coughed politely .     i don   t think so  commander .  this area is too dangerous to fight in .         well  yes  i can see it would be terrible if anyone got hurt     said vimes  climbing over a long heap of rotting timber .     that would spoil the day for everyone .      historical re creation  he thought glumly as they picked their way across  under  over  or through the boulders and insect buzzing heaps of splintered timber  with streamlets running everywhere .  only we do it with people dressing up and running around with blunt weapons  and people selling hot dogs  and the girls all miserable because they can only dress up as wenches  wenching being the only job available to women in the olden days .   but the dwarfs and the trolls   they fight it again  for real .  like  perhaps  if they fight it enough times  they   ll get it right .   now there was a hole in the track in front of him  half blocked with the winter   s debris  but still managing to swallow a whole streamlet .  it poured  foaming  into the depths .  there was a booming noise  far below .  when he knelt down and touched the water  it was so cold it stung .      yes  watch out for sinkholes  commander     said bashfullsson .     this is limestone .  water wears it away quite quickly .  we   ll probably see some much bigger ones .  often they   re hidden by rotting debris .  watch where you tread .         don   t they get blocked up .         oh  yes  sir .  you   ve seen the size of the rocks that roll down here .         it must be like a giant game of billiards .         something like that  i expect     said bashfullsson carefully .   after ten minutes  vimes sat down on a log  pulled out his helmet  took out a big red handkerchief  and wiped his forehead .      it   s getting hotter     he said .     and everywhere in this bloody place looks the same   ow .      he slapped at his wrist .      the midges can be a bit extreme  sir     cheery volunteered .     it   s said that when they bite extra hard  there   s a storm coming .      they both looked up at the mountains .  there was a yellow haze at the far end of the valley  and clouds between the peaks .      oh  good     said vimes .     because it feels like that bite went to the bone .         i wouldn   t worry too much  commander     said cheery .     the big koom valley storm was a once in a lifetime occurrence .         it certainly was a lifetime if you were caught in it     said vimes .     this damn place is getting to me  i don   t mind admitting it .      by now  the rest of the squad had caught up .  sally and detritus were visibly suffering from the heat .  the vampire sat down in the shade of a big rock without saying anything .  brick lay down by the icy stream and stuck his head in it .      i   m afraid i   m not much help here  sir     said angua .     i can smell dwarf  but that   s about it .  there   s just too much damn water everywhere .         maybe we won   t need your nose     said vimes .  he unslung the tube that contained sybil   s sketch  unrolled the drawing  and pinned the ends together .      give me a hand with this  will you  cheery .     he said .     everyone else  get some rest .  and don   t laugh .      he lowered the circlet of mountains over his head .  there was a cough from angua  which he pretended to ignore .      okay     said vimes  turning the stiff paper to get the mountains lined up just above their penciled outlines .     that   s copperhead over there  and cori celesti over there   and they line up pretty well against the drawing .  we   re practically on top of it already .         not really  commander     said bashfullsson behind him .     they   re both almost four hundred miles away .  they   d look pretty much the same from anywhere in this part of the valley .  you need to look at the nearer peaks .      vimes turned .      okay .  what   s that one that looks really steep on the left hand side .         that is the king  sir     said cheery .     he   s about ten miles away .         really .  he looks closer        vimes found the mountain on the drawing .     and that small one over there .     he said .     the one with two peaks .         i don   t know the name  sir  but i can see the one you mean .         they   re too small and too close together       vimes muttered .      then walk toward them  sir .  mind where you   re putting your feet .  only tread on bare rock .  keep off piles of debris .  the grag is right .  it could be over an old sinkhole and you might drop right through .         o kay .  about halfway between them is that funny shaped little outcrop .  i   ll head directly for it .  you watch where i   m putting my feet  too  will you .      trying to keep the paper level  stumbling on rocks  splashing through ice rivulets  vimes walked the lonesome valley        damn and blast .         sir .      vimes peered over the top of his ring of paper .     i   ve lost the king .  that damn great ridge of boulders is in the way .  hold on   i can see that mountain with the chunk taken out of it        it looked so simple .  it would have been simple if koom valley had been flat and not littered with rubbish like the ten pin bowling alley of the gods .  in some places  they had to backtrack  because a wall of tangled  stinking  gnat infested timber blocked the way .  or the barrier was a wall of rocks the length of a street .  or a wide  mist filled  thundering cauldron of white water that elsewhere would have a name like the devil   s cauldron but here was nameless  because this was koom valley and for koom valley there just weren   t enough devils and they didn   t have enough cauldrons .   and the flies stung  and the sun shone  and the rotting wood and damp air and lack of wind created a sticky  swamp like miasma that seemed to weaken the muscles .   no wonder they fought at the other end of the valley  vimes thought .  there was air and wind up there .  at least you   d be comfortable .   sometimes they   d come out into a clear stretch that looked quite like the scene that methodia rascal had painted  but the nearby mountains didn   t quite match up  and it was off again into the maze .  you had to detour  and then detour around the detour .   at last  vimes sat down on a bleached  crumbling log and put the paper aside .      we must   ve missed it     he said  panting .     or rascal didn   t get the mountains quite right .  or maybe even a slice of mountain fell off in the last hundred years .  it could have happened .  we could be twenty feet away from whatever it is we   re looking for and still miss it .     he slapped a gnat off his wrist .      cheer up  sir  i think we   re fairly close     said cheery .      why .  what makes you think that .     said vimes  wiping his brow .      because i think you may be sitting on the painting  sir .  it   s very dirty  but that looks like rolled up canvas to me .      vimes stood up quickly  and inspected the log .  one corner of what he   d taken to be yellow gray bark peeled back to reveal paint on the other side .      and those timbers over there       cheery began but stopped  because vimes had raised a finger to his lips .   there were  indeed  some long  thin pine saplings lying nearby  stripped of all branches .  they would have gone unnoticed if it wasn   t for the presence of the rolled up painting .   they did just what we did  vimes thought .  it was probably easier  if they had enough dwarfs to hold up the painting  the mountains would be properly colored  not just pencil lines  and it would be more accurate on the bigger canvas .  they could take their time  too .  they thought they were well ahead of me .  all they were worried about was some bloody mystic symbol .   he drew his sword and beckoned cheery to follow him .   there   s not just dark dwarfs here  then  he thought  creeping around the nearby rocks .  they wouldn   t have stood out here in daylight .  so let   s see how many stayed on guard     none  as it turned out .  it was something of an anticlimax .  beyond the rocks was the spot that x would have marked  if there had been an x .   they must have been really confident  vimes realized .  by the look if it  they   d moved tons of rock and stricken timber  and there were the crowbars to prove it .   right now would be a really good time for angua and the others to catch us up  he decided .   in front of them was a hole about six feet wide .  a steel bar had been laid across it  bedded into two freshly chiseled grooves  and from the bar a stout rope disappeared into the depths .  from far below came the thunder of dark waters .      mr .  rascal must   ve been a brave man to stand here     said vimes .      i expect it was a plugged hole a hundred years ago     said cheery .      i   ll tell you what     said vimes  kicking a pebble into the dark .     pretend i   m a city man who doesn   t know a bloody thing about caves  why don   t you .         it   s what you get when a hole gets blocked  sir     said cheery patiently .     mr .  rascal probably just had to climb down onto a plug of debis .      this is the place .   so   this is where he found the talking cube  vimes thought .  ignoring cheery   s protests  because he was the commander around here  he swung down onto the rope and lowered himself a few feet .   there  tucked under the lip of the hole  a stubby piece of iron was rusted into the rock .  a few links of equally rusted chain hung from it .   it sang in its chains        there was a note about the thing being in chains     he said .     well  there   s some chain here  and what could be the stub of a knife .         dwarf steel  sir .     said cheery reproachfully .     it does last .         it could last all that time .         oh yes .  i expect the sink became a fountain for a while since rascal   s day  and forced the blockage out .  that sort of thing happens all the time in koom va   er  what are you doing  sir .      vimes was staring down into the darkness .  below  unseen  dark waters churned .  so   the messenger climbed up this hole  he thought .  where to hide the cube safely .   there could be trolls up above .  but a fighting dwarf would have a dagger  certainly  and they love chains .  yes   here would be a good place .  and he   d be back soon  anyway        old men climbed down this .     he said  staring down the rope into the dark .      old dwarfs  sir .  yes .  we   re strong for our size .  you   re not going down  are you  sir .      there   s a side tunnel down there        there must be a side tunnel down there     said vimes .  thunder rumbled  far up in the mountains .      but the others will be here soon  sir .  aren   t you rushing things .      don   t wait for them        no .  tell them to follow me .  look  we   ve lost time .  i can   t hang around all day .      cheery hesitated  and then pulled something out of a pouch on her belt .      then at least take these  sir     she said .  he grabbed the little package as it fell .  it was surprisingly heavy .      waxed matches  sir  they don   t get wet .  and the wrapping will burn like a torch for at least four minutes .  there   s a small loaf of dwarf bread  too .         well   thank you     said vimes to the worried round shadow against the yellow sky .     look  i   ll see if there   s any light down there  and if there isn   t  i   ll come straight back .  i   m not that daft .      he let himself slide on down the rope .  there was a knot every couple of feet .  the air was winter cold after the heat of the valley .  fine spray came up from below .   there was a tunnel  well above the cauldron .  he could make himself believe there was light in the distance  too .  well  he wasn   t stupid .  he needed to     let go     his hands loosened their grip .  he didn   t even have time to swear before the water closed over him .       vimes opened his eyes .  after a while  moving his arm slowly  because of the pain  he found his face and checked that his eyelids were  indeed  open .   what bits of his body weren   t aching .  he checked .  no  there seemed to be none .  his ribs were carrying the melody of pain  but knees  elbows  and head were all adding trills and arpeggios .  every time he shifted to ease the agony  it moved somewhere else .  his head ached as if someone was hammering on his eyeballs .   he groaned  and coughed up water .   gritty sand was under him .  he could hear the rush of water somewhere nearby  but the sand under him was merely damp .  and that didn   t seem right .   he risked turning over  a process that extracted a considerable amount of groan .   he could remember the icy water .  there had been no question of swimming .  all he   d been able to do was roll himself into a ball as the water threw and scraped and banged him through the bagatelle board of koom valley .  he   d gone over an underground waterfall once  he was sure  and had managed to suck in a breath before being whisked onward .  and then there was depth  and pressure  and his life started to unroll before his eyes  and his last thought had been please  please  can we skip the bit with mavis trouncer     and now he was here on an invisible beach  totally out of the water .  but this place surely didn   t have tides .   so someone was somewhere in the blackness  watching him .  that was it .  they   d pulled him out and now they were watching him     he opened his eyes again .  some of the pain was gone  leaving stiffness as payment .  he had a feeling that time had passed .  the darkness pressed in on all sides  thick as velvet .   he rolled back with more groans  and this time managed to push himself onto his hands and knees .      who   s there .     he mumbled  and  very carefully  got to his feet .   being upright seemed to shake his brain into gear again .      anyone there .     the darkness swallowed the sound .  anyway  what would he have done if something had said    yes .      he drew his sword and held it out in front of him as he shuffled forward .  after a dozen steps  it clinked against rock .      matches     he mumbled .     got matches .      he found the wax bundle and  working his clammy fingers slowly  drew out one match .  scraping the wax off the head with his thumb  he struck it against the stone .   the glare hurt his eyes .  look  quick .  flowing water  smooth sand  hand and footprints coming out of the water  one set only .  yes .  walls looked dry  small cave  darkness over there  way out     vimes limped toward the oval entrance as quick as he could while the match spat and fizzed in his hand .   there was a bigger cave here  so big that the blackness in it seemed to suck all the light from the match  which scorched his fingers and died .   the heavy darkness closed in again  like curtains  and now he knew what the dwarfs meant .  this wasn   t the darkness of a hood  or a cellar  or even of their shallow little mine .  he was a long way below the ground here  and the weight of all that darkness bore down on him .   now and again  a drop of water went plink into some unseen pool .   vimes staggered onwards .  he knew he was bleeding .  he didn   t know why he was walking  but he did know that he had to .   maybe he   d find daylight .  maybe he   d find a log that had been washed in here  and float his way out .  he wasn   t going to die  not down here in the dark  a long way from home .   a lot of water was dripping in this cavern .  a lot of it was going down his neck right now  but there were plinks on every side .  hah  water trickling down your neck and odd noises in the shadows   well  that   s when we find out if we   ve got a real copper  right .  but there were no shadows here .  it wasn   t light enough .   perhaps that poor sod of a dwarf had wandered through here .  but he found a way out .  maybe he knew the way  maybe he had a rope  maybe he was young and limber   and so he   d got out  dying on his feet  and tucked away the treasure  out of the way  and then went down the valley  walking through his grave .  that   s how it could take people .  he remembered mrs .  oldsburton  who went mad after her baby died  cleaning everything in the house  every cup  wall  ceiling  and spoon  not seeing anybody or hearing anything  just working all day and all night .  something in the head went click  and you found something to do  anything  to stop yourself thinking .   best to stop thinking that the way out the dwarf had found had been the one vimes had dropped in by  and he had no idea where that was now .   maybe he could simply jump back in the water  knowing what he was doing this time  and maybe he   d make it all the way down to the river before the turbulent currents battered him to death .  maybe he     why the hell had he let go of that rope .  it had been like that little voice that whispers    jump    when you   re at a cliff edge  or    touch the fire .     you didn   t listen  of course .  at least most people didn   t  most of the time .  well  a voice had said    let go     and he had     he shuffled on  aching and bleeding  while the dark curled its tail around him .          he   ll be back soon  you know     said sybil .     even if it   s at the very last minute .      out in the hall  a big grandfather clock had just stopped chiming half past five .      i   m sure he will     said bunty .  they were bathing young sam .      he   s never late     sybil went on .     he says if you   re late for a good reason you   ll be late for a bad one .  and it   s only half past five  anyway .         plenty of time     bunty agreed .      fred and nobby did take the horses up to the valley  didn   t they .     said sybil .      yes  sybil .  you watched them go     said bunty .  she looked over sybil   s head to the gaunt figure of her husband  who was standing in the hall doorway .  he shrugged hopelessly .      only the other day  he was running up the stairs as the clocks were striking six     sybil said  calmly soaping young sam with a sponge shaped like a teddy bear .     the very last second .  you wait and see .          he wanted to sleep .  he   d never felt this tired before .  vimes slumped to his knees  and then fell sideways onto the sand .   when he forced his eyes open  he saw pale stars above him  and had  once again  the sensation that there was someone else present .   he turned his head  wincing at the stab of pain  and saw a small but brightly lit folding chair on the sand .  a robed figure was reclining in it  reading a book .  a scythe was stuck in the sand beside it .   a white  skeletal hand turned a page .      you   ll be death  then .     said vimes  after a while .   ah  mister vimes  astute as ever .  got it in one  said death  shutting the book on his finger to keep the place .      i   ve seen you before .      i have walked with you many times  mister vimes .      and this is it  is it .      has it never struck you that the concept of a writ ten narrative is somewhat strange .  said death .   vimes could tell when people were trying to avoid something they really didn   t want to say  and it was happening here .      is it .     he insisted .     is this it .  this time i die .      could be .      could be .  what sort of answer is that .     said vimes .   a very accurate one .  you see  you are having a near death experience  which inescapably means that i must undergo a near vimes experience .  don   t mindme .  carry on with whatever you were doing .  i have a book .   vimes rolled over onto his stomach  gritted his teeth  and pushed himself onto his hands and knees again .  he managed a few yards before slumping back down .   he heard the sound of a chair being moved .      shouldn   t you be somewhere else .     he said .   i am  said death  sitting down again .      but you   re here .      as well .  death turned a page and  for a person without breath  managed a pretty good sigh .  it appears that the butler did it .      did what .      itisamade up story .  very strange .  all one need do is turn to the last page and the answer is there .  what  therefore  is the point of deliberately not knowing .   it sounded like gibberish to vimes  so he ignored it .  some of the aches were gone  although his head still hammered .  there was an empty feeling everywhere .  he just wanted to sleep .          is that clock right .         i   m afraid it is  sybil .         i   ll just go outside and wait for him  then .  i   ll have the book ready     said lady sybil .     he won   t let anything stop him  you know .        i   m sure he won   t     said bunty .      although things can be very treacherous in the lower valley at this time of       her husband began  and was fried into silence by his wife   s stare .   it was six minutes to six .          ob oggle oog soggle .      it was a very little  watery sound  and it came from somewhere in vimes   s trousers .  after a few moments  enough time to recollect that he had both hand and trousers  he reached down and  after a struggle  freed the gooseberry from his pocket .  the case was battered  and the imp  when vimes had got the flap open  was quite pale .      ob ogle soggle .      vimes stared at it .  it was a talking box .  it meant something .      woggle soggle lob .      slowly  vimes tipped the box up .  water poured out of it .      you weren   t listening .  i was shouting and you weren   t listening .     the imp whined .     it   s five minutes to six .  read to young sam .      vimes dropped the protesting box on his chest and stared up at the pale stars .      mus    read to young sam     he murmured  and shut his eyes .   they snapped open again .      got t   read to young sam .      the stars were moving .  it wasn   t the sky .  how could it be the sky .  this was a bloody cave  wasn   t it .   he rolled over and got to his feet in one movement .  there were more stars now  drifting along the walls .  the vurms were moving with a purpose .  overhead  they had become a glowing river .   although they were flickering a little  the lights were also coming back on in vimes   s head .  he peered into what was now no longer blackness but merely gloom  and gloom was like daylight after the darkness that had gone before .         got to read to young sam       he whispered  to a cavern of giant stalactites and stalagmites  all gleaming with water        to read to young sam        stumbling and sliding through shallow pools  running across the occasional patch of white sand  vimes followed the lights .       sybil tried not to look at the worried faces of her host and hostess as she crossed their hall .  she glared at the grandfather clock .  the minute hand was nearly on the     and trembling .   she threw open the front door .  there was no sam there  and no one galloping down the road .   the clock struck the hour .  she heard someone step quietly beside her .      would you like me to read to the young man  madam .     said willikins .     perhaps a man   s voice would           no  i   ll go up     said sybil quietly .     you wait here for my husband .  he won   t be long     she added firmly .      yes  madam .         he   ll probably be quite rushed .         i shall usher him up without delay  madam .         he will be here  you know .         yes  madam .         he will walk through walls .      sybil climbed the stairs as the chimes ended .  the clock was a wrong clock .  of course it was .   young sam had been installed in the old nursery of the house  a rather somber place full of grays and browns .  there was a truly frightening rocking horse  all teeth and mad glass eyes .   the boy was standing up in his cot .  he was smiling  but the smile faded into puzzlement as sybil pulled up a chair and sat down next to him .      daddy has asked mummy to read to you tonight  sam     she announced brightly .     won   t that be fun .      her heart did not sink .  it could not .  it was already as low as any heart could go .  but it curled up and whimpered as she watched the little boy stare at her  at the door  at her again  and then throw back his head and scream .       vimes  half limping and half running  tripped and fell into a shallow pool .   he found he   d stumbled over a dwarf .  a dead one .  very dead .  so dead  in fact  that the dripping water had built a small stalagmite on him  and with a film of milky stone had cemented him to the rock against which he sat .         got to read to young sam     vimes told the shadowy helmet  earnestly .   a little way away  on the sand  was a dwarf   s battle axe .  what was going on in vimes   s mind was not exactly coherent thought  but he could hear faint noises up ahead and an instinct older than thought decided there was no such thing as too much cutting power .   he picked it up .  it was covered with no more than a thin coat of rust .  there were other humps and mounds on the cavern floor  which  now that he came to look at them  might all be     no time .  read book .   at the end of the cavern  the ground sloped up  and had been made treacherous by the dripping water .  it fought back  but the axe helped .  one problem at a time .  climb hill .  read book .   and then the screaming started .  his son  screaming .   it filled his mind .   they will burn     a staircase floated in his vision  reaching endlessly upwards into darkness .  the screaming came from up there .   feet slithered .  the axe bit into the milky stone .  weeping and cursing  sliding at every step  vimes struggled to the top of the slope .   a new  huge cave spread out below .  it was busy with dwarfs .  it looked like a mine .   there were four of them  only a few feet away from vimes  whose vision was full of rocking lambs .  they stared at this sudden  bloody  swaying apparition  which was dreamily waving a sword in one hand and an axe in the other .   they had axes  too .  but the thing glared at them and asked      where   s   my   cow .      they backed away .      is that my cow .     the creature demanded  stepping forward unsteadily .  it shook its head sadly .      it goes baaaa .     it wept .     it is   a sheep        then it fell to its knees  clenched its teeth  turned its face upwards  like a man tortured beyond his wits  beseeching the gods of fortune and the tempest  and screamed         no .  that .  is .  .  not .  .  .  my .  .  .  cow .  .  .  .  .        the words echoed around the cavern and broke through mere rock  so great was the force behind them  melted mere mountains  screamed across the miles     and in the somber nursery  young sam stopped crying and looked around  suddenly happy but puzzled  and said  to his despairing mother   s surprise     co .      the dwarfs backed way down the slope .  overhead  the vurms were still pouring in  outlining the invader against their green white glow .      where   s my cow .  is that my cow .     it demanded  following them .   in every part of the cavern  dwarfs had stopped work .  there was hesitancy in the air .  this was only one man  after all  and the thought in many minds was  what is someone else going to do about this .  it had not yet progressed to  what am i going to do about this .  besides  where was the cow .  there were cows down here .      it goes naaaaay .  it is a horse .  that is not my cow .      dwarfs looked at one another .  where was the horse  then .  did you hear a horse .  who else is down here .   the four guards had retreated to the cavern for advice and reorientation .  there was a number of deep downers there  clustered in frantic conversation and watching the approaching man .   in vimes   s strobing vision  there were fluffy bunnies  too  and quacky ducks     he had dropped to his knees again  and was staring at the ground and crying .   half a dozen shrouded dark guards stepped out from the group .  one of them carried ahead of him a flame weapon  and advanced on the figure cautiously .  the flame of its little pilot light was the brightest thing in the cave .   the figure looked up  the light reflected red in its eyes  and growled     is that my cow .      then it threw the axe overarm  full at the guard .  it struck the flame weapon  which exploded .      it goes hruuugh .         hg .     said young sam  as his mother hugged him and stared blankly at the wall .   burning oil fountained across the dark .  some of it splashed on vimes   s arm .  he slapped at it .  there was pain  intense pain  but he knew this only in the same way that he knew the moon existed .  it was there  but it was a long way off and didn   t affect him very much .      that   s not my cow .     he said  standing up .   he strode on now  over the burning oil  through red edged smoke  past the dwarfs rolling desperately on the ground to put out the flames .  he seemed to be looking for something .   two more guards ran at him .  without appearing to notice them  vimes crouched and whirled the sword around in a circle .  a little lamb rocked in front of his eyes .   a dwarf with greater presence of mind than the others had found a crossbow and was taking aim when he had to stop to brush away the bats streaming past him .  he raised the bow again  looked around at a noise like two slabs of meat being slapped together  and was picked up and thrown across the cave by a naked young woman .  an astonished miner swung his axe at the smiling girl  who vanished in a cloud of bats .   there was a lot of yelling going on .  vimes paid it no attention .  dwarfs were running through the smoke .  he merely slapped them aside .  he had found what he was seeking .      is that my cow .  it goes mooooo .      picking up another fallen axe  vimes started to run .      yes .  that   s my cow .      the grags were behind a ring of guards  in a frantic huddle  but vimes   s eyes were on fire  and there were flames streaming from his helmet .  a dwarf holding a flamethrower threw it down and fled .      hooray  hooray  it   s a wonderful day  for i have found my cow .         and perhaps that  it was said later  was what did it .  against the berserker  there is no defense .  they had sworn to fight to the death  but not to this death .  the slowest four guards went down to the axe and the sword  the others scattered and ran .   and now vimes paused in front of the cowering old dwarfs  raising the weapons over his head     and halted  rocking like a statue .       night  forever .  but within it  a city  shadowy and only real in certain ways .   the entity cowered in its alley  where the mist was rising .  this could not have happened .   yet it had .  the streets had filled with   things .  animals .  birds .  changing shape .  screaming and yelling .  and  above it all  higher than the rooftops  a lamb rocking back and forth in great slow motions  thundering over the cobbles     and then bars had come down  slamming down  and the entity had been thrown back .   but it had been so close .  it had saved the creature  it was getting through  it was beginning to have control   and now this     in the darkness of the inner city  above the rustle of the never ending rain  it heard the sound of boots approaching .   a shape appeared in the mist .   it drew nearer .   water cascaded off a metal helmet and an oiled leather cloak as the figure stopped and  entirely unconcerned  cupped its hand in front of its face and lit a cigar .   then the match was dropped on the cobbles  where it hissed out  and the figure said     what are you .      the entity stirred  like an old fish in a deep pool .  it was too tired to flee .      i am the summoning dark .     it was not  in fact  a sound  but had it been  it would have been a hiss .     who are you .         i am the watchman .         they would have killed his family .     the darkness lunged  and met resistance .     think of the deaths they have caused .  who are you to stop me .         he created me .  quis custodiet ipsos custodes .  who watches the watchmen .  me .  i watch him .  always .  you will not force him to murder for you .         what kind of human creates his own policeman .         one who fears the dark        and so he should     said the entity  with satisfaction .      indeed .  but i think you misunderstand .  i am not here to keep darkness out .  i   m here to keep it in .     there was a clink of metal as the shadowy watchman lifted a dark lantern and opened its little door .  orange light cut through the blackness .     call me   the guarding dark .  imagine how strong i must be .      the summoning dark backed desperately into the alley  but the light followed it  burning it .      and now     said the watchman     get out of town .         and went down as a werewolf landed on his back .   angua drooled .  the hair along her spine stood out like a saw blade .  her lips curled back like a wave .  her growl was from the back of a haunted cave .  all together  these told the brain of anything monkey shaped that movement meant death .  and that stillness  while it also meant death  didn   t mean immediate  this actual second  death  and was therefore the smart monkey option .   vimes didn   t move .  the growl knotted his muscles .  terror was in control .   i salute you  said a thought that was not his  and he felt the sudden absence of something whose presence he had not noticed before .  in the blackness behind his eyes  some dark fin swished and vanished .   he heard a whimper  and the weight on him disappeared .  he rolled over and saw  fading in the middle of the air  a crude drawing of an eye with a tail .  it dwindled into nothing  and the all enveloping darkness slowly gave way to flames and the light of the vurms .  blood had been spilled  they were pouring down the walls .  he felt     a certain amount of time passed .  vimes jerked awake .      i read it for him .     he said  mostly to reassure himself .      you did  sir     said the voice of angua  behind him .     very clearly  too .  we were more than two hundred yards away .  well done  sir .  we thought you ought to have a rest .         what have i done well .     said vimes  trying to sit up .  the movement filled his world with pain  but he managed a brief glimpse before slumping back .   there was a lot of smoke in the cave  but there were actual torches flickering here and there .  and a great many dwarfs  some distance away  some sitting down  some standing around in groups .      why are there so many dwarfs here  sergeant .     he asked  looking up at the cavern roof .     that is  why are there so many dwarfs here that aren   t actually trying to kill us .         they   re from the low king  sir .  we   re their prisoners   sort of   er   but not exactly           of rhys .  bugger that .     said vimes  trying to get to his feet again .     i saved his bloody life once .     he managed to get upright  but then the world pivoted around him  and he would have fallen if angua hadn   t caught him and lowered him onto a rock .  well  at least he was sitting up now        not exactly prisoners     angua said .     we can   t go anywhere .  but since we wouldn   t know where to go even it we could go anywhere  it   s all a bit moot .  sorry i   m only in a shift  sir  you know how it is .  the dwarfs have promised to fetch my gear .  er   it   s all gone political  sir .  the dwarf in command seems a decent sort but he   s way out of his depth  so he   s sticking with what he knows  sir .  and  er  he doesn   t know a lot .  do you remember anything about what happened .  you   ve been out for a good twenty minutes .         yes .  there were   wooly lambs       vimes   s voice trailed into silence for a while .  somehow  what he   d just said took the ring of veracity and dropped it in a deep  deep hole .     there weren   t wooly lambs  right .     he asked hopelessly .      i didn   t see any     said angua carefully .     i did see a striding  screaming  vengeful maniac  sir .  but in a good way     she added .   the internal vimes looked at memories he didn   t remember from the first time around .      i       he began .      everything   s   sort of fine  sir     said angua quickly .     but come and see this .  bashfullsson said you ought to see everything .         bashfullsson   he   s the know it all dwarf  right .     he said .      ah  it   s all coming back  sir     said angua .     good .  he was a bit worried about that .      vimes was steadier on his feet now  but his right arm hurt like hell  and all the other pains that the day had accumulated were coming back and waving .  angua carefully led him through puddles and across rocks as slippery as wet marble until they reached a stalagmite .  it was about eight feet high .   it was a troll .  it wasn   t a rock shaped like a troll  it was a troll .  they only got stonier when they died  vimes knew  but the lines of this one had been softened by the milky rock dripped on the troll   s head .      but now look at this  sir     said angua  leading him on .     they were destroying them        there was another stalagmite  lying on its side in a pool .  it had been smashed off at the base .  and it was   a dwarf .   dwarfs crumble after death  just like humans  but all the armor  mail  chains  and heavy leather mean there   s no great change to the eye of the casual observer .  the flowing rock had covered it all in a glistening shroud .   vimes straightened up and looked across the cavern .  shapes loomed in the gloom  all the way to the near wall  where the drip of ages had formed a perfect ivory waterfall  frozen in time .      there are more .         about twenty  sir .  half of them had been smashed before you   arrived .  look at this one over here  sir .  you can just make them out .  they   re sitting back to back  sir .      vimes stared at the figures under the glaze  and shook his head .  a dwarf and a troll  together  cemented in rock .      is there anything to eat .     he said .  it wasn   t the most awe inspired thing to say  but it came from the stomach  with feeling .      our rations got lost in the excitement  sir .  but the dwarfs will share theirs .  they aren   t unfriendly  sir .  just cautious .         share .  they have dwarf bread .         i   m afraid so  sir .         i thought it was illegal to give that to prisoners .  i think i   ll wait  thanks .  and now  sergeant  you can tell me about the excitement .          it hadn   t exactly been an ambush  the dwarfs just caught up with them .  their captain had been given rather wide orders to follow vimes and his party  and there had been a certain chilliness when he found that the party included two trolls .  this was still koom valley  after all .  vimes felt a pang of sympathy for him  he   d had a simple job to do  and suddenly it was full of politics .  been there  done that  bought the singlet  thought vimes .   fortunately  grag bashfullsson had a way with words .  since they were all going the same way     and it had been a long way .  the fleeing dwarfs had brought down the ceiling not far from the entrance tunnel  and a journey that had taken vimes a few minutes had taken the pursuers the best part of a day  even with sally scouting ahead .  angua spoke of caves even bigger than this  of vast waterfalls in the dark .  vimes said  yes  he knew .   then the words of where   s my cow .  had boomed under koom valley  shaking the rock of ages and making the stalactites hum in sympathy  and the rest had been a matter of running        i can remember reading to young sam     said vimes slowly .     but there were these   strange pictures in my head .     he stopped .  all that anger  all that red hot rage  had flowed out of him in a torrent  without thought .     i killed those damn soldiers           most of them  sir     said angua cheerfully .     and there   s a couple of miners who got in the way who   ll be aching for months .      it was all coming back to vimes now .  he wished it wasn   t .  there was always a part of the human brain that objected to fighting dwarfs .  they were child sized .  oh  they were also at least as strong as a human  and more resilient  and would take any advantage in a fight  and if you were lucky  you learned to overcome that prejudice before you were hacked off at the knees  but it was always there        i remember those old dwarfs     he said .     they were cowering like little maggots .  i wanted to smash them           you resisted for almost four seconds  sir  and then i brought you down     said angua .      and that was a good thing  was it .     said vimes .      oh  yes .  it   s why you   re still here  commander     said bashfullsson  appearing from behind a stalagmite .     i   m glad to see you up and about again .  this is a historical day .  and you still have a soul  it appears .  isn   t that nice .         now you listen to me       vimes began .      no  you listen to me  commander .  yes  i knew you   d come to koom valley  because the summoning dark would come here .  it needed you to bring it .  no  listen to me  because we don   t have much time .  the summoning dark symbol commands an entity as old as the universe .  but it has no real body and very little physical strength  it can cover a million dimensions in the blink of an eye but could barely make it across a room .  it works through living creatures  especially ones it finds   amenable .  it found you  commander  a cauldron of anger  and in small  subtle ways it saw that you got it to this place .         i believe him  sir     said angua quickly .     it was the one called up as a curse by one of the miners .  remember .  the one who drew the sign in his own blood .  on a locked door .  and you           there was a door that stung when i touched it  i remember       said vimes .     are you telling me that behind that door he   oh  no           he was already dead by then  sir  i   m positive about that     said angua quickly .     we couldn   t have saved him .         helmclever said       vimes began  and bashfullsson must have seen the panic rising in his eyes  because he grabbed both his hands and spoke fast and urgently     no .  you didn   t kill him .  you didn   t even touch him .  you were afraid that if you did  i   d say you   d used force  remember .         he dropped dead .  how much force is that .     vimes shouted .  his voice echoed  and heads turned all across the cavern .     there was the symbol  wasn   t there .         it   s true that the   creature tends to leave a  a signature on events  but you would have had to touch him .  you did not .  you did not raise a hand .  i think you would have resisted even then .  resisted and won .  do you hear me .  calm down .  calm down .  he died of fear and guilt .  you must realize that .         what reason did he have to feel guilty .         every reason  for a dwarf .  that mine bore down so heavily on him .     the grag turned to angua .     sergeant  could you get the commander some water .  it   s as pure in these pools as anywhere in the world .  well  it is if you pick one without a body floating in it .         y   know  you could have avoided that last sentence .     said vimes .  he sat down on a rock .  he could feel himself shaking now .      and then i got the damn thing here .     he managed .      yes  commander .  and it got you here  too  i suspect .  cheery says she saw you drop into churning water half a mile from where we are now .  even a champion swimmer wouldn   t have survived that .         i woke up on a beach           it got you there .  it swam your body for you .         but i was all knocked about .         oh  it wasn   t your friend  commander .  it needed to get you here in one piece .  it didn   t have to be a good looking piece .  and then   you disappointed it  commander .  you disappointed it .  or  perhaps  impressed it .  it   s hard to tell .  you wouldn   t strike the helpless  you see .  you resisted .  i had the sergeant here bring you down because i was frightened that the struggle inside would rip your tendons from your bones .         they were just frightened old men           and so  it appears to have let you go     said the dwarf .     i wonder why .  historically  anyone subject to the summoning dark dies insane .      vimes reached up and took a mug of water from angua .  it was teeth aching cold and the best drink he   d ever tasted .  and his mind worked fast  flying in emergency supplies of common sense  as human minds do  to construct a huge anchor in sanity and prove that what happened hadn   t really happened and  if it had happened  hadn   t happened much .   it was all mystic  that   s what it was .  oh  it might all be true  but how could you ever tell .  you had to stick to the things you can see .  and you had to keep reminding yourself of that  too .   yeah  that was it .  what had really happened  eh .  a few signs .  well  anything can look like you want it to  if you   re worried and confused enough  yes .  a sheep can look like a cow  right .  ha .   as for the rest  well  bashfullsson seemed a decent lad  but you didn   t have to buy into his worldview .  same with mr .  shine .  that sort of thing could spook you .   he   d been wound up about young sam  and when he   d seen those devil guards  of course he   d gone for them .  he hadn   t been getting much sleep lately .  it seemed like every hour brought some new problem .  the mind played funny tricks .   surviving the underground river .  easy .  he must have kept himself afloat .  there were a lot of things the body would rather do than die .   there   some logical thought  and the mystic becomes   well  straightforward .  you can stop feeling like some puppet and become a man with a purpose once again .   he put down the empty mug and stood up   purposefully .      i   m going to see how my men are     he announced .      i   ll come with you     said bashfullsson quickly .      i think i need no assistance     lied vimes  as coolly as he could .      i   m sure you do not     said the dwarf .     but captain gud is a little nervous .         he   ll be a lot nervous if i don   t like what i see     said vimes .      yes .  that   s why i   m coming with you     said bashfullsson .   vimes set off across the cavern a little faster than he felt comfortable .  the grag kept up by skipping at every other step .      don   t think you know me  mr .  bashfullsson     vimes growled .     don   t think i took pity on those bastards .  don   t think i was merciful .  you just don   t kill the helpless .  you just don   t .         the dark guards seemed to have no trouble with the prospect     said bashfullsson .      exactly .     said vimes .     by the way  mr .  bashfullsson  what kind of dwarf doesn   t carry an axe .         well  as a grag  my first resort  of course  is to my voice     said the grag .     the axe is nothing without the hand  and the hand is nothing without the mind .  i   ve trained myself to think about axes .         sounds mystical to me     said vimes .      i suppose it would     said bashfullsson .     ah  here we are .         here    was the area that the newly arrived dwarfs had occupied .  very military  vimes thought .  a defensive square .  you   re not sure who your enemies are .  and neither am i .   the nearest dwarf regarded him with that slightly defiant  slightly uneasy look he   d come to recognize .  captain gud straightened up .   vimes looked over the dwarf   s shoulder  which was not hard to do .  there were nobby and fred colon  and both of the trolls  and even cheery  all sitting in a huddle .      are my men under arrest  captain .     he said .      my orders are to detain everyone found here     said the captain .  vimes admired the flatness of the response .  it meant  i am not interested in a dialogue at this time .      what is your authority here  captain .     he said .      my authority comes threefold  the low king  mining law  and sixty armed dwarfs     said gud .   bugger  thought vimes .  i forgot about mining law .  this is a problem .  i think i need to delegate .  a good commander learns to delegate .  therefore  i will delegate this problem to captain gud .      that was a good answer  captain     he said     and i respect it .     in one movement  he pushed past and headed for the watchmen .  he stopped dead when he heard the sound of drawn metal behind him  raised his hands  and said     grag bashfullsson  will you explain matters to the captain .  i have stepped into his custody  not out of it .  and this is not the time or place for rash action .      he walked on without waiting for a reply .  admittedly  banking on the fact that someone would get into trouble if they killed you would probably come under the heading of rash action  but he   d just have to live with that .  or  of course  not .   he hunkered down by nobby and colon .      sorry about this  mister vimes     said fred .     we were waiting on the path with some horses and they just turned up .  we showed    em our badges  but they just did not want to know .         understood .  and you  cheery .         i thought it   d be best to stay together  sir     said cheery earnestly .      right .  and you  detr       vimes looked down  and felt the bile rise .  brick and detritus both had chains on their legs .      you let them shackle you .     he said .      well  it seemed to be gettin    all poll itical  mister vimes .     said detritus .     but say der word and me an    brick can have    em off  no trouble .  dey   re only field chains .  my granny could   ve bust out of    em .      vimes felt the anger rising  but put a lid on it .  right now  detritus was being rather more sensible than his boss .     don   t do that  not until i say so     he said .     where are the grags .         they   re guarding them in another cave  sir     said cheery .     and the miners .  sir  they said the low king is on his way .         good job it   s a big cave  otherwise it   d be getting crowded     said vimes .  he walked back to the captain and bent down .      you chained up my sergeant .     he said .      he   s a troll .  this is koom valley     said the captain flatly .      except even i could bust out of chain that thin     said vimes .  he glanced up .  sally and angua had regained their amour propre in their proper armor  and were watching vimes carefully .      those two officers are a vampire and a werewolf     he said  still in the same level voice .     i know you know this  and you very wisely didn   t try to lay a finger on them .  and bashfullsson   s a grag .  but you put my sergeant in weak chains that he could snap with a finger so you could kill him and say he was trying to escape .  don   t even think about denying it .  i know a dirty trick when i see one .  shall i tell you what i   m going to do .  i   m going to give you a chance to show brotherly love and let the trolls out  right now .  and the others .  otherwise  unless you kill me  i   ll poison your future career to the very best of my ability .  and you don   t dare kill me .      the captain eyeballed him  but it was a game vimes had mastered a long time ago .  then the dwarf   s gaze fell on vimes   s arm  and he gave a groan and took a step back  raising his hand protectively .      yes .  i   ll do it .  yes .         see you do     said vimes  taken aback .  then he  too  looked down at the inside of his wrist .      what the hell is this .     he said  turning to bashfullsson .      ah  it left its mark on you  commander     said the grag cheerfully .     an exit wound  perhaps .      on the soft underskin of vimes   s wrist  the sign of the summoning dark blazed as a livid scar .   vimes turned his arm this way and that .      it was real .     he said .      yes .  but it is gone  i   m sure .  there is a difference in you .      vimes rubbed the symbol .  it didn   t hurt  it was just raised  reddened skin .      it   s not going to come back  is it .     he said .      i doubt it   ll risk it  sir .     said angua .   vimes opened his mouth to ask her what she meant by that piece of sarcasm when yet more dwarfs trotted in to the cavern .   these were the tallest and broadest dwarfs he   d ever seen .  unlike most dwarfs  they wore simple mail shirts and carried one axe  one good  large  beautifully balanced axe .  other dwarfs bristled with up to a dozen weapons .  these dwarfs bristled with one each  and they separated and spread out into the cavern with a purpose  covering lines of sight  guarding shadows  and  in the case of four of them  taking up station behind detritus and brick .   when they finally clattered to a halt  another group stepped out of the tunnel .  vimes recognized rhys  low king of the dwarfs .  he stopped  looked around  glanced briefly at vimes  and summoned the captain to him .      we have everything .         sire .     said gud nervously .      you know what i mean  captain .         yes  but we found nothing on any of them  sire .  we searched them  and we   ve gone over the floor three times .         excuse me .     said vimes .      commander vimes .     said the king  turning and greeting vimes like a long lost son .     it is good to see you .         you   ve lost the bloody cube .     said vimes .     after all this .         what cube would this be  commander .     said the king .  vimes had to admire his acting ability  at least .      the one you   re looking for     he said .     the one dug up in my city .  the one all this fuss is about .  they wouldn   t throw it away  because they   re grags  right .  you can   t destroy words .  it   s the worst crime there is .  they can   t destroy it and they don   t dare hide it .  so they   d keep it with them .      the low king looked at captain gud  who swallowed .      it   s not in this cave     he muttered .      they wouldn   t leave it anywhere else     said vimes .     not now .  someone might find it .      the luckless captain turned to his king  seeking help there .      there was panic everywhere when we arrived  sire .     he protested .     people running and screaming  fires everywhere .  complete chaos  sire .  all we can be sure of it that no one got out .  and we searched them all  sire .  we searched them all .      vimes shut his eyes .  memories were fading fast as common sense walled up all those things that could not have happened  but he recalled the panicking grags  hunched over something .  had there been just a twinkle of blue and green specks .   time for a long shot        corporal nobbs  come here .     he said .     let him through  captain .  i insist .      gud didn   t protest .  his spirit was broken .  a reluctant nobby was produced .      yes  mister vimes .     he said .      corporal nobbs  did you obtain that precious thing i asked you to acquire .     said vimes .      er   what would that be  sir .     said nobby .  vimes   s heart leapt .  nobby   s face was an open book  albeit the kind that got banned in some countries .      nobby  there are times when i   ll put up with you mucking about .  this isn   t one of those     he said .     did you find the thing i asked you to look for .      nobby looked into his eyes .     i   oh .  oh .  oh  yes  sir     he said .     i   yes   we rushed in  you see  you see  you see  and people were running everywhere and there was  like  smoke       nobby   s face glazed and his lips moved soundlessly in an agony of creation        an     an    i was bravely fightin    when what did i see but a sparkly thing rollin    and bein    kicked about  an    i thought  i jus    bet that   s the very same sparkly thing mister vimes very specific   ly told me to be lookin    out for   an    here it is  all safe        he pulled a small  glittering cube out of his pocket and held it out .   vimes was faster than the king .  his hand shot forward  closed over the cube  and was locked in a fist in the skin of a second .      well done  corporal nobbs  for obeying my orders so concisely     he said and stifled a grin at nobby   s impeccably dreadful salute .      i believe that is dwarf property  commander vimes     said the king calmly .   vimes opened his hand  palm up .  the cube  only a couple of inches across  gave off little blue and green glints .  the metal looked like bronze that had been corroded by time into a beautiful pattern of greens  blues  and browns .  it was a jewel .   he   s a king  thought vimes .  a king on a throne as wobbly as a rocking horse .  and he   s not nice .  it   s not a job where the nice last long .  he even got a spy into my watch .  i will not put my faith in kings .  right now  who do i trust .   me .   one thing i do know it that no damn demon got inside my head  no matter what they say .  i wouldn   t buy that even if they threw in a lifetime supply of cabbage .  no one gets into my head but me .  this damn   burn is just a   coincidence .  it doesn   t mean anything .  but you play the hand you   re dealt      take it     he said  opening his hand .  on his wrist  the summoning dark glowed .      i ask you to give it to me  commander     said rhys .      take it     vimes repeated .  and he thought  let   s see what you believe  shall we .   the king reached out  hesitated  and then slowly withdrew his hand .      or  perhaps     he said  as if the thought had just occurred to him     it might be best to leave it in your celebrated custody  commander vimes .         yes .  i want to hear what it has to say     said vimes  closing his fist again .     i want to know what was too dangerous to know .         indeed  so do i     said the king of the dwarfs .     we will take it to a place that can           look around you  sire .     snapped vimes .     dwarfs and trolls died here .  they weren   t fighting  they were standing together .  look around you  the place looks like a godsdamn game board .  was this their testament .  then we listen to it here .  in this place .  at this time .         and supposing what it has to say is dreadful .     said the king .      then we listen .         i am the king  vimes .  you have no authority here .  this is not your city .  you stand here defying me with a handful of men and your wife and child not ten miles away        rhys stopped  and the echoes bounced back from distant caves  tumbling over themselves and dying into a silence that rang like iron .   out of the corner of his ear  vimes heard sally say     oops        bashfullsson hurried forward and whispered something in the king   s ear .  the king   s expression changed  as only a politician   s face can  into careful amity .   i   m not going to do a thing  vimes told himself .  i   m just going to stand here .      i do look forward to seeing lady sibyl again     said rhys .     and your son  of course           good .  they   re staying in a house not ten miles away     said vimes .     sergeant littlebottom .         sir .     said cheery .      please take lance constable von humpeding with you and go down to the town  will you .  tell lady sybil i   m fine     vimes added  not taking his eyes off the king .     off you go  right now .      as they hurried away  the king smiled  and looked around the cavern .  then he sighed .      well  i cannot afford a row with ankh morpork  not at the moment .  very well  commander .  do you know how to make it speak .         no .  don   t you .     this is a game  right .  vimes thought .  a king wouldn   t take this kind of gobbyness from anyone  especially when you outnumber them ten to one .  a row .  you   d just have to say we got caught in a storm in koom valley  which is such a treacherous place  as everyone agrees .  he will be greatly missed and we will certainly hand over his body if it ever turns up   but you   re not going to try that  are you  because you need me .  you know something about this cavern  yes .  and whatever   s going to happen  you want good ol    not sharp but by gods he   s straight sam vimes to tell the world        no two cubes are alike     said rhys .     it is usually a word  but sometimes a breath  a sound  a temperature  a point in the world  the smell of rain .  anything .  i understand that there are many cubes that have never spoken .         really .     said vimes .     but this thing damn well gabbled .  and whoever sent it out of the valley wanted it to be heard  so i doubt it only starts talking when a virgin   s tear falls on it on a warm tuesday in february .  and this one started chatting very smartly to a man who didn   t know a word of dwarfish  too .         but the speaker would want dwarfs to hear it  surely .     the king protested .      it   s a two thousand year old legend .  who knows who wanted what .     said vimes .     what do you want .      this was to nobby  who had appeared beside him  looking with interest at the cube .      how did tha   he get past my guards .     said the king .      the nobbs sidle     said vimes  and  as a couple of embarrassed guards dropped heavy hands on nobby   s frail shoulders  he added     no .  leave him .  come on  nobby  you say something to make this thing start speaking .         er      say something or it   ll be the worse for you    .     nobby suggested .      not a bad try     vimes conceded .     a hundred years ago  sire  i doubt if anyone in ankh morpork knew many words of dwarf or troll .  perhaps the message was intended for humans .  there must have been a settlement down on the plain  with all those birds and fish to eat .         perhaps some more human words  then  er  nobby .     said the king .      okay .  open  speak  say something  talk  spill the beans  play           no  no  mister vimes  he   s doing it wrong .     fred colon shouted .     it was in the olden days  right .  so it   d be old words  like   er   openeth .      vimes laughed as a thought struck .  i wonder  he thought .  it could be .  this is not really about words  it   s about sounds .  noises     bashfullsson was watching the attempt with a puzzled expression .      what is the dwarf word for    open     mr .  bashfullsson .     said vimes .      in the sense of    open a book .     that would be dhwe  commander .         hmm .  that won   t do .  how about      say    .         why  that would be aargk  or  in the preemptive form  aork .   commander .  you know  i don   t think           excuse me .     said vimes loudly .  the babble of voices stopped .  he moved the cube close to his mouth .      awk .     he said .   the blue and green lights ceased their sparkle and  instead  began to form across the metal a pattern of blue and green squares .      i thought the artist knew no dwarfish     said the king .      he didn   t  but he spoke fluent chicken     said vimes .     i   ll explain later           captain  fetch the grags     the king snapped .     the prisoners  too  even the trolls .  all shall hear this .      the metal seemed to be moving over vimes   s skin .  some of the green and blue squares rose slightly proud of the rest of the metal .   the box began to speak .  there was a crackle that sounded like dwarfish  although vimes couldn   t make out a single word .  it was followed by a couple of loud knocking noises .      second convocation hubland dwarfish     said bashfullsson .     that would be right for the time .  whoever is speaking has just said     art thys thyng workyng .          the voice spoke again .  as the cracked  old syllables unrolled  bashfullsson went on         the first thyng tak did  he wroten hymself  the second thyng tak did  he wroten the laws  the thyrd thyng tak did  he wroten the world  the fourth thyng tak did  he wroten ay cave  the fyfth thyng tak did  he wroten a geode  ay egge of stone  and in the gloamyn of the mouth of the cave  the geode hatched and the brothers were born  the first brother walked toward the light  and stood under the open sky               this is just the story of the things tak wrote     cheery whispered to vimes .  vimes shrugged  and watched as some of the bodyguards hustled the old grags in the circle  ardent among them .      it   s not new or anything .     vimes said  disappointed .      every dwarf knows it  sir .               he was the first dwarf        bashfullsson translated .        he found the laws tak had wrytten  and he was endarkened           the crackling voice went on  and then bashfullsson  who had his eyes closed in concentration  opened them in shock .  this time  he didn   t bother with olde world language .         uh      then tak looked upon the stone and it was trying to come alive  and tak smiled and wroten     all thyngs strive           said the dwarf  raising his voice above the growing commotion around him .         and for the service the stone had given  he fashioned it into the first troll  and delighted in the life that came unbidden .  these are the thyngs that tak wroten .         he was shouting now  because of the noise level .   vimes felt like an outsider .  it seemed that everyone except him was arguing .  axes were being flourished .         i who speak to you now am b   hrian blood axe  by right of the scone the true king of the dwarfs .        bashfullsson screamed .   the cave went silent  except for the echoing scream returning from distant darkness .         we were washed into the caves by the flood .  we sought one another  voices in the dark .  we are dying .  our bodies are broken by the terrible water with teeth   of stone .  we are too weak to climb .  water surrounds all .  this testament we will entrust to young stronginthearm  who is still nimble  in the hope that it will reach the daylight .  for the story of this day must not be forgotten .  this outcome was not meant .  we came to sign a treaty .  it was the secret  careful work of many years .         the box stopped speaking .  but there were faint groans  and the rush of water somewhere .      sire  i demand that this should not be heard .     shouted ardent among the grags .     it is nothing but lies upon lies .  there is no truth in it .  what proof is there that this is the voice of bloodaxe .      captain gud is looking a bit uncertain  vimes thought .  the king   s bodyguard .  well  they mostly looked like the stolid kind who stayed loyal and didn   t pay much attention to politics .  the miners .  angry and confused because the old grags are yelling .  this is going to go bad really fast .      city watch  to me .     he shouted .   the background noises from the cube died  and another voice started to speak .  detritus looked up quickly .      dat   s old troll .     he said .   bashfullsson hesitated for a moment .           er   i am diamond king of trolls        he said  looking desperately at vimes .         indeed  we came to make peace .  but the mist came down upon us and when it rose  some trolls and dwarfs cried     ambush .     they fell to fighting and would not hear our commands .  so troll fought troll  and dwarf fought dwarf  and fools made fools of all of us as we fought to stop a war  until the disgusted sky washed us away .         and yet we say this .  here  in this cave at the end of the world  peace is made between dwarf and troll  and we will march beyond the hand of death together .  for the enemy is not troll  nor it is dwarf  but it is the baleful  the malign  the cowardly  the vessels of hatred  those who do a bad thing and call it good .  those we fought today  but the willful fool is eternal and will say              this is just a trick .     ardent shouted .            say this is a trick        bashfullsson continued        and so we implore  come to the caves under this valley  where you will find us sharing the peace that cannot be braken .         the rumbling voice from the box stopped speaking .  there was  once again  a rustle of half heard voices  and then silence .   the litle squares moved about for a moment like a sliding puzzle  and the sound came back .  now what issued from it was shouts and screams  and the clash of steel     vimes was watching the king   s face .  some of this you knew  right .  not all of it  but you didn   t look surprised that it was bloodaxe speaking .  rumors .  old stories .  something in the records .  you   ll never tell me .      had   ra     said bashfullsson  and the cube fell silent .     that means    stop     mister vimes     the grag added .      and so we are under koom valley     sneered ardent .     and what do we find .         we find you     said bashfullsson .     we always find you .         dead trolls .  dead dwarfs .  and nothing more than a voice     said ardent .     ankh morpork is here .  they are devious .  these words could have been spoken yesterday .      the king was watching ardent and bashfullsson .  so was every other dwarf .  you don   t have to stand and argue .  vimes wanted to shout .  just chain the bastards up and we can sort it out later .   but being a dwarf was all about words and laws        these are venerable grags     said ardent  indicating the robed figures behind him .     they have studied the histories .  they have studied the devices .  thousands of years of knowledge stand before you .  and you .  what do you know .         that you came to destroy the truth     said bashfullsson .     you dared not trust it .  a voice is just a voice  but these bodies are proof .  you came here to destroy them .      ardent snatched the axe from a miner and was flourishing it before any of the bodyguards could react .  when realization caught up with them  there was a massed move forward .      no .     said bashfullsson  holding up his hands .     sire  please .  this is an argument between grags .         why do you carry no axe .     ardent snarled .      i need no axe to be a dwarf     said bashfullsson .     nor do i need to hate trolls .  what kind of creature defines itself by hatred .         you strike at the very root of us .     said ardent .     at the root .         then strike back     said bashfullsson  holding out his empty hands .     and put your sword away  commander vimes     he added  without turning his head .     this is dwarf business .  ardent .  i   m still standing .  what do you believe in .  ha   ak .  ga strak ja   ada .      ardent jerked forward  axe raised .  bashfullsson moved quickly  there was the thud of something hitting flesh  and then a tableau as motionless as the brooding figures around the cavern .  there was ardent  axe raised overhead .  there was bashfullsson  down on one knee  with his head resting almost companionably against the dwarf   s chest and the edge of one hand pressed hard against ardent   s throat .   ardent   s mouth opened  but all that came out was a croak and a trickle of blood .   he took a few steps back  and fell over backwards .  the axe struck the white  wet  stony waterfall  and smashed through the drip of millennia .  time fell in shards around .   bashfullsson rose  looking shocked and massaging his hand .      it is like using an axe     he said  to no one in particular     but without the axe        the uproar began again  but a dwarf  dripping with water  pushed through the mob .      sire  there   s a band of trolls coming up the valley .  they asked for you .  they say they want to parley .      rhys stepped over the gurgling body of ardent  looking intently at the hole in the waterfall of stone .  another piece fell down as he touched it .      is there something unusual about their leader .     he said in a preoccupied voice  still staring into the new darkness .      yes  sire .  he   s all   sparkly .         ah .  good     said the king .     he has his parley .  bring him down here .         could that be a troll who knows some very powerful dwarfs .     said vimes .   the low king met his eyes for a moment .     yes  i imagine it is     he said .  then he raised his voice .     someone fetch me a torch .  commander vimes  could you just   look at this  please .      in the depths of the revealed cave  something shone .       on this day in       the painter methodia rascal dropped the glittering thing in the deepest well he knew .  no one would ever hear it down there . the chicken chased him home .       it would be a lot simpler  vimes thought  if this was a story .  a sword is pulled out of a stone  or a magic ring is flung into the depths of the sea  and with general rejoicing  the world turns .   but this was real life .  the world didn   t turn  it just went into a spin .  it was koom valley day  and there wasn   t a battle going on in koom valley .  but what was going on here wasn   t peace  either .  what was going on   well  what was going on was committees .  it was negotiation .  actually  as far as he could tell  it hadn   t even got as far as negotiation yet .   it hadn   t got past talks about meetings about delegations .  on the other hand  no one had died  except maybe of boredom .   there was a lot of history to be unpicked  and  for those who weren   t actually engaged in that delicate activity  there was koom valley to tame .  two cultural heroes were down there in the cavern  and all it needed was one good storm and a few misplaced blockages for a white flood laden with grinding boulders to wipe the whole place away .  it hadn   t happened yet  but sooner or later the dynamic geography would get around to it .  koom valley couldn   t be left to its own devices  not anymore .   everywhere you looked  there were teams of trolls and dwarfs surveying  diverting  damming  and drilling .  they   d been engaged in this for two days .  it would take them forever  because every winter changed the game .  koom valley was forcing cooperation on them .  dam koom valley     vimes thought that was a bit too pat  but nature can be like that .  sometimes you got sunsets so pink that they had no style at all .   one thing that had happened fast was the tunnel .  dwarfs had cut down quickly through the soft limestone .  you could stroll down into the cavern now  although  in fact  you   d have to queue  because of the long line of trolls and dwarfs .   those in the line going down eyed one another with uncertainty at best .  those in the line coming up sometimes looked angry  or were close to tears  or just walked along looking at the ground .  once they got past the exit  they tended to form into quiet groups .   sam  with young sam in his arms  didn   t have to queue .  news had got around .  he went straight in  past the trolls and dwarfs who were painstakingly reassembling the broken stalagmites  it was news to vimes that you could do that  but apparently if you came back in five hundred years they   d be as good as new  and into what had come to be called the kings    cave .   and there they were .  you couldn   t argue with it .  there was the dwarf king  slumped forward across the board  glazed by the eternal drip  his beard now rock and at one with the stone  but the diamond troll king had remained upright in death  his skin gone cloudy  and you could still see the game in front of him .  it was his move  a healthy little stalagmite hung from his outstretched hand .   they   d broken off small stalagmites to make the pieces  which time had now glued into immobility .  the scratched lines on the stone were more or less invisible  but thud players from both races had already pored over it and a sketch of the dead kings    game had already appeared in the times .  the troll king was playing the dwarf side .  apparently  it could go either way .   people were saying that when this was all over  they   d seal the cave .  too many people in a living cave killed it in some way  the dwarfs said .  and then the kings would be left in the dark to finish their game in  with luck  peace .   water dripping on a stone  changing the shape of the world one drop at a time  washing away a valley     yes  well  vimes had added to himself .  but it   d never be that simple .  and for every new generation  you   d have to open it again  so that people could see that it was true .   today  though  it was open for sam and young sam  who was wearing a fetching wooly hat with a bobble on it .   brick and sally were on duty  along with a couple of dwarfs and two more trolls  all watching the stream of visitors and one another .  vurms covered the ceiling .  the game gleamed .  what would young sam remember .  probably just the glitter .  but it had to be done .   the players were genuine   on that  at least  both sides agreed .  the carvings on diamond were accurate  the armor and jewelry on bloodaxe were just as history recorded .  even the long loaf of dwarf bread that he carried into battle  and which could shatter a troll skull  was by his side .  dwarf scholars had  with delicacy and care and the blunting of fifteen saw blades  removed a tiny slice of it .  miraculously  it had turned out still to be as inedible now as the day it was baked .   a minute was about enough for this historic moment  vimes decided .  young sam was at the grabbing age  and he   d never hear the end of it if his son ate a historic monument .      can i have a word  lance constable .     he said to sally as he turned to go .     the guard changes in a minute .         certainly  sir     said sally .  vimes strolled off to a corner of the cavern and waited until nobby and fred colon marched in at the head of the relief .      glad you joined  lance constable .     he said  as she hurried up .      very much  sir .         good .  shall we go up to the daylight .      she followed him up the slope and into the damp warmth of koom valley  where he sat down on a boulder .  he looked at her while young sam played at his feet .   he said     is there anything you   d like to say to me  lance constable .         should there be  sir .         i can   t prove anything  of course     said vimes .     but you are an agent of the low king  aren   t you .  you   ve been spying on me .      he waited while she considered her options .  swallows swooped overhead in squadrons .      i  er  wouldn   t put it quite like that  sir     she said eventually .     i was keeping an eye on hamcrusher  and i   d heard about the mining  and then  when it all started to heat up              becoming a watchman seemed a good idea  right .  did the league know .         no .  look  sir  i wasn   t spying on you           you told him i was headed for koom valley .  and the night we arrived  you went for a little fly around .  just stretching your wings .         look  this isn   t my life .     said sally .     i   d joined the new force in bonk .  we   re trying to make a difference up there .  i did want to come to ankh morpork anyway  because  well  we all want to .  to learn  you know .  how you manage to do it .  everyone speaks highly of you .  and then the low king summoned me and i thought  where   s the harm .  hamcrusher has caused trouble up there  too .  er   i never actually told you a lie  sir .         rhys already knew about the secret  right .     said vimes .      no  sir  not as such .  but i think he had some reason to suspect there was something down there .         then why didn   t he just go and look .         dwarfs digging around in koom valley .  the trolls would  er  go postal  sir .         but not if the dwarfs were merely investigating why a copper from ankh morpork was chasing some fleeing criminals into the caves  right .  not if the copper was good ol    sam vimes  who  everyone knows  is as straight as an arrow even if he   s not the sharpest knife in the drawer .  you can   t bribe sam vimes  but why bother when you can pull the wool over his eyes .         look  sir  i know how you must feel  but   well  there   s your litle boy there  playing in koom valley  with trolls and dwarfs all    round  and they   re not fighting .  right .  i didn   t lie  i just   liaised a little .  wasn   t it worth it  sir .  hah  you really worried them when you went to the wizards .  shine hadn   t left the city .  rhys had to fly him in by night .  all they really did was follow your lead .  the only person who fooled you was me  and it turns out i wasn   t very good at it .  they needed you  sir .  look around and say it wasn   t worth it        a hundred yards away  a house sized rock rumbled across the stone  pushed and steered by a dozen trolls  dropped into a sinkhole and blocked it like an egg in a cup .  there was a cheer .      can i mention something else  sir .     said sally .     i do know angua is standing behind me .         it   s sergeant angua to you     said angua  by her ear .     you didn   t fool me  either .  i told you we didn   t like snitches in the watch .  but for what it   s worth  sir  she smells like she   s telling the truth .         do you still have a route to the low king .     said vimes .      yes  and i   m sure he   ll       sally began quickly .      these are my demands .  the grags and what   s left of their guards are coming back to ankh morpork with me .  that includes ardent  though i   m told it   ll be weeks before he can talk again .  they   re going before vetinari .  i   ve got promises to keep  and no one is going to stop me .  it   ll be tough to make any big charges stick  but i   m bloody well going to try .  and since i   ll bet my dinner that vetinari is in on all this  i expect he   ll pack    em off back to rhys in any case .  i imagine he   s got a cell that   s deep enough for comfort .  understood .         yes  sir .  and the other demands .         the same as that one  repeated in a louder voice     said vimes .     understood .         absolutely  sir .  then i   ll resign  of course     said sally .   vimes   s eyes narrowed .     you   ll resign when i tell you to  lance constable .  you took the king   s shilling  remember .  and made an oath .  go and liaise .         you   re going to keep her .     said angua  watching the vampire disappear into the distance .      you said yourself she   s a good copper .  we   ll see .  oh  don   t make that face  sergeant .  it   s all the rage in politics these days  spying on your friends .  that   s what i   m told .  like she said  look around .         this is a bit unlike you  sir     said angua  giving him a look of concern .      yes  it is  isn   t it .     said vimes .     i had a nice sleep last night .  it   s a nice day .  no one is actively trying to kill me  which is nice .  thank you  sergeant .  have a nice evening .      vimes carried young sam back in late afternoon light .  just as well the girl had been working for rhys .  things might have been a bit tricky otherwise .  that was the plain fact of it .  keep her on .  maybe .  she   d been very useful  even angua admitted .  besides  he   d been practically forced to take on a spy  in times of more orless war .  if he played that right  no one would ever again dictate to him who he took on in the watch .  doreen winkings could rattle her false canines as much as she liked .   hmm   was this how vetinari thought all the time .   he heard his name being called .  a coach was coming across the rock  and sybil was waving from the window .  that was another step forward  even wagons could get up here now .      you haven   t forgotten the dinner tonight  have you .     she said  a hint of suspicion in her voice .      no  dear .     vimes hadn   t  but he   d hoped that it might evaporate if he didn   t think about it .  it was going to be official  with both kings and lots of important lesser kings and clan leaders .  and the special envoy from ankh morpork  unfortunately .  that would be sam vimes  scrubbed up .   at least there weren   t going to be tights and plumes .  even sybil hadn   t been that farsighted .  regrettably  though  the town had a decent tailor who   d been very keen to use all that gold braid he   d bought by accident a couple of years ago .      willikins will have a bath run by the time we get back     said sybil as the coach moved away .      yes  dear     said vimes .      don   t look so glum .  you   ll be upholding the honor of ankh morpork  remember .         really  dear .  what shall i do with the other hand .     said vimes  settling back into the seat .      oh  sam .  tonight you   ll walk with kings .      i   d sooner be walking all by myself along treacle mine road at three in the morning  vimes thought .  in the rain  with the gutters gushing .  but it was a wife thing .  she took such a   a pride in him .  he could never work out why .   he looked down at his arm .  he   s sorted that out  at least .  exit wound indeed .  it was just the way the burning oil had splashed on his skin .  it might look a bit like that damn symbol  enough to put the wind up the dwarfs  but no floaty eyeball was going to get past him .  common sense and facts  that   s what worked .   after a while  it dawned on him that they weren   t going into the town .  they   d gone down almost as far as the lakes  but now they were heading back up on the cliff path .  he could see the valley below them  opening out .   the kings were working their subjects hard  reasoning that tired warriors are less keen to fight .  teams swarmed over the rock like ants .  maybe there was a plan .  there probably was .  but the mountains would sneer at it every winter .  you   d have to have squads here all the time  you   d need to scout the mountainsides to find and smash the big boulders before they caused trouble .  remember koom valley .  because  if you don   t  your history is   history .   and maybe  behind the thunder and in the roar of the waters flowing underground  you   ll hear the laughter of dead kings .   the coach came to a halt .  sybil opened the door .      get down  sam vimes     she said .     no arguing .  it   s time for your portrait .         out here .  but it   s       vimes began .      good afternoon  commander     said otto chriek cheerfully  appearing at the doorway .     i haf set up a bench and zer light is just right for color .      vimes had to agree that it was .  thunder light made the mountains gleam like gold .  in the middle distance  the tears of the king fell in a line of glittering silver .  brightly colored birds skimmed through the air .  and all the way up the valley there were rainbows .   koom valley  on koom valley day .  he   d had to be there .      if her ladyship vill be seated viz zer little boy on her lap and you  commander  standink with your hand on her shoulder    .     he bustled around his big black iconograph .      he   s up here taking pictures for the times     sybil whispered .     and i thought  well  it   s now or never .  portraiture must move on .         how long is this going to take .     said vimes .      oh  about a fraction of a second  commander     said otto .   vimes brightened up .  this was more like it .   of course  it never is .  but it was a warm afternoon  and vimes still felt good .  they sat and stared with those fixed grins people wear when they   re wondering why a fraction of a second takes half an hour  while otto tried to get the universe sorted out to his satisfaction .      havelock will be wondering how to reward you  you know     murmured sybil as the vampire fussed around .      he can go on wondering     said vimes .     i   ve everything i want .      he smiled .   click .          sixty new officers .     said lord vetinari .      the price of peace  sir     said captain carrot earnestly .     i   m sure that commander vimes wouldn   t settle for anything less .  we are really stretched .         sixty men   and dwarfs and trolls  obviously   is more than a third of your current complement     said the patrician  tapping his walking stick on the cobbles .     peace comes with a rather large bill  captain .         and a few dividends  sir     carrot said .   they looked up at the circle and bar symbol over the door of the mine  just above the yellow and black rope used by the watch to warn off intruders .      the mine falls to us by default .     said vetinari .      apparently  sir .  i believe the term is    eminent domain .            ah  yes .  that means    theft by the government        said vetinari .      but the grags bought the freehold  sir .  they   re hardly going to contest it now .         quite .  and the dwarfs really can make watertight tunnels .         oh  yes .  the trick is almost as old as mining .  would you care to step inside .  i   m afraid the elevator is not working at the moment  though .      lord vetinari inspected the rails and the little carts the dwarfs had used to shift spoil .  he felt the dry walls .  he went back upstairs and frowned as a one ton slab of iron came through the wall  whirled past his face  passed through the opposite wall  and buried itself in the street outside .      and was that supposed to happen .     he said  brushing plaster dust off his robe .   an excited voice behind him shouted     the torque .  it   s impossible .  amazing .      a figure climbed through the wall  holding something in one hand .  it rushed up to captain carrot  vibrating with excitement .      it spins once every six point nine seconds  but the torque is immense .  it broke the clamp .  what powers it .         no one seems to know     said carrot .     in uberwald           excuse me  what is this about .     said lord vetinari  holding out a hand imperiously .   the man glanced at him and then turned to carrot .      who   s this .     he said .      lord vetinari  ruler of the city  may i present mr .  pony of the artificers    guild .     said carrot quickly .     please let his lordship see the axle  mr .  pony .         thank you     said vetinari .  he took the thing  which looked like two cubes  each about six inches on a side  joined together on one face  like a pair of dice joined at the sixes .  in relation to the other  one turned   very  very slowly .      oh     he said flatly .     a mechanism .  how nice .         nice .     said pony .     don   t you understand .  it won   t stop turning .      carrot and pony looked expectantly at the patrician  who said     and that   s a good thing  is it .      carrot coughed .     yes  sir .  one of these drives one of the biggest mines in uberwald .  all the pumps  the fans that move the air  the trucks that haul the ore  the bellows for the forges  the elevators   everything .  just one of those .  it   s another type of device  like the cubes .  we don   t know how they   re made  they   re very rare  but the other three i   ve heard of have not stopped working for hundreds of years .  they don   t use fuel  they don   t need anything .  they appear to be millions of years old .  no one knows what made them .  they just turn .         how interesting     said vetinari .     hauling trucks .  underground  you say .         oh  yes     said carrot .     even with miners in .         i shall give this some thought     said vetinari  avoiding mr .  pony   s outstretched hand .     and what could we make it do in this city .      he and carrot turned questioning faces to mr .  pony  who shrugged and said     everything .          plink .  went a drop of water onto the head of the very  very late king bloodaxe .      how long are we going to have to do this  sarge .     said nobby as they watched the line of visitors shuffle past the dead kings .      mister vimes has sent for another squad from home     said fred colon  shifting from one foot to the other .  it seemed quite warm when you first came into the cave  but after a while  the clamminess could get a man down .  he reflected that nobby wasn   t affected by this  being blessed by nature with natural clammy .      it   s starting to give me the creeps  sarge     said nobby  indicating the kings .     if that hand moves  i   m going to scream .         think of it as being there  nobby .         i   ve always been somewhere  sarge .         yeah  but when they comes to write the history books  they   ll       fred colon paused for thought .  he had to admit  they probably wouldn   t mention him and nobby .     well  your tawneee will be proud of you  anyway .         i think that   s not to be  sarge     said nobby sadly .     she   s a nice girl  but i think i   m goin    to have to let her down lightly .         surely not .            fraid so  sarge .  she cooked me dinner the other day .  she tried to make distressed pudding like my ol    mum used to make .      plink .   fred colon smiled all the way from his stomach .     ah  yes .  no one could distress a pudding like your ol    mum  nobby .         it was awful  fred     said nobby  hanging his head .     as for her slumpie  well  i do not wish to go there .  she is not a girl who knows her way around a stove .         she   s more of a pole person  nobby  that is true .         exactly .  an    i thought  ol    hammerhead  well  you might never be sure which way she was lookin     but her buttered clams  well       he sighed .      there   s a thought to keep a man warm on a cold night     fred agreed .      an     y   know  these days  when she hits me with a wet fish  it doesn   t sting like it used to     nobby went on .     i think we were reaching an understanding .      plink .      she can crack a lobster with her fist     colon observed .     that   s a very portable talent .         so i was thinking of speaking to angua     said nobby .     she might give me a few hints on how to let tawneee down gently .         that   s a good idea  nobby     said fred .     no touchin     sir  otherwise i shall have to cut yer fingers orf .     this was said  in a friendly tone of voice  to a dwarf who had been reaching in awe toward the board .      but we   ll still be friends  of course     said nobby as the dwarf backed away .     so long as i can get into the pussycat club for free  anyway  i   ll always be there if she needs a helmet to cry on .         that   s very modern of you  nobby     said fred .  he smiled in the gloom .  somehow  the world was back on course .   plink .       wandering through the world  the eternal troll     brick headed after detritus  dragging his club .  well  he wuz goin    up in der worl    an    no mistakin    .  dey said it hurt if you come off of der stuff  but brick had always hurt  all his life  and right now it wasn   t too bad at all .  it wuz  like  weird der way he could fink to der end of a sentence now an    still remember der start of it .  an    he wuz bein    given food  which he wuz gettin    to like once he stopped frowing it up .  sergeant detritus  who knew everythin     had tole him if   n he stayed clean an    smartened up he could rise as high as lance constable one day  makin    heapo money .   he wuzn   t too sure what had been happnin    to cause all dis .  it looked like he wasn   t in der city anymore  an    dere had been some fightin     and sergeant detritus had showed him dese kinda dead people and smacked him aroun    der head an    said    remember .     an    he wuz doin    his best  but he   d been smacked aroun    der head a hole lot harder many  many times and dat one was nuffin    .  but sergeant detritus said it wuz all about not hatin    dwarfs no more and dat was okay  cuz really brick never had der energy to waste hatin    .  what dey had been doin    down dat hole was makin    der worl    a betterer place  sergeant detritus said .   and it seemed to brick  as he smelled the food  dat sergeant detritus had got dat one dead right .       trolls and dwarfs had raised a huge roundhouse in koom valley  using giant boulders for the walls and half a fallen forest for the roof .  a fire thirty yards long crackled inside .  ranged around it on long benches were the kings of more than a hundred dwarf mines  and the leaders of eighty troll clans  with their followers and servants and bodyguards .  the noise was intense  the smoke was thick  the heat was a wall .   it had been a good day .  progress had been made .  the guests were not mixing  that was true  but neither were they trying to kill one another .  this was a promising development .  the truce was holding .   at the high table  king rhys leaned back in his makeshift throne and said     one does not make demands of kings .  one makes requests  which are graciously granted .  does he not understand .         i don   t think he gives a tra   ka  sir  if i may be coarse     said grag bashfullsson  who was standing respectfully beside him .     and the senior dwarfs in the city will be right behind him on this .  it   s not my place  sir  but i advise acquiescence .         and that   s all he wants .  no gold  no silver  no concessions .         that   s all he wants  sire .  but i suspect you will be hearing from lord vetinari before long .         oh  you may be sure of that .     said the king .  he sighed .     it   s a new world  grag  but some things don   t change .  er   that   thing has left him  has it .         i believe so  sire .         you are not certain .      the grag smiled a faint  inward smile .     let   s just say that his reasonable request is best granted  shall we  sire .         your point is taken  grag .  thank you .      king rhys turned in his seat  leaned across the two empty places  and said to the diamond king     do you think something has happened to them .  it   s past six o   clock .      shine smiled  filling the hall with light .     i suspect they   ve been delayed by matters of great importance .         more important than this .     said the dwarf king .    and  because some things are important  the coach stood outside the magistrate   s house  down in the town .  the horses stamped impatiently .  the coachman waited .  inside  lady sybil darned a sock  because some things are important  with a faint smile on her face .   and floating out of an open upstairs window was the voice of sam vimes          it goes hruuugh .  it is a hippopotamus .   that is not my cow .        nevertheless  it was close enough for now .        this was a bit of a slur on nobby  vimes had to admit .  like many other officers  nobby was human .  it was just that he was the only one who had to carry a certificate to prove it .      as in    ol    fred thought he said custard officer and volunteered .     since this is an example of office humor  it doesn   t actually have to be funny .      anoia is the ankh morpork goddess of things that get stuck in drawers .      vimes had never got on with any game much more complex than darts .  chess in particular had always annoyed him .  it was the dumb way the pawns went off and slaughtered their fellow pawns while the kings lounged about doing nothing that always got to him  if only the pawns united  maybe talked the rooks around  the whole board could   ve been a republic in a dozen moves .      vimes maintained three trays  in  out  and shake it all about  the last one was where he put everything he was too busy  angry  tired  or bewildered to do anything about .      the better class of gods  anyway .  not the ones with the tentacles  obviously .      vimes had got around to a clean desk policy .  it was a clean floor strategy that eluded him at the moment .      troll lore says that living creatures actually move backwards through time .  it   s complicated .      empirical crescent was just off park lane  in what was generally a high rent district .  the rents would have been higher still were it not for the continued existence of empirical crescent itself  which  despite the best efforts of the ankh morpork historical preservation society  had still not been pulled down .     this was because it had been built by bergholt stuttley johnson  better known to history as bloody stupid johnson  a man who combined in one frail body such enthusiasm  self delusion  and creative lack of talent that he was  in many respects  one of the great heroes of architecture .  only bloody stupid johnson could have invented the thirteen inch foot and a triangle with three right angles in it .  only bloody stupid johnson could have twisted common matter through dimensions it was not supposed to go .  and only bloody stupid johnson could have done all this by accident .   his highly original multidimensional approach to geometry was responsible for empirical crescent .  on the outside it was a normal terraced crescent of the period  built of honey colored stone with the occasional pillar or cherub nailed on .  inside  the front door of no .    opened into the back bedroom of no .      the ground floor front window of no .    showed the view appropriate to the second floor of no .     and smoke from the dining room fireplace of no .    came out of the chimney of no .       but it was okay to throw your rubbish into the garden  because it might not be your garden you were throwing it into .      that is to say  every dragon breeder not currently occupying a small artistic urn .      a famous ankh morpork gutter sport  second only to dead rat conkers .  turd races in the gutter appear to have died out  despite an attempt to take them upmarket with the name poosticks .      making fred colon possibly unique in the annals of jail history .      who wasn   t an igor  but was merely called one .  it was best not to have fun with him on this subject  and especially not to ask him to sew your head back on .      patience is a key virtue among dwarfs .      they say there   s one in every police station .  constable visit the ungodly with explanatory pamphlets was enough for two .      that was a phrase of sybil   s that got to him .  she   d announce at lunch     we must have the pork tonight  it needs eating up .     vimes never had an actual problem with this  because he   d been raised to eat what was put in front of him  and do it quickly  too  before someone else snatched it away .  he was just puzzled at the suggestion that he was there to do the food a favor     the university porters  or bledlows  who doubled  with rather more enthusiasm  as its under proctors  a private police force .  they commanded their nickname for being thick shelled  liable to turn red when hot  and having the smallest brain for their size of any known creature .      and even then had been belaboring mountain goats on apparently sheer cliff faces and  while pebbles slid and bounced around him  was clearly accusing them of obstructing his right to roam .  eric believed very firmly that the land belonged to the people  and also that he was more the people than anyone else was .  eric went everywhere with a map encased in waterproof material  on a string around his neck .  such people are not to be trifled with .      but as it happened  it was all blamed on people from another world  so that was all right .       about the author     terry pratchett   s novels have sold
