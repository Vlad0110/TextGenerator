publisher      begin reading     the wind howled .  lightning stabbed at the earth erratically  like an inefficient assassin .  thunder rolled back and forth across the dark  rain lashed hills .   the night was as black as the inside of a cat .  it was the kind of night  you could believe  on which gods moved men as though they were pawns on the chessboard of fate .  in the middle of this elemental storm a fire gleamed among the dripping furze bushes like the madness in a weasel   s eye .  it illuminated three hunched figures .  as the cauldron bubbled an eldritch voice shrieked     when shall we three meet again .      there was a pause .   finally another voice said  in far more ordinary tones     well  i can do next tuesday .        through the fathomless deeps of space swims the star turtle great a   tuin  bearing on its back the four giant elephants who carry on their shoulders the mass of the discworld .  a tiny sun and moon spin around them  on a complicated orbit to induce seasons  so probably nowhere else in the multiverse is it sometimes necessary for an elephant to cock a leg to allow the sun to go past .   exactly why this should be may never be known .  possibly the creator of the universe got bored with all the usual business of axial inclination  albedos and rotational velocities  and decided to have a bit of fun for once .   it would be a pretty good bet that the gods of a world like this probably do not play chess and indeed this is the case .  in fact no gods anywhere play chess .  they haven   t got the imagination .  gods prefer simple  vicious games  where you do not achieve transcendence but go straight to oblivion  a key to the understanding of all religion is that a god   s idea of amusement is snakes and ladders with greased rungs .   magic glues the discworld together   magic generated by the turning of the world itself  magic wound like silk out of the underlying structure of existence to suture the wounds of reality .   a lot of it ends up in the ramtop mountains  which stretch from the frozen lands near the hub all the way  via a lengthy archipelago  to the warm seas which flow endlessly into space over the rim .   raw magic crackles invisibly from peak to peak and earths itself in the mountains .  it is the ramtops that supply the world with most of its witches and wizards .  in the ramtops the leaves on the trees move even when there is no breeze .  rocks go for a stroll of an evening .   even the land  at times  seems alive       at times  so does the sky .   the storm was really giving it everything it had .  this was its big chance .  it had spent years hanging around the provinces  putting in some useful work as a squall  building up experience  making contacts  occasionally leaping out on unsuspecting shepherds or blasting quite small oak trees .  now an opening in the weather had given it an opportunity to strut its hour  and it was building up its role in the hope of being spotted by one of the big climates .   it was a good storm .  there was quite effective projection and passion there  and critics agreed that if it would only learn to control its thunder it would be  in years to come  a storm to watch .   the woods roared their applause and were full of mists and flying leaves .   on nights such as these the gods  as has already been pointed out  play games other than chess with the fates of mortals and the thrones of kings .  it is important to remember that they always cheat  right up to the end     and a coach came hurtling along the rough forest track  jerking violently as the wheels bounced off tree roots .  the driver lashed at the team  the desperate crack of his whip providing a rather neat counterpoint to the crash of the tempest overhead .   behind   only a little way behind  and getting closer   were three hooded riders .   on nights such as this  evil deeds are done .  and good deeds  of course .  but mostly evil  on the whole .     on nights such as this  witches are abroad .   well  not actually abroad .  they don   t like the food and you can   t trust the water and the shamans always hog the deckchairs .  but there was a full moon breasting the ragged clouds and the rushing air was full of whispers and the very broad hint of magic .   in their clearing above the forest the witches spoke thus      i   m babysitting on tuesday     said the one with no hat but a thatch of white curls so thick she might have been wearing a helmet .     for our jason   s youngest .  i can manage friday .  hurry up with the tea  luv .  i   m that parched .      the junior member of the trio gave a sigh  and ladled some boiling water out of the cauldron into the teapot .   the third witch patted her hand in a kindly fashion .      you said it quite well     she said .     just a bit more work on the screeching .  ain   t that right  nanny ogg .         very useful screeching  i thought     said nanny ogg hurriedly .     and i can see goodie whemper  maysherestinpeace  gave you a lot of help with the squint .         it   s a good squint     said granny weatherwax .   the junior witch  whose name was magrat garlick  relaxed considerably .  she held granny weatherwax in awe .  it was known throughout the ramtop mountains that miss weatherwax did not approve of anything very much .  if she said it was a good squint  then magrat   s eyes were probably staring up her own nostrils .   unlike wizards  who like nothing better than a complicated hierarchy  witches don   t go in much for the structured approach to career progression .  it   s up to each individual witch to take on a girl to hand the area over to when she dies .  witches are not by nature gregarious  at least with other witches  and they certainly don   t have leaders .   granny weatherwax was the most highly regarded of the leaders they didn   t have .   magrat   s hands shook slightly as they made the tea .  of course  it was all very gratifying  but it was a bit nerve racking to start one   s working life as village witch between granny and  on the other side of the forest  nanny ogg .  it   d been her idea to form a local coven .  she felt it was more  well  occult .  to her amazement the other two had agreed or  at least  hadn   t disagreed much .      an oven .     nanny ogg had said .     what   d we want to join an oven for .         she means a coven  gytha     granny weatherwax had explained .     you know  like in the old days .  a meeting .         a knees up .     said nanny ogg hopefully .      no dancing     granny had warned .     i don   t hold with dancing .  or singing or getting over excited or all that messing about with ointments and similar .         does you good to get out     said nanny happily .   magrat had been disappointed about the dancing  and was relieved that she hadn   t ventured one or two other ideas that had been on her mind .  she fumbled in the packet she had brought with her .  it was her first sabbat  and she was determined to do it right .      would anyone care for a scone .     she said .   granny looked hard at hers before she bit .  magrat had baked bat designs on it .  they had little eyes made of currants .     the coach crashed through the trees at the forest edge  ran on two wheels for a few seconds as it hit a stone  righted itself against all the laws of balance  and rumbled on .  but it was going slower now .  the slope was dragging at it .   the coachman  standing upright in the manner of a charioteer  pushed his hair out of his eyes and peered through the murk .  no one lived up here  in the lap of the ramtops themselves  but there was a light ahead .  by all that was merciful  there was a light there .   an arrow buried itself in the coach roof behind him .     meanwhile king verence  monarch of lancre  was making a discovery .   like most people   most people  at any rate  below the age of sixty or so   verence hadn   t exercised his mind much about what happened to you when you died .  like most people since the dawn of time  he assumed it all somehow worked out all right in the end .   and  like most people since the dawn of time  he was now dead .   he was in fact lying at the bottom of one of his own stairways in lancre castle  with a dagger in his back .   he sat up  and was surprised to find that while someone he was certainly inclined to think of as himself was sitting up  something very much like his body remained lying on the floor .   it was a pretty good body  incidentally  now he came to see it from outside for the first time .  he had always been quite attached to it although  he had to admit  this did not now seem to be the case .   it was big and well muscled .  he   d looked after it .  he   d allowed it a mustache and long flowing locks .  he   d seen it got plenty of healthy outdoor exercise and lots of red meat .  now  just when a body would have been useful  it had let him down .  or out .   on top of that  he had to come to terms with the tall  thin figure standing beside him .  most of it was hidden in a hooded black robe  but the one arm which extended from the folds to grip a large scythe was made of bone .   when one is dead  there are things one instinctively recognizes .   hallo .   verence drew himself up to his full height  or what would have been his full height if that part of him of which the word    height    could have been applied was not lying stiff on the floor and facing a future in which only the word    depth    could be appropriate .      i am a king  mark you     he said .   was  your majesty .      what .     verence barked .   i said was .  it   s called the past tense .  you   ll soon get used to it .   the tall figure tapped its calcareous fingers on the scythe   s handle .  it was obviously upset about something .   if it came to that  verence thought  so am i .  but the various broad hints available in his present circumstances were breaking through even the mad brain stupidity that made up most of his character  and it was dawning on him that whatever kingdom he might currently be in  he wasn   t king of it .      are you death  fellow .     he ventured .   i have many names .      which one are you using at present .     said verence  with a shade more deference .  there were people milling around them  in fact  quite a few people were milling through them  like ghosts .      oh  so it was felmet     the king added vaguely  looking at the figure lurking with obscene delight at the top of the stairs .     my father said i should never let him get behind me .  why don   t i feel angry .      glands  said death shortly .  adrenalin and so forth .  and emotions .  you don   t have them .  all you have now is thought .   the tall figure appeared to reach a decision .   this is very irregular  he went on  apparently to himself .  however  who am i to argue .      who indeed .      what .      i said  who indeed .      shut up .   death stood with his skull on one side  as though listening to some inner voice .  as his hood fell away the late king noticed that death resembled a polished skeleton in every way but one .  his eye sockets glowed sky blue .  verence wasn   t frightened  however  not simply because it is difficult to be in fear of anything when the bits you need to be frightened with are curdling several yards away  but because he had never really been frightened of anything in his life  and wasn   t going to start now .  this was partly because he didn   t have the imagination  but he was also one of those rare individuals who are totally focused in time .   most people aren   t .  they live their lives as a sort of temporal blur around the point where their body actually is   anticipating the future  or holding onto the past .  they   re usually so busy thinking about what happens next that the only time they ever find out what is happening now is when they come to look back on it .  most people are like this .  they learn how to fear because they can actually tell  down at the subconscious level  what is going to happen next .  it   s already happening to them .   but verence had always lived only for the present .  until now  anyway .   death sighed .   i suppose no one mentioned anything to you .  he hazarded .      say again .      no premonitions .  strange dreams .  mad old soothsayers shouting things at you in the street .      about what .  dying .      no  i suppose not .  it would be too much to expect  said death sourly .  they leave it all to me .      who do .     said verence  mystified .   fate .  destiny .  all the rest of them .  death laid a hand on the king   s shoulder .  the fact is  i   m afraid  you   re due to become a ghost .      oh .     he looked down at his   body  which seemed solid enough .  then someone walked through him .   don   t let it upset you .   verence watched his own stiff corpse being carried reverentially from the hall .      i   ll try     he said .   good man .      i don   t think i will be up to all that business with the white sheets and the chains  though     he said .     do i have to walk around moaning and screaming .      death shrugged .  do you want to .  he said .      no .      then i shouldn   t bother  if i were you .  death pulled an hour glass from the recesses of his dark robe and inspected it closely .   and now i really must be going  he said .  he turned on his heel  put his scythe over his shoulder and started to walk out of the hall through the wall .      i say .  just hold on there .     shouted verence  running after him .   death didn   t look back .  verence followed him through the wall  it was like walking through fog .      is that all .     he demanded .     i mean  how long will i be a ghost .  why am i a ghost .  you can   t just leave me like this .     he halted and raised an imperious  slightly transparent finger .     stop .  i command you .      death shook his head gloomily  and stepped through the next wall .  the king hurried after him with as much dignity as he could still muster  and found death fiddling with the girths of a large white horse standing on the battlements .  it was wearing a nosebag .      you can   t leave me like this .     he repeated  in the face of the evidence .   death turned to him .   i can  he said .  you   re undead  you see .  ghosts inhabit a world between the living and the dead .  it   s not my responsibility .  he patted the king on the shoulder .  don   t worry  he said  it won   t be forever .      good .      it may seem like forever .      how long will it really be .      until you have fulfilled your destiny  i assume .      and how will i know what my destiny is .     said the king  desperately .   can   t help there .  i   m sorry .      well  how can i find out .      these things generally become apparent  i understand  said death  and swung himself into the saddle .      and until then i have to haunt this place .     king verence stared around at the drafty battlements .     all alone  i suppose .  won   t anyone be able to see me .      oh  the psychically inclined .  close relatives .  and cats  of course .      i hate cats .      death   s face became a little stiffer  if that were possible .  the blue glow in his eye sockets flickered red for an instant .   i see  he said .  the tone suggested that death was too good for cat haters .  you like great big dogs  i imagine .      as a matter of fact  i do .     the king stared gloomily at the dawn .  his dogs .  he   d really miss his dogs .  and it looked like such a good hunting day .   he wondered if ghosts hunted .  almost certainly not  he imagined .  or ate  or drank either for that matter  and that was really depressing .  he liked a big noisy banquet and had quaffed  many a pint of good ale .  and bad ale  come to that .  he   d never been able to tell the difference till the following morning  usually .   he kicked despondently at a stone  and noted gloomily that his foot went right through it .  no hunting  drinking  carousing  no wassailing  no hawking   it was dawning on him that the pleasures of the flesh were pretty sparse without the flesh .  suddenly life wasn   t worth living .  the fact that he wasn   t living it didn   t cheer him up at all .   some people like to be ghosts  said death .      hmm .     said verence  gloomily .   it   s not such a wrench  i assume .  they can see how their descendants get on .  sorry .  is something the matter .   but verence had vanished into the wall .   don   t mind me  will you  said death  peevishly .  he looked around him with a gaze that could see through time and space and the souls of men  and noted a landslide in distant klatch  a hurricane in howandaland  a plague in hergen .   busy  busy  he muttered  and spurred his horse into the sky .   verence ran through the walls of his own castle .  his feet barely touched the ground   in fact  the unevenness of the floor meant that at times they didn   t touch the ground at all .   as a king he was used to treating servants as if they were not there  and running through them as a ghost was almost the same .  the only difference was that they didn   t stand aside .   verence reached the nursery  saw the broken door  the trailed sheets     heard the hoofbeats .  he reached the window  saw his own horse go full tilt through the open gateway in the shafts of the coach .  a few seconds later three horsemen followed it .  the sound of hooves echoed for a moment on the cobbles and died away .   the king thumped the still  his fist going several inches into the stone .   then he pushed his way out into the air  disdaining to notice the drop  and half flew  half ran down across the courtyard and into the stables .   it took him a mere twenty seconds to learn that  to the great many things a ghost cannot do  should be added the mounting of a horse .  he did succeed in getting into the saddle  or at least in straddling the air just above it  but when the horse finally bolted  terrified beyond belief by the mysterious things happening behind its ears  verence was left sitting astride five feet of fresh air .   he tried to run  and got about as far as the gateway before the air around him thickened to the consistency of tar .      you can   t     said a sad  old voice behind him .     you have to stay where you were killed .  that   s what haunting means .  take it from me .  i know .        granny weatherwax paused with a second scone halfway to her mouth .      something comes     she said .      can you tell by the pricking of your thumbs .     said magrat earnestly .  magrat had learned a lot about witchcraft from books .      the pricking of my ears     said granny .  she raised her eyebrows at nanny ogg .  old goodie whemper had been an excellent witch in her way  but far too fanciful .  too many flowers and romantic notions and such .   the occasional flash of lightning showed the moorland stretching down to the forest  but the rain on the warm summer earth had filled the air with mist wraiths .      hoofbeats .     said nanny ogg .     no one would come up here this time of night .      magrat peered around timidly .  here and there on the moor were huge standing stones  their origins lost in time  which were said to lead mobile and private lives of their own .  she shivered .      what   s to be afraid of .     she managed .      us     said granny weatherwax  smugly .   the hoofbeats neared  slowed .  and then the coach rattled between the furze bushes  its horses hanging in their harnesses .  the driver leapt down  ran around to the door  pulled a large bundle from inside and dashed toward the trio .   he was halfway across the damp peat when he stopped and stared at granny weatherwax with a look of horror .      it   s all right     she whispered  and the whisper cut through the grumbling of the storm as clearly as a bell .   she took a few steps forward and a convenient lightning flash allowed her to look directly into the man   s eyes .  they had the peculiarity of focus that told those who had the know that he was no longer looking at anything in this world .   with a final jerking movement he thrust the bundle into granny   s arms and toppled forward  the feathers of a crossbow bolt sticking out of his back .   three figures moved into the firelight .  granny looked up into another pair of eyes  which were as chilly as the slopes of hell .   their owner threw his crossbow aside .  there was a glimpse of chain mail under his sodden cloak as he drew his sword .   he didn   t flourish it .  the eyes that didn   t leave granny   s face weren   t the eyes of one who bothers about flourishing things .  they were the eyes of one who knows exactly what swords are for .  he reached out his hand .      you will give it to me     he said .   granny twitched aside the blanket in her arms and looked down at a small face  wrapped in sleep .   she looked up .      no     she said  on general principles .   the soldier glanced from her to magrat and nanny ogg  who were as still as the standing stones of the moor .      you are witches .     he said .   granny nodded .  lightning skewered down from the sky and a bush a hundred yards away blossomed into fire .  the two soldiers behind the man muttered something  but he smiled and raised a mailed hand .      does the skin of witches turn aside steel .     he said .      not that i   m aware     said granny  levelly .     you could give it a try .      one of the soldiers stepped forward and touched the man   s arm gingerly .      sir  with respect  sir  it   s not a good idea           be silent .         but it   s terrible bad luck to           must i ask you again .         sir     said the man .  his eyes caught granny   s for a moment  and reflected hopeless terror .   the leader grinned at granny  who hadn   t moved a muscle .      your peasant magic is for fools  mother of the night .  i can strike you down where you stand .         then strike  man     said granny  looking over his shoulder .     if your heart tells you  strike as hard as you dare .      the man raised his sword .  lightning speared down again and split a stone a few yards away  filling the air with smoke and the stink of burnt silicon .      missed     he said smugly  and granny saw his muscles tense as he prepared to bring the sword down .   a look of extreme puzzlement crossed his face .  he tilted his head sideways and opened his mouth  as if trying to come to terms with a new idea .  his sword dropped out of his hand and landed point downward in the peat .  then he gave a sigh and folded up  very gently  collapsing in a heap at granny   s feet .   she gave him a gentle prod with her toe .     perhaps you weren   t aware of what i was aiming at     she whispered .     mother of the night  indeed .      the soldier who had tried to restrain the man stared in horror at the bloody dagger in his hand  and backed away .      i i i couldn   t let .  he shouldn   t of .  it   s   it   s not right to     he stuttered .      are you from around these parts  young man .     said granny .   he dropped to his knees .     mad wolf  ma   am     he said .  he stared back at the fallen captain .     they   ll kill me now .     he wailed .      but you did what you thought was right     said granny .      i didn   t become a soldier for this .  not to go around killing people .         exactly right .  if i was you  i   d become a sailor     said granny thoughtfully .     yes  a nautical career .  i should start as soon as possible .  now  in fact .  run off  man .  run off to sea where there are no tracks .  you will have a long and successful life  i promise .     she looked thoughtful for a moment  and added     at least  longer than it   s likely to be if you hang around here .      he pulled himself upward  gave her a look compounded of gratitude and awe  and ran off into the mist .      and now perhaps someone will tell us what this is all about .     said granny  turning to the third man .   to where the third man had been .   there was the distant drumming of hooves on the turf  and then silence .   nanny ogg hobbled forward .      i could catch him     she said .     what do you think .      granny shook her head .  she sat down on a rock and looked at the child in her arms .  it was a boy  no more than two years old  and quite naked under the blanket .  she rocked him vaguely and stared at nothing .   nanny ogg examined the two corpses with the air of one for whom laying out holds no fears .      perhaps they were bandits     said magrat tremulously .   nanny shook her head .      a strange thing     she said .     they both wear this same badge .  two bears on a black and gold shield .  anyone know what that means .         it   s the badge of king verence     said magrat .      who   s he .     said granny weatherwax .      he rules this country     said magrat .      oh .  that king     said granny  as if the matter was hardly worth noting .      soldiers fighting one another .  doesn   t make sense     said nanny ogg .     magrat  you have a look in the coach .      the youngest witch poked around inside the bodywork and came back with a sack .  she upended it  and something thudded onto the turf .   the storm had rumbled off to the other side of the mountain now  and the watery moon shed a thin gruel of light over the damp moorland .  it also gleamed off what was  without any doubt  an extremely important crown .      it   s a crown     said magrat .     it   s got all spiky bits on it .         oh  dear     said granny .   the child gurgled in its sleep .  granny weatherwax didn   t hold with looking at the future  but now she could feel the future looking at her .   she didn   t like its expression at all .     king verence was looking at the past  and had formed pretty much the same view .      you can see me .     he said .      oh  yes .  quite clearly  in fact     said the newcomer .   verence   s brows knotted .  being a ghost seemed to require considerably more mental effort than being alive  he   d managed quite well for forty years without having to think more than once or twice a day  and now he was doing it all the time .      ah     he said .     you   re a ghost  too .         well spotted .         it was the head under your arm     said verence  pleased with himself .     that gave me a clue .         does it bother you .  i can put it back on if it bothers you     said the old ghost helpfully .  he extended his free hand .     pleased to meet you .  i   m champot  king of lancre .         verence .  likewise .     he peered down at the old king   s features and added     don   t seem to recall seeing your picture in the long gallery           oh  all that was after my time     said champot dismissively .      how long have you been here  then .      champot reached down and rubbed his nose .     about a thousand years     he said  his voice tinged with pride .     man and ghost .         a thousand years .         i built this place  in fact .  just got it nicely decorated when my nephew cut my head off while i was asleep .  i can   t tell you how much that upset me .         but   a thousand years       verence repeated  weakly .   champot took his arm .     it   s not that bad     he confided  as he led the unresisting king across the courtyard .     better than being alive  in many ways .         they must be bloody strange ways  then .     snapped verence .     i liked being alive .      champot grinned reassuringly .     you   ll soon get used to it     he said .      i don   t want to get used to it .         you   ve got a strong morphogenic field     said champot .     i can tell .  i look for these things .  yes .  very strong  i should say .         what   s that .         i was never very good with words  you know     said champot .     i always found it easier to hit people with something .  but i gather it all boils down to how alive you were .  when you were alive  i mean .  something called       he paused      animal vitality .  yes  that was it .  animal vitality .  the more you had  the more you stay yourself  as it were  if you   re a ghost .  i expect you were one hundred percent alive  when you were alive     he added .   despite himself  verence felt flattered .     i tried to keep myself busy     he said .  they had strolled through the wall into the great hall  which was now empty .  the sight of the trestle tables triggered an automatic reaction in the king .      how do we go about getting breakfast .     he said .   champot   s head looked surprised .      we don   t     he said .     we   re ghosts .         but i   m hungry .         you   re not  you know .  it   s just your imagination .      there was a clattering from the kitchens .  the cooks were already up and  in the absence of any other instructions  were preparing the castle   s normal breakfast menu .  familiar smells were wafting up from the dark archway that led to the kitchens .   verence sniffed .      sausages     he said dreamily .     bacon .  eggs .  smoked fish .     he stared at champot .     black pudding     he whispered .      you haven   t actually got a stomach     the old ghost pointed out .     it   s all in the mind .  just force of habit .  you just think you   re hungry .         i think i   m ravenous .         yes  but you can   t actually touch anything  you see     champot explained gently .     nothing at all .      verence lowered himself gently onto a bench  so that he did not drift through it  and sank his head in his hands .  he   d heard that death could be bad .  he just hadn   t realized how bad .   he wanted revenge .  he wanted to get out of this suddenly horrible castle  to find his son .  but he was even more terrified to find that what he really wanted  right now  was a plate of kidneys .     a damp dawn flooded across the landscape  scaled the battlements of lancre castle  stormed the keep and finally made it through the casement of the solar .   duke felmet stared out gloomily at the dripping forest .  there was such a lot of it .  it wasn   t  he decided  that he had anything against trees as such  it was just that the sight of so much of them was terribly depressing .  he kept wanting to count them .      indeed  my love     he said .   the duke put those who met him in mind of some sort of lizard  possibly the type that lives on volcanic islands  moves once a day  has a vestigial third eye and blinks on a monthly basis .  he considered himself to be a civilized man more suited to the dry air and bright sun of a properly organized climate .   on the other hand  he mused  it might be nice to be a tree .  trees didn   t have ears  he was pretty sure of this .  and they seemed to manage without the blessed state of matrimony .  a male oak tree   he   d have to look this up   a male oak tree just shed its pollen on the breeze and all the business with the acorns  unless it was oak apples  no  he was pretty sure it was acorns  took place somewhere else        yes  my precious     he said .   yes  trees had got it all worked out .  duke felmet glared at the forest roof .  selfish bastards .      certainly  my dear     he said .      what .     said the duchess .   the duke hesitated  desperately trying to replay the monologue of the last five minutes .  there had been something about him being half a man  and   infirm on purpose .  and he was sure there had been a complaint about the coldness of the castle .  yes  that was probably it .  well  those wretched trees could do a decent day   s work for once .      i   ll have some cut down and brought in directly  my cherished     he said .   lady felmet was momentarily speechless .  this was by way of being a calendar event .  she was a large and impressive woman  who gave people confronting her for the first time the impression that they were seeing a galleon under full sail  the effect was heightened by her unfortunate belief that red velvet rather suited her .  however  it didn   t set off her complexion .  it matched it .   the duke often mused on his good luck in marrying her .  if it wasn   t for the engine of her ambition he   d be just another local lord  with nothing much to do but hunt  drink and exercise his droit de seigneur .   instead  he was now just a step away from the throne  and might soon be monarch of all he surveyed .   provided that all he surveyed was trees .   he sighed .      cut what down .     said lady felmet  icily .      oh  the trees     said the duke .      what have trees got to do with it .         well   there are such a lot of them     said the duke  with feeling .      don   t change the subject .         sorry  my sweet .         what i said was  how could you have been so stupid as to let them get away .  i told you that servant was far too loyal .  you can   t trust someone like that .         no  my love .         you didn   t by any chance consider sending someone after them  i suppose .         bentzen  my dear .  and a couple of guards .         oh .     the duchess paused .  bentzen  as captain of the duke   s personal bodyguard  was as efficient a killer as a psychotic mongoose .  he would have been her choice .  it annoyed her to be temporarily deprived of a chance to fault her husband  but she rallied quite well .      he wouldn   t have needed to go out at all  if only you   d listened to me .  but you never do .         do what  my passion .      the duke yawned .  it had been a long night .  there had been a thunderstorm of quite unnecessarily dramatic proportions  and then there had been all that messy business with the knives .   it has already been mentioned that duke felmet was one step away from the throne .  the step in question was at the top of the flight leading to the great hall  down which king verence had tumbled in the dark only to land  against all the laws of probability  on his own dagger .   it had  however  been declared by his own physician to be a case of natural causes .  bentzen had gone to see the man and explained that falling down a flight of steps with a dagger in your back was a disease caused by unwise opening of the mouth .   in fact it had already been caught by several members of the king   s own bodyguard who had been a little bit hard of hearing .  there had been a minor epidemic .   the duke shuddered .  there were details about last night that were both hazy and horrible .   he tried to reassure himself that all the unpleasantness was over now  and he had a kingdom .  it wasn   t much of one  apparently being mainly trees  but it was a kingdom and it had a crown .   if only they could find it .   lancre castle was built on an outcrop of rock by an architect who had heard about gormenghast but hadn   t got the budget .  he   d done his best  though  with a tiny confection of cut price turrets  bargain basements  buttresses  crenellations  gargoyles  towers  courtyards  keeps and dungeons  in fact  just about everything a castle needs except maybe reasonable foundations and the kind of mortar that doesn   t wash away in a light shower .   the castle leaned vertiginously over the racing white water of the lancre river  which boomed darkly a thousand feet below .  every now and again a few bits fell in .   small as it was  though  the castle contained a thousand places to hide a crown .   the duchess swept out to find someone else to berate  and left lord felmet looking gloomily at the landscape .  it started to rain .   it was on this cue that there came a thunderous knocking at the castle door .  it seriously disturbed the castle porter  who was playing cripple mister onion with the castle cook and the castle   s fool in the warmth of the kitchen .   he growled and stood up .     there is a knocking without     he said .      without what .     said the fool .      without the door  idiot .      the fool gave him a worried look .     a knocking without a door .     he said suspiciously .     this isn   t some kind of zen  is it .      when the porter had grumbled off in the direction of the gatehouse the cook pushed another farthing into the kitty and looked sharply over his cards at the fool .      what   s a zen .     he said .   the fool   s bells tinkled as he sorted through his cards .  without thinking  he said     oh  a sub sect of the turnwise klatch philosophical system of sumtin  noted for its simple austerity and the offer of personal tranquillity and wholeness achieved through meditation and breathing techniques  an interesting aspect is the asking of apparently nonsensical questions in order to widen the doors of perception .         how   s that again .     said the cook suspiciously .  he was on edge .  when he   d taken the breakfast up to the great hall he   d kept getting the feeling that something was trying to take the tray out of his hands .  and as if that wasn   t bad enough  this new duke had sent him back for   he shuddered .  oatmeal .  and a runny boiled egg .  the cook was too old for this sort of thing .  he was set in his ways .  he was a cook in the real feudal tradition .  if it didn   t have an apple in its mouth and you couldn   t roast it  he didn   t want to serve it .   the fool hesitated with a card in his hand  suppressed his panic and thought quickly .      i   faith  nuncle     he squeaked     thou   t more full of questions than a martlebury is of mizzensails .      the cook relaxed .      well  ok     he said  not entirely satisfied .  the fool lost the next three hands  just to be on the safe side .   the porter  meanwhile  unfastened the hatch in the wicket gate and peered out .      who dost knock without .     he growled .   the soldier  drenched and terrified though he was  hesitated .      without .  without what .     he said .      if you   re going to bugger about  you can bloody well stay without all day     said the porter calmly .      no .  i must see the duke upon the instant .     shouted the guard .     witches are abroad .      the porter was about to come back with     good time of year for it     or    wish i was  too     but stopped when he saw the man   s face .  it wasn   t the face of a man who would enter into the spirit of the thing .  it was the look of someone who had seen things a decent man shouldn   t wot of          witches .     said lord felmet .      witches .     said the duchess .   in the drafty corridors  a voice as faint as the wind in distant keyholes said  with a note of hope     witches .      the psychically inclined          it   s meddling  that   s what it is     said granny weatherwax .     and no good will come of it .         it   s very romantic     said magrat breathily  and heaved a sigh .      goochy goo     said nanny ogg .      anyway     said magrat     you killed that horrid man .         i never did .  i just encouraged   things to take their course .     granny weatherwax frowned .     he didn   t have no respect .  once people lose their respect  it means trouble .         izzy wizzy wazzy  den .         that other man brought him out here to save him .     shouted magrat .     he wanted us to keep him safe .  it   s obvious .  it   s destiny .         oh  obvious     said granny .     i   ll grant you it   s obvious .  trouble is  just because things are obvious doesn   t mean they   re true .      she weighed the crown in her hands .  it felt very heavy  in a way that went beyond mere pounds and ounces .      yes  but the point is       magrat began .      the point is     said granny     that people are going to come looking .  serious people .  serious looking .  pull down the walls and burn off the thatch looking .  and           howsa boy  den .            and  gytha  i   m sure we   ll all be a lot happier if you   d stop gurgling like that .     granny snapped .  she could feel her nerves coming on .  her nerves always played up when she was unsure about things .  besides  they had retired to magrat   s cottage  and the decor was getting to her  because magrat believed in nature   s wisdom and elves and the healing power of colors and the cycle of the seasons and a lot of other things granny weatherwax didn   t have any truck with .      you   re not after telling me how to look after a child     snapped nanny ogg mildly .     and me with fifteen of my own .         i   m just saying that we ought to think about it     said granny .   the other two watched her for some time .      well .     said magrat .   granny   s fingers drummed on the edge of the crown .  she frowned .      first  we   ve got to take him away from here     she said  and held up a hand .     no  gytha  i   m sure your cottage is ideal and everything  but it   s not safe .  he   s got to be somewhere away from here  a long way away  where no one knows who he is .  and then there   s this .     she tossed the crown from hand to hand .      oh  that   s easy     said magrat .     i mean  you just hide it under a stone or something .  that   s easy .  much easier than babies .         it ain   t     said granny .     the reason being  the country   s full of babies and they all look the same  but i don   t reckon there   s many crowns .  they have this way of being found  anyway .  they kind of call out to people   s minds .  if you bunged it under a stone up here  in a week   s time it   d get itself discovered by accident .  you mark my words .         it   s true  is that     said nanny ogg  earnestly .     how many times have you thrown a magic ring into the deepest depths of the ocean and then  when you get home and have a nice bit of turbot for your tea  there it is .      they considered this in silence .      never     said granny irritably .     and nor have you .  anyway  he might want it back .  if it   s rightfully his  that is .  kings set a lot of store by crowns .  really  gytha  sometimes you say the most           i   ll just make some tea  shall i .     said magrat brightly  and disappeared into the scullery .   the two elderly witches sat on either side of the table in polite and prickly silence .  finally nanny ogg said     she done it up nice  hasn   t she .  flowers and everything .  what are them things on the walls .         sigils     said granny sourly .     or some such .         fancy     said nanny ogg  politely .     and all them robes and wands and things too .         modern     said granny weatherwax  with a sniff .     when i was a gel  we had a lump of wax and a couple of pins and had to be content .  we had to make our own enchantment in them days .         ah  well  we   ve all passed a lot of water since then     said nanny ogg sagely .  she gave the baby a comforting jiggle .   granny weatherwax sniffed .  nanny ogg had been married three times and ruled a tribe of children and grandchildren all over the kingdom .  certainly  it was not actually forbidden for witches to get married .  granny had to concede that  but reluctantly .  very reluctantly .  she sniffed again  disapprovingly  this was a mistake .      what   s that smell .     she snapped .      ah     said nanny ogg  carefully repositioning the baby .     i expect i   ll just go and see if magrat has any clean rags  shall i .      and now granny was left alone .  she felt embarrassed  as one always does when left alone in someone else   s room  and fought the urge to get up and inspect the books on the shelf over the sideboard or examine the mantelpiece for dust .  she turned the crown around and around in her hands .  again  it gave the impression of being bigger and heavier than it actually was .   she caught sight of the mirror over the mantelpiece and looked down at the crown .  it was tempting .  it was practically begging her to try it for size .  well  and why not .  she made sure that the others weren   t around and then  in one movement  whipped off her hat and placed the crown on her head .   it seemed to fit .  granny drew herself up proudly  and waved a hand imperiously in the general direction of the hearth .      jolly well do this     she said .  she beckoned arrogantly at the grandfather clock .     chop his head off  what ho     she commanded .  she smiled grimly .   and froze as she heard the screams  and the thunder of horses  and the deadly whisper of arrows and the damp  solid sound of spears in flesh .  charge after charge echoed across her skull .  sword met shield  or sword  or bone   relentlessly .  years streamed across her mind in the space of a second .  there were times when she lay among the dead  or hanging from the branch of a tree  but always there were hands that would pick her up again  and place her on a velvet cushion     granny very carefully lifted the crown off her head   it was an effort  it didn   t like it much   and laid it on the table .      so that   s being a king for you  is it .     she said softly .     i wonder why they all want the job .         do you take sugar .     said magrat  behind her .      you   d have to be a born fool to be a king     said granny .      sorry .      granny turned .     didn   t see you come in     she said .     what was it you said .         sugar in your tea .         three spoons     said granny promptly .  it was one of the few sorrows of granny weatherwax   s life that  despite all her efforts  she   d arrived at the peak of her career with a complexion like a rosy apple and all her teeth .  no amount of charms could persuade a wart to take root on her handsome if slightly equine features  and vast intakes of sugar only served to give her boundless energy .  a wizard she   d consulted had explained it was on account of her having a metabolism  which at least allowed her to feel vaguely superior to nanny ogg  who she suspected had never even seen one .   magrat dutifully dug out three heaped ones .  it would be nice  she thought wistfully  if someone could say    thank you    occasionally .   she became aware that the crown was staring at her .      you can feel it  can you .     said granny .     it said  didn   t i .  crowns call out .         it   s horrible .         no  no .  it   s just being what it is .  it can   t help it .         but it   s magic .         it   s just being what it is     granny repeated .      it   s trying to get me to try it on     said magrat  her hand hovering .      it does that  yes .         but i shall be strong     said magrat .      so i should think     said granny  her expression suddenly curiously wooden .     what   s gytha doing .         she   s giving the baby a wash in the sink     said magrat vaguely .     how can we hide something like this .  what   d happen if we buried it really deeply somewhere .         a badger   d dig it up     said granny wearily .     or someone   d go prospecting for gold or something .  or a tree   d tangle its roots around it and then be blown over in a storm  and then someone   d pick it up and put it on           unless they were as strong minded as us     magrat pointed out .      unless that  of course     said granny  staring at her fingernails .     though the thing with crowns is  it isn   t the putting them on that   s the problem  it   s the taking them off .      magrat picked it up and turned it over in her hands .      it   s not as though it even looks much like a crown     she said .      you   ve seen a lot  i expect     said granny .     you   d be an expert on them  naturally .         seen a fair few .  they   ve got a lot more jewels on them  and cloth bits in the middle     said magrat defiantly .     this is just a thin little thing           magrat garlick .         i have .  when i was being trained up by goodie whemper              maysherestinpeace              maysherestinpeace  she used to take me over to razorback or into lancre whenever the strolling players were in town .  she was very keen on the theater .  they   ve got more crowns than you can shake a stick at although  mind       she paused       goodie did say they   re made of tin and paper and stuff .  and just glass for the jewels .  but they look more realler than this one .  do you think that   s strange .         things that try to look like things often do look more like things than things .  well known fact     said granny .     but i don   t hold with encouraging it .  what do they stroll about playing  then  in these crowns .         you don   t know about the theater .     said magrat .   granny weatherwax  who never declared her ignorance of anything  didn   t hesitate .     oh  yes     she said .     it   s one of them style of things  then  is it .         goodie whemper said it held a mirror up to life     said magrat .     she said it always cheered her up .         i expect it would     said granny  striking out .     played properly  at any rate .  good people  are they  these theater players .         i think so .         and they stroll around the country  you say .     said granny thoughtfully  looking toward the scullery door .      all over the place .  there   s a troupe in lancre now  i heard .  i haven   t been because  you know .     magrat looked down .        tis not right  a woman going into such places by herself .      granny nodded .  she thoroughly approved of such sentiments so long as there was  of course  no suggestion that they applied to her .   she drummed her fingers on magrat   s tablecloth .      right     she said .     and why not .  go and tell gytha to wrap the baby up well .  it   s a long time since i heard a theater played properly .        magrat was entranced  as usual .  the theater was no more than some lengths of painted sacking  a plank stage laid over a few barrels  and half a dozen benches set out in the village square .  but at the same time it had also managed to become the castle  another part of the castle  the same part a little later  the battlefield and now it was a road outside the city .  the afternoon would have been perfect if it wasn   t for granny weatherwax .   after several piercing glares at the three man orchestra to see if she could work out which instrument the theater was  the old witch had finally paid attention to the stage  and it was beginning to become apparent to magrat that there were certain fundamental aspects of the theater that granny had not yet grasped .   she was currently bouncing up and down on her stool with rage .      he   s killed him     she hissed .     why isn   t anyone doing anything about it .  he   s killed him .  and right up there in front of everyone .      magrat held on desperately to her colleague   s arm as she struggled to get to her feet .      it   s all right     she whispered .     he   s not dead .         are you calling me a liar  my girl .     snapped granny .     i saw it all .         look  granny  it   s not really real  d   you see .      granny weatherwax subsided a little  but still grumbled under her breath .  she was beginning to feel that things were trying to make a fool of her .   up on the stage a man in a sheet was giving a spirited monologue .  granny listened intently for some minutes  and then nudged magrat in the ribs .      what   s he on about now .     she demanded .      he   s saying how sorry he was that the other man   s dead     said magrat  and in an attempt to change the subject added hurriedly     there   s a lot of crowns  isn   t there .      granny was not to be distracted .     what   d he go and kill him for  then .     she said .      well  it   s a bit complicated       said magrat  weakly .      it   s shameful .     snapped granny .     and the poor dead thing still lying there .      magrat gave an imploring look to nanny ogg  who was masticating an apple and studying the stage with the glare of a research scientist .      i reckon     she said slowly     i reckon it   s all just pretendin    .  look  he   s still breathing .      the rest of the audience  who by now had already decided that this commentary was all part of the play  stared as one man at the corpse .  it blushed .      and look at his boots  too     said nanny critically .     a real king   d be ashamed of boots like that .      the corpse tried to shuffle its feet behind a cardboard bush .   granny  feeling in some obscure way that they had scored a minor triumph over the purveyors of untruth and artifice  helped herself to an apple from the bag and began to take a fresh interest .  magrat   s nerves started to unknot  and she began to settle down to enjoy the play .  but not  as it turned out  for very long .  her willing suspension of disbelief was interrupted by a voice saying      what   s this bit .      magrat sighed .     well     she hazarded     he thinks that he is the prince  but he   s really the other king   s daughter  dressed up as a man .      granny subjected the actor to a long analytical stare .      he is a man     she said .     in a straw wig .  making his voice squeaky .      magrat shuddered .  she knew a little about the conventions of the theater .  she had been dreading this bit .  granny weatherwax had views .      yes  but     she said wretchedly     it   s the theater  see .  all the women are played by men .         why .         they don   t allow no women on the stage     said magrat in a small voice .  she shut her eyes .   in fact  there was no outburst from the seat on her left .  she risked a quick glance .   granny was quietly chewing the same bit of apple over and over again  her eyes never leaving the action .      don   t make a fuss  esme     said nanny  who also knew about granny   s views .     this is a good bit .  i reckon i   m getting the hang of it .      someone tapped granny on the shoulder and a voice said     madam  will you kindly remove your hat .      granny turned around very slowly on her stool  as though propelled by hidden motors  and subjected the interrupter to a hundred kilowatt diamond blue stare .  the man wilted under it and sagged back onto his stool  her face following him all the way down .      no     she said .   he considered the options .     all right     he said .   granny turned back and nodded to the actors  who had paused to watch her .      i don   t know what you   re staring at     she growled .     get on with it .      nanny ogg passed her another bag .      have a humbug     she said .   silence again filled the makeshift theater except for the hesitant voices of the actors  who kept glancing at the bristling figure of granny weatherwax  and the sucking sounds of a couple of boiled humbugs being relentlessly churned from cheek to cheek .   then granny said  in a piercing voice that made one actor drop his wooden sword     there   s a man over on the side there whispering to them .         he   s a prompter     said magrat .     he tells them what to say .         don   t they know .         i think they   re forgetting     said magrat sourly .     for some reason .      granny nudged nanny ogg .      what   s going on now .     she said .     why   re all them kings and people up there .         it   s a banquet  see     said nanny ogg authoritatively .     because of the dead king  him in the boots  as was  only now if you look  you   ll see he   s pretending to be a soldier  and everyone   s making speeches about how good he was and wondering who killed him .         are they .     said granny  grimly .  she cast her eyes along the cast  looking for the murderer .   she was making up her mind .   then she stood up .   her black shawl billowed around her like the wings of an avenging angel  come to rid the world of all that was foolishness and pretense and artifice and sham .  she seemed somehow a lot bigger than normal .  she pointed an angry finger at the guilty party .      he done it .     she shouted triumphantly .     we all seed    im .  he done it with a dagger .        the audience filed out  contented .  it had been a good play on the whole  they decided  although not very easy to follow .  but it had been a jolly good laugh when all the kings had run off  and the woman in black had jumped up and did all the shouting .  that alone had been well worth the ha   penny admission .   the three witches sat alone on the edge of the stage .      i wonder how they get all them kings and lords to come here and do this .     said granny  totally unabashed .     i   d have thought they   d been too busy .  ruling and similar .         no     said magrat  wearily .     i still don   t think you quite understand .         well  i   m going to get to the bottom of it     snapped granny .  she got back onto the stage and pulled aside the sacking curtains .      you .     she shouted .     you   re dead .      the luckless former corpse  who was eating a ham sandwich to calm his nerves  fell backward off his stool .   granny kicked a bush .  her boot went right through it .      see .     she said to the world in general in a strangely satisfied voice .     nothing   s real .  it   s all just paint  and sticks and paper at the back .         may i assist you  good ladies .      it was a rich and wonderful voice  with every diphthong gliding beautifully into place .  it was a golden brown voice .  if the creator of the multiverse had a voice  it was a voice such as this .  if it had a drawback  it was that it wasn   t a voice you could use  for example  for ordering coal .  coal ordered by this voice would become diamonds .   it apparently belonged to a large fat man who had been badly savaged by a mustache .  pink veins made a map of quite a large city on his cheeks  his nose could have hidden successfully in a bowl of strawberries .  he wore a ragged jerkin and holey tights with an aplomb that nearly convinced you that his velvet and vermine robes were in the wash just at the moment .  in one hand he held a towel  with which he had clearly been removing the make up that still greased his features .      i know you     said granny .     you done the murder .     she looked sideways at magrat  and admitted  grudgingly     leastways  it looked like it .         so glad .  it is always a pleasure to meet a true connoisseur .  olwyn vitoller  at your service .  manager of this band of vagabonds     said the man and  removing his moth eaten hat  he treated her to a low bow .  it was less an obeisance than an exercise in advanced topology .   the hat swerved and jerked through a series of complex arcs  ending up at the end of an arm which was now pointing in the direction of the sky .  one of his legs  meanwhile  had wandered off behind him .  the rest of his body sagged politely until his head was level with granny   s knees .      yes  well     said granny .  she felt that her clothes had grown a bit larger and much hotter .      i thought you was very good  too     said nanny ogg .     the way you shouted all them words so graciously .  i could tell you was a king .         i hope we didn   t upset things     said magrat .      my dear lady     said vitoller .     could i begin to tell you how gratifying it is for a mere mummer to learn that his audience has seen behind the mere shell of greasepaint to the spirit beneath .         i expect you could     said granny .     i expect you could say anything  mr .  vitoller .      he replaced his hat and their eyes met in the long and calculating stare of one professional weighing up another .  vitoller broke first  and tried to pretend he hadn   t been competing .      and now     he said     to what do i owe this visit from three such charming ladies .      in fact he   d won .  granny   s mouth fell open .  she would not have described herself as anything much above    handsome  considering .     nanny  on the other hand  was as gummy as a baby and had a face like a small dried raisin .  the best you could say for magrat was that she was decently plain and well scrubbed and as flat chested as an ironing board with a couple of peas on it  even if her head was too well stuffed with fancies .  granny could feel something  some sort of magic at work .  but not the kind she was used to .   it was vitoller   s voice .  by the mere process of articulation it transformed everything it talked about .   look at the two of them  she told herself  primping away like a couple of ninnies .  granny stopped her hand in the process of patting her own iron hard bun  and cleared her throat meaningfully .      we   d like to talk to you  mr .  vitoller .     she indicated the actors  who were dismantling the set and staying well out of her way  and added in a conspiratorial whisper     somewhere private .         dear lady  but of a certain     he said .     currently i have lodgings in yonder esteemed watering hole .      the witches looked around .  eventually magrat risked     you mean in the pub .        it was cold and drafty in the great hall of lancre castle  and the new chamberlain   s bladder wasn   t getting any younger .  he stood and squirmed under the gaze of lady felmet .      oh  yes     he said .     we   ve got them all right .  lots .         and people don   t do anything about them .     said the duchess .   the chamberlain blinked .     i   m sorry .     he said .      people tolerate them .         oh  indeed     said the chamberlain happily .     it   s considered good luck to have a witch living in your village .  my word  yes .         why .      the chamberlain hesitated .  the last time he had resorted to a witch it had been because certain rectal problems had turned the privy into a daily torture chamber  and the jar of ointment she had prepared had turned the world into a nicer place .      they smooth out life   s little humps and bumps     he said .      where i come from  we don   t allow witches     said the duchess sternly .     and we don   t propose to allow them here .  you will furnish us with their addresses .         addresses  ladyship .         where they live .  i trust your tax gatherers know where to find them .         ah     said the chamberlain  miserably .   the duke leaned forward on his throne .      i trust     he said     that they do pay taxes .         not  exactly pay taxes  my lord     said the chamberlain .   there was silence .  finally the duke prompted     go on  man .         well  it   s more that they don   t pay  you see .  we never felt  that is  the old king didn   t think   well  they just don   t .      the duke laid a hand on his wife   s arm .      i see     he said coldly .     very well .  you may go .      the chamberlain gave him a brief nod of relief and scuttled crabwise from the hall .      well .     said the duchess .      indeed .         that was how your family used to run a kingdom  was it .  you had a positive duty to kill your cousin .  it was clearly in the interests of the species     said the duchess .     the weak don   t deserve to survive .      the duke shivered .  she would keep on reminding him .  he didn   t  on the whole  object to killing people  or at least ordering them to be killed and then watching it happen .  but killing a kinsman rather stuck in the throat or   he recalled   the liver .      quite so     he managed .     of course  there would appear to be many witches  and it might be difficult to find the three that were on the moor .         that doesn   t matter .         of course not .         put matters in hand .         yes  my love .      matters in hand .  he   d put matters in hand all right .  if he closed his eyes he could see the body tumbling down the steps .  had there been a hiss of shocked breath  down in the darkness of the hall .  he   d been certain they were alone .  matters in hand .  he   d tried to wash the blood off his hand .  if he could wash the blood off  he told himself  it wouldn   t have happened .  he   d scrubbed and scrubbed .  scrubbed still he screamed .     granny wasn   t at home in public houses .  she sat stiffly to attention behind her port and lemon  as if it were a shield against the lures of the world .   nanny ogg  on the other hand  was enthusiastically downing her third drink and  granny thought sourly  was well along that path which would probably end up with her usual dancing on the table  showing her petticoats and singing    the hedgehog can never be buggered at all .      the table was covered with copper coins .  vitoller and his wife sat at either end  counting .  it was something of a race .   granny considered mrs .  vitoller as she snatched farthings from under her husband   s fingers .  she was an intelligent looking woman  who appeared to treat her husband much as a sheepdog treats a favorite lamb .  the complexities of the marital relationship were known to granny only from a distance  in the same way that an astronomer can view the surface of a remote and alien world  but it had already occurred to her that a wife to vitoller would have to be a very special woman with bottomless reserves of patience and organizational ability and nimble fingers .      mrs .  vitoller     she said eventually     may i make so bold as to ask if your union has been blessed with fruit .      the couple looked blank .      she means       nanny ogg began .      no  i see     said mrs .  vitoller  quietly .     no .  we had a little girl once .      a small cloud hung over the table .  for a second or two vitoller looked merely human sized  and much older .  he stared at the small pile of cash in front of him .      only  you see  there is this child     said granny  indicating the baby in nanny ogg   s arms .     and he needs a home .      the vitollers stared .  then the man sighed .      it is no life for a child     he said .     always moving .  always a new town .  and no room for schooling .  they say that   s very important these days .     but his eyes didn   t look away .   mrs .  vitoller said     why does he need a home .         he hasn   t got one     said granny .     at least  not one where he would be welcome .      the silence continued .  then mrs .  vitoller said     and you  who ask this  you are by way of being his    .         godmothers     said nanny ogg promptly .  granny was slightly taken aback .  it never would have occurred to her .   vitoller played abstractly with the coins in front of him .  his wife reached out across the table and touched his hand  and there was a moment of unspoken communion .  granny looked away .  she had grown expert at reading faces  but there were times when she preferred not to .      money is  alas  tight       vitoller began .      but it will stretch     said his wife firmly .      yes .  i think it will .  we should be happy to take care of him .      granny nodded  and fished in the deepest recesses of her cloak .  at last she produced a small leather bag  which she tipped out onto the table .  there was a lot of silver  and even a few tiny gold coins .      this should take care of       she groped      nappies and suchlike .  clothes and things .  whatever .         a hundred times over  i should think     said vitoller weakly .     why didn   t you mention this before .         if i   d had to buy you  you wouldn   t be worth the price .         but you don   t know anything about us .     said mrs .  vitoller .      we don   t  do we .     said granny  calmly .     naturally we   d like to hear how he gets along .  you could send us letters and suchlike .  but it would not be a good idea to talk about all this after you   ve left  do you see .  for the sake of the child .      mrs .  vitoller looked at the two old women .      there   s something else here  isn   t there .     she said .     something big behind all this .      granny hesitated  and then nodded .      but it would do us no good at all to know it .      another nod .   granny stood up as several actors came in  breaking the spell .  actors had a habit of filling all the space around them .      i have other things to see to     she said .     please excuse me .         what   s his name .     said vitoller .      tom     said granny  hardly hesitating .      john     said nanny .  the two witches exchanged glances .  granny won .      tom john     she said firmly  and swept out .   she met a breathless magrat outside the door .      i found a box     she said .     it had all the crowns and things in .  so i put it in  like you said  right underneath everything .         good     said granny .      our crown looked really tatty compared to the others .         it just goes to show  doesn   t it     said granny .     did anyone see you .         no  everyone was too busy  but       magrat hesitated  and blushed .      out with it  girl .         just after that a man came up and pinched my bottom .     magrat went a deep crimson and slapped her hand over her mouth .      did he .     said granny .     and then what .         and then  and then           yes .         he said  he said           what did he say .         he said     hallo  my lovely  what are you doing tonight .         granny ruminated on this for a while and then she said     old goodie whemper  she didn   t get out and about much  did she .         it was her leg  you know     said magrat .      but she taught you all the midwifery and everything .         oh  yes  that     said magrat .     i done lots .         but       granny hesitated  groping her way across unfamiliar territory      she never talked about what you might call the previous .         sorry .         you know     said granny  with an edge of desperation in her voice .     men and such .      magrat looked as if she was about to panic .     what about them .      granny weatherwax had done many unusual things in her time  and it took a lot to make her refuse a challenge .  but this time she gave in .      i think     she said helplessly     that it might be a good idea if you have a quiet word with nanny ogg one of these days .  fairly soon .      there was a cackle of laughter from the window behind them  a chink of glasses  and a thin voice raised in song         with a giraffe  if you stand on a stool .  but the hedgehog        granny stopped listening .     only not just now     she added .     the troupe got under way a few hours before sunset  their four carts lurching off down the road that led toward the sto plains and the big cities .  lancre had a town rule that all mummers  mountebanks and other potential criminals were outside the gates by sundown  it didn   t offend anyone really because the town had no walls to speak of  and no one much minded if people nipped back in again after dark .  it was the look of the thing that counted .   the witches watched from magrat   s cottage  using nanny ogg   s ancient green crystal ball .      it   s about time you learned how to get sound on this thing     granny muttered .  she gave it a nudge  filling the image with ripples .      it was very strange     said magrat .     in those carts .  the things they had .  paper trees  and all kinds of costumes  and       she waved her hands      there was this great big picture of forn parts  with all temples and things all rolled up .  it was beautiful .      granny grunted .      i thought it was amazing the way all those people became kings and things  didn   t you .  it was like magic .         magrat garlick  what are you saying .  it was just paint and paper .  anyone could see that .      magrat opened her mouth to speak  ran the ensuing argument through her head  and shut it again .      where   s nanny .     she said .      she   s lying out on the lawn     said granny .     she felt a bit poorly .     and from outside came the sound of nanny ogg being poorly at the top of her voice .   magrat sighed .      you know     she said     if we are his godmothers  we ought to have given him three gifts .  it   s traditional .         what are you talking about  girl .         three good witches are supposed to give the baby three gifts .  you know  like good looks  wisdom and happiness .     magrat pressed on defiantly .     that   s how it used to be done in the old days .         oh  you mean gingerbread cottages and all that     said granny dismissively .     spinning wheels and pumpkins and pricking your finger on rose thorns and similar .  i could never be having with all that .      she polished the ball reflectively .      yes  but       magrat said .  granny glanced up at her .  that was magrat for you .  head full of pumpkins .  everyone   s fairy godmother  for two pins .  but a good soul  underneath it all .  kind to small furry animals .  the sort of person who worried about baby birds falling out of nests .      look  if it makes you any happier     she muttered  surprised at herself .  she waved her hands vaguely over the image of the departing carts .     what   s it to be   wealth  beauty .         well  money isn   t everything  and if he takes after his father he   ll be handsome enough     magrat said  suddenly serious .     wisdom  do you think .         that   s something he   ll have to learn for himself     said granny .      perfect eyesight .  a good singing voice .     from the lawn outside came nanny ogg   s cracked but enthusiastic voice telling the night sky that a wizard   s staff has a knob on the end .      not important     said granny loudly .     you   ve got to think headology  see .  not muck about with all this beauty and wealth business .  that   s not important .      she turned back to the ball and gestured half heartedly .     you   d better go and get nanny  then  seeing as there should be three of us .      nanny was helped in  eventually  and had to have things explained to her .      three gifts  eh .     she said .     haven   t done one of them things since i was a gel  it takes me back   what   re you doing .      magrat was bustling around the room  lighting candles .      oh  we   ve got to create the right magical ambience     she explained .  granny shrugged  but said nothing  even in the face of the extreme provocation .  all witches did their magic in their own way  and this was magrat   s house .      what   re we going to give him  then .     said nanny .      we was just discussing it     said granny .      i know what he   ll want     said nanny .  she made a suggestion  which was received in frozen silence .      i don   t see what use that would be     said magrat  eventually .     wouldn   t it be rather uncomfortable .         he   ll thank us when he grows up  you mark my words     said nanny .     my first husband  he always said           something a bit less physical is generally the style of things     interrupted granny  glaring at nanny ogg .     there   s no need to go and spoil everything  gytha .  why do you always have to           well  at least i can say that i       nanny began .   both voices faded to a mutter .  there was a long edgy silence .      i think     said magrat  with brittle brightness     that perhaps it would be a good idea if we all go back to our little cottages and do it in our own way .  you know .  separately .  it   s been a long day and we   re all rather tired .         good idea     said granny firmly  and stood up .     come  nanny ogg     she snapped .     it   s been a long day and we   re all rather tired .      magrat heard them bickering as they wandered down the path .   she sat rather sadly amidst the colored candles  holding a small bottle of extremely thaumaturgical incense that she had ordered from a magical supplies emporium in faraway ankh morpork .  she had been rather looking forward to trying it .  sometimes  she thought  it would be nice if people could be a bit kinder     she stared at the ball .   well  she could make a start .      he will make friends easily     she whispered .  it wasn   t much  she knew  but it was something she   d never been able to get the hang of .   nanny ogg  sitting alone in her kitchen with her huge tomcat curled up on her lap  poured herself a nightcap and through the haze tried to remember the words of verse seventeen of the hedgehog song .  there was something about goats  she recalled  but the details eluded her .  time abraded memory .   she toasted the invisible presence .      a bloody good memory is what he ought to have     she said .     he   ll always remember the words .      and granny weatherwax  striding home alone through the midnight forest  wrapped her shawl around her and considered .  it had been a long day  and a trying one .  the theater had been the worst part .  all people pretending to be other people  things happening that weren   t real  bits of countryside you could put your foot through   granny liked to know where she stood  and she wasn   t certain she stood for that sort of thing .  the world seemed to be changing all the time .   it didn   t use to change so much .  it was bewildering .   she walked quickly through the darkness with the frank stride of someone who was at least certain that the forest  on this damp and windy night  contained strange and terrible things and she was it .      let him be whoever he thinks he is     she said .     that   s all anybody could hope for in this world .      like most people  witches are unfocused in time .  the difference is that they dimly realize it  and make use of it .  they cherish the past because part of them is still living there  and they can see the shadows the future casts before it .   granny could feel the shape of the future  and it had knives in it .     it began at five the next morning .  four men rode through the woods near granny   s cottage  tethered the horses out of earshot  and crept very cautiously through the mists .   the sergeant in charge was not happy in his work .  he was a ramtops man  and wasn   t at all certain about how you went about arresting a witch .  he was pretty certain  though  that the witch wouldn   t like the idea .  he didn   t like the idea of a witch not liking the idea .   the men were ramtoppers as well .  they were following him very closely  ready to duck behind him at the first sign of anything more unexpected than a tree .   granny   s cottage was a fungoid shape in the mist .  her unruly herb garden seemed to move  even in the still air .  it contained plants seen nowhere else in the mountains  their roots and seeds traded across five thousand miles of the discworld  and the sergeant could swear that one or two blooms turned toward him .  he shuddered .      what now  sarge .         we   we spread out     he said .     yes .  we spread out .  that   s what we do .      they moved carefully through the bracken .  the sergeant crouched behind a handy log  and said     right .  very good .  you   ve got the general idea .  now let   s spread out again  and this time we spread out separately .      the men grumbled a bit  but disappeared into the mist .  the sergeant gave them a few minutes to take up positions  then said     right .  now we        he paused .   he wondered whether he dared shout  and decided against it .   he stood up .  he removed his helmet  to show respect  and sidled through the damp grass to the back door .  he knocked  very gently .   after a wait of several seconds he clamped his helmet back on his head  said     no one in .  blast     and started to stride away .   the door opened .  it opened very slowly  and with the maximum amount of creak .  simple neglect wouldn   t have caused that depth of groan  you   d need careful work with hot water over a period of weeks .  the sergeant stopped  and then turned around very slowly while contriving to move as few muscles as possible .   he had mixed feelings about the fact that there was nothing in the doorway .  in his experience  doors didn   t just open themselves .   he cleared his throat nervously .   granny weatherwax  right by his ear  said     that   s a nasty cough you   ve got there .  you did right in coming to me .      the sergeant looked up at her with an expression of mad gratitude .  he said     argle .           she did what .     said the duke .   the sergeant stared fixedly at an area a few inches to the right of the duke   s chair .      she give me a cup of tea  sir     he said .      and what about your men .         she give them one too  sir .      the duke rose from his chair and put his arms around the sergeant   s rusting chain mail shoulders .  he was in a bad mood .  he had spent half the night washing his hands .  he kept thinking that something was whispering in his ear .  his breakfast oatmeal had been served up too salty and roasted with an apple in it  and the crook had hysterics in the kitchen .  you could tell the duke was extremely annoyed .  he was polite .  the duke was the kind of man who becomes more and more agreeable as his temper drains away  until the point is reached where the words    thank you so much    have the cutting edge of a guillotine .      sergeant     he said  walking the man slowly across the floor .      sir .         i   m not sure i made your orders clear  sergeant     said the duke  in snake tones .      sir .         i mean  it is possible i may have confused you .  i meant to say    bring me a witch  in chains if necessary     but perhaps what i really said was    go and have a cup of tea .     was this in fact the case .      the sergeant wrinkled his forehead .  sarcasm had not hitherto entered his life .  his experience of people being annoyed with him generally involved shouting and occasional bits of wood .      no  sir     he said .      i wonder why  then  you did not in fact do this thing that i asked .         sir .         i expect she said some magic words  did she .  i   ve heard about witches     said the duke  who had spent the night before reading  until his bandaged hands shook too much  some of the more excitable works on the subject .      i imagine she offered you visions of unearthly delight .  did she show you       the duke shuddered      dark fascinations and forbidden raptures  the like of which mortal men should not even think of  and demonic secrets that took you to the depths of man   s desires .      the duke sat down and fanned himself with his handkerchief .      are you all right  sir .     said the sergeant .      what .  oh  perfectly  perfectly .         only you   ve gone all red .         don   t change the subject  man     snapped the duke  pulling himself together a bit .     admit it   she offered you hedonistic and licentious pleasures known only to those who dabble in the carnal arts  didn   t she .      the sergeant stood to attention and stared straight ahead .      no  sir     he said  in the manner of one speaking the truth come what may .     she offered me a bun .         a bun .         yes  sir .  it had currants in it .      felmet sat absolutely still while he fought for internal peace .  finally  all he could manage was     and what did your men do about this .         they had a bun too  sir .  all except young roger  who isn   t allowed fruit  sir  on account of his trouble .      the duke sagged back on the window seat and put his hand over his eyes .  i was born to rule down on the plains  he thought  where it   s all flat and there isn   t all this weather and everything and there are people who don   t appear to be made of dough .  he   s going to tell me what this roger had .      he had a biscuit  sir .      the duke stared out at the trees .  he was angry .  he was extremely angry .  but twenty years of marriage to lady felmet had taught him not simply to control his emotions but to control his instincts as well  and not so much as the twitching of a muscle indicated the workings of his mind .  besides  arising out of the black depths of his head was an emotion that  hitherto  he had a little time for .  curiosity was flashing a fin .   the duke had managed quite well for fifty years without finding a use for curiosity .  it was not a trait much encouraged in aristocrats .  he had found certainty was a much better bet .  however  it occurred to him that for once curiosity might have its uses .   the sergeant was standing in the middle of the floor with the stolid air of one who is awaiting a word of command  and who is quite prepared so to wait until continental drift budges him from his post .  he had been in the undemanding service of the kings of lancre for many years  and it showed .  his body was standing to attention .  despite all his efforts his stomach stood at ease .   the duke   s gaze fell on the fool  who was sitting on his stool by the throne .  the hunched figure looked up  embarrassed  and gave his bells a half hearted shake .   the duke reached a decision .  the way to progress  he   d found  was to find weak spots .  he tried to shut away the thought that these included such things as a king   s kidneys at the top of a dark stairway  and concentrated on the matter in hand .      hand .  he   d scrubbed and scrubbed  but it seemed to have no effect .  eventually he   d gone down to the dungeons and borrowed one of the torturer   s wire brushes  and scrubbed and scrubbed with that  too .  that had no effect  either .  it made it worse .  the harder he scrubbed  the more blood there was .  he was afraid he might go mad     he wrestled the thought to the back of his mind .  weak spots .  that was it .  the fool looked all weak spot .      you may go  sergeant .         sir     said the sergeant  and marched out stiffly .      fool .         marry  sir       said the fool nervously  and gave his hated mandolin a quick strum .   the duke sat down on the throne .      i am already extremely married     he said .     advise me  my fool .         i   faith  nuncle       said the fool .      nor am i thy nuncle .  i feel sure i would have remembered     said lord felmet  leaning down until the prow of his nose was a few inches from the fool   s stricken face .     if you preface your next remark with nuncle  i   faith or marry  it will go hard with you .      the fool moved his lips silently  and then said     how do you feel about prithee .      the duke knew when to allow some slack .     prithee i can live with     he said .     so can you .  but no capering .     he grinned encouragingly .     how long have you been a fool  boy .         prithee  sirrah           the sirrah     said the duke  holding up a hand     on the whole  i think not .         prithee  sirra   sir     said the fool  and swallowed nervously .     all my life  sir .  seventeen years under the bladder  man and boy .  and my father before me .  and my nuncle at the same time as him .  and my grandad before them .  and his           your whole family have been fools .         family tradition  sir     said the fool .     prithee  i mean .      the duke smiled again  and the fool was too worried to notice how many teeth it contained .      you come from these parts  don   t you .     said the duke .      ma   yes  sir .         so you would know all about the native beliefs and so on .         i suppose so  sir .  prithee .         good .  where do you sleep  my fool .         in the stables  sir .         from now on you may sleep in the corridor outside my room     said the duke beneficently .      gosh .         and now     said the duke  his voice dripping across the fool like treacle over a pudding     tell me about witches          that night the fool slept on good royal flagstones in the whistling corridor above the great hall instead of the warm stuffy straw of the stables .      this is foolish     he told himself .     marry  but is it foolish enough .      he dozed off fitfully  into some sort of dream where a vague figure kept trying to attract his attention  and was only dimly aware of the voices of lord and lady felmet on the other side of the door .      it   s certainly a lot less drafty     said the duchess grudgingly .   the duke sat back in the armchair and smiled at his wife .      well .     she demanded .     where are the witches .         the chamberlain would appear to be right  beloved .  the witches seem to have the local people in thrall .  the sergeant of the guard came back empty handed .     handed   he came down heavily on the importunate thought .      you must have him executed     she said promptly .     to make an example to the others .         a course of action  my dear  which ultimately results in us ordering the last soldier to cut his own throat as an example to himself .  by the way     he added mildly     there would appear to be somewhat fewer servants around the place .  you know i would not normally interfere           then don   t     she snapped .     housekeeping is under my control .  i cannot abide slackness .         i   m sure you know best  but           what of these witches .  will you stand idly by and let trouble seed for the future .  will you let these witches defy you .  what of the crown .      the duke shrugged .     no doubt it ended in the river     he said .      and the child .  he was given to the witches .  do they do human sacrifice .         it would appear not     said the duke .  the duchess looked vaguely disappointed .      these witches     said the duke .     apparently  they seem to cast a spell on people .         well  obviously           not like a magic spell .  they seem to be respected .  they do medicine and so on .  it   s rather strange .  the mountain people seem to be afraid of them and proud of them at the same time .  it might be a little difficult to move against them .         i could come to believe     said the duchess darkly     that they have cast a glamor over you as well .      in fact the duke was intrigued .  power was always darkly fascinating  which was why he had married the duchess in the first place .  he stared fixedly at the fire .      in fact     said the duchess  who recognized the malign smile     you like it  don   t you .  the thought of the danger .  i remember when we were married  all that business with the knotted rope        she snapped her fingers in front of the duke   s glazed eyes .  he sat up .      not at all .     he shouted .      then what will you do .         wait .         wait .         wait  and consider .  patience is a virtue .      the duke sat back .  the smile he smiled could have spent a million years sitting on a rock .  and then  just below one eye  he started to twitch .   blood was oozing between the bandages on his hand .     once again the full moon rode the clouds .   granny weatherwax milked and fed the goats  banked the fire  put a cloth over the mirror and pulled her broomstick out from behind the door .  she went out  locked the back door behind her  and hung the key on its nail in the privy .   this was quite sufficient .  only once  in the entire history of witchery in the ramtops  had a thief broken into a witch   s cottage .  the witch concerned visited the most terrible punishment on him .    granny sat on the broom and muttered a few words  but without much conviction .  after a further couple of tries she got off  fiddled with the binding  and had another go .  there was a suspicion of glitter from one end of the stick  which quickly died away .      drat     she said  under her breath .   she looked around carefully  in case anyone was watching .  in fact it was only a hunting badger who  hearing the thumping of running feet  poked its head out from the bushes and saw granny hurtling down the path with the broomstick held stiff armed beside her .  at last the magic caught  and she managed to vault clumsily onto it before it trundled into the night sky as gracefully as a duck with one wing missing .   from above the trees came a muffled curse against all dwarfish mechanics .   most witches preferred to live in isolated cottages with the traditional curly chimneys and weed grown thatch .  granny weatherwax approved of this  it was no good being a witch unless you let people know .   nanny ogg didn   t care much about what people knew and even less for what they thought  and lived in a new  knick knack crammed cottage in the middle of lancre town itself and at the heart of her own private empire .  various daughters and daughters in law came in to cook and clean on a sort of rota .  every flat surface was stuffed with ornaments brought back by far traveling members of the family .  sons and grandsons kept the logpile stacked  the roof shingled  the chimney swept  the drinks cupboard was always full  the pouch by her rocking chair always stuffed with tobacco .  above the hearth was a huge pokerwork sign saying    mother .     no tyrant in the whole history of the world had ever achieved a domination so complete .   nanny ogg also kept a cat  a huge one eyed gray tom called greebo who divided his time between sleeping  eating and fathering the most enormous incestuous feline tribe .  he opened his eye like a yellow window into hell when he heard granny   s broomstick land awkwardly on the back lawn .  with the instinct of his kind he recognized granny as an inveterate cat hater and oozed gently under a chair .   magrat was already seated primly by the fire .   it is one of the few unbendable rules of magic that its practitioners cannot change their own appearance for any length of time .  their bodies develop a kind of morphic inertia and gradually return to their original shape .  but magrat tried .  every morning her hair was long  thick and blond  but by the evening it had always returned to its normal worried frizz .  to ameliorate the effect she had tried to plait violets and cowslips in it .  the result was not all she had hoped .  it gave the impression that a window box had fallen on her head .      good evening     said granny .      well met by moonlight     said magrat politely .     merry meet .  a star shines on           wotcha     said nanny ogg .  magrat winced .   granny sat down and started removing the pins that nailed her tall hat to her bun .  finally the sight of magrat dawned on her .      magrat .      the young witch jumped  and clamped her knuckly hands to the virtuous frontage of her gown .      yes .     she quavered .      what have you got on your lap .         it   s my familiar     she said defensively .      what happened to that toad you had .         it wandered off     muttered magrat .     anyway  it wasn   t very good .      granny sighed .  magrat   s desperate search for a reliable familiar had been going on for some time  and despite the love and attention she lavished on them they all seemed to have some terrible flaw  such as a tendency to bite  get trodden on or  in extreme cases  metamorphose .      that makes fifteen this year     said granny .     not counting the horse .  what   s this one .         it   s a rock     chuckled nanny ogg .      well  at least it should last     said granny .   the rock extended a head and gave her a look of mild amusement .      it   s a tortoise     said magrat .     i bought it down in sheep ridge market .  it   s incredibly old and knows many secrets  the man said .         i know that man     said granny .     he   s the one who sells goldfish that tarnish after a day or two .         anyway  i shall call him lightfoot     said magrat  her voice warm with defiance .     i can if i want .         yes  yes  all right  i   m sure     said granny .     anyway  how goes it  sisters .  it is two months since last we met .         it should be every new moon     said magrat sternly .     regular .         it was our grame   s youngest   s wedding     said nanny ogg .     couldn   t miss it .         and i was up all night with a sick goat     said granny weatherwax promptly .      yes  well     said magrat doubtfully .  she rummaged in her bag .     anyway  if we   re going to start  we   d better light the candles .      the senior witches exchanged a resigned glance .      but we got this lovely new lamp our tracie sent me     said nanny ogg innocently .     and i was going to poke up the fire a bit .         i have excellent night vision  magrat     said granny sternly .     and you   ve been reading them funny books .  grimmers .         grimories           you ain   t going to draw on the floor again  neither     warned nanny ogg .     it took our dreen days to clean up all those wossnames last time           runes     said magrat .  there was a look of pleading in her eyes .     look  just one candle .         all right     said nanny ogg  relenting a bit .     if it makes you feel any better .  just the one  mind .  and a decent white one .  nothing fancy .      magrat sighed .  it probably wasn   t a good idea to bring out the rest of the contents of her bag .      we ought to get a few more here     she said sadly .     it   s not right  a coven of three .         i didn   t know we was still a coven .  no one told me we was still a coven     sniffed granny weatherwax .     anyway  there   s no one else this side of the mountain  excepting old gammer dismass  and she doesn   t get out these days .         but a lot of young girls in my village       said magrat .     you know .  they could be keen .         that   s not how we do it  as well you know     said granny disapprovingly .     people don   t go and find witchcraft  it comes and finds them .         yes  yes     said magrat .     sorry .         right     said granny  slightly mollified .  she   d never mastered the talent for apologizing  but she appreciated it in other people .      what about this new duke  then     said nanny  to lighten the atmosphere .   granny sat back .     he had some houses burned down in bad ass     she said .     because of taxes .         how horrible     said magrat .      old king verence used to do that     said nanny .     terrible temper he had .         he used to let people get out first  though     said granny .      oh yes     said nanny  who was a staunch royalist .     he could be very gracious like that .  he   d pay for them to be rebuilt  as often as not .  if he remembered .         and every hogswatchnight  a side of venison .  regular     said granny wistfully .      oh  yes .  very respectful to witches  he was     added nanny ogg .     when he was out hunting people  if he met me in the woods  it was always off with his helmet and    i hope i finds you well  mistress ogg    and next day he   d send his butler down with a couple of bottles of something .  he was a proper king .         hunting people isn   t really right  though     said magrat .      well  no     granny weatherwax conceded .     but it was only if they   d done something bad .  he said they enjoyed it really .  and he used to let them go if they gave him a good run .         and then there was that great hairy thing of his     said nanny ogg .   there was a perceptible change in the atmosphere .  it became warmer  darker  filled at the corners with the shadows of unspoken conspiracy .      ah     said granny weatherwax distantly .     his droit de seigneur .         needed a lot of exercise     said nanny ogg  staring at the fire .      but next day he   d send his housekeeper around with a bag of silver and a hamper of stuff for the wedding     said granny .     many a couple got a proper start in life thanks to that .         ah     agreed nanny .     one or two individuals  too .         every inch a king     said granny .      what are you talking about .     said magrat suspiciously .     did he keep pets .      the two witches surfaced from whatever deeper current they had been swimming in .  granny weatherwax shrugged .      i must say     magrat went on  in severe tones     if you think so much of the old king  you don   t seem very worried about him being killed .  i mean  it was a pretty suspicious accident .         that   s kings for you     said granny .     they come and go  good and bad .  his father poisoned the king we had before .         that was old thargum     said nanny ogg .     had a big red beard  i recall .  he was very gracious too  you know .         only now no one must say felmet killed the king     said magrat .      what .     said granny .      he had some people executed in lancre  the other day for saying it     magrat went on .     spreading malicious lies  he said .  he said anyone saying different will see the inside of his dungeons  only not for long .  he said verence died of natural causes .         well  being assassinated is natural causes for a king     said granny .     i don   t see why he   s so sheepish about it .  when old thargum was killed they stuck his head on a pole  had a big bonfire and everyone in the palace got drunk for a week .         i remember     said nanny .     they carried his head all around the villages to show he was dead .  very convincing  i thought .  specially for him .  he was grinning .  i think it was the way he would have liked to go .         i think we might have to keep an eye on this one  though     said granny .     i think he might be a bit clever .  that   s not a good thing  in a king .  and i don   t think he knows how to show respect .         a man came to see me last week to ask if i wanted to pay any taxes     said magrat .     i told him no .         he came to see me  too     said nanny ogg .     but our jason and our wane went out and tole him we didn   t want to join .         small man  bald  black cloak .     said granny thoughtfully .      yes     said the other two .      he was hanging about in my raspberry bushes     said granny .     only  when i went out to see what he wanted  he ran away .         actually  i gave him tuppence     said magrat .     he said he was going to be tortured  you see  if he didn   t get witches to pay their taxes          lord felmet looked carefully at the two coins in his lap .   then he looked at his tax gatherer .      well .     he said .   the tax gatherer cleared his throat .     well  sir  you see .  i explained about the need to employ a standing army  ekcetra  and they said why  and i said because of bandits  ekcetra  and they said bandits never bothered them .         and civil works .         ah .  yes .  well  i pointed out the need to build and maintain bridges  ekcetra .         and .         they said they didn   t use them .         ah     said the duke knowledgeably .     they can   t cross running water .         not sure about that  sir .  i think witches cross anything they like .         did they say anything else .     said the duke .   the tax gatherer twisted the hem of his robe distractedly .      well  sir .  i mentioned how taxes help to maintain the king   s peace  sir           and .         they said the king should maintain his own peace  sir .  and then they gave me a look .         what sort of look .      the duke sat with his thin face cupped in one hand .  he was fascinated .      it   s sort of hard to describe     said the taxman .  he tried to avoid lord felmet   s gaze  which was giving him the distinct impression that the tiled floor was fleeing away in all directions and had already covered several acres .  lord felmet   s fascination was to him what a pin is to a purple emperor .      try     the duke invited .   the taxman blushed .      well     he said .     it   wasn   t nice .      which demonstrates that the tax gatherer was much better at figures than words .  what he would have said  if embarrassment  fear  poor memory and a complete lack of any kind of imagination hadn   t conspired against it  was      when i was a little boy  and staying with my aunt  and she had told me not to touch the cream  ekcetra  and she had put it on a high shelf in the pantry  and i got a stool and went after it when she was out anyway  and she   d come back and i didn   t know  and i couldn   t reach the bowl properly and it smashed on the floor  and she opened the door and glared at me  it was that look .  but the worst thing was  they knew it .         not nice     said the duke .      no  sir .      the duke drummed the fingers of his left hand on the arm of his throne .  the tax gatherer coughed again .      you   re   you   re not going to force me to go back  are you .     he said .      um .     said the duke .  he waved a hand irritably .     no  no     he said .     not at all .  just call in at the torturer on your way out .  see when he can fit you in .      the taxman gave him a look of gratitude  and bobbed a bow .      yes  sir .  at once  sir .  thank you  sir .  you   re very           yes  yes     said lord felmet  absently .     you may go .      the duke was left alone in the vastness of the hall .  it was raining again .  every once in a while a piece of plaster smashed down on the tiles  and there was a crunching from the walls as they settled still further .  the air smelled of old cellars .   gods  he hated this kingdom .   it was so small  only forty miles long and maybe ten miles wide  and nearly all of it was cruel mountains with ice green slopes and knife edge crests  or dense huddled forests .  a kingdom like that shouldn   t be any trouble .   what he couldn   t quite fathom was this feeling that it had depth .  it seemed to contain far too much geography .   he rose and paced the floor to the balcony  with its unrivaled view of trees .  it struck him that the trees were also looking back at him .   he could feel the resentment .  but that was odd  because the people themselves hadn   t objected .  they didn   t seem to object to anything very much .  verence had been popular enough  in his way .  there   d been quite a turnout for the funeral  he recalled the lines of solemn faces .  not stupid faces .  by no means stupid .  just preoccupied  as though what kings did wasn   t really very important .   he found that almost as annoying as trees .  a jolly good riot  now  that would have been more   more appropriate .  one could have ridden out and hanged people  there would have been the creative tension so essential to the proper development of the state .  back down on the plains  if you kicked people they kicked back .  up here  when you kicked people they moved away and just waited patiently for your leg to fall off .  how could a king go down in history ruling a people like that .  you couldn   t oppress them any more than you could oppress a mattress .   he had raised taxes and burned a few villages on general principles  just to show everyone who they were dealing with .  it didn   t seem to have any effect .   and then there were these witches .  they haunted him .      fool .      the fool  who had been having a quiet doze behind the throne  awoke in terror .      yes .         come hither  fool .      the fool jingled miserably across the floor .      tell me  fool  does it always rain here .         marry  nuncle           just answer the question     said lord felmet  with iron patience .      sometimes it stops  sir .  to make room for the snow .  and sometimes we get some right squand   ring orgulous fogs     said the fool .      orgulous .     said the duke  absently .   the fool couldn   t stop himself .  his horrified ears heard his mouth blurt out     thick  my lord .  from the latatian orgulum  a soup or broth .      but the duke wasn   t listening .  listening to the prattle of underlings was not  in his experience  particularly worthwhile .      i am bored  fool .         let me entertain you  my lord  with many a merry quip and lightsome jest .         try me .      the fool licked his dry lips .  he hadn   t actually expected this .  king verence had been happy enough just to give him a kick  or throw a bottle at his head .  a real king .      i   m waiting .  make me laugh .      the fool took the plunge .      why  sirrah     he quavered     why may a caudled fillhorse be deemed the brother to a hiren candle in the night .      the duke frowned .  the fool felt it better not to wait .      withal  because a candle may be greased  yet a fillhorse be without a fat argier     he said and  because it was part of the joke  patted lord felmet lightly with his balloon on a stick and twanged his mandolin .   the duke   s index finger tapped an abrupt tattoo on the arm of the throne .      yes .     he said .     and then what happened .         that  er  was by way of being the whole thing     said the fool  and added     my grandad thought it was one of his best .         i daresay he told it differently     said the duke .  he stood up .     summon my huntsmen .  i think i shall ride out on the chase .  and you can come too .         my lord  i cannot ride .      for the first time that morning lord felmet smiled .      capital .     he said .     we will give you a horse that can   t be ridden .  ha .  ha .      he looked down at his bandages .  and afterward  he told himself  i   ll get the armorer to send me up a file .     a year went past .  the days followed one another patiently .  right back at the beginning of the multiverse they had tried all passing at the same time  and it hadn   t worked .   tomjon sat under hwel   s rickety table  watching his father as he walked up and down between the lattys  waving one arm and talking .  vitoller always waved his arms when he spoke  if you tied his hands behind his back he would be dumb .      all right     he was saying     how about the king   s brides .         last year     said the voice of hwel .      all right  then .  we   ll give them mallo  the tyrant of klatch     said vitoller  and his larynx smoothly changed gear as his voice became a great rolling thing that could rattle the windows across the width of the average town square .        in blood i came  and by blood rule  that none will dare assay these walls of blood              we did it the year before     said hwel calmly .     anyway  people are fed up with kings .  they want a bit of a chuckle .         they are not fed up with my kings     said vitoller .     my dear boy  people do not come to the theater to laugh  they come to experience  to learn  to wonder           to laugh     said hwel  flatly .     have a look at this one .      tomjon heard the rustle of paper and the creak of wickerwork as vitoller lowered his weight onto a props basket .      a wizard of sorts     vitoller read .     or  please yourself .      hwel stretched his legs under the table and dislodged tomjon .  he hauled the boy out by one ear .      what   s this .     said vitoller .     wizards .  demons .  imps .  merchants .         i   m rather pleased with act ii  scene iv     said hwel  propelling the toddler toward the props box .     comic washing up with two servants .         any death bed scenes .     said vitoller hopefully .      no o     said hwel .     but i can do you a humorous monologue in act iii .         a humorous monologue .         all right  there   s room for a soliloquy in the last act     said hwel hurriedly .     i   ll write one tonight  no problem .         and a stabbing     said vitoller  getting to his feet .     a foul murder .  that always goes down well .      he strode away to organize the setting up of the stage .   hwel sighed  and picked up his quill .  somewhere behind the sacking walls was the town of hangdog  which had somehow allowed itself to be built in a hollow perched in the nearly sheer walls of a canyon .  there was plenty of flat ground in the ramtops .  the problem was that nearly all of it was vertical .   hwel didn   t like the ramtops  which was odd because it was traditional dwarf country and he was a dwarf .  but he   d been banished from his tribe years ago  not only because of his claustrophobia but also because he had a tendency to daydream .  it was felt by the local dwarf king that this is not a valuable talent for someone who is supposed to swing a pickaxe without forgetting what he is supposed to hit with it  and so hwel had been given a very small bag of gold  the tribe   s heartfelt best wishes  and a firm goodbye .   it had happened that vitoller   s strolling players had been passing through at the time  and the dwarf had ventured one small copper coin on a performance of the dragon of the plains .  he had watched it without a muscle moving in his face  gone back to his lodgings  and in the morning had knocked on vitoller   s latty with the first draft of king under the mountain .  it wasn   t in fact very good  but vitoller had been perceptive enough to see that inside the hairy bullet head was an imagination big enough to bestride the world and so  when the strolling players strolled off  one of them was running to keep up .   particles of raw inspiration sleet through the universe all the time .  every once in a while one of them hits a receptive mind  which then invents dna or the flute sonata form or a way of making light bulbs wear out in half the time .  but most of them miss .  most people go through their lives without being hit by even one .   some people are even more unfortunate .  they get them all .   such a one was hwel .  enough inspirations to equip a complete history of the performing arts poured continuously into a small heavy skull designed by evolution to do nothing more spectacular than be remarkably resistant to axe blows .   he licked his quill and looked bashfully around the camp .  no one was watching .  he carefully lifted up the wizard and revealed another stack of paper .   it was another potboiler .  every page was stained with sweat and the words themselves scrawled across the manuscript in a trellis of blots and crossings out and tiny scribbled insertions .  hwel stared at it for a moment  alone in a world that consisted of him  the next blank page and the shouting  clamoring voices that haunted his dreams .   he began to write .   free of hwel   s never too stringent attention  tomjon pushed open the lid of the props hamper and  in the methodical way of the very young  began to unpack the crowns .   the dwarf stuck out his tongue as he piloted the errant quill across the ink speckled page .  he   d found room for the star crossed lovers  the comic grave diggers and the hunchback king .  it was the cats and the roller skates that were currently giving him trouble     a gurgle made him look up .      for goodness sake  lad     he said .     it hardly fits .  put it back .        the disc rolled into winter .   winter in the ramtops could not honestly be described as a magical frosty wonderland  each twig laced with confections of brittle ice .  winter in the ramtops didn   t mess about  it was a gateway straight through to the primeval coldness that lived before the creation of the world .  winter in the ramtops was several yards of snow  the forests a mere collection of shadowy green tunnels under the drifts .  winter meant the coming of the lazy wind  which couldn   t be bothered to blow around people and blew right through them instead .  the idea that winter could actually be enjoyable would never have occurred to ramtop people  who had eighteen different words for snow .    the ghost of king verence prowled the battlements  bereft and hungry  and stared out across his beloved forests and waited his chance .   it was a winter of portents .  comets sparkled against the chilled skies at night .  clouds shaped mightily like whales and dragons drifted over the land by day .  in the village of razorback a cat gave birth to a two headed kitten  but since greebo  by dint of considerable effort  was every male ancestor for the last thirty generations this probably wasn   t all that portentous .   however  in bad ass a cockerel laid an egg and had to put up with some very embarrassing personal questions .  in lancre town a man swore he   d met a man who had actually seen with his own eyes a tree get up and walk .  there was a short sharp shower of shrimps .  there were odd lights in the sky .  geese walked backward .  above all of this flared the great curtains of cold fire that were the aurora coriolis  the hublights  whose frosty tints illuminated and colored the midnight snows .   there was nothing the least unusual about any of this .  the ramtops  which as it were lay across the disc   s vast magical standing wave like an iron bar dropped innocently across a pair of subway rails  were so saturated with magic that it was constantly discharging itself into the environment .  people would wake up in the middle of the night  mutter     oh  it   s just another bloody portent     and go back to sleep .   hogswatchnight came around  marking the start of another year .  and  with alarming suddenness  nothing happened .   the skies were clear  the snow deep and crisped like icing sugar .   the freezing forests were silent and smelled of tin .  the only things that fell from the sky were the occasional fresh showers of snow .   a man walked across the moors from razorback to lancre town without seeing a single marshlight  headless dog  strolling tree  ghostly coach or comet  and had to be taken in by a tavern and given a drink to unsteady his nerves .   the stoicism of the ramtoppers  developed over the years as a sovereign resistance to the thaumaturgical chaos  found itself unable to cope with the sudden change .  it was like a noise which isn   t heard until it stops .   granny weatherwax heard it now as she lay snug under a pile of quilts in her freezing bedroom .  hogswatchnight is  traditionally  the one night of the disc   s long year when witches are expected to stay at home  and she   d had an early night in the company of a bag of apples and a stone hot water bottle .  but something had awoken her from her doze .   an ordinary person would have crept downstairs  possibly armed with a poker .  granny simply hugged her knees and let her mind wander .   it hadn   t been in the house .  she could feel the small  fast minds of mice  and the fuzzy minds of her goats as they lay in their cozy flatulence in the outhouse .  a hunting owl was a sudden dagger of alertness as it glided over the rooftops .   granny concentrated harder  until her mind was full of the tiny chittering of the insects in the thatch and the woodworm in the beams .  nothing of interest there .   she snuggled down and let herself drift out into the forest  which was silent except for the occasional muffled thump as snow slid off a tree .  even in midwinter the forest was full of life  usually dozing in burrows or hibernating in the middle of trees .   all as usual .  she spread herself further  to the high moors and secret passes where the wolves ran silently over the frozen crust  she touched their minds  sharp as knives .  higher still  and there was nothing in the snowfields but packs of vermine .    everything was as it should be  with the exception that nothing was right .  there was something   yes  there was something alive out there  something young and ancient and     granny turned over the feeling in her mind .  yes .  that was it .  something forlorn .  something lost .  and     feelings were never simple  granny knew .  strip them away and there were others underneath     something that  if it didn   t stop feeling lost and forlorn very soon  was going to get angry .   and still she couldn   t find it .  she could feel the tiny minds of chrysalises down under the frozen leaf mold .  she could sense the earthworms  which had migrated below the frost line .  she could even sense a few people  who were hardest of all   human minds were thinking so many thoughts all at the same time that they were nearly impossible to locate  it was like trying to nail fog to the wall .   nothing there .  nothing there .  the feeling was all around her  and there was nothing to cause it .  she   d gone down about as far as she could  to the smallest creature in the kingdom  and there was nothing there .   granny weatherwax sat up in bed  lit a candle and reached for an apple .  she glared at her bedroom wall .   she didn   t like being beaten .  there was something out there  something drinking in magic  something growing  something that seemed so alive it was all around the house  and she couldn   t find it .   she reduced the apple to its core and placed it carefully in the tray of the candlestick .  then she blew out the candle .   the cold velvet of the night slid back into the room .   granny had one last try .  perhaps she was looking in the wrong way     a moment later she was lying on the floor with the pillow clasped around her head .   and to think she had expected it to be small       lancre castle shook .  it wasn   t a violent shaking  but it didn   t need to be  the construction of the castle being such that it swayed slightly even in a gentle breeze .  a small turret toppled slowly into the depths of the misty canyon .   the fool lay on his flagstones and shivered in his sleep .  he appreciated the honor  if it was an honor  but sleeping in the corridor always made him dream of the fools    guild  behind whose severe gray walls he had trembled his way through seven years of terrible tuition .  the flagstones were slightly softer than the beds there  though .   a few feet away a suit of armor jingled gently .  its pike vibrated in its mailed glove until  swishing through the night air like a swooping bat  it slid down and shattered the flagstone by the fool   s ear .   the fool sat up and realized he was still shivering .  so was the floor .   in lord felmet   s room the shaking sent cascades of dust down from the ancient four poster .  he awoke from a dream that a great beast was tramping around the castle  and decided with horror that it might be true .   a portrait of some long dead king fell off the wall .  the duke screamed .   the fool stumbled in  trying to keep his balance on a floor that was now heaving like the sea  and the duke staggered out of bed and grabbed the little man by his jerkin .      what   s happening .     he hissed .     is it an earthquake .         we don   t have them in these parts  my lord     said the fool  and was knocked aside as a chaise longue drifted slowly across the carpet .   the duke dashed to the window  and looked out at the forests in the moonlight .  the white capped trees shook in the still night air .   a slab of plaster crashed onto the floor .  lord felmet spun around and this time his grip lifted the fool a foot off the floor .   among the very many luxuries the duke had dispensed with in his life was that of ignorance .  he liked to feel he knew what was going on .  the glorious uncertainties of existence held no attraction for him .      it   s the witches  isn   t it .     he growled  his left cheek beginning to twitch like a landed fish .     they   re out there  aren   t they .  they   re putting an influence on the castle  aren   t they .         marry  nuncle       the fool began .      they run this country  don   t they .         no  my lord  they   ve never           who asked you .      the fool was trembling with fear in perfect antiphase to the castle  so that he was the only thing that now appeared to be standing perfectly still .      er  you did  my lord     he quavered .      are you arguing with me .         no  my lord .         i thought so .  you   re in league with them  i suppose .         my lord .     said the fool  really shocked .      you   re all in league  you people .     the duke snarled .     the whole bunch of you .  you   re nothing but a pack of ringleaders .      he flung the fool aside and thrust the tall windows open  striding out into the freezing night air .  he glared out over the sleeping kingdom .      do you all hear me .     he screamed .     i am the king .      the shaking stopped  catching the duke off balance .  he steadied himself quickly  and brushed the plaster dust off his nightshirt .      right  then     he said .   but this was worse .  now the forest was listening .  the words he spoke vanished into a great vacuum of silence .   there was something out there .  he could feel it .  it was strong enough to shake the castle  and now it was watching him  listening to him .   the duke backed away  very carefully  fumbling behind him for the window catch .  he stepped carefully into the room  shut the windows and hurriedly pulled the curtains across .      i am the king     he repeated  quietly .  he looked at the fool  who felt that something was expected of him .   the man is my lord and master  he thought .  i have eaten his salt  or whatever all that business was .  they told me at guild school that a fool should be faithful to his master until the very end  after all others have deserted him .  good or bad doesn   t come into it .  every leader needs his fool .  there is only loyalty .  that   s the whole thing .  even if he is clearly three parts bonkers  i   m his fool until one of us dies .   to his horror he realized the duke was weeping .   the fool fumbled in his sleeve and produced a rather soiled red and yellow handkerchief embroidered with bells .  the duke took it with an expression of pathetic gratitude and blew his nose .  then he held it away from him and gazed at it with demented suspicion .      is this a dagger i see before me .     he mumbled .      um .  no  my lord .  it   s my handkerchief  you see .  you can sort of tell the difference if you look closely .  it doesn   t have as many sharp edges .         good fool     said the duke  vaguely .   totally mad  the fool thought .  several bricks short of a bundle .  so far around the twist you could use him to open wine bottles .      kneel beside me  my fool .      the fool did so .  the duke laid a soiled bandage on his shoulder .      are you loyal  fool .     he said .     are you trustworthy .         i swore to follow my lord until death     said the fool hoarsely .   the duke pressed his mad face close to the fool  who looked up into a pair of bloodshot eyes .      i didn   t want to     he hissed conspiratorially .     they made me do it .  i didn   t want        the door swung open .  the duchess filled the doorway .  in fact  she was nearly the same shape .      leonal .     she barked .   the fool was fascinated by what happened to the duke   s eyes .  the mad red flame vanished  was sucked backward  and was replaced by the hard blue stare he had come to recognize .  it didn   t mean  he realized  that the duke was any less mad .  even the coldness of his sanity was madness in a way .  the duke had a mind that ticked like a clock and  like a clock  it regularly went cuckoo .   lord felmet looked up calmly .      yes  my dear .         what is the meaning of all this .     she demanded .      witches  i suspect     said lord felmet .      i really don   t think       the fool began .  lady felmet   s glare didn   t merely silence him  it almost nailed him to the wall .      that is clearly apparent     she said .     you are an idiot .         a fool  my lady .         as well     she added  and turned back to her husband .      so     she said  smiling grimly .     still they defy you .      the duke shrugged .     how should i fight magic .     he said .      with words     said the fool  without thinking  and was instantly sorry .  they were both staring at him .      what .     said the duchess .   the fool dropped his mandolin in his embarrassment .      in   in the guild     said the fool     we learned that words can be more powerful even than magic .         clown .     said the duke .     words are just words .  brief syllables .  sticks and stones may break my bones       he paused  savoring the thought      but words can never hurt me .         my lord  there are such words that can     said the fool .     lair .  usurper .  murderer .      the duke jerked back and gripped the arms of the throne  wincing .      such words have no truth     said the fool  hurriedly .     but they can spread like fire underground  breaking out to burn           it   s true .  it   s true .     screamed the duke .     i hear them  all the time .     he leaned forward .     it   s the witches .     he hissed .      then  then  then they can be fought with other words     said the fool .     words can fight even witches .         what words .     said the duchess  thoughtfully .   the fool shrugged .     crone .  evil eye .  stupid old woman .      the duchess raised one thick eyebrow .      you are not entirely an idiot  are you     she said .     you refer to rumor .         just so  my lady .     the fool rolled his eyes .  what had he got himself into .      it   s the witches     whispered the duke  to no one in particular .     we must tell the world about the witches .  they   re evil .  they make it come back  the blood .  even sandpaper doesn   t work .        there was another tremor as granny weatherwax hurried along the narrow  frozen pathways in the forest .  a lump of snow slipped off a tree branch and poured over her hat .   this wasn   t right  she knew .  never mind about the   whatever it was   but it was unheard of for a witch to go out on hogswatchnight .  it was against all tradition .  no one knew why  but that wasn   t the point .   she came out onto the moorland and pounded across the brittle heather  which had been scoured of snow by the wind .  there was a crescent moon near the horizon  and its pale glow lit up the mountains that towered over her .  it was a different world up there  and one even a witch would rarely venture into  it was a landscape left over from the frosty birth of the world  all green ice and knife edge ridges and deep  secret valleys .  it was a landscape never intended for human beings   not hostile  anymore than a brick or cloud is hostile  but terribly  terribly uncaring .   except that  this time  it was watching her .  a mind quite unlike any other she had ever encountered was giving her a great deal of its attention .  she glared up at the icy slopes  half expecting to see a mountainous shadow move against the stars .      who are you .     she shouted .     what do you want .      her voice bounced and echoed among the rocks .  there was a distant boom of an avalanche  high among the peaks .   on the crest of the moor  where in the summer partridges lurked among the bushes like small whirring idiots  was a standing stone .  it stood roughly where the witches    territories met  although the boundaries were never formally marked out .   the stone was about the same height as a tall man  and made of bluish tinted rock .  it was considered intensely magical because  although there was only one of it  no one had ever been able to count it  if it saw anyone looking at it speculatively  it shuffled behind them .  it was the most self effacing monolith ever discovered .   it was also one of the numerous discharge points for the magic that accumulated in the ramtops .  the ground around it for several yards was bare of snow  and steamed gently .   the stone began to edge away  and watched her suspiciously from behind a tree .   she waited for ten minutes until magrat came hurrying up the path from mad stoat  a village whose good natured inhabitants were getting used to ear massage and flower based homeopathic remedies for everything short of actual decapitation .   she was out of breath  and wore only a shawl over a nightdress that  if magrat had anything to reveal  would have been very revealing .      you felt it too .     she said .   granny nodded .     where   s gytha .     she said .   they looked down the path that led to lancre town  a huddle of lights in the snowy gloom .     there was a party going on .  light poured out into the street .  a line of people were winding in and out of nanny ogg   s house  from inside which came occasional shrieks of laughter and the sounds of breaking glass and children grizzling .  it was clear that family life was being experienced to its limits in that house .   the two witches stood uncertainly in the street .      do you think we should go in .     said magrat diffidently .     it   s not as though we were invited .  and we haven   t brought a bottle .         sounds to me as if there   s a deal too many bottles in there already     said granny weatherwax disapprovingly .  a man staggered out of the doorway  burped  bumped into granny  said     happy hogswatchnight  missus     glanced up at her face and sobered up instantly .      miss     snapped granny .      i am most frightfully sorry       he began .   granny swept imperiously past him .     come  magrat     she commanded .   the din inside hovered around the pain threshold .  nanny ogg got around the hogswatchnight tradition by inviting the whole village in  and the air in the room was already beyond the reach of pollution controls .  granny navigated through the press of bodies by the sound of a cracked voice explaining to the world at large that  compared to an unbelievable variety of other animals  the hedgehog was quite fortunate .   nanny ogg was sitting in a chair by the fire with a quart mug in one hand  and was conducting the reprise with a cigar .  she grinned when she saw granny   s face .      what ho  my old boiler     she screeched above the din .     see you turned up  then .  have a drink .  have two .  wotcher  magrat .  pull up a chair and call the cat a bastard .      greebo  who was curled up in the inglenook and watching the festivities with one slit yellow eye  flicked his tail once or twice .   granny sat down stiffly  a ramrod figure of decency .      we   re not staying     she said  glaring at magrat  who was tentatively reaching out toward a bowl of peanuts .     i can see you   re busy .  we just wondered whether you might have noticed   anything .  tonight .  a little while ago .      nanny ogg wrinkled her forehead .      our darron   s eldest was sick     she said .     been at his dad   s beer .         unless he was extremely ill     said granny     i doubt if it was what i was referring to .     she made a complex occult sign in the air  which nanny totally ignored .      someone tried to dance on the table     she said .     fell into our reet   s pumpkin dip .  we had a good laugh .      granny waggled her eyebrows and placed a meaningful finger alongside her nose .      i was alluding to things of a different nature     she hinted darkly .   nanny ogg peered at her .      something wrong with your eye  esme .     she hazarded .   granny weatherwax sighed .      extremely worrying developments of a magical tendency are even now afoot     she said loudly .   the room went quiet .  everyone stared at the witches  except for darron   s eldest  who took advantage of the opportunity to continue his alcoholic experiments .  then  swiftly as they had fled  several dozen conversations hurriedly got back into gear .      it might be a good idea if we can go and talk somewhere more private     said granny  as the comforting hubbub streamed over them again .   they ended up in the washhouse  where granny tried to give an account of the mind she had encountered .      it   s out there somewhere  in the mountains and the high forests     she said .     and it is very big .         i thought it was looking for someone     said magrat .     it put me in mind of a large dog .  you know  lost .  puzzled .      granny thought about this .  now she came to think of it        yes     she said .     something like that .  a big dog .         worried     said magrat .      searching     said granny .      and getting angry     said magrat .      yes     said granny  staring fixedly at nanny .      could be a troll     said nanny ogg .     i left best part of a pint in there  you know     she added reproachfully .      i know what a troll   s mind feels like  gytha     said granny .  she didn   t snap the words out .  in fact it was the quiet way she said them that made nanny hesitate .      they say there   s really big trolls up toward the hub     said nanny slowly .     and ice giants  and big hairy wossnames that live above the snowline .  but you don   t mean anything like that  do you .         no .         oh .      magrat shivered .  she told herself that a witch had absolute control over her own body  and the goosepimples under her thin nightdress were just a figment of her own imagination .  the trouble was  she had an excellent imagination .   nanny ogg sighed .      we   d better have a look  then     she said  and took the lid off the copper .   nanny ogg never used her washhouse  since all her washing was done by the daughters in law  a tribe of gray faced  subdued women whose names she never bothered to remember .  it had become  therefore  a storage place for dried up old bulbs  burnt out cauldrons and fermenting jars of wasp jam .  no fire had been lit under the copper for ten years .  its bricks were crumbling  and rare ferns grew around the firebox .  the water under the lid was inky black and  according to rumor  bottomless  the ogg grandchildren were encouraged to believe that monsters from the dawn of time dwelt in its depths  since nanny believed that a bit of thrilling and pointless terror was an essential ingredient of the magic of childhood .   in summer she used it as a beer cooler .      it   ll have to do .  i think perhaps we should join hands     she said .     and you  magrat  make sure the door   s shut .         what are you going to try .     said granny .  since they were on nanny   s territory  the choice was entirely up to her .      i always say you can   t go wrong with a good invocation     said nanny .     haven   t done one for years .      granny weatherwax frowned .  magrat said     oh  but you can   t .  not here .  you need a cauldron  and a magic sword .  and an octogram .  and spices  and all sorts of stuff .      granny and nanny exchanged glances .      it   s not her fault     said granny .     it   s all them grimmers she was bought .     she turned to magrat .      you don   t need none of that     she said .     you need headology .     she looked around the ancient washroom .      you just use whatever you   ve got     she said .   she picked up the bleached copper stick  and weighed it thoughtfully in her hand .        we conjure and abjure thee by means of this       granny hardly paused      sharp and terrible copper stick .      the waters in the boiler rippled gently .      see how we scatter       magrat sighed      rather old washing soda and some extremely hard soap flakes in thy honor .  really  nanny  i don   t think           silence .  now you  gytha .         and i invoke and bind thee with the balding scrubbing brush of art and the washboard of protection     said nanny  waving it .  the wringer attachment fell off .      honesty is all very well     whispered magrat  wretchedly     but somehow it isn   t the same .         you listen to me  my girl     said granny .     demons don   t care about the outward shape of things .  it   s what you think that matters .  get on with it .      magrat tried to imagine that the bleached and ancient bar of lye soap was the rarest of scented whatever  ungulants or whatever they were  from distant klatch .  it was an effort .  the gods alone knew what kind of demon would respond to a summoning like this .   granny was also a little uneasy .  she didn   t much care for demons in any case  and all this business with incantations and implements whiffed of wizardry .  it was pandering to the things  making them feel important .  demons ought to come when they were called .   but protocol dictated that the host witch had the choice  and nanny quite liked demons  who were male  or apparently so .   at this point granny was alternately cajoling and threatening the nether world with two feet of bleached wood .  she was impressed at her own daring .   the waters seethed a little  became very still and then  with a sudden movement and a little popping noise  mounded up into a head .  magrat dropped her soap .   it was a good looking head  maybe a little cruel around the eyes and beaky about the nose  but nevertheless handsome in a hard kind of way .  there was nothing surprising about this  since the demon was only extending an image of itself into this reality  it might as well make a good job of it .  it turned slowly  a gleaming black statue in the fitful moonlight .      well .     it said .      who   re you .     said granny  bluntly .   the head revolved to face her .      my name is unpronounceable in your tongue  woman     it said .      i   ll be the judge of that     warned granny  and added     don   t you call me woman .         very well .  my name is wxrthltl jwlpklz     said the demon smugly .      where were you when the vowels were handed out .  behind the door .     said nanny ogg .      well  mr .        granny hesitated only fractionally      wxrthltl jwlpklz  i except you   re wondering why we called you here tonight .         you   re not supposed to say that     said the demon .     you   re supposed to say           shut up .  we have the sword of art and the octogram of protection  i warn you .         please yourself .  they look like a washboard and a copper stick to me     sneered the demon .   granny glanced sideways .  the corner of the washroom was stacked with kindling wood  with a big heavy sawhorse in front of it .  she stared fixedly at the demon and  without looking  brought the stick down hard across the thick timber .   the dead silence that followed was broken only by the two perfectly sliced halves of the sawhorse teetering backward and forward and folding slowly into the heap of kindling .   the demon   s face remained impassive .      you are allowed three questions     it said .      is there something strange at large in the kingdom .     said granny .   it appeared to think about it .      and no lying     said magrat earnestly .     otherwise it   ll be the scrubbing brush for you .         you mean stranger than usual .         get on with it     said nanny .     my feet are freezing out here .         no .  there is nothing strange .         but we felt it       magrat began .      hold on  hold on     said granny .  her lips moved soundlessly .  demons were like genies or philosophy professors   if you didn   t word things exactly right  they delighted in giving you absolutely accurate and completely misleading answers .      is there something in the kingdom that wasn   t there before .     she hazarded .      no .      tradition said that there could be only three questions .  granny tried to formulate one that couldn   t be deliberately misunderstood .  then she decided that this was playing the wrong kind of game .      what the hell   s going on .     she said carefully .     and no mucking about trying to wriggle out of it  otherwise i   ll boil you .      the demon appeared to hesitate .  this was obviously a new approach .      magrat  just kick that kindling over here  will you .     said granny .      i protest at this treatment     said the demon  its voice tinged with uncertainty .      yes  well  we haven   t got time to bandy legs with you all night     said granny .     these word games might be all right for wizards  but we   ve got other fish to fry .         or boil     said nanny .      look     said the demon  and now there was a whine of terror in its voice .     we   re not supposed to volunteer information just like that .  there are rules  you know .         there   s some old oil in the can on the shelf  magrat     said nanny .      if i simply tell you       the demon began .      yes .     said granny  encouragingly .      you won   t let on  will you .     it implored .      not a word     promised granny .      lips are sealed     said magrat .      there is nothing new in the kingdom     said the demon     but the land has woken up .         what do you mean .     said granny .      it   s unhappy .  it wants a king that cares for it .         how       magrat began  but granny waved her into silence .      you don   t mean people  do you .     she said .  the glistening head shook .     no  i didn   t think so .         what       nanny began .  granny put a finger to her lips .   she turned and walked to the washhouse   s window  a dusty spiderweb graveyard of faded butterfly wings and last summer   s bluebottles .  a faint glow beyond the frosted panes suggested that  against all reason  a new day would soon dawn .      can you tell us why .     she said  without turning around .  she   d felt the mind of a whole country     she was rather impressed .      i   m just a demon .  what do i know .  only what is  not the why and how of it .         i see .         may i go now .         um .         please .      granny jerked upright again .      oh .  yes .  run along     she said distractedly .     thank you .      the head didn   t move .  it hung around  like a hotel porter who has just carried fifteen suitcases up ten flights of stairs  shown everyone where the bathroom is  plumped up the pillows  and feels he has adjusted all the curtains he is going to adjust .      you wouldn   t mind banishing me  would you .     said the demon  when no one seemed to be taking the hint .      what .     said granny  who was thinking again .      only i   d feel better for being properly banished .     run along    lacks that certain something     said the head .      oh .  well  if it gives you any pleasure .  magrat .         yes .     said magrat  startled .   granny tossed the copper stick to her .      do the honors  will you .     she said .   magrat caught the stick by what she hoped granny was imagining as the handle  and smiled .      certainly .  right .  ok .  um .  begone  foul fiend  unto the blackest pit        the head smiled contentedly as the words rolled over it .  this was more like it .   it melted back into the waters of the copper like candlewax under a flame .  its last contemptuous comment  almost lost in the swirl  was     run aaaalonggg          granny went home alone as the cold pink light of dawn glided across the snow  and let herself into her cottage .   the goats were uneasy in their outhouse .  the starlings muttered and rattled their false teeth under the roof .  the mice were squeaking behind the kitchen dresser .   she made a pot of tea  conscious that every sound in the kitchen seemed slightly louder than it ought to be .  when she dropped the spoon into the sink it sounded like a bell being hit with a hammer .   she always felt uncomfortable after getting involved in organized magic or  as she would put it  out of sorts with herself .  she found herself wandering around the place looking for things to do and then forgetting them when they were half complete .  she paced back and forth across the cold flagstones .   it is at times like this that the mind finds the oddest jobs to do in order to avoid its primary purpose  i . e .  thinking about things .  if anyone had been watching they would have been amazed at the sheer dedication with which granny tackled such tasks as cleaning the teapot stand  rooting ancient nuts out of the fruit bowl on the dresser  and levering fossilized bread crusts out of the cracks in the flagstones with the back of a teaspoon .   animals had minds .  people had minds  although human minds were vague foggy things .  even insects had minds  little pointy bits of light in the darkness of non mind .   granny considered herself something of an expert on minds .  she was pretty certain things like countries didn   t have minds .   they weren   t even alive  for goodness sake .  a country was  well  was     hold on .  hold on   a thought stole gently into granny   s mind and sheepishly tried to attract her attention .   there was a way in which those brooding forests could have a mind .  granny sat up  a piece of antique loaf in her hand  and gazed speculatively at the fireplace .  her mind   s eye looked through it  out at the snow filled aisles of trees .  yes .  it had never occurred to her before .  of course  it   d be a mind made up of all the other little minds inside it  plant minds  bird minds  bear minds  even the great slow minds of the trees themselves     she sat down in her rocking chair  which started to rock all by itself .   she   d often thought of the forest as a sprawling creature  but only metterforically  as a wizard would put it  drowsy and purring with bumblebees in the summer  roaring and raging in autumn gales  curled in on itself and sleeping in the winter .  it occurred to her that in addition to being a collection of other things  the forest was a thing in itself .  alive  only not alive in the way that  say  a shrew was alive .   and much slower .   that would have to be important .  how fast did a forest   s heart beat .  once a year  maybe .  yes  that sounded about right .  out there the forest was waiting for the brighter sun and longer days that would pump a million gallons of sap several hundred feet into the sky in one great systolic thump too big and loud to be heard .   and it was at about this point that granny bit her lip .   she   d just thought the word    systolic     and it certainly wasn   t in her vocabulary .   somebody was inside her head with her .   some thing .   had she just thought all those thoughts  or had they been thought through her .   she glared at the floor  trying to keep her ideas to herself .  but her mind was being watched as easily as if her head was made of glass .   granny weatherwax got to her feet and opened the curtains .   and they were out there on what   in warmer months   was the lawn .  and every single one of them was staring at her .   after a few minutes granny   s front door opened .  this was an event in its own right  like most ramtoppers granny lived her life via the back door .  there were only three times in your life when it was proper to come through the front door  and you were carried every time .   it opened with considerable difficulty  in a series of painful jerks and thumps .  a few flakes of paint fell onto the snowdrift in front of the door  which sagged inward .  finally  when it was about halfway open  the door wedged .   granny sidled awkwardly through the gap and out onto the hitherto undisturbed snow .   she had put her pointed hat on  and the long black cloak which she wore when she wanted anyone who saw her to be absolutely clear that she was a witch .   there was an elderly kitchen chair half buried in snow .  in summer it was a handy place to sit and do whatever hand chores were necessary  while keeping one eye on the track .  granny hauled it out  brushed the snow off the seat  and sat down firmly with her knees apart and her arms folded defiantly .  she stuck out her chin .   the sun was well up but the light on this hogswatchday was still pink and slanting .  it glowed on the great cloud of steam that hung over the assembled creatures .  they hadn   t moved  although every now and again one of them would stamp a hoof or scratch itself .   granny looked up at a flicker of movement .  she hadn   t noticed before  but every tree around her garden was so heavy with birds that it looked as though a strange brown and black spring had come early .   occupying the patch where the herbs grew in summer were the wolves  sitting or lolling with their tongues hanging out .  a contingent of bears was crouched behind them  with a platoon of deer beside them .  occupying the metterforical stalls was a rabble of rabbits  weasels  vermine  badgers  foxes and miscellaneous creatures who  despite the fact that they live their entire lives in a bloody atmosphere of hunter and hunted  killing or being killed by claw  talon and tooth  are generally referred to as woodland folk .   they rested together on the snow  their normal culinary relationships entirely forgotten  trying to outstare her .   two things were immediately apparent to granny .  one was that this seemed to represent a pretty accurate cross section of the forest life .   the other she couldn   t help saying aloud .      i don   t know what this spell is     she said .     but i   ll tell you this for nothing   when it wears off  some of you little buggers had better get moving .      none of them stirred .  there was no sound except for an elderly badger relieving itself with an embarrassed expression .      look     said granny .     what can i do about it .  it   s no good you coming to me .  he   s the new lord .  this is his kingdom .  i can   t go meddling .  it   s not right to go meddling  on account of i can   t interfere with people ruling .  it has to sort itself out  good or bad .  fundamental rule of magic  is that .  you can   t go around ruling people with spells  because you   d have to use more and more spells all the time .     she sat back  grateful that long standing tradition didn   t allow the crafty and the wise to rule .  she remembered what it had felt like to wear the crown  even for a few seconds .   no  things like crowns had a troublesome effect on clever folk  it was best to leave all the reigning to the kind of people whose eyebrows met in the middle when they tried to think .  in a funny sort of way  they were much better at it .   she added     people have to sort it out for themselves .  well known fact .      she felt that one of the larger stags was giving her a particularly doubting look .      yes  well  so he killed the old king     she conceded .     that   s nature   s way  ain   t it .  your lot know all about this .  survival of the wossname .  you wouldn   t know what an heir was  unless you thought it was a sort of rabbit .      she drummed her fingers on her knees .      anyway  the old king wasn   t much of a friend to you  was he .  all that hunting  and such .      three hundred pairs of dark eyes bored in at her .      it   s no good you all looking at me     she tried .     i can   t go around mucking about with kings just because you don   t like them .  where would it all end .  it   s not as if he   s done me any harm .      she tried to avoid the gaze of a particularly cross eyed stoat .      all right  so it   s selfish     she said .     that   s what bein    a witch is all about .  good day to you .      she stamped inside  and tried to slam the door .  it stuck once or twice  which rather spoiled the effect .   once inside she drew the curtains and sat down in the rocking chair and rocked fiercely .      that   s the whole point     she said .     i can   t go around meddling .  that   s the whole point .        the lattys lurched slowly over the rutted roads  toward yet another little city whose name the company couldn   t quite remember and would instantly forget .  the winter sun hung low over the damp  misty cabbage fields of the sto plains  and the foggy silence magnified the creaking of the wheels .   hwel sat with his stubby legs dangling over the backboard of the last latty .   he   d done his best .  vitoller had left the education of tomjon in his hands     you   re better at all that business     he   d said  adding with his usual tact     besides  you   re more his height .      but it wasn   t working .      apple     he repeated  waving the fruit in the air .   tomjon grinned at him .  he was nearly three years old  and hadn   t said a word anyone could understand .  hwel was harboring dark suspicions about the witches .      but he seems bright enough     said mrs .  vitoller  who was traveling inside the latty and darning the chain mail .     he knows what things are .  he does what he   s told .  i just wish you   d speak     she said softly  patting the boy on the cheek .   hwel gave the apple to tomjon  who accepted it gravely .      i reckon them witches did you a bad turn  missus     said the dwarf .     you know .  changelings and whatnot .  there used to be a lot of that sort of thing .  my great great grandmother said it was done to us  once .  the fairies swapped a human and a dwarf .  we never realized until he started banging his head on things  they say               they say this fruit be like unto the world  so sweet .  or like  say i  the heart of man  so red without and yet within  unclue   d   we find the worm  the rot  the flaw .   however glows his bloom the bite  proves many a man be rotten at the core .        the two of them swiveled around to stare at tomjon  who nodded to them and proceeded to eat the apple .      that was the worm speech from the tyrant     whispered hwel .  his normal grasp of the language temporarily deserted him .     bloody hell     he said .      but he sounded just like           i   m going to get vitoller     said hwel  and dropped off the tailboard and ran through the frozen puddles to the front of the convoy  where the actor manager was whistling tunelessly and  yes  strolling .      what ho  b   zugda hiara      he said cheerfully .      you   ve got to come at once .  he   s talking .         talking .      hwel jumped up and down .     he   s quoting .     he shouted .     you   ve got to come .  he sounds just like           me .     said vitoller  a few minutes later  after they had pulled the lattys into a grove of leafless trees by the roadside .     do i sound like that .         yes     chorused the company .   young willikins  who specialized in female roles  prodded tomjon gently as he stood on an upturned barrel in the middle of the clearing .      here  boy  do you know my speech from please yourself .     he said .   tomjon nodded .        he is not dead  i say  who lies beneath the stone .  for if death could but hear           they listened in awed silence as the endless mists rolled across the dripping fields and the red ball of the sun floated down the sky .  when the boy had finished hot tears were streaming down hwel   s face .      by all the gods     he said  when tomjon had finished     i must have been on damn good form when i wrote that .     he blew his nose noisily .      do i sound like that .     said willikins  his face pale .   vitoller patted him gently on the shoulder .      if you sounded like that  my bonny     he said     you wouldn   t be standing arse deep in slush in the middle of these forsaken fields  with nothing but liberated cabbage for thy tea .      he clapped his hands .      no more  no more     he said  his breath making puffs of steam in the freezing air .     backs to it  everybody .  we must be outside the walls of sto lat by sunset .      as the grumbling actors awoke from the spell and wandered back to the shafts of the lattys vitoller beckoned to the dwarf and put his arm around his shoulders  or rather around the top of his head .      well .     he said .     you people know all about magic  or so it is said .  what do you make of it .         he spends all his time around the stage  master .  it   s only natural that he should pick things up     said hwel vaguely .   vitoller leaned down .      do you believe that .         i believe i heard a voice that took my doggerel and shaped it and fired it back through my ears and straight into my heart     said hwel simply .     i believe i heard a voice that got behind the crude shape of the words and said the things i had meant them to say  but had not the skill to achieve .  who knows where such things come from .      he stared impassively into vitoller   s red face .     he may have inherited it from his father     he said .      but           and who knows what witches may achieve .     said the dwarf .   vitoller felt his wife   s hand pushed into his .  as he stood up  bewildered and angry  she kissed him on the back of the neck .      don   t torture yourself     she said .     isn   t it all for the best .  your son has declaimed his first word .        spring came  and ex king verence still wasn   t taking being dead lying down .  he prowled the castle relentlessly  seeking for a way in which its ancient stones would release their grip on him .   he was also trying to keep out of the way of the other ghosts .   champot was all right  if a bit tiresome .  but verence had backed away at the first sight of the twins  toddling hand in hand along the midnight corridors  their tiny ghosts a memorial to a deed darker even than the usual run of regicidal unpleasantness .   and then there was the troglodyte wanderer  a rather faded monkeyman in a furry loincloth who apparently happened to haunt the castle merely because it had been built on his burial mound .  for no obvious reason a chariot with a screaming woman in it occasionally rumbled through the laundry room .  as for the kitchen     one day he   d given in  despite everything old champot had said  and had followed the smells of cooking into the big  hot  high domed cavern that served the castle as kitchen and abattoir .  funny thing  that .  he   d never been down there since his childhood .  somehow kings and kitchens didn   t go well together .   it was full of ghosts .   but they weren   t human .  they weren   t even protohuman .   they were stags .  they were bullocks .  they were rabbits  and pheasants  and partridges  and sheep  and pigs .  there were even some round blobby things that looked unpleasantly like the ghosts of oysters .  they were packed so tightly that in fact they merged and mingled  turning the kitchen into a silent  jostling nightmare of teeth and fur and horns  half seen and misty .  several noticed him  and there was a weird blarting of noises that sounded far off  tinny and unpleasantly out of register .  through them all the cook and his assistants wandered quite unconcernedly  making vegetarian sausages .   verence had stared for half a minute and then fled  wishing that he still had a real stomach so that he could stick his fingers down his throat for forty years and bring up everything he   d eaten .   he   d sought solace in the stables  where his beloved hunting dogs had whined and scratched at the door and had generally been very ill at ease at his sensed but unseen presence .   now he haunted   and how he hated the word   the long gallery  where paintings of long dead kings looked down at him from the dusty shadows .  he would have felt a lot more kindly toward them if he hadn   t met a number of them gibbering in various parts of the premises .   verence had decided that he had two aims in death .  one was to get out of the castle and find his son  and the other was to get his revenge on the duke .  but not by killing him  he   d decided  even if he could find a way  because an eternity in that giggling idiot   s company would lend a new terror to death .   he sat under a painting of queen bemery            whose rather stern good looks he would have felt a whole lot happier about if he hadn   t seen her earlier that morning walking through the wall .   verence tried to avoid walking through walls .  a man had his dignity .   he became aware that he was being watched .   he turned his head .   there was a cat sitting in the doorway  subjecting him to a slow blink .  it was a mottled gray and extremely fat     no .  it was extremely big .  it was covered with so much scar tissue that it looked like a fist with fur on it .  its ears were a couple of perforated stubs  its eyes two yellow slits of easy going malevolence  its tail a twitching series of question marks as it stared at him .   greebo had heard that lady felmet had a small white female cat and had strolled up to pay his respects .   verence had never seen an animal with so much built in villainy .  he didn   t resist as it waddled across the floor and tried to rub itself against his legs  purring like a waterfall .      well  well     said the king  vaguely .  he reached down and made an effort to scratch it behind the two ragged bits on top of its head .  it was a relief to find someone else besides another ghost who could see him  and greebo  he couldn   t help feeling  was a distinctly unusual cat .  most of the castle cats were either pampered pets or flat eared kitchen and stable habitu  s who generally resembled the very rodents they lived on .  this cat  on the other hand  was its own animal .  all cats give that impression  of course  but instead of the mindless animal self absorption that passes for secret wisdom in the creatures  greebo radiated genuine intelligence .  he also radiated a smell that would have knocked over a wall and caused sinus trouble in a dead fox .   only one type of person kept a cat like this .   the king tried to hunker down  and found he was sinking slightly into the floor .  he pulled himself together and drifted upward .  once a man allowed himself to go native in the ethereal world there would be no hope for him  he felt .   only close relatives and the psychically inclined  death had said .  there weren   t many of either in the castle .  the duke qualified under the first heading  but his relentless self interest made him about as psychically useful as a carrot .  as for the rest  only the cook and the fool seemed to qualify  but the cook spent a lot of his time weeping in the pantry because he wasn   t being allowed to roast anything more bloody than a parsnip and the fool was already such a bundle of nerves that verence had given up his attempts to get through .   a witch  now .  if a witch wasn   t psychically inclined  then he  king verence  was a puff of wind .  he had to get a witch into the castle .  and then     he   d got a plan .  in fact  it was more than that  it was a plan .  he spent months over it .  he hadn   t got anything else to do  except think .  death had been right about that .  all that ghosts had were thoughts  and although thoughts in general had always been alien to the king the absence of any body to distract him with its assorted humors had actually given him the chance to savor the joys of cerebration .  he   d never had a plan before  or at least one that went much further than    let   s find something and kill it .     and here  sitting in front of him washing itself  was the key .      here  pussy     he ventured .  greebo gave him a penetrating yellow stare .      cat     the king amended hastily  and backed away  beckoning .  for a moment it seemed that the cat wouldn   t follow and then  to his relief  greebo stood up  yawned  and padded toward him .  greebo didn   t often see ghosts  and was vaguely interested in this tall  bearded man with the see through body .   the king led him along a dusty side corridor and toward a lumber room crammed with crumbling tapestries and portraits of long dead kings .  greebo examined it critically  and then sat down in the middle of the dusty floor  looking at the king expectantly .      there   s plenty of mice and things in here  d   you see     said verence .     and the rain blows in through the broken window .  plus there   s all these tapestries to sleep on .      sorry     the king added  and turned to the door .   this was what he had been working on all these months .  when he was alive he had always taken a lot of care of his body  and since being dead he had taken care to preserve its shape .  it was too easy to let yourself go and become all fuzzy around the edges  there were ghosts in the castle who were mere pale blobs .  but verence had wielded iron self control and exercised   well  had thought hard about exercise   and fairly bulged with spectral muscles .  months of pumping ectoplasm had left him in better shape than he had ever been  apart from being dead .   then he   d started out small  with dust motes .  the first one had nearly killed him   but he   d persevered and progressed to sand grains  then whole dried peas  he still didn   t dare venture into the kitchens  but he had amused himself by oversalting felmet   s food a pinch at a time until he pulled himself together and told himself that poisoning wasn   t honorable  even against vermin .   now he leaned all his weight on the door  and with every microgramme of his being forced himself to become as heavy as possible .  the sweat of auto suggestion dripped off his nose and vanished before it hit the floor .  greebo watched with interest as ghostly muscles moved on the king   s arms like footballs mating .   the door began to move  creaked  then accelerated and hit the doorway with a thump .  the latch clicked into place .   it bloody well had to work now  verence told himself .  he   d never be able to lift the latch by himself .  but a witch would certainly come looking for her cat   wouldn   t she .     in the hills beyond the castle the fool lay on his stomach and stared into the depths of a little lake .  a couple of trout stared back at him .   somewhere on the disc  reason told him  there must be someone more miserable than he was .  he wondered who it was .   he hadn   t asked to be a fool  but it wouldn   t have mattered if he had  because he couldn   t recall anyone in his family ever listening to anything he said after dad ran away .   certainly not grandad .  his earliest memory was of grandad standing over him making him repeat the jokes by rote  and hammering home every punchline with his belt  it was thick leather  and the fact that it had bells on didn   t improve things much .   grandad was credited with seven official new jokes .  he   d won the honorary cap and bells of the grand prix des idiots blithering at ankh morpork four years in a row  which no one else had ever done  and presumably they made him the funniest man who ever lived .  he had worked hard at it  you had to give him that .   the fool recalled with a shudder how  at the age of six  he   d timidly approached the old man after supper with a joke he   d made up .  it was about a duck .   it had earned him the biggest thrashing of his life  which even then must have presented the old joker with a bit of a challenge .      you will learn  my lad       he recalled  with every sentence punctuated by jingling cracks      that there is nothing more serious than jesting .  from now on you will never       the old man paused to change hands      never  never  ever utter a joke that has not been approved by the guild .  who are you to decide what is amusing .  marry  let the untutored giggle at unskilled banter  it is the laughter of the ignorant .  never .  never .  never let me catch you joculating again .      after that he   d gone back to learning the three hundred and eighty three guild approved jokes  which was bad enough  and the glossary  which was a lot bigger and much worse .   and then he   d been sent to ankh  and there  in the bare  severe rooms  he   d found there were books other than the great heavy brass bound monster fun book .  there was a whole circular world out there  full of weird places and people doing interesting things  like     singing .  he could hear singing .   he raised his head cautiously  and jumped at the tinkle of the bells on his cap .  he gripped the hated things hurriedly .   the singing went on .  the fool peeped cautiously through the drift of meadowsweet that was providing him with perfect concealment .   the singing wasn   t particularly good .  the only word the singer appeared to know was    la     but she was making it work hard .  the general tune gave the impression that the singer believed that people were supposed to sing    lalala    in certain circumstances  and was determined to do what the world expected of her .   the fool risked raising his head a little further  and saw magrat for the first time .   she had stopped dancing rather self consciously through the narrow meadow and was trying to plait some daisies in her hair  without much success .   the fool held his breath .  on long nights on the hard flagstones he had dreamed of women like her .  although  if he really thought about it  not much like her  they were better endowed around the chest  their noses weren   t so red and pointed  and their hair tended to flow more .  but the fool   s libido was bright enough to tell the difference between the impossible and the conceivably attainable  and hurriedly cut in some filter circuits .   magrat was picking flowers and talking to them .  the fool strained to hear .      here   s woolly fellwort     she said .     and treacle wormseed  which is for inflammation of the ears        even nanny ogg  who took a fairly cheerful view of the world  would have been hard put to say anything complimentary about magrat   s voice .  but it fell on the fool   s ears like blossom .         and five leaved false mandrake  sovereign against fluxes of the bladder .  ah  and here   s old man   s frogbit .  that   s for constipation .      the fool stood up sheepishly  in a carillon of jingles .  to magrat it was as if the meadow  hitherto supporting nothing more hazardous than clouds of pale blue butterflies and a few self employed bumblebees  had sprouted a large red and yellow demon .   it was opening and shutting its mouth .  it had three menacing horns .   an urgent voice at the back of her mind said  you should run away now  like a timid gazelle  this is the accepted action in these circumstances .   common sense intervened .  in her most optimistic moments magrat would not have compared herself to a gazelle  timid or otherwise .  besides  it added  the basic snag about running away like a timid gazelle was that in all probability she would easily out distance him .      er     said the apparition .   uncommon sense  which  despite granny weatherwax   s general belief that magrat was several sticks short of a bundle  she still had in sufficiency  pointed out that few demons tinkled pathetically and appeared to be quite so breathless .      hallo     she said .   the fool   s mind was also working hard .  he was beginning to panic .   magrat shunned the traditional pointed hat  as worn by the other witches  but she still held to one of the most fundamental rules of witchcraft .  it   s not much use being a witch unless you look like one .  in her case this meant lots of silver jewelry with octograms  bats  spiders  dragons and other symbols of everyday mysticism  magrat would have painted her fingernails black  except that she didn   t think she would be able to face granny   s withering scorn .   it was dawning on the fool that he had surprised a witch .      whoops     he said  and turned to run for it .      don   t       magrat began  but the fool was already pounding down the forest path that led back to the castle .   magrat stood and stared at the wilting posy in her hands .  she ran her fingers through her hair and a shower of wilted petals fell out .   she felt that an important moment had been allowed to slip out of her grasp as fast as a greased pig in a narrow passageway .   she felt an overpowering urge to curse .  she knew a great many curses .  goodie whemper had been really imaginative in that department  even the creatures of the forest used to go past her cottage at a dead run .   she couldn   t find a single one that fully expressed her feelings .      oh  bugger     she said .     it was a full moon again that night  and most unusually all three witches arrived at the standing stone early  it was so embarrassed by this that it went and hid in some gorse bushes .      greebo hasn   t been home for two days     said nanny ogg  as soon as she arrived .     it   s not like him .  i can   t find him anywhere .         cats can look after themselves     said granny weatherwax .     countries can   t .  i have intelligence to report .  light the fire  magrat .         mmm .         i said  light the fire  magrat .         mmm .  oh .  yes .      the two old women watched her drift vaguely across the moorland  tugging absently at dried up whin clumps .  magrat seemed to have her mind on something .      doesn   t seem to be her normal self     said nanny ogg .      yes .  could be an improvement     said granny shortly  and sat down on a rock .     she should of got it lit before we arrived .  it   s her job .         she means well     said nanny ogg  studying magrat   s back reflectively .      i used to mean well when i was a girl  but that didn   t stop the sharp end of goodie filter   s tongue .  youngest witch serves her time  you know how it is .  we had it tougher  too .  look at her .  doesn   t even wear the pointy hat .  how   s anyone going to know .         you got something on your mind  esme .     said nanny .   granny nodded gloomily .      had a visit yesterday     she said .      me too .      despite her worries  granny was slightly annoyed at this .     who from .     she said .      the mayor of lancre and a bunch of burghers .  they   re not happy about the king .  they want a king they can trust .         i wouldn   t trust any king a burgher could trust     said granny .      yes  but it   s not good for anyone  all this taxing and killing folk .  the new sergeant they   ve got is a keen man when it comes to setting fire to cottages  too .  old verence used to do it too  mind  but   well           i know  i know .  it was more personal     said granny .     you felt he meant it .  people like to feel they   re valued .         this felmet hates the kingdom     nanny went on .     they all say it .  they say when they go to talk to him he just stares at them and giggles and rubs his hand and twitches a bit .      granny scratched her chin .     the old king used to shout at them and kick them out of the castle  mind .  he used to say he didn   t have time for shopkeepers and such     she added  with a note of personal approval .      but he was always very gracious about it     said nanny ogg .     and he           the kingdom is worried     said granny .      yes  i already said .         i didn   t mean the people  i meant the kingdom .      granny explained .  nanny interrupted a few times with brief questions .  it didn   t occur to her to doubt anything she heard .  granny weatherwax never made things up .   at the end of it she said     well .         my feelings exactly .         fancy that .         quite so .         and what did the animals do then .         went away .  it had brought them there  it let them go .         no one et anyone else .         not where i saw .         funny thing .         right enough .      nanny ogg stared at the setting sun .      i don   t reckon a lot of kingdoms do that sort of thing     she said .     you saw the theater .  kings and such are killing one another the whole time .  their kingdoms just make the best of it .  how come this one takes offense all of a sudden .         it   s been here a long time     said granny .      so   s everywhere     said nanny  and added  with the air of a lifetime student     everywhere   s been where it is ever since it was first put there .  it   s called geography .         that   s just about land     said granny .     it   s not the same as a kingdom .  a kingdom is made up of all sorts of things .  ideas .  loyalties .  memories .  it all sort of exists together .  and then all these things create some kind of life .  not a body kind of life  more like a living idea .  made up of everything that   s alive and what they   re thinking .  and what the people before them thought .      magrat reappeared and began to lay the fire with the air of one in a trance .          i can see you   ve been thinking about this a lot     said nanny  speaking very slowly and carefully .     and this kingdom wants a better king  is that it .         no .  that is  yes .  look       she leaned forward      it doesn   t have the same kind of likes and dislikes as people  right .      nanny ogg leaned back .     well  it wouldn   t  would it     she ventured .      it doesn   t care if people are good or bad .  i don   t think it could even tell  anymore than you could tell if an ant was a good ant .  but it expects the king to care for it .         yes  but     said nanny wretchedly .  she was becoming a bit afraid of the gleam in granny   s eye .     lots of people have killed each other to become king of lancre .  they   ve done all kinds of murder .         don   t matter .  don   t matter .     said granny  waving her arms .  she started counting on her fingers .     for why     she said .     one  kings go around killing each other because it   s all part of destiny and such and doesn   t count as murder  and two  they killed for the kingdom .  that   s the important bit .  but this new man just wants the power .  he hates the kingdom .         it   s a bit like a dog  really     said magrat .  granny looked at her with her mouth open to frame some suitable retort  and then her face softened .      very much like     she said .     a dog doesn   t care if its master   s good or bad  just so long as it likes the dog .         well  then     said nanny .     no one and nothing likes felmet .  what are we going to do about it .         nothing .  you know we can   t meddle .         you saved that baby     said nanny .      that   s not meddling .         have it your way     said nanny .     but maybe one day he   ll come back .  destiny again .  and you said we should hide the crown .  it   ll all come back  mark my words .  hurry up with that tea  magrat .         what are you going to do about the burghers .     said granny .      i told them they   ll have to sort it out themselves .  once we use magic  i said  it   d never stop .  you know that .         right     said granny  but there was a hint of wistfulness in her voice .      i   ll tell you this  though     said nanny .     they didn   t like it much .  they was muttering when they left .      magrat blurted out     you know the fool  who lives up at the castle .         little man with runny eyes .     said nanny  relieved that the conversation had returned to more normal matters .      not that little     said magrat .     what   s his name  do you happen to know .         he   s just called fool     said granny .     no job for a man  that .  running around with bells on .         his mother was a beldame  from over blackglass way     said nanny ogg  whose knowledge of the genealogy of lancre was legendary .     bit of a beauty when she was younger .  broke many a heart  she did .  bit of a scandal there  i did hear .  granny   s right  though .  at the end of the day  a fool   s a fool .         why d   you want to know  magrat .     said granny weatherwax .      oh   one of the girls in the village was asking me     said magrat  crimson to the ears .   nanny cleared her throat  and grinned at granny weatherwax  who sniffed aloofly .      it   s a steady job     said nanny .     i   ll grant you that .         huh     said granny .     a man who tinkles all day .  no kind of husband for anyone  i   d say .         you   she   d always know where he was     said nanny  who was enjoying this .     you   d just have to listen .         never trust a man with horns on his hat     said granny flatly .   magrat stood up and pulled herself together  giving the impression that some bits had to come quite a long way .      you   re a pair of silly old women     she said quietly .     and i   m going home .      she marched off down the path to her village without another word .   the old witches stared at one another .      well .     said nanny .      it   s all these books they read today     said granny .     it overheats the brain .  you haven   t been putting ideas in her head  have you .         what do you mean .         you know what i mean .      nanny stood up .     i certainly don   t see why a girl should have to be single her whole life just because you think it   s the right thing     she said .     anyway  if people didn   t have children  where would we be .         none of your girls is a witch     said granny  also standing up .      they could have been     said nanny defensively .      yes  if you   d let them work it out for themselves  instead of encouragin    them to throw themselves at men .         they   re good lookin    .  you can   t stand in the way of human nature .  you   d know that if you   d ever           if i   d ever what .     said granny weatherwax  quietly .   they stared at one another in shocked silence .  they could both feel it  the tension creeping into their bodies from the ground itself  the hot  aching feeling that they   d started something they must finish  no matter what .      i knew you when you were a gel     said nanny sullenly .     stuck up  you were .         at least i spent most of the time upright     said granny .     disgustin     that was .  everyone thought so .         how would you know .     snapped nanny .      you were the talk of the whole village     said granny .      and you were  too .  they called you the ice maiden .  never knew that  did you .     sneered nanny .      i wouldn   t sully my lips by sayin    what they called you     shouted granny .      oh yes .     shrieked nanny .     well  let me tell you  my good woman           don   t you dare talk to me in that tone of voice .  i   m not anyone   s good woman           right .      there was another silence while they stared at one another  nose to nose  but this silence was a whole quantum level of animosity higher than the last one  you could have roasted a turkey in the heat of this silence .  there was no more shouting .  things had got far too bad for shouting .  now the voices came in low and full of menace .      i should have known better than to listen to magrat     growled granny .     this coven business is ridiculous .  it attracts entirely the wrong sort of people .         i   m very glad we had this little talk     hissed nanny ogg .     cleared the air .      she looked down .      and you   re in my territory  madam .         madam .      thunder rolled in the distance .  the permanent lancre storm  after a trip through the foothills  had drifted back toward the mountains for a one night stand .  the last rays of sunset shone livid through the clouds  and fat drops of water began to thud on the witches    pointed hats .      i really don   t have time for all this     snapped granny  trembling .     i have far more important things to do .         and me     said nanny .      good night to you .         and you .      they turned their backs on one another and strode away into the downpour .     the midnight rain drummed on magrat   s curtained windows as she thumbed her way purposefully through goodie whemper   s books of what  for want of any better word  could be called natural magic .   the old woman had been a great collector of such things and  most unusually  had written them down  witches didn   t normally have much use for literacy .  but book after book was filled with tiny  meticulous handwriting detailing the results of patient experiments in applied magic .  goodie whemper had  in fact  been a research witch .    magrat was looking up love spells .  every time she shut her eyes she saw a red and yellow figure on the darkness inside .  something had to be done about it .   she shut the book with a snap and looked at her notes .  first  she had to find out his name .  the old peel the apple trick should do that .  you just peeled an apple  getting one length of peel  and threw the peel behind you  it   d land in the shape of his name .  millions of girls had tried it and had inevitably been disappointed  unless the loved one was called scscs .  that was because they hadn   t used an unripe sunset wonder picked three minutes before noon on the first frosty day in the autumn and peeled left handedly using a silver knife with a blade less than half an inch wide  goodie had done a lot of experimenting and was quite explicit on the subject .  magrat always kept a few by for emergencies  and this probably was one .   she took a deep breath  and threw the peel over her shoulder .   she turned slowly .   i   m a witch  she told herself .  this is just another spell .  there   s nothing to be frightened of .  get a grip of yourself  girl .  woman .   she looked down  and bit the back of her hand out of nervousness and embarrassment .      who   d have thought it .     she said aloud .   it had worked .   she turned back to her notes  her heart fluttering .  what was next .  ah  yes   gathering fern seed in a silk handkerchief at dawn .  goodie whemper   s tiny handwriting went on for two pages of detailed botanical instructions which  if carefully followed  resulted in the kind of love potion that had to be kept in a tightly stoppered jar at the bottom of a bucket of iced water .   magrat pulled open her back door .  the thunder had passed  but now the first gray light of the new day was drowned in a steady drizzle .  but it still qualified as dawn  and magrat was determined .   brambles tugging at her dress  her hair plastered against her head by the rain  she set out into the dripping forest .   the trees shook  even without a breeze .     nanny ogg was also out early .  she hadn   t been able to get any sleep anyway  and besides  she was worried about greebo .  greebo was one of her few blind spots .  while intellectually she would concede that he was indeed a fat  cunning  evil smelling multiple rapist  she nevertheless instinctively pictured him as the small fluffy kitten he had been decades before .  the fact that he had once chased a female wolf up a tree and seriously surprised a she bear who had been innocently digging for roots didn   t stop her worrying that something bad might happen to him .  it was generally considered by everyone else in the kingdom that the only thing that might slow greebo down was a direct meteorite strike .   now she was using a bit of elementary magic to follow his trail  although anyone with a sense of smell could have managed it .  it had led her through the damp streets and to the open gates of the castle .   she gave the guards a nod as she went through .  it didn   t occur to either of them to stop her because witches  like beekeepers and big gorillas  went where they liked .  in any case  an elderly lady banging a bowl with a spoon was probably not the spearhead of an invasion force .   life as a castle guard in lancre was extremely boring .  one of them  leaning on his spear as nanny went past  wished there could be some excitement in his job .  he will shortly learn the error of his ways .  the other guard pulled himself together  and saluted .      mornin     mum .         mornin     our shawn     said nanny  and set off across the inner courtyard .   like all witches nanny ogg had an aversion to front doors .  she went around the back and entered the keep via the kitchens .  a couple of maids curtsied to her .  so did the head housekeeper  whom nanny ogg vaguely recognized as a daughter in law  although she couldn   t remember her name .   and so it was that when lord felmet came out of his bedroom he saw  coming along the passage toward him  a witch .  there was no doubt about it .  from the tip of her pointed hat to her boots  she was a witch .  and she was coming for him .     magrat slid helplessly down a bank .  she was soaked to the skin and covered in mud .  somehow  she thought bitterly  when you read these spells you always think of it being a fine sunny morning in late spring .  and she had forgotten to check what bloody kind of bloody fern it bloody was .   a tree tipped a load of raindrops onto her .  magrat pushed her sodden hair out of her eyes and sat down heavily on a fallen log  from which grew great clusters of pale and embarrassing fungus .   it had seemed such a lovely idea .  she   d had great hopes of the coven .  she was sure it wasn   t right to be a witch alone  you could get funny ideas .  she   d dreamed of wise discussions of natural energies while a huge moon hung in the sky  and then possibly they   d try a few of the old dances described in some of goodie whemper   s books .  not actually naked  or skyclad as it was rather delightfully called  because magrat had no illusions about the shape of her own body and the older witches seemed solid across the hems  and anyway that wasn   t absolutely necessary .  the books said that the old time witches had sometimes danced in their shifts .  magrat had wondered about how you danced in shifts .  perhaps there wasn   t room for them all to dance at once  she   d thought .   what she hadn   t expected was a couple of crochety old women who were barely civil at the best of times and simply didn   t enter into the spirit of things .  oh  they   d been kind to the baby  in their own way  but she couldn   t help feeling that if a witch was kind to someone it was entirely for deeply selfish reasons .   and when they did magic  they made it look as ordinary as housekeeping .  they didn   t wear any occult jewelry .  magrat was a great believer in occult jewelry .   it was all going wrong .  and she was going home .   she stood up  wrapped her damp dress around her  and set off through the misty woods        and heard the running feet .  someone was coming through them at high speed  without caring who heard him  and over the top of the sound of breaking twigs was a curious dull jingling .  magrat sidled behind a dripping holly bush and peered cautiously through the leaves .   it was shawn  the youngest of nanny ogg   s sons  and the metal noise was caused by his suit of chain mail  which was several sizes too big for him .  lancre is a poor kingdom  and over the centuries the chain mail of the palace guards has had to be handed down from one generation to another  often on the end of a long stick .  this one made him look like a bullet proof bloodhound .   she stepped out in front of him .      is that you  miss magrat .     said shawn  raising the flap of mail that covered his eyes .     it   s mam .         what   s happened to her .         he   s locked her up .  said she was coming to poison him .  and i can   t get down to the dungeons to see because there   s all new guards .  they say she   s been put in chains       shawn frowned      and that means something horrible   s going to happen .  you know what she   s like when she loses her temper .  we   ll never hear the last of it  miz .         where were you going .     demanded magrat .      to fetch our jason and our wane and our darron and our           wait a moment .         oh  miss magrat  suppose they try to torture her .  you know what a tongue she   s got on her when she gets angry           i   m thinking     said magrat .      he   s put his own bodyguards on the gates and everything           look  just shut up a minute  will you  shawn .         when our jason finds out  he   s going to give the duke a real seeing to  miz .  he says it   s about time someone did .      nanny ogg   s jason was a young man with the build and  magrat had always thought  the brains of a herd of oxen .  thick skinned though he was  she doubted whether he could survive a hail of arrows .      don   t tell him yet     she said thoughtfully .     there could be another way           i   ll go and find granny weatherwax  shall i  miz .     said shawn  hopping from one leg to another .     she   ll know what to do  she   s a witch .      magrat stood absolutely still .  she had thought she was angry before  but now she was furious .  she was wet and cold and hungry and this person   once upon a time  she heard herself thinking she would have burst into tears at this point .      oops     said shawn .     um .  i didn   t mean .  whoops .  um       he backed away .      if you happen to see granny weatherwax     said magrat slowly  in tones that should have etched her words into glass     you can tell her that i will sort it all out .  now go away before i turn you into a frog .  you look like one anyway .      she turned  hitched up her skirts  and ran like hell toward her cottage .     lord felmet was one of nature   s gloaters .  he was good at it .      quite comfortable  are we .     he said .   nanny ogg considered this .     apart from these stocks  you mean .     she said .      i am impervious to your foul blandishments     said the duke .     i scorn your devious wiles .  you are to be tortured  i   ll have you know .      this didn   t appear to have the required effect .  nanny was staring around the dungeon with the vaguely interested gaze of a sightseer .      and then you will be burned     said the duchess .      ok     said nanny .      ok .         well  it   s bloody freezing down here .  what   s that big wardrobe thing with the spikes .      the duke was trembling .     aha     he said .     now you realize  eh .  that  my dear lady  is an iron maiden .  it   s the latest thing .  well may you           can i have a go in it .         your pleas fall on deaf       the duke   s voice trailed off .  his twitch started up .   the duchess leaned forward until her big red face was inches away from nanny   s nose .      this insouciance gives you pleasure     she hissed     but soon you will laugh on the other side of your face .         it   s only got this side     said nanny .   the duchess fingered a tray of implements lovingly .     we shall see     she said  picking up a pair of pliers .      and you need not think any others of your people will come to your aid     said the duke  who was sweating despite the chill .     we alone hold the keys to this dungeon .  ha ha .  you will be an example to all those who have been spreading malicious rumors about me .  do not protest your innocence .  i hear the voices all the time  lying        the duchess gripped him ferociously by the arm .     enough     she rasped .     come  leonal .  we will let her reflect on her fate for a while .            the faces   wicked lies   i wasn   t there  and anyway he fell   my porridge  all salty       murmured the duke  swaying .   the door slammed behind them .  there was a click of locks and a thudding of bolts .   nanny was left alone in the gloom .  a flickering torch high on the wall only made the surrounding darkness more forbidding .  strange metal shapes  designed for no more exalted purpose than the destruct testing of the human body  cast unpleasant shadows .  nanny ogg stirred in her chains .      all right     she said .     i can see you .  who are you .      king verence stepped forward .      i saw you making faces behind him     said nanny ogg .     all i could do to keep a straight face myself .         i wasn   t making faces  woman  i was scowling .      nanny squinted .        ere  i know you     she said .     you   re dead .         i prefer the term    passed over        said the king .      i   d bow      said nanny .     only there   s all these chains and things .  you haven   t seen a cat around here  have you .         yes .  he   s in the room upstairs  asleep .      nanny appeared to relax .     that   s all right  then     she said .     i was beginning to worry .     she stared around the dungeon again .     what   s that big bed thing over there .         the rack     said the king  and explained its use .  nanny ogg nodded .      what a busy little mind he   s got     she said .      i fear  madam  that i may be responsible for your present predicament     said verence  sitting down on or at least just above a handy anvil .     i wished to attract a witch .         i suppose you   re no good at locks .         i fear they would be beyond my capabilities as yet   but surely       the ghost of the king waved a hand in a vague gesture which encompassed the dungeon  nanny and the manacles      to a witch all this is just so much           solid iron     said nanny .     you might be able to walk through it  but i can   t .         i didn   t realize     said verence .     i thought witches could do magic .         young man     said nanny     you will oblige me by shutting up .         madam .  i am a king .         you are also dead  so i wouldn   t aspire to hold any opinions if i was you .  now just be quiet and wait  like a good boy .      against all his instincts  the king found himself obeying .  there was no gainsaying that tone of voice .  it spoke to him across the years  from his days in the nursery .  its echoes told him that if he didn   t eat it all up he would be sent straight to bed .   nanny ogg stirred in her chains .  she hoped they would turn up soon .      er     said the king uneasily .     i feel i owe you an explanation             thank you     said granny weatherwax  and because shawn seemed to be expecting it  added     you   ve been a good boy .         yes   m     said shawn .     m   m .         was there something else .      shawn twisted the end of his chain mail vest out of embarrassment .     it   s not true what everyone   s been saying about our mam  is it  m   m .     he said .     she doesn   t go around putting evil curses on folk .  except for daviss the butcher .  and old cake bread  after he kicked her cat .  but they wasn   t what you   d call real curses  was they  m   m .         you can stop calling me m   m .         yes  m   m .         they   ve been saying that  have they .         yes  m   m .         well  your mam does upset people sometimes .      shawn hopped from one leg to another .      yes  m   m  but they says terrible things about you  m   m  savin    your presence  m   m .      granny stiffened .      what things .         don   t like to say  m   m .         what things .      shawn considered his next move .  there weren   t many choices .      a lot of things what aren   t true  m   m     he said  establishing his credentials as early as possible .     all sorts of things .  like  old verence was a bad king and you helped him on the throne  and you caused that bad winter the other year  and old norbut   s cow dint give no milk after you looked at it .  lot of lies  m   m     he added  loyally .      right     said granny .   she shut the door in his panting face  stood in thought for a moment  and retired to her rocking chair .   eventually she said  once more     right .      a little later she added     she   s a daft old besom  but we can   t have people going around doing things to witches .  once you   ve lost your respect  you ain   t got a thing .  i don   t remember looking at old norbut   s cow .  who   s old norbut .      she stood up  took her pointed hat from its hook behind the door and  glaring into the mirror  skewered it in place with a number of ferocious hatpins .  they slid on one by one  as unstoppable as the wrath of god .   she vanished into the outhouse for a moment and came back with her witch   s cloak  which served as a blanket for sick goats when not otherwise employed .   once upon a time it had been black velvet  now it was just black .  it was carefully and slowly fastened by a tarnished silver brooch .   no samurai  no questing knight  was ever dressed with as much ceremony .   finally granny drew herself up  surveyed her dark reflection in the glass  gave a thin little smile of approval  and left via the back door .   the air of menace was only slightly dispelled by the sound of her running up and down outside  trying to get her broomstick started .     magrat was also regarding herself in the mirror .   she   d dug out a startlingly green dress that was designed to be both revealing and clinging  and would have been if magrat had anything to display or cling to  so she   d shoved a couple of rolled up stockings down the front in an effort to make good the more obvious deficiencies .  she had also tried a spell on her hair  but it was naturally magic resistant and already the natural shape was beginning to assert itself  a dandelion clock at about   p . m .   .   magrat had also tried makeup .  this wasn   t an unqualified success .  she didn   t have much practice .  she was beginning to wonder if she   d overdone the eyeshadow .   her neck  fingers and arms between them carried enough silverware to make a full sized dinner service  and over everything she had thrown a black cloak lined with red silk .   in a certain light and from a carefully chosen angle  magrat was not unattractive .  whether any of these preparations did anything for her is debatable  but they did mean that a thin veneer of confidence overlaid her trembling heart .   she drew herself up and turned this way and that .  the clusters of amulets  magical jewelry and occult bangles on various parts of her body jingled together  any enemy wouldn   t only have to be blind to fail to notice that a witch was approaching  he   d have to be deaf as well .   she turned to her worktable and examined what she rather self consciously  and never in granny   s hearing  called her tools of the craft .  there was the white handled knife  used in the preparation of magical ingredients .  there was the black handled knife  used in the magical workings themselves  magrat had carved so many runes into its handle it was in constant danger of falling in half .  they were undoubtedly powerful  but     magrat shook her head regretfully  went over to the kitchen dresser and took out the breadknife .  something told her that at times like these a good sharp breadknife was probably the best friend a girl could have .        i spy  with my little eye     said nanny ogg     something beginning with p .      the ghost of the king stared wearily around the dungeons .      pliers     he suggested .      no .         pilliwinks .         that   s a pretty name .  what is it .         it   s a kind of thumbscrew .  look     said the king .      it   s not that     said nanny .      choke pear .     he said desperately .      that   s a c  and anyway i don   t know what it is     said nanny ogg .  the king obligingly indicated it on the tray  and explained its use .      definitely not     said nanny .      smouldering boot of punishment .     said the king .      you   re a bit too good at these names     said nanny sharply .     you sure you didn   t use them when you were alive .         absolutely  nanny     said the ghost .      boys that tell lies go to a bad place     warned nanny .      lady felmet had most of them installed herself  it   s the truth     said the king desperately  he felt his position to be precarious enough without having any bad places to worry about .   nanny sniffed .     right  then     she said  slightly mollified .     it was    pinchers .            but pinchers is just another name for pl       the king began  and stopped himself in time .  during his adult life he   d been afraid of no man  beast or combination of the two  but nanny   s voice brought back old memories of schoolroom and nursery  of life under strict orders given by stern ladies in long skirts  and nursery food   mostly gray and brown   which seemed indigestible at the time but now appeared a distant ambrosia .      that   s five to me     said nanny happily .      they   ll be back soon     said the king .     are you sure you   ll be all right .         if i   m not  precisely how much help can you be .     said nanny .   there was the sound of bolts sliding back .     there was already a crowd outside the castle as granny   s broomstick wobbled uncertainly toward the ground .  they went quiet as she strode forward  and parted to let her pass .  she had a basket of apples under her arm .      there   s a witch in the dungeons     someone whispered to granny .     and foul tortures  they say .         nonsense     said granny .     it couldn   t be .  i expect nanny ogg has just gone to advize the king  or something .         they say jason ogg   s gone to fetch his brothers     said a stallholder  in awe .      i really advize you all to return home     said granny weatherwax .     there has probably been a misunderstanding .  everyone knows a witch cannot be held against her will .         it   s gone too far this time     said a peasant .     all this burning and taxing and now this .  i blame you witches .  it   s got to stop .  i know my rights .         what rights are they .     said granny .      dunnage  cowhage in ordinary  badinage  leftovers  scrommidge  clary and spunt     said the peasant promptly .     and acornage  every other year  and the right to keep two thirds of a goat on the common .  until he set fire to it .  it was a bloody good goat  too .         a man could go far  knowing his rights like you do     said granny .     but right now he should go home .      she turned and looked at the gates .  there were two extremely apprehensive guards on duty .  she walked up to them  and fixed one of them with a look .      i am a harmless old seller of apples     she said  in a voice more appropriate for the opening of hostilities in a middle range war .     pray let me past  dearie .     the last word had knives in it .      no one must enter the castle     said one of the guards .     orders of the duke .      granny shrugged .  the apple seller gambit had never worked more than once in the entire history of witchcraft  as far as she knew  but it was traditional .      i know you  champett poldy     she said .     i recall i laid out your grandad and i brought you into the world .     she glanced at the crowds  which had regathered a little way off  and turned back to the guard  whose face was already a mask of terror .  she leaned a little closer  and said     i gave you your first good hiding in this valley of tears and by all the gods if you cross me now i will give you your last .      there was a soft metallic noise as the spear fell out of the man   s fearful fingers .  granny reached and gave the trembling man a reassuring pat on the shoulder .      but don   t worry about it     she added .     have an apple .      she made to step forward  and a second spear barred her way .  she looked up with interest .   the other guard was not a ramtopper  but a city bred mercenary brought up to swell the ranks depleted in recent years .  his face was a patchwork of scar tissue .  several of the scars rearranged themselves into what was possibly a sneer .      so that   s witches    magic  is it .     said the guard .     pretty poor stuff .  maybe it frightens these country idiots  woman  but it doesn   t frighten me .         i imagine it takes a lot to frighten a big strong lad like you     said granny  reaching up to her hat .      and don   t you try to put the wind up me  neither .     the guard stared straight ahead  and rocked gently on the balls of his feet .     old ladies like you  twisting people around .  it shouldn   t be stood for  like they say .         just as you like     said granny  pushing the spear aside .      listen  i said       the guard began  and grabbed granny   s shoulder .  her hand moved so quickly it hardly seemed to move at all  but suddenly he was clutching at his arm and moaning .   granny replaced the hatpin in her hat and ran for it .        we will begin     said the duchess  leering     with the showing of the implements .         seen    em     said nanny .     leastways  all the ones beginning with p  s  i  t and w .         then let us see how long you can keep that light conversational tone .  light the brazier  felmet     snapped the duchess .      light the brazier  fool     said the duke .   the fool moved slowly .  he hadn   t expected any of this .  torturing people hadn   t been on his mental agenda .  hurting old ladies in cold blood wasn   t his cup of tea  and actually hurting witches in blood of any temperature whatsoever failed to be an entire twelve course banquet .  words  he   d said .  all this probably came under the heading of sticks and stones .      i don   t like doing this     he murmured under his breath .      fine     said nanny ogg  whose hearing was superb .     i   ll remember that you didn   t like it .         what   s that .     said the duke sharply .      nothing     said nanny .     is this going to take long .  i haven   t had breakfast .      the fool lit a match .  there was the faintest disturbance in the air beside him  and it went out .  he swore  and tried another .  this time his shaking hands managed to get it as far as the brazier before it  too  flared and darkened .      hurry up  man .     said the duchess  laying out a tray of tools .      doesn   t seem to want to light       muttered the fool  as another match became a fluttering streak of flame and then went out .   the duke snatched the box from his trembling fingers and caught him across the cheek with a handful of rings .      can no orders of mine be obeyed .     he screamed .     infirm of purpose .  weak .  give me the box .      the fool backed away .  someone he couldn   t see was whispering things he couldn   t quite make out in his ear .      go outside     hissed the duke     and see that we are not disturbed .      the fool tripped over the bottom step  turned and  with a last imploring look at nanny  scampered through the door .  he capered a little bit  out of force of habit .      the fire isn   t completely necessary     said the duchess .     it merely assists .  now  woman  will you confess .         what to .     said nanny .      it   s common knowledge .  treason .  malicious witchcraft .  harboring the king   s enemies .  theft of the crown        a tinkling noise made them look down .  a bloodstained dagger had fallen off the bench  as though someone had tried to pick it up but just couldn   t get the strength together .  nanny heard the king   s ghost swear under its breath  or what would have been its breath .         and spreading false rumors     finished the duchess .         salt in my food       said the duke  nervously  staring at the bandages on his hand .  he kept getting the feeling that there was a fourth person in the dungeon .      if you do confess     said the duchess     you will merely be burned at the stake .  and  please  no humorous remarks .         what false rumors .      the duke closed his eyes  but the visions were still there .     concerning the accidental death of the late king verence     he whispered hoarsely .  the air swirled again .   nanny sat with her head cocked to one side  as though listening to a voice only she could hear .  except that the duke was certain that he could hear something too  not exactly a voice  something like the distant sighing of the wind .      oh  i don   t know nothing false     she said .     i know you stabbed him  and you gave him the dagger .  it was at the top of the stairs .     she paused  head cocked  nodded  and added     just by the suit of armor with the pike  and you said     if it   s to be done  it   s better if it   s done quickly     or something  and then you snatched the king   s own dagger  the very same what is now lying on the floor  out of his belt and           you lie .  there were no witnesses .  we made   there was nothing to witness .  i heard someone in the dark  but there was no one there .  there couldn   t have been anyone seeing anything .     screamed the duke .  his wife scowled at him .      do shut up  leonal     she said .     i think within these four walls we can dispense with that sort of thing .         who told her .  did you tell her .         and calm down .  no one told her .  she   s a witch  for goodness sake  they find out about these things .  second glance  or something .         sight     said nanny .      which you will not possess much longer  my good woman  unless you tell us who else knows and indeed  assist us on a number of other matters     said the duchess grimly .     and you will do so  believe me .  i am skilled in these things .      granny glanced around the dungeon .  it was beginning to get crowded .  king verence was bursting with such angry vitality that he was very nearly apparent  and was furiously trying to get a grip on a knife .  but there were others behind   wavering  broken shapes  not exactly ghosts but memories  implanted in the very substances of the walls themselves by sheer pain and terror .      my own dagger .  the bastards .  they killed me with my own dagger     said the ghost of king verence silently  raising his transparent arms and imploring the netherworld in general to witness this ultimate humiliation .     give me strength           yes     said nanny .     it   s worth a try .         and now we will commence     said the duchess .        what .     said the guard .      i said     said magrat     i   ve come to sell my lovely apples .  don   t you listen .         there   s not a sale on  is there .     the guard was extremely nervous since his colleague had been taken off to the infirmary .  he hadn   t taken the job in order to deal with this sort of thing .   it dawned on him .      you   re not a witch  are you .     he said  fumbling awkwardly with his pike .      of course not .  do i look like one .      the guard looked at her occult bangles  her lined cloak  her trembling hands and her face .  the face was particularly worrying .  magrat had used a lot of powder to make her face pale and interesting .  it combined with the lavishly applied mascara to give the guard the impression that he was looking at two flies that had crashed into a sugar bowl .  he found his fingers wanted to make a sign to ward off the evil eyeshadow .      right     he said uncertainly .  his mind was grinding through the problem .  she was a witch .  just lately there   d been a lot of gossip about witches being bad for your health .  he   d been told not to let witches pass  but no one had said anything about apple sellers .  apple sellers were not a problem .  it was witches that were the problem .  she   d said she was an apple seller and he wasn   t about to doubt a witch   s word .   feeling happy with this application of logic  he stood to one side and gave an expansive wave .      pass  apple seller     he said .      thank you     said magrat sweetly .     would you like an apple .         no  thanks .  i haven   t finished the one the other witch gave me .     his eyes rolled .     not a witch .  not a witch  an apple seller .  an apple seller .  she ought to know .         how long ago was this .         just a few minutes        granny weatherwax was not lost .  she wasn   t the kind of person who ever became lost .  it was just that  at the moment  while she knew exactly where she was  she didn   t know the position of anywhere else .  currently she had arrived in the kitchens again  precipitating a breakdown in the cook  who was trying to roast some celery .  the fact that several people had tried to buy apples from her wasn   t improving her temper .   magrat found her way to the great hall  empty and deserted at this time of day except for a couple of guards who were playing dice .  they wore the tabards of felmet   s own personal bodyguard  and stopped their game as soon as she appeared .      well  well     said one  leering .     come to keep us company  have you  my pretty .          i was looking for the dungeons     said magrat  to whom the words    sexual harassment    were a mere collection of syllables .      just fancy     said one of the guards  winking at the other .     i reckon we can help you there .     they got up and stood either side of her  she was aware of two chins you could strike matches on and an overpowering smell of stale beer .  frantic signals from outlying portions of her mind began to break down her iron hard conviction that bad things only happened to bad people .   they escorted her down several flights of steps into a maze of dank  arched passageways as she sought hurriedly for some polite way of disengaging herself .      i should warn you     she said     i am not  as i may appear  a simple apple seller .         fancy that .         i am  in fact  a witch .      this did not make the impression she had hoped .  the guards exchanged glances .      fair enough     said one .     i   ve always wondered what it was like to kiss a witch .  around here they do say you gets turned into a frog .      the other guard nudged him .     i reckon  then     he said  in the slow  ripe tones of one who thinks that what he is about to say next is going to be incredibly funny     you kissed one years ago .      the brief guffaw was suddenly interrupted when magrat was flung against the wall and treated to a close up view of the guard   s nostrils .      now listen to me  sweetheart     he said .     you ain   t the first witch we   ve had down here  if witch you be  but you could be lucky and walk out again .  if you are nice to us  d   you see .      there was a shrill  short scream from somewhere nearby .      that  you see     said the guard     was a witch having it the hard way .  you could do us all a favor  see .  lucky you met us  really .      his questing hand stopped its wandering .     what   s this .     he said to magrat   s pale face .     a knife .  a knife .  i reckon we   ve got to take that very seriously  don   t you  hron .         you got to tie her hands and gag her     said hron hurriedly .     they can   t do no magic if they can   t speak or wave their hands about           you can take your hands off her .      all three stared down the passage at the fool .  he was jingling with rage .      let her go this minute .     he shouted .     or i   ll report you .         oh  you   ll report us  will you .     said hron .     and will anyone listen to you  you earwax colored little twerp .         this is a witch we have here     said the other guard .     so you can go and tinkle somewhere else .     he turned back to magrat .     i like a girl with spirit     he said  incorrectly as it turned out .   the fool advanced with the bravery of the terminally angry .      i told you to let her go     he repeated .   hron drew his sword and winked at his companion .   magrat struck .  it was an unplanned  instinctive blow  its stopping power considerably enhanced by the weight of rings and bangles  her arm whirred around in an arc that connected with her captor   s jaw and spun him twice before he folded up in a heap with a quiet little sigh  and incidentally with several symbols of occult significance enbossed on his cheek .   hron gaped at him  and then looked at magrat .  he raised his sword at about the same moment that the fool cannoned into him  and the two men went down in a struggling heap .  like most small men the fool relied on the initial mad rush to secure an advantage and was at a loss for a follow through  and it would probably have gone hard with him if hron hadn   t suddenly become aware that a breadknife was pressed to his neck .      let go of him     said magrat  pushing her hair out of her eyes .   he stiffened .     you   re wondering whether i really would cut your throat     panted magrat .     i don   t know either .  think of the fun we could have together  finding out .      she reached down with her other hand and hauled the fool to his feet by his collar .      where did that scream come from .     she said  without taking her eyes off the guard .      it was down this way .  they   ve got her in the torture dungeon and i don   t like it  it   s going too far  and i couldn   t get in and i couldn   t get in and i came to look for someone           well  you   ve found me     said magrat .      you     she said to hron     will stay here .  or run away  for all i care .  but you won   t follow us .      he nodded  and stared after them as they hurried down the passage .     the door   s locked     said the fool .     there   s all sorts of noises  but the door   s locked .         well  it   s a dungeon  isn   t it .         they   re not supposed to lock from the inside .      it was  indeed  unbudgeable .  silence came from the other side   a busy  thick silence that crawled through the cracks and spilled out into the passage  a kind of silence that is worse than screams .   the fool hopped from one foot to the other as magrat explored the door   s rough surface .      are you really a witch .     he said .     they said you were a witch  are you really .  you don   t look like a witch  you look very  that is       he blushed .     not like a  you know  crone at all  but absolutely beautiful       his voice trailed into silence     i am totally in control of the situation  magrat told herself .  i never thought i would be  but i am thinking absolutely clearly .   and she realized  in an absolutely clear way  that her padding had slipped down to her waist  her head felt as though a family of unhygienic birds had been nesting in it  and her eyeshadow had not so much run as sprinted .  her dress was torn in several places  her legs were scratched  her arms were bruised  and for some reason she felt on top of the world .      i think you   d better stand back  verence     she said .     i   m not sure how this is going to work .      there was a sharp intake of breath .      how did you know my name .      magrat sized up the door .  the oak was old  centuries old  but she could sense just a little sap under a surface varnished by the years into something that was nearly as tough as stone .  normally what she had in mind would require a day   s planning and a bagful of exotic ingredients .  at least  so she   d always believed .  now she was prepared to doubt it .  if you could conjure demons out of washtubs  you could do anything .   she became aware that the fool had spoken .      oh  i expect i heard it somewhere     she said vaguely .      i shouldn   t think so  i never use it     said the fool .     i mean  it   s not a popular name with the duke .  it was me mam  you see .  they like to name you after kings  i suppose .  my grandad said i had no business having a name like that and he said i shouldn   t go around        magrat nodded .  she was looking around the dank tunnel with a professional   s eye .   it wasn   t a promising place .  the old oak planks had been down here in the darkness all these years  away from the clock of the seasons     on the other hand   granny had said that somehow all trees were one tree  or something like that .  magrat thought she understood it  although she didn   t know exactly what it meant .  and it was springtime up there .  the ghost of life that still lived in the wood must know that .  or if it had forgotten  it must be told .   she put her palms flat on the door again and shut her eyes  tried to think her way out through the stone  out of the castle  and into the thin  black soil of the mountains  into the air  into the sunlight     the fool was merely aware that magrat was standing very still .  then her hair stood out from her head  gently  and there was a smell of leaf mold .   and then  without warning  the hammer that can drive a marshmallow soft toadstool through six inches of solid pavement or an eel across a thousand miles of hostile ocean to a particular pond in an upland field  struck up through her and into the door .   she stepped back carefully  her mind stunned  fighting against a desperate urge to bury her toes into the rock and put forth leaves .  the fool caught her  and the shock nearly knocked him over .   magrat sagged against the faintly jingling body  and felt triumphant .  she had done it .  and with no artificial aids .  if only the others could have seen this        don   t go near it     she mumbled .     i think i gave it rather   a lot .     the fool was still holding her toastrack body in his arms and was too overcome to utter a word  but she still got a reply .      i reckon you did     said granny weatherwax  stepping out of the shadows .     i never would have thought of it myself .      magrat peered at her .      you   ve been here all the time .         just a few minutes .     granny glanced at the door .     good technique     she said     but it   s old wood .  been in a fire  too  i reckon .  lot of iron nails and stuff in there .  can   t see it working  i   d have tried the stones if it was me  but        she was interrupted by a soft    pop .      there was another  and then a whole series of them together  like a shower of meringues .   behind her  very gently  the door was breaking into leaf .   granny stared at it for a few seconds  and then met magrat   s terrified gaze .      run .     she yelled .   they grabbed the fool and scurried into the shelter of a convenient buttress .   the door gave a warning creak .  several of its planks twisted in vegetable agony and there was a shower of rock splinters when nails were expelled like thorns from a wound  ricocheting off the stonework .  the fool ducked as part of the lock whirred over his head and smashed into the opposite wall .   the lower parts of the planks extended questing white roots  which slithered across the damp stone to the nearest crack and began to auger in .  knotholes bulged  burst and thrust out branches which hit the stones of the doorway and tumbled them aside .  and all the time there was a low groan  the sound of the cells of the wood trying to contain the surge of raw life pounding through them .      if it had been me     said granny weatherwax  as part of the ceiling caved in further along the passage     i wouldn   t have done it like that .  not that i   m objecting  mind you     she said  as magrat opened her mouth .     it   s a reasonable job .  i think you might have overdone it a bit  that   s all .         excuse me     said the fool .      i can   t do rocks     said magrat .      well  no  rocks is an acquired taste           excuse me .      the two witches stared at him  and he backed away .      weren   t you supposed to be rescuing someone .     he said .      oh     said granny .     yes .  come on  magrat .  we   d better see what she   s been getting up to .         there were screams     said the fool  who couldn   t help feeling they weren   t taking things seriously enough .      i daresay     said granny  pushing him aside and stepping over a writhing taproot .     if anyone locked me in a dungeon  there   d be screams .      there was a lot of dust inside the dungeon  and by the nimbus of light around its one torch magrat could dimly make out two figures cowering in the furthest corner .  most of the furniture had been overturned and scattered across the floor  it didn   t look as though any of it had been designed to be the last word in comfort .  nanny ogg was sitting quite calmly in what appeared to be a sort of stocks .      took your time     she observed .     let me out of this  will you .  i   m getting cramp .      and there was the dagger .   it spun gently in the middle of the room  glinting when the turning blade caught the light .      my own dagger .     said the ghost of the king  in a voice only the witches could hear .     all this time and i never knew it .  my own dagger .  they bloody well did me in with my own bloody knife .      he took another step toward the royal couple  waving the dagger .  a faint gurgle escaped from the lips of the duke  glad to be out of there .      he   s doing well  isn   t he     said nanny  as magrat helped her out of her prison .      isn   t that the old king .  can they see him .         shouldn   t think so .      king verence staggered slightly under the weight .  he was too old for such poltergeist activity  you had to be an adolescent for this        let me just get a grip on this thing     he said .     oh  damn        the knife dropped from the ghost   s tenuous grasp and clattered to the floor .  granny weatherwax stepped forward smartly and put her foot on it .      the dead shouldn   t kill the living     she said .     it could be a dangerous wossname  precedent .  we   d all be outnumbered  for one thing .      the duchess surfaced from her terror first .  there had been knives swooping through the air and exploding doors  and now these women were defying her in her own dungeons .  she couldn   t be sure how she was supposed to react to the supernatural items  but she had very firm ideas about how she should tackle the last one .   her mouth opened like the gateway to a red hell .     guards .     she yelled  and spotted the fool hovering near the door .     fool .  fetch the guards .         they   re busy .  we were just leaving     said granny .     which one of you is the duke .      felmet stared pink eyed up at her from his half crouch in the corner .  a thin dribble of saliva escaped from the corner of his mouth  and he giggled .   granny looked closer .  in the center of those streaming eyes something else looked back at her .      i   m going to give you no cause     she said quietly .     but it would be better for you if you left this country .  abdicate  or whatever .         in favor of whom .     said the duchess icily .     a witch .         i won   t     said the duke .      what did you say .      the duke pulled himself upright  brushed some of the dust off his clothes  and looked granny full in the face .  the coldness in the center of his eyes was larger .      i said i won   t     he said .     do you think a bit of simple conjuring would frighten me .  i am the king by right of conquest  and you cannot change it .  it is as simple as that  witch .      he moved closer .   granny stared at him .  she hadn   t faced anything like this before .  the man was clearly mad  but at the heart of his madness was a dreadful cold sanity  a core of pure interstellar ice in the center of the furnace .  she   d thought him weak under a thin shell of strength  but it went a lot further than that .  somewhere deep inside his mind  somewhere beyond the event horizon of rationality  the sheer pressure of insanity had hammered his madness into something harder than diamond .      if you defeat me by magic  magic will rule     said the duke .     and you can   t do it .  and any king raised with your help would be under your power .  hag ridden  i might say .  that which magic rules  magic destroys .  it would destroy you  too .  you know it .  ha .  ha .      granny   s knuckles whitened as he moved closer .      you could strike me down     he said .     and perhaps you could find someone to replace me .  but he would have to be a fool indeed  because he would know he was under your evil eye  and if he mispleased you  why  his life would be instantly forfeit .  you could protest all you wished  but he   d know he ruled with your permission .  and that would make him no king at all .  is this not true .      granny looked away .  the other witches hung back  ready to duck .      i said  is this not true .         yes     said granny .     it is true           yes .            but there is one who could defeat you     said granny slowly .      the child .  let him come when he is grown .  a young man with a sword  seeking his destiny .     the duke sneered .     very romantic .  but i have many years to prepare .  let him try .      beside him king verence   s fist smashed through the air and quite failed to connect .   the duke leaned closer until his nose was an inch from granny   s face .      get back to your cauldrons  wyrd sisters     he said softly .     granny weatherwax stalked through the passages of lancre castle like a large  angry bat  the duke   s laughter echoing around her head .      you could give him boils or something     said nanny ogg .     hemorrhoids are good .  that   s allowed .  it won   t stop him ruling  it just means he   ll have to rule standing up .  always good for a laugh  that .  or piles .      granny weatherwax said nothing .  if fury were heat  her hat would have caught fire .      mind you  that   d probably make him worse     said nanny  running to keep up .     same with toothache .     she gave a sideways glance at granny   s twitching features .      you needn   t fret     she said .     they didn   t do anything much .  but thanks  anyway .         i ain   t worried about you  gytha ogg     snapped granny .     i only come along    cos magrat was fretting .  what i say is  if a witch can   t look after herself  she   s got no business calling herself a witch .         magrat done well with the woodwork  i thought .      even in the grip of her sullen fury  granny weatherwax spared a nod .      she   s coming along     she said .  she looked up and down the corridor  and then leaned closer to nanny ogg   s ear .      i ain   t going to give him the pleasure of saying it     she said     but he   s got us beaten .         well  i don   t know     said nanny .     our jason and a few sharp lads could soon           you saw some of his guards .  these aren   t the old sort .  these are a tough kind .         we could give the boys just a bit of help           it wouldn   t work .  people have to sort this sort of thing out for themselves .         if you say so  esme     said nanny meekly .      i do .  magic   s there to be ruled  not for ruling .      nanny nodded and then  remembering a promise  reached down and picked up a fragment of stone from the rubble on the tunnel floor .      i thought you   d forgotten     said the ghost of the king  by her ear .   further down the passage the fool was capering after magrat .      can i see you again .     he said .      well   i don   t know     said magrat  her heart singing a smug song .      how about tonight .     said the fool .      oh  no     said magrat .     i   m very busy tonight .     she had intended to curl up with a hot milk drink and goodie whemper   s notebooks on experimental astrology  but instinct told her that any suitor should have an uphill struggle put in front of him  just to make him keener .      tomorrow night  then .     the fool persisted .      i think i should be washing my hair .         i could get friday night free .         we do a lot of work at night  you see           the afternoon  then .      magrat hesitated .  perhaps instinct had got it wrong .     well       she said .      about two o   clock .  in the meadow by the pond  all right .         well           see you there  then .  all right .     said the fool desperately .      fool .     the duchess   s voice echoed along the passage  and a look of terror crossed his face .      i   ve got to go     he said .     the meadow  ok .  i   ll wear something so you recognize me .  all right .         all right     echoed magrat  hypnotized by the sheer pressure of his persistence .  she turned and ran after the other witches .   there was pandemonium outside the castle .  the crowd that had been there at granny   s arrival had grown considerably  and had flowed in through the now unguarded gateway and lapped around the keep .  civil disobedience was new to lancre  but its inhabitants had already mastered some of its more elementary manifestations  viz  the jerking of rakes and sickles in the air with simple up and down motions accompanied by grimaces and cries of    gerrh .      although a few citizens  who hadn   t quite grasped the idea  were waving flags and cheering .  advanced students were already eyeing the more combustible buildings inside the walls .  several sellers of hot meat pies and sausages in a bun had appeared from nowhere  and were doing a brisk trade .  pretty soon someone was going to throw something .   the three witches stood at the top of the steps that led to the keep   s main door and surveyed the seas of faces .      there   s our jason     said nanny happily .     and wane and darron and kev and trev and nev           i will remember their faces     said lord felmet  emerging between them and putting a hand on their shoulders .     and do you see my archers  on the walls .         i see    em     said granny grimly .      then smile and wave     said the duke .     so that the people may know that all is well .  after all  have you not been to see me today on matters of state .      he leaned closer to granny .      yes  there are a hundred things you could do     he said .     but the ending would always be the same .     he drew back .     i   m not an unreasonable man  i hope     he added  in cheerful tones .     perhaps  if you persuade the people to be calm  i may be prevailed upon to moderate my rule somewhat .  i make no promises  of course .      granny said nothing .      smile and wave     commanded the duke .   granny raised one hand in a vague motion and produced a brief rictus that had nothing whatsoever to do with humor .  then she scowled and nudged nanny ogg  who was waving and mugging like a maniac .      no need to get carried away     she hissed .      but there   s our reet and our sharleen and their babbies     said nanny .     coo eee .         will you shut up  you daft old besom .     snapped granny .     and pull yourself together .         jolly good  well done     said the duke .  he raised his hands  or at least his hand .  the other still ached .  he   d tried the grater again last night  but it hadn   t worked .      people of lancre     he cried     do not be afeared .  i am your friend .  i will protect you from the witches .  they have agreed to leave you in peace .      granny stared at him as he spoke .  he   s one of these here maniac depressives  she said .  up and down like a wossname .  kill you one minute and ask you how you   re feeling the next .   she became aware that he was looking at her expectantly .      what .         i said  i   ll now call upon the respected granny weatherwax to say a few words  ha ha     he said .      you said that  did you .         yes .         you   ve gone a long way too far     said granny .      i have  haven   t i .     the duke giggled .   granny turned to the expectant crowds  which went silent .      go home     she said .   there was a further long silence .      is that all .     said the duke .      yes .         what about pledges of eternal allegiance .         what about them .  gytha  will you stop waving at people .         sorry .         and now we are going to go  too     said granny .      but we were getting on so well     said the duke .      come  gytha     said granny icily .     and where   s magrat got to .      magrat looked up guiltily .  she had been deep in conversation with the fool  although it was the kind of conversation where both parties spend a lot of time looking at their feet and picking at their fingernails .  ninety percent of true love is acute  ear burning embarrassment .      we   re leaving     said granny .      friday afternoon  remember     hissed the fool .      well  if i can     said magrat .   nanny ogg leered .   and so granny weatherwax swept down the steps and through the crowds  with the other two running behind her .  several of the grinning guards caught her eye and wished they hadn   t  but here and there  among the watching crowd  was a barely suppressed snigger .  she hurtled through the gateway  across the drawbridge and through the town .  granny walking fast could beat most other people at a run .   behind them the duke  who had crested the latest maniac peak on the switchback of his madness and was coasting speedily toward the watersplash of despair  laughed .      ha ha .      granny didn   t stop until she was outside the town and under the welcoming eaves of the forest .  she turned off the road and flumped down on a log  her face in her hands .   the other two approached her carefully .  magrat patted her on the back .      don   t despair     she said .     you handled it very well  we thought .         i ain   t despairing  i   m thinking     said granny .     go away .      nanny ogg raised her eyebrows at magrat in a warning fashion .  they backed off to a suitable distance although  with granny in her present mood  the next universe might not be far enough  and sat down on a moss grown stone .      are you all right .     said magrat .     they didn   t do anything  did they .         never laid a finger on me     said nanny .  she sniffed .     they   re not your real royalty     she added .     old king gruneweld  for one  he wouldn   t have wasted time waving things around and menacing people .  it   d been bang  needles right under the fingernails from the word go  and no messing .  none of this evil laughter stuff .  he was a real king .  very gracious .         he was threatening to burn you .         oh  i wouldn   t of stood for it .  i see you   ve got a follower     said nanny .      sorry .     said magrat .      the young fellow with the bells     said nanny .     and the face like a spaniel what   s just been kicked .         oh  him .     magrat blushed hotly under her pale makeup .     really  he   s just this man .  he just follows me around .         can be difficult  can that     said nanny sagely .      besides  he   s so small .  and he capers all over the place     said magrat .      looked at him carefully  have you .     said the old witch .      pardon .         you haven   t  have you .  i thought not .  he   s a very clever man  that fool .  he ought to have been one of them actor men .         what do you mean .         next time you have a look at him like a witch  not like a woman     said nanny  and gave magrat a conspiratorial nudge .     good bit of work with the door back there     she added .     coming on well  you are .  i hope you told him about greebo .         he said he   d let him out directly  nanny .      there was a snort from granny weatherwax .      did you hear the sniggering in the crowd .     she said .     someone sniggered .      nanny ogg sat down beside her .      and a couple of them pointed     she said .     i know .         it   s not to be borne .      magrat sat down on the other end of the log .      there   s other witches     she said .     there   s lots of witches further up the ramtops .  maybe they can help .      the other two looked at her in pained surprise .      i don   t think we need go that far     sniffed granny .     asking for help .         very bad practice     nodded nanny ogg .      but you asked a demon to help you     said magrat .      no  we didn   t     said granny .      right .  we didn   t .         we ordered it to assist .         s   right .      granny weatherwax stretched out her legs and looked at her boots .  they were good strong boots  with hobnails and crescent shaped scads  you couldn   t believe a cobbler had made them  someone had laid down a sole and built up from there .      i mean  there   s that witch over skund way     she said .     sister whosis  wossname  her son went off to be a sailor   you know  gytha  her who sniffs and puts them antimassacres on the backs of chairs soon as you sits down           grodley     said nanny ogg .     sticks her little finger out when she drinks her tea and drops her haitches all the time .         yes .  hwell .  i haven   t hlowered myself to talk to her hever since that business with the gibbet  you recall .  i daresay she   d just love to come snooping haround here  running her fingers over heverything and sniffling  telling us how to do things .  oh  yes .  help .  we   d all be in a fine to do if we went around helping all the time .         yes  and over skund way the trees talk to you and walk around of night     said nanny .     without even asking permission .  very poor organization .         not really good organization  like we   ve got here .     said magrat .   granny stood up purposefully .      i   m going home     she said .   there are thousands of good reasons why magic doesn   t rule the world .  they   re called witches and wizards  magrat reflected  as she followed the other two back to the road .   it was probably some wonderful organization on the part of nature to protect itself .  it saw to it that everyone with any magical talent was about as ready to cooperate as a she bear with toothache  so all that dangerous power was safely dissipated as random bickering and rivalry .  there were differences in style  of course .  wizards assassinated each other in drafty corridors  witches just cut one another dead in the street .  and they were all as self centered as a spinning top .  even when they help other people  she thought  they   re secretly doing it for themselves .  honestly  they   re just like big children .   except for me  she thought smugly .      she   s very upset  isn   t she     said magrat to nanny ogg .      ah  well     said nanny .     there   s the problem  see .  the more you get used to magic  the more you don   t want to use it .  the more it gets in your way .  i expect  when you were just starting out  you learned a few spells from goodie whemper  maysherestinpeace  and you used them all the time  didn   t you .         well  yes .  everyone does .         well known fact     agreed nanny .     but when you get along in the craft  you learn that the hardest magic is the sort you don   t use at all .      magrat considered the proposition cautiously .     this isn   t some kind of zen  is it .     she said .      dunno .  never seen one .         when we were in the dungeons  granny said something about trying the rocks .  that sounded like pretty hard magic .         well  goodie wasn   t much into rocks     said nanny .     it   s not really hard .  you just prod their memories .  you know  of the old days .  when they were hot and runny .      she hesitated  and her hand flew to her pocket .  she gripped the lump of castle stone and relaxed .      thought i   d forgotten it  for a minute     she said  lifting it out .     you can come out now .      he was barely visible in the brightness of day  a mere shimmer in the air under the trees .  king verence blinked .  he wasn   t used to daylight .      esme     said nanny .     there   s someone to see you .      granny turned slowly and squinted at the ghost .      i saw you in the dungeon  didn   t i .     she said .     who   re you .         verence  king of lancre     said the ghost  and bowed .     do i have the honor of addressing granny weatherwax  doyenne of witches .      it has already been pointed out that just because verence came from a long line of kings didn   t mean that he was basically stupid  and a year without the distractions of the flesh had done wonders as well .  granny weatherwax considered herself totally unsusceptible to buttering up  but the king was expertly applying the equivalent of the dairy surplus of quite a large country .  bowing was a particularly good touch .   a muscle twitched at the corner of granny   s mouth .  she gave a stiff little bow in return  because she wasn   t quite sure what    doyenne    meant .      i   m her     she conceded .      you can get up now     she added  regally .   king verence remained kneeling  about two inches above the actual ground .      i crave a boon     he said urgently .      here  how did you get out of the castle .     said granny .      the esteemed nanny ogg assisted me     said the king .     i reasoned  if i am anchored to the stones of lancre  then i can also go where the stones go .  i am afraid i indulged in a little trickery to arrange matters .  currently i am haunting her apron .         not the first  either     said granny  automatically .      esme .         and i beg you  granny weatherwax  to restore my son to the throne .         restore .         you know what i mean .  he is in good health .      granny nodded .     the last time we looked at him  he was eating an apple     she said .      it is his destiny to be king of lancre .         yes  well .  destiny is tricky  you know     said granny .      you will not help .      granny looked wretched .     it   s meddling  you see     she said .     it always goes wrong if you meddle in politics .  like  once you start  you can   t stop .  fundamental rule of magic  is that .  you can   t go around messing with fundamental rules .         you   re not going to help .         well   naturally  one day  when your lad is a bit older           where is he now .     said the king  coldly .   the witches avoided one another   s faces .      we saw him safe out of the country  you see     said granny awkwardly .      very good family     nanny ogg put in quickly .      what kind of people .     said the king .     not commoners  i trust .         absolutely not     said granny with considerable firmness as a vision of vitoller floated across her imagination .     not common at all .  very uncommon .  er .      her eyes implored magrat for help .      they were thespians     said magrat firmly  her voice radiating such approval that the king found himself nodding automatically .      oh     he said .     good .         were they .     whispered nanny ogg .     they didn   t look it .         don   t show your ignorance  gytha ogg     sniffed granny .  she turned back to the ghost of the king .     sorry about that  your majesty .  it   s just her showing off .  she don   t even know where thespia is .         wherever it is  i hope that they know how to school a man in the arts of war     said verence .     i know felmet .  in ten years he   ll be dug in here like a toad in a stone .      the king looked from witch to witch .     what kind of kingdom will he have to come back to .  i hear what the kingdom is becoming  even now .  will you watch it change  over the years  become shoddy and mean .     the king   s ghost faded .   his voice hung in the air  faint as a breeze .      remember  good sisters     he said     the land and the king are one .      and he vanished .   the embarrassed silence was broken by magrat blowing her nose .      one what .     said nanny ogg .      we   ve got to do something     said magrat  her voice choked with emotion .     rules or no rules .         it   s very vexing     said granny  quietly .      yes  but what are you going to do .     she said .      reflect on things     said granny .     think about it all .         you   ve been thinking about it for a year     magrat said .      one what .  are one what .     said nanny ogg .      it   s no good just reacting     said granny .     you   ve got to        a cart came bouncing and rumbling along the track from lancre .  granny ignored it .         give these things careful consideration .         you don   t know what to do  do you .     said magrat .      nonsense .  i           there   s a cart coming  granny .      granny weatherwax shrugged .     what you youngsters don   t realize       she began .   witches never bothered with elementary road safety .  such traffic as there was on the roads of lancre either went around them or  if this was not possible  waited until they moved out of the way .  granny weatherwax had grown up knowing this for a fact  the only reason she didn   t die knowing that it wasn   t was that magrat  with rather better reflexes  dragged her into the ditch .   it was an interesting ditch .  there were jiggling corkscrew things in it which were direct descendants of things which had been in the primordial soup of creation .  anyone who thought that ditchwater was dull could have spent an instructive half hour in that ditch with a powerful microscope .  it also had nettles in it  and now it had granny weatherwax .   she struggled up through the weeds  incoherent with rage  and rose from the ditch like venus anadyomene  only older and with more duckweed .      t t t     she said  pointing a shaking finger at the disappearing cart .      it was young nesheley from over inkcap way     said nanny ogg  from a nearby bush .     his family were always a bit wild .  of course  his mother was a whipple .         he ran us down .     said granny .      you could have got out of the way     said magrat .      get out of the way .     said granny .     we   re witches .  people get out of our way .     she squelched onto the track  her finger still pointing at the distant cart .     by hoki  i   ll make him wish he   d never been born           he was quite a big baby  i recall     said the bush .     his mother had a terrible time .         it   s never happened to me before  ever     said granny  still twanging like a bowstring .     i   ll teach him to run us down as though  as though  as though we was ordinary people .         he already knows     said magrat .     just help me get nanny out of this bush  will you .         i   ll turn his           people haven   t got any respect anymore  that   s what it is     said nanny  as magrat helped her with the thorns .     it   s all due to the king being one  i expect .         we   re witches .     screamed granny  turning her face toward the sky and shaking her fists .      yes  yes     said magrat .     the harmonious balance of the universe and everything .  i think nanny   s a bit tired .         what   ve i been doing all this time .     said granny  with a rhetorical flourish that would have made even vitoller gasp .      not a lot     said magrat .      laughed at .  laughed at .  on my own roads .  in my own country .     screamed granny .     that just about does it .  i   m not taking ten more years of this .  i   m not taking another day of it .      the trees around her began to sway and the dust from the road sprang up into writhing shapes that tried to swirl out of her way .  granny weatherwax extended one long arm and at the end of it unfolded one long finger and from the tip of its curving nail there was a brief flare of octarine fire .   half a mile down the track all four wheels fell off the cart at once .      lock up a witch  would he .     granny shouted at the trees .   nanny struggled to her feet .      we   d better grab her     she whispered to magrat .  the two of them leapt at granny and forced her arms down to her sides .      i   ll bloody well show him what a witch could do .     she yelled .      yes  yes  very good  very good     said nanny .     only perhaps not just now and not just like this  eh .         wyrd sisters  indeed .     granny yelled .     i   ll make his           hold her a minute  magrat     said nanny ogg  and rolled up her sleeve .      it can be like this with the highly trained ones     she said  and brought her plam around in a slap that lifted both witches off their feet .  on such a flat  final note the universe might have ended .   at the conclusion of the breathless silence which followed granny weatherwax said     thank you .      she adjusted her dress with some show of dignity  and added     but i meant it .  we   ll meet tonight at the stone and do what must be done .  ahem .      she reset the pins in her hat and set off unsteadily in the direction of her cottage .      whatever happened to the rule about not meddling in politics .     said magrat  watching her retreating back .   nanny ogg massaged some life back into her fingers .      by hoki  that woman   s got a jaw like an anvil     she said .     what was that .         i said  what about this rule about not meddling .     said magrat .      ah     said nanny .  she took the girl   s arm .     the thing is     she explained     as you progress in the craft  you   ll learn there is another rule .  esme   s obeyed it all her life .         and what   s that .         when you break rules  break    em good and hard     said nanny  and grinned a set of gums that were more menacing than teeth .     the duke smiled out over the forest .      it works     he said .     the people mutter against the witches .  how do you do it  fool .         jokes  nuncle .  and gossip .  people are halfway ready to believe it anyway .  everyone respects the witches .  the point is that no one actually likes them very much .      friday afternoon  he thought .  i   ll have to get some flowers .  and my best suit  the one with the silver bells .  oh gosh .      this is very pleasing .  if it goes on like this  fool  you shall have a knighthood .      this was no .       and the fool knew better than to let a feed line go hungry .     marry  nuncle     he said wearily  ignoring the spasm of pain that crawled across the duke   s face     if   n i had a knighthood  night hood   why  it would keep my ears warm in bedde  i   faith  if many a knight is a fool  why  should a           yes  yes  all right     snapped lord felmet .  in fact he was feeling much better already .  his porridge hadn   t been over salted this evening  and there was a decently empty feel about the castle .  there were no more voices on the cusp of hearing .   he sat down on the throne .  it felt really comfortable for the first time .   the duchess sat beside him  her chin on her hand  watching the fool intently .  this bothered him .  he thought he knew where he stood with the duke  it was just a matter of hanging on until his madness curved back to the cheerful stage  but the duchess genuinely frightened him .      it seems that words are extremely powerful     she said .      indeed  lady .         you must have made a lengthy study .      the fool nodded .  the power of words had sustained him through the hell of the guild .  wizards and witches used words as if they were tools to get things done  but the fool reckoned that words were things in their own right .      words can change the world     he said .   her eyes narrowed .      so you have said before .  i remain unconvinced .  strong men change the world     she said .     strong men and their deeds .  words are just like marzipan on a cake .  of course you think words are important .  you are weak  you have nothing else .         your ladyship is wrong .      the duchess   s fat hand drummed impatiently on the arm of her throne .      you had better     she said     be able to substantiate that comment .         lady  the duke wishes to chop down the forests  is this not so .         the trees talk about me     whispered lord felmet .     i hear them whisper when i go riding .  they tell lies about me .      the duchess and the fool exchanged glances .      but     the fool continued     this policy has met with fanatical opposition .         what .         people don   t like it .      the duchess exploded .     what does that matter .     she roared .     we rule .  they will do what we say or they will be pitilessly executed .      the fool bobbed and capered and waved his hands in a conciliatory fashion .      but  my love  we will run out of people     murmured the duke .      no need  no need .     said the fool desperately .     you don   t have to do that at all .  what you do is  you       he paused for a moment  his lips moving quickly      you embark upon a far reaching and ambitious plan to expand the agricultural industry  provide long term employment in the sawmills  open new land for development  and reduce the scope for banditry .      this time the duke looked baffled .     how will i do that .     he said .      chop down the forests .         but you said           shut up  felmet     said the duchess .  she subjected the fool to another long  thoughtful stare .      exactly how     she said  eventually     does one go about knocking over the houses of people one does not like .         urban clearance     said the fool .      i was thinking of burning them down .         hygienic urban clearance     the fool added promptly .      and sowing the ground with salt .         marry  i suspect that is hygienic urban clearance and a program of environmental improvements .  it might be a good idea to plant a few trees as well .         no more trees .     shouted felmet .      oh  it   s all right .  they won   t survive .  the important thing is to have planted them .         but i also want us to raise taxes     said the duchess .      why  nuncle           and i am not your nuncle .         n   aunt .     said the fool .      no .         why   prithee   you need to finance your ambitious program for the country .         sorry .     said the duke  who was getting lost again .      he means that chopping down trees costs money     said the duchess .  she smiled at the fool .  it was the first time he had ever seen her look at him as if he was other than a disgusting little cockroach .  there was still a large element of cockroach in her glance  but it said  good little cockroach  you have learned a trick .      intriguing     she said .     but can your words change the past .      the fool considered this .      more easily  i think     he said .     because the past is what people remember  and memories are words .  who knows how a king behaved a thousand years ago .  there is only recollection  and stories .  and plays  of course .         ah  yes .  i saw a play once     said felmet .     bunch of funny fellows in tights .  a lot of shouting .  the people liked it .         you tell me history is what people are told .     said the duchess .   the fool looked around the throne room and found king gruneberry the good           .      was he .     he said  pointing .     who knows  now .  what was he good at .  but he will be gruneberry the good until the end of the world .      the duke was leaning forward in his throne  his eyes gleaming .      i want to be a good ruler     he said .     i want people to like me .  i would like people to remember me fondly .         let us assume     said the duchess     that there were other matters  subject to controversy .  matters of historical record that had   been clouded .         i didn   t do it  you know     said the duke  quickly .     he slipped and fell .  that was it .  slipped and fell .  i wasn   t even there .  he attacked me .  it was self defense .     his voice fell to a mumble .     i have no recollection of it at this time     he murmured .  he rubbed his dagger hand  although the word was becoming inappropriate .      be quiet  husband     snapped the duchess .     i know you didn   t do it .  i wasn   t there with you  you may recall .  it was i who didn   t hand you the dagger .     the duke shuddered again .      and now  fool     said lady felmet .     i was saying  i believe  that perhaps there are matters that should be properly recorded .         marry  that you were not there at the time .     said the fool  brightly .   it is true that words have power  and one of the things they are able to do is get out of someone   s mouth before the speaker has the chance to stop them .  if words were sweet little lambs  then the fool watched them bound cheerfully away into the flame thrower of the duchess   s glare .      not where .     she said .      anywhere     said the fool hastily .      stupid man .  everyone is somewhere .         i mean  you were everywhere but at the top of the stairs     said the fool .      which stairs .         any stairs     said the fool  who was beginning to sweat .     i distinctly remember not seeing you .      the duchess eyed him for a while .      so long as you remember it     she said .  the duchess rubbed her chin  which made an audible rasping noise .      reality is only weak words  you say .  therefore  words are reality .  but how can words become history .         it was a very good play  the play that i saw     said felmet dreamily .     there were fights  and no one really died .  some very good speeches  i thought .      there was another sandpapery sound from the duchess .      fool .     she said .      lady .         can you write a play .  a play that will go around the world  a play that will be remembered long after rumor has died .         no  lady .  it is a special talent .         but can you find someone who has it .         there are such people  lady .         find one     murmured the duke .     find the best .  find the best .  the truth will out .  find one .        the storm was resting .  it didn   t want to be  but it was .  it had spent a fortnight understudying a famous anticyclone over the circle sea  turning up every day  hanging around in the cold front  grateful for a chance to uproot the occasional tree or whirl a farmhouse to any available emerald city of its choice .  but the big break in the weather had never come .   it consoled itself with the thought that even the really great storms of the past   the great gale of       for example  of hurricane zelda and her amazing raining frogs   had gone through this sort of thing at some stage in their career .  it was just part of the great tradition of the weather .   besides  it had had a good stretch in the equivalent of pantomime down on the plains  bringing seasonal snow and terminal frostbite to millions .  it just had to be philosophical about being back up here now with nothing much to do except wave the heather about .  if weather was people  this storm would be filling in time wearing a cardboard hat in a hamburger hell .   currently it was observing three figures moving slowly over the moor  converging with some determination on a bare patch where the standing stone stood  or usually stood  though just at the moment it wasn   t visible .   it recognized them as old friends and connoisseurs  and conjured up a brief unseasonal roll of thunder as a form of greeting .  this was totally ignored .      the bloody stone   s gone     said granny weatherwax .     however many there is of it .      her face was pale .  it might also have been drawn  if so  then it was by a very neurotic artist .  she looked as though she meant business .  bad business .      light the fire  magrat     she added automatically .      i daresay we   ll all feel better for a cup of tea     said nanny ogg  mouthing the words like a mantra .  she fumbled in the recesses of her shawl .     with something in it     she added  producing a small bottle of applejack .      alcohol is a deceiver and tarnishes the soul     said magrat virtuously .      i never touch the stuff     said granny weatherwax .     we should keep a clear head  gytha .         just a drop in your tea isn   t drinking     said nanny .     it   s medicine .  it   s a chilly old wind up here  sisters .         very well     said granny .     but just a drop .      they drank in silence .  eventually granny said     well  magrat .  you know all about the coven business .  we might as well do it right .  what do we do next .      magrat hesitated .  she wasn   t up to suggesting dancing naked .      there   s a song     she said .     in praise of the full moon .         it ain   t full     granny pointed out .     it   s wossname .  bulging .         gibbous     said nanny obligingly .      i think it   s in praise of full moons in general     magrat hazarded .     and then we have to raise our consciousness .  it really ought to be full moon for that  i   m afraid .  moons are very important .      granny gave her a long  calculating look .      that   s modern witchcraft for you  is it .     she said .      it   s part of it  granny .  there   s a lot more .      granny weatherwax sighed .     each to her own  i suppose .  i   m blowed if i   ll let a ball of shiny rock tell me what to do .         yes  bugger all that     said nanny .     let   s curse somebody .        the fool crept cautiously along the nighttime corridors .  he wasn   t taking any chances either .  magrat had given him a graphic account of greebo   s general disposition  and the fool had borrowed a couple of gloves and a sort of metal wimple from the castle   s store of hereditary chain mail .   he reached the lumber room  lifted the latch cautiously  pushed the door and then flung himself against the wall .   the corridor became slightly darker as the more intense darkness inside the room spilled out and mingled with the rather lighter darkness already there .   apart from that  nothing .  the number of spitting  enraged balls of murderous fur pouring through the door was zero .  the fool relaxed  and slipped inside .   greebo dropped on his head .   it had been a long day .  the room did not offer the kind of full life that greebo had come to expect and demand .  the only point of interest had been the discovery  around mid morning  of a colony of mice who had spent generations eating their way through a priceless tapestry history of lancre and had just got as far as king murune            who met a terrible fate   when they did  too .  he had sharpened his claws on a bust of lancre   s only royal vampire  queen grimnir the impaler                                             and            .  he had performed his morning ablutions on a portrait of an unknown monarch  which was beginning to dissolve .  now he was bored  and also angry .   he raked his claws across the place where the fool   s ears should have been  and was rewarded with nothing more than a metallic scraping noise .      who   s a good boy  den .     said the fool .     wowsa wowsa whoosh .      this intrigued greebo .  the only other person who had ever spoken to him like this was nanny ogg  everyone else addressed him as    yarrgeroffoutofityahbarstard .     he leaned down very carefully  intrigued by the new experience .   from the fool   s point of view an upside down cat face lowered itself slowly into his field of vision  wearing an expression of evil eyed interest .      does oo want to go home  den .     said the fool hopefully .     look  mr .  door is open .      greebo increased his grip .  he had found a friend .   the fool shrugged  very carefully  turned  and walked back into the passage .  he made his way down through the hall  out into the courtyard  around the side of the guardroom and out through the main gate  nodding   carefully   to the guards .      man just went past with a cat on his head     one of them remarked  after a minute or two   s reflection .      see who it was .         the fool  i think .      there was a thoughtful pause .  the second guard shifted his grip on his halberd .      it   s a rotten job     he said .     but i suppose someone   s got to do it .           we ain   t going to curse anyone     said granny firmly .     it hardly ever works if they don   t know you   ve done it .         what you do is  you send him a doll of himself with pins in .         no  gytha .         all you have to do is get hold of some of his toenails     nanny persisted  enthusiastically .      no .         or some of his hair or anything .  i   ve got some pins .         no .         cursing people is morally unsound and extremely bad for your karma     said magrat .      well  i   m going to curse him anyway     said nanny .     under my breath  like .  i could of caught my death in that dungeon for all he cared .         we ain   t going to curse him     said granny .     we   re going to replace him .  what did you do with the old king .         i left the rock on the kitchen table     said nanny .     i couldn   t stand it anymore .         i don   t see why     said magrat .     he seemed very pleasant .  for a ghost .         oh  he was all right .  it was the other     said nanny .      others .            pray carry a stone out of the palace so   s i can haunt it  good mother     he says     said nanny ogg .        it   s bloody boring in here  mistress ogg  excuse my klatchian     he says  so of course i did .  i reckon they was all listening .  ho yes  they all thinks  all aboard  time for a bit of a holiday .  i   ve nothing against ghosts .  especially royal ghosts     she added loyally .     but my cottage isn   t the place for them .  i mean  there   s some woman in a chariot yelling her head off in the washhouse .  i ask you .  and there   s a couple of little kiddies in the pantry  and men without heads all over the place  and someone screaming under the sink  and there   s this little hairy man wandering around looking lost and everything .  it   s not right .         just so long as he   s not here     said granny .     we don   t want any men around .         he   s a ghost  not a man     said magrat .      we don   t have to go into details     granny said icily .      but you can   t put the old king back on the throne     said magrat .     ghosts can   t rule .  you   d never get the crown to stay on .  it   d drop through .         we   re going to replace him with his son     said granny .     proper succession .         oh  we   ve been through all that     said nanny  dismissively .     in about fifteen years    time  perhaps  but           tonight     said granny .      a child on the throne .  he wouldn   t last five minutes .         not a child     said granny quietly .     a grown man .  remember aliss demurrage .      there was silence .  then nanny ogg sat back .      bloody hell     she whispered .     you ain   t going to try that  are you .         i mean to have a go .         bloody hell     said nanny again  very quietly  and added     you   ve been thinking about this  have you .         yes .         see here  esme .  i mean  black aliss was one of the best .  i mean  you   re very good at  well  headology and thinking and that .  i mean  black aliss  well  she just upped and went at it .         you saying i couldn   t do it  are you .         excuse me     said magrat .      no .  no .  of course not     said nanny  ignoring her .      right .         only   well  she was a  you know  a hoyden of witches  like the king said .         doyenne     said granny  who had looked it up .     not hoyden .         excuse me     said magrat  louder this time .     who was black aliss .  and     she added quickly     none of this exchanging meaningful glances and talking over my head .  there   s three witches in this coven  remember .         she was before your time     said nanny ogg .     before mine  really .  she lived over skund way .  very powerful witch .         if you listen to rumor     said granny .      she turned a pumpkin into a royal coach once     said nanny .      showy     said granny weatherwax .     that   s no help to anyone  turning up at a ball smelling like a pie .  and that business with the glass slipper .  dangerous  to my mind .         but the biggest thing she ever did     said nanny  ignoring the interruption     was to send a whole palace to sleep for a hundred years until       she hesitated .     can   t remember .  was there rose bushes involved  or was it spinning wheels in that one .  i think some princess had to finger   no  there was a prince .  that was it .         finger a prince .     said magrat  uneasily .      no   he had to kiss her .  very romantic  black aliss was .  there was always a bit of romance in her spells .  she liked nothing better than girl meets frog .         why did they call her black aliss .         fingernails     said granny .      and teeth     said nanny ogg .     she had a sweet tooth .  lived in a real gingerbread cottage .  couple of kids shoved her in her own oven at the end .  shocking .         and you   re going to send the castle to sleep .     said magrat .      she never sent the castle to sleep     said granny .     that   s just an old wives    tale     she added  glaring at nanny .     she just stirred up time a little .  it   s not as hard as people think .  everyone does it all the time .  it   s like rubber  is time .  you can stretch it to suit yourself .      magrat was about to say  that   s not right  time is time  every second lasts a second  that   s what it   s for  that   s its job     and then she recalled weeks that had flown past and afternoons that had lasted forever .  some minutes had lasted hours  some hours had gone past so quickly she hadn   t been aware they   d gone past at all        but that   s just people   s perception     she said .     isn   t it .         oh  yes     said granny     of course it is .  it all is .  what difference does that make .         a hundred years   d be over egging it  mind     said nanny .      i reckon fifteen   d be a nice around number     said granny .     that means the lad will be eighteen at the finish .  we just do the spell  go and fetch him  he can manifest his destiny  and everything will be nice and neat .      magrat didn   t comment on this  because it had occurred to her that destinies sounded easy enough when you talked about them but were never very bankable where real human beings were concerned .  but nanny ogg sat back and tipped another generous measure of apple brandy in her tea .      could work out nice     she said .     a bit of peace and quiet for fifteen years .  if i recall the spell  after you say it you have to fly around the castle before cock crow .         i wasn   t thinking about that     said granny .     it wouldn   t be right .  felmet would still be king all that time .  the kingdom would still get sick .  no  what i was thinking of doing was moving the whole kingdom .      she beamed at them .      the whole of lancre .     said nanny .      yes .         fifteen years into the future .         yes .      nanny looked at granny   s broomstick .  it was a well made thing  built to last  apart from the occasional starting problem .  but there were limits .      you   ll never do it     she said .     not around the whole kingdom in that .  that   s all the way up to powderknife and down to drumlin   s fell .  you just couldn   t carry enough magic .         i   ve thought of that     said granny .   she beamed again .  it was terrifying .   she explained the plan .  it was dreadful .   a minute later the moor was deserted  as the witches hurried to their tasks .  it was silent for a while  apart from the squeak of bats and the occasional rustle of the wind in the heather .   then there was a bubbling from the nearby peat bog .  very slowly  crowned with a thicket of sphagnum moss  the standing stone surfaced and peered around the landscape with an air of deep distrust .     greebo was really enjoying this .  at first he thought his new friend was taking him to magrat   s cottage  but for some reason he   d wandered off the path in the dark and was taking a stroll in the forest .  in one of the more interesting bits  greebo had always felt .  it was a hummocky area  rich in hidden potholes and small  intense swamps  full of mist even in fine weather .  greebo often came up here on the offchance that a wolf was lying up for the day .      i thought cats could find their own way home     the fool muttered .   he cursed himself under his breath .  it would have been easy to take this wretched creature back to nanny ogg   s house  which was only a few streets away  almost in the shadow of the castle .  but then he   d had the idea of delivering it to magrat .  it would impress her  he thought .  witches were very keen on cats .  and then she   d be bound to ask him in  for a cup of tea or something     he put his foot in another water filled hole .  something wriggled underneath it .  the fool groaned  and stepped back onto a tumescent mushroom .      look  cat     he said .     you   ve got to come down  right .  and then you can find your way home and i   ll follow you .  cats are good at seeing in the dark and finding their own way home     he added hopefully .   he reached up .  greebo sank his claws into his arm as a friendly warning  and found to his surprise that this had no effect on chain mail .      there   s a good cat     said the fool  and lowered him to the ground .     go on  find your way home .  any home will do .      greebo   s grin gradually faded  until there was nothing left but the cat .  this was nearly as spooky as the opposite way around .   he stretched and yawned to hide his embarrassment .  being called a good cat in the middle of one of his favorite stalking grounds wasn   t going to do anything for his prowl credibility .  he disappeared into the undergrowth .   the fool peered into the gloom .  it dawned on him that while he liked forests  he liked them at one remove  as it were  it was nice to know that they were there  but the forests of the mind were not quite the same as real forests that  for example  you got lost in .  they had more mighty oaks and fewer brambles .  they also tended to be viewed in daylight  and the trees didn   t have malevolent faces and long scratchy branches .  the trees of the imagination were proud giants of the forest .  most of the trees here appeared to be vegetable gnomes  mere trellises for fungi and ivy .   the fool was vaguely aware that you could tell which direction the hub lay by seeing which side of the trees the moss grew on .  a quick inspection of the nearby trunks indicated that  in defiance of all normal geography  the hub lay everywhere .   greebo had vanished .   the fool sighed  removed his chain mail protection  and tinkled gently through the night in search of high ground .  high ground seemed a good idea .  the ground he was on at the moment appeared to be trembling .  he was sure it shouldn   t do that .     magrat hovered on her broomstick several hundred feet above the turnwise borders of lancre  looking down on a sea of mist through which the occasional treetop poked like a seaweed covered rock at high tide .  a bulging moon floated above her  probably gibbous again .  even a decent thin crescent would have been better  she felt .  more appropriate .   she shivered  and wondered where granny weatherwax was at this moment .   the old witch   s broomstick was known and feared throughout the skies of lancre .  granny had been introduced to flying quite late in life  and after some initial suspicion had taken to it like a bluebottle to an ancient fish head .  a problem  however  was that granny saw every flight simply as a straight line from a to b and was unable to get alongside the idea that other users of the air might have any rights whatsoever  the flight migration patterns of an entire continent had been changed because of that simple fact .  high speed evolution among local birds had developed a generation that flew on their backs  so that they could keep a watchful eye on the skies .   granny   s implicit belief that everything should get out of her way extended to other witches  very tall trees and  on occasion  mountains .   granny had also browbeaten the dwarfs who lived under the mountains and in fear of their lives into speeding the thing up .  many an egg had been laid in midair by unsuspecting fowls who had suddenly glimpsed granny bearing down on them  scowling over the top of the broomstick .      oh dear     thought magrat .     i hope she hasn   t happened to someone .      a midnight breeze turned her gently around in the air  like an unsupported weathercock .  she shivered and squinted at the moonlit mountains  the high ramtops  whose freezing crags and ice green chasms acknowledged no king or cartographer .  only on the rimward side was lancre open to the world  the rest of its borders looked as jagged as a wolf   s mouth and far more impassable .  from up here it was possible to see the whole kingdom     there was a ripping noise in the sky above her  a blast of wind that spun her around again  and a doppler distorted cry of     stop dreaming  girl .      she gripped the bristles with her knees and urged the stick upward .   it took several minutes to catch up with granny  who was lying almost full length along her broomstick to reduce wind resistance .  dark treetops roared far below them as magrat came alongside .  granny turned to her  holding her hat on with one hand .      not before time     she snapped .     i don   t reckon this one   s got more   n a few minutes flight left .  come on  get a move on .      she reached out a hand .  so did magrat .  unsteadily  the broomsticks bucking and dipping in one another   s slipstream  they touched fingertips .   magrat   s arm tingled as the power flowed up it .   granny   s broomstick jerked forward .      leave me a bit     shouted magrat .     i   ve got to get down .         shouldn   t be difficult     screamed granny  above the noise of the wind .      i mean get down safely .         you   re a witch  ain   t you .  by the way  did you bring the cocoa .  i   m freezing up here .      magrat nodded desperately  and with her spare hand passed up a straw bag .      right     said granny .     well done .  see you at lancre bridge .      she uncurled her fingers .   magrat whirled away in the buffeting wind  clinging tightly to a broomstick which now  she feared  had about as much buoyancy as a bit of firewood .  it certainly wasn   t capable of sustaining a full grown woman against the beckoning fingers of gravity .   as she plunged down toward the forest roof in a long shallow dive she reflected that there was possibly something complimentary in the way granny weatherwax resolutely refused to consider other people   s problems .  it implied that  in her considerable opinion  they were quite capable of sorting them out by themselves .   some kind of change spell was probably in order .   magrat concentrated .   well  that seemed to work .   nothing in the sight of mortal man had in fact changed .  what magrat had achieved was a mere adjustment of the mental processes  from a bewildered and slightly frightened woman gliding inexorably toward the inhospitable ground to a clearheaded  optimistic and positive thinking woman who had really got it together  was taking full responsibility for her own life and in general knew where she was coming from although  unfortunately  where she was heading had not changed in any way .  but she felt a lot better about it .   she dug her heels in and forced the broomstick to yield the last dregs of its power in a brief burst  sending it skimming erratically a few feet from the trees .  as it sagged again and started to plow a furrow among the midnight leaves she tensed herself  prayed to whatever gods of the forest might be listening that she would land on something soft  and let go .   there are three thousand known major gods on the disc  and research theologians discover more every week .  apart from the minor gods of rock  tree and water  there are two that haunt the ramtops   hoki  half a man  half a goat  and entirely a bad practical joker  who was banished from dunmanifestin for pulling the old exploding mistletoe joke on blind io  chief of all the gods  and also herne the hunted  the terrified and apprehensive deity of all small furry creatures whose destiny it is to end their lives as a brief  crunchy squeak     either could have been candidates for the small miracle which then occurred  for   in a forest full of cold rocks  jagged stumps and thorn bushes   magrat landed on something soft .   granny  meanwhile  was accelerating toward the mountains on the second leg of the journey .  she consumed the regrettably tepid cocoa and  with proper environmental consideration  dropped the bottle as she passed over an upland lake .   it turned out that magrat   s idea of sustaining food was two rounds of egg and cress sandwiches with the crusts cut off and  granny noticed before the wind whipped it away  a small piece of parsley placed with consideration and care on top of each one .  granny regarded them for some time .  then she ate them .   a chasm loomed  still choked with winter snow .  like a tiny spark in the darkness  a dot of light against the hugeness of the ramtops  granny tackled the maze of the mountains .   back in the forest  magrat sat up and absent mindedly pulled a twig from her hair .  a few yards away the broomstick dropped through the trees  showering leaves .   a groan and a small  half hearted tinkle caused her to peer into the gloom .  an indistinct figure was on its hands and knees  searching for something .      did i land on you .     said magrat .      someone did     said the fool .   they crawled nearer to one another .      you .         you .         what are you doing here .         marry  i was walking along the ground     said the fool .     a lot of people do  you know .  i mean  i know it   s been done before .  it   s not original .  it probably lacks imagination but  well  it   s always been good enough for me .         did i hurt you .         i think i   ve got one or two bells that won   t be the same again .      the fool scrabbled through the leafmould  and finally located his hated hat .  it clonked .      totally crushed  i   faith     he said  putting it on anyway .  he seemed to feel better for that  and went on     rain  yes  hail  yes  even lumps of rock .  fish and small frogs  ok .  women no  up till now .  is it going to happen again .         you   ve got a bloody hard head     said magrat  pulling herself to her feet .      modesty forbids me to comment     said the fool  and then remembered himself and added  quickly     prithee .      they stared at one another again  their minds racing .   magrat thought  nanny said look at him properly .  i   m looking at him .  he just looks the same .  a sad thin little man in a ridiculous jester   s outfit  he   s practically a hunchback .   then  in the same way that a few random bulges in a cloud can suddenly become a galleon or a whale in the eye of the beholder  magrat realized that the fool was not a little man .  he was at least of average height  but he made himself small  by hunching his shoulders  bandying his legs and walking in a half crouch that made him appear as though he was capering on the spot .   i wonder what else gytha ogg noticed .  she thought  intrigued .   he rubbed his arm and gave her a lopsided grin .      i suppose you haven   t got any idea where we are .     he said .      witches never get lost     said magrat firmly .     although they can become temporarily mislaid .  lancre   s over that way  i think .  i   ve got to find a hill  if you   ll excuse me .         to see where you are .         to see when  i think .  there   s a lot of magic going on tonight .         is there .  then i think i   ll accompany you     the fool added chivalrously  after peering cautiously into the tree haunted gloom that apparently lay between him and his flagstones .     i wouldn   t want anything to happen to you .      granny lay low over the broomstick as it plunged through the trackless chasms of the mountains  leaning from side to side in the hope that this might have some effect on the steering which seemed  strangely  to be getting worse .  falling snow behind her was whipped and spiraled into odd shapes by the wind of her passage .  rearing waves of crusted snow  poised all winter over the glacial valleys  trembled and then began the long  silent fall .  her flight was punctuated by the occasional boom of an avalanche .   she looked down at a landscape of sudden death and jagged beauty  and knew it was looking back at her  as a dozing man may watch a mosquito .  she wondered if it realized what she was doing .  she wondered if it   d make her fall any softer  and mentally scolded herself for such softness .  no  the land wasn   t like that .  it didn   t bargain .  the land gave hard  and took hard .  a dog always bit deepest on the veterinary hand .   and then she was through  vaulting so low over the last peak that one of her boots filled with snow  and barrelling down toward the lowlands .   the mist  never far away in the mountains  was back again  but this time it was making a fight of it and had become a thick  silver sea in front of her .  she groaned .   somewhere in the middle of it nanny ogg floated  taking the occasional pull from a hip flask as a preventative against the chill .   and thus it was that granny  her hat and iron gray hair dripping with moisture  her boots shedding lumps of ice  heard the distant and muffled sound of a voice enthusiastically explaining to the invisible sky that the hedgehog had less to worry over than just about any other mammal .  like a hawk that has spotted something small and fluffy in the grass  like a wandering interstellar flu germ that has just seen a nice blue planet drifting by  granny turned the stick and plunged down through the choking billows .      come on .     she screamed  drunk with speed and exhilaration  and the sound from five hundred feet overhead put a passing wolf severely off its supper .     this minute  gytha ogg .      nanny ogg caught her hand with considerable reluctance and the pair of broomsticks swept up again and into the clear  starlit sky .   the disc  as always  gave the impression that the creator has designed it specifically to be looked at from above .  streamers of cloud in white and silver stretched away to the rim  stirred into thousand mile swirls by the turning of the world .  behind the speeding brooms the sullen roof of the fog was dragged up into a curling tunnel of white vapor  so that the watching gods   and they were certainly watching   could see the terrible flight as a furrow in the sky .   a thousand feet and rising fast into the frosty air  the two witches were bickering again .      it was a bloody stupid idea     moaned nanny .     i never liked heights .         did you bring something to drink .         certainly .  you said .         well .         i drank it  didn   t i     said nanny .     sitting around up there at my age .  our jason would have a fit .      granny gritted her teeth .     well  let   s have the power     she said .     i   m running out of up .  amazing how        granny   s voice ended in a scream as  without any warning at all  her broomstick pinwheeled sharply across the clouds and dropped from sight .     the fool and magrat sat on a log on a small outcrop that looked out across the forest .  the lights of lancre town were in fact not very far away  but neither of them had suggested leaving .   the air between them crackled with unspoken thoughts and wild surmisings .      you   ve been a fool long .     said magrat  politely .  she blushed in the darkness .  in that atmosphere it sounded the most impolite of questions .      all my life     said the fool bitterly .     i cut my teeth on a set of bells .         i suppose it gets handed on  from father to son .     said magrat .      i never saw much of my father .  he went off to be fool for the lords of quirm when i was small     said the fool .     had a row with my grandad .  he comes back from time to time  to see my mam .         i never saw much of my father .  he went off to be fool for the lords of quirm when i was small     said the fool .     had a row with my grandad .  he comes back from time to time  to see my mam .         that   s terrible .      there was a sad jingle as the fool shrugged .  he vaguely recalled his father as a short  friendly little man  with eyes like a couple of oysters .  doing something as brave as standing up to the old boy must have been quite outside his nature .  the sound of two suits of bells shaken in anger still haunted his memory  which was full enough of bad scenes as it was .      still     said magrat  her voice higher than usual and with a vibrato of uncertainty     it must be a happy life .  making people laugh  i mean .      when there was no reply she turned to look at the man .  his face was like stone .  in a low voice  talking as though she was not there  the fool spoke .   he spoke of the guild of fools and joculators in ankh morpork .   most visitors mistook it at first sight for the offices of the guild of assassins  which in fact was the rather pleasant  airy collection of buildings next door  the assassins always had plenty of money   sometimes the young fools  slaving at their rote in rooms that were always freezing  even in high summer  heard the young assassins at play over the wall and envied them  even though  of course  the number of piping voices grew noticeably fewer toward the end of them  the assassins also believed in competitive examination  .   in fact all sorts of sounds managed to breach the high grim windowless walls  and from keen questioning of servants the younger fools picked up a vision of the city beyond .  there were taverns out there  and parks .  there was a whole bustling world  in which the students and apprentices of the various guilds and colleges took a full ripe part  either by playing tricks on it  running through it shouting  or throwing parts of it up .  there was laughter which paid no attention to the five cadences or twelve inflections .  and   although the students debated this news in the dormitories at night   there was apparently unauthorized humor  delivered freestyle  with no reference to the monster fun book or the council or anyone .   out there  beyond the stained stonework  people were telling jokes without reference to the lords of misrule .   it was a sobering thought .  well  not a sobering thought in actual fact  because alcohol wasn   t allowed in the guild .  but if it was  it would have been .   there was nowhere more sober than the guild .   the fool spoke bitterly of the huge  redfaced brother prankster  of evenings learning the merry jests  of long mornings in the freezing gymnasium learning the eighteen pratfalls and the accepted trajectory for a custard pie .  and juggling .  juggling .  brother jape  a man with a soul like cold boiled string  taught juggling .  it wasn   t that the fool was bad at juggling that reduced him to incoherent fury .  fools were expected to be bad at juggling  especially if juggling inherently funny items like custard pies  flaming torches or extremely sharp cleavers .  what had brother jape laying about him in red hot  clanging rage was the fact that the fool was bad at juggling because he wasn   t any good at it .      didn   t you want to be anything else .     said magrat .      what else is there .     said the fool .     i haven   t seen anything else i could be .      student fools were allowed out  in the last year of training  but under a fearsome set of restrictions .  capering miserably through the streets he   d seen wizards for the first time  moving like dignified carnival floats .  he   d seen the surviving assassins  foppish  giggling young men in black silk  as sharp as knives underneath  he   d seen priests  their fantastic costumes only slightly marred by the long rubber sacrificial aprons they wore for major services .  every trade and profession had its costume  he saw  and he realized for the first time that the uniform he was wearing had been carefully and meticulously designed for no other purpose than making its wearer look like a complete and utter pillock .   even so  he   d persevered .  he   d spent his whole life persevering .   he persevered precisely because he had absolutely no talent  and because grandfather would have flayed him alive if he didn   t .  he memorized the authorized jokes until his head rang  and got up even earlier in the morning to juggle until his elbows creaked .  he had perfected his grasp of the comic vocabulary until only the very senior lords could understand him .  he   d capered and clowned with an impenetrable grim determination and he   d graduated top of his year and had been awarded the bladder of honor .  he   d dropped it down the privy when he came home .   magrat was silent .   the fool said     how did you get to be a witch .         um .         i mean  did you go to a school or something .         oh .  no .  goodie whemper just walked down to the village one day  got all us girls lined up  and chose me .  you don   t choose the craft  you see .  it chooses you .         yes  but when do you actually become a witch .         when the other witches treat you as one  i suppose .     magrat sighed .     if they ever do     she added .     i thought they would after i did that spell in the corridor .  it was pretty good  after all .         marry     twas a rite of passage     said the fool  unable to stop himself .  magrat gave him a blank look .  he coughed .      the other witches being those two old ladies .     he said  relapsing into his usual gloom .      yes .         very strong characters  i imagine .         very     said magrat  with feeling .      i wonder if they ever met my grandad     said the fool .   magrat looked at her feet .      they   re quite nice really     she said .     it   s just that  well  when you   re a witch you don   t think about other people .  i mean  you think about them  but you don   t actually think about their feelings  if you see what i mean .  at least  not unless you think about it .     she looked at her feet again .      you   re not like that     said the fool .      look  i wish you   d stop working for the duke     said magrat desperately .     you know what he   s like .  torturing people and setting fire to their cottages and everything .         but i   m his fool     said the fool .     a fool has to be loyal to his master .  right up until he dies .  i   m afraid it   s tradition .  tradition is very important .         but you don   t even like being a fool .         i hate it .  but that   s got nothing to do with it .  if i   ve got to be a fool  i   ll do it properly .         that   s really stupid     said magrat .      foolish  i   d prefer .      the fool had been edging along the log .     if i kiss you     he added carefully     do i turn into a frog .      magrat looked down at her feet again .  they shuffled themselves under her dress  embarrassed at all this attention .   she could sense the shades of gytha ogg and esme weatherwax on either side of her .  granny   s specter glared at her .  a witch is master of every situation  it said .   mistress  said the vision of nanny ogg  and made a brief gesture involving much grinning and waving of forearms .      we shall have to see     she said .   it was destined to be the most impressive kiss in the history of foreplay .   time  as granny weatherwax had pointed out  is a subjective experience .  the fool   s years in the guild had been an eternity whereas the hours with magrat on the hilltop passed like a couple of minutes .  and  high above lancre  a double handful of seconds extended like taffy into hours of screaming terror .      ice .     screamed granny .     it   s iced up .      nanny ogg came alongside  trying vainly to match courses with the tumbling  bucking broomstick .  octarine fire crackled over the frozen bristles  shorting them out at random .  she leaned over and snatched a handful of granny   s skirt .      i tole you it was daft .     she shouted .     you went all through all that wet mist and then up into the cold air  you daft besom .         you let go of my skirt  gytha ogg .         come on  grab hold o   mine .  you   re on fire at the back there .      they shot through the bottom of the cloud bank and screamed in unison as the shrub covered ground emerged from nowhere and aimed itself directly at them .   and went past .   nanny looked down a black perspective at the bottom of which a boil of white water was dimly visible .  they had flown over the edge of lancre gorge .   blue smoke was pouring out of granny   s broomstick but she hung on  determined  and forced it around .      what the hell you doing .     roared nanny .      i can follow the river     granny weatherwax screamed  above the crackle of flames .     don   t you worry .         you come aboard  d   you hear .  it   s all over  you can   t do it        there was a small explosion behind granny and several handfuls of burning bristles broke off and whirled away into the booming depths of the gorge .  her stick jerked sideways and nanny grabbed her around the shoulders as a gout of fire snapped another binding .   the blazing broomstick shot from between her legs  twisted in the air  and went straight upward  trailing sparks and making a noise like a wet finger dragged around the top of a wineglass .   this left nanny flying upside down  supporting granny weatherwax at arm   s length .  they stared into one another   s face and screamed .      i can   t pull you up .         well i can   t climb up  can i .  act your age  gytha .      nanny considered this .  then she let go .   three marriages and an adventurous girlhood had left nanny ogg with thigh muscles that could crack coconuts  and the g forces sucked at her as she forced the speeding stick down and around in a tight loop .   ahead of her she made out granny weatherwax dropping like a stone  one hand clutching her hat  the other trying to prevent gravity from seeing up her skirts .  she urged the stick forward until it creaked  snatched the falling witch around the waist  fought the plunging stick back up to level flight  and sagged .   the subsequent silence was broken by granny weatherwax saying     don   t you ever do that again  gytha ogg .         i promise .         now turn us around .  we   re heading for lancre bridge  remember .      nanny obediently turned the broomstick  brushing the canyon walls as she did so .      it   s still miles to go     she said .      i mean to do it     said granny .     there   s plenty of night left .         not enough  i   m thinking .         a witch doesn   t know the meaning of the word    failure     gytha .      they shot up into the clear air again .  the horizon was a line of golden light as the slow dawn of the disc sped across the land  bulldozing the suburbs of the night .      esme .     said nanny ogg  after a while .      what .         it means    lack of success .         they flew in chilly silence for several seconds .      i was speaking wossname .  figuratively     said granny .      oh .  well .  you should of said .      the line of light was bigger  brighter .  for the first time a flicker of doubt invaded granny weatherwax   s mind  puzzled to find itself in such unfamiliar surroundings .      i wonder how many cockerels there are in lancre .     she said quietly .      was that one of them wossname questions .         i was just wondering .      nanny ogg sat back .  there were thirty two of crowing age  she knew .  she knew because she   d worked it out last night   tonight   and had given jason his instructions .  she had fifteen grown up children and innumerable grandchildren and great grandchildren  and they   d had most of the evening to get into position .  it should be enough .      did you hear that .     said granny .     over razorback way .      nanny looked innocently across the misty landscape .  sound traveled very clearly in these early hours .      what .     she said .      sort of an    urk    noise .         no .      granny spun around .      over there     she said .     i definitely heard it this time .  something like    cock a doo arrgh .            can   t say i did  esme     said nanny  smiling at the sky .     lancre bridge up ahead .         and over there .  right down there .  it was a definite squawk .         dawn chorus  esme  i expect .  look  only half a mile to go .      granny glared at the back of her colleague   s head .      there   s something going on here     she said .      search me  esme .         your shoulders are shaking .         lost my shawl back there .  i   m a bit chilly .  look  we   re nearly there .      granny glared ahead  her mind a maze of suspicions .  she was going to get to the bottom of this .  when she had time .   the damp logs of lancre   s main link to the outside world drifted gently underneath them .  from the chicken farm half a mile away came a chorus of strangled squawks and a thud .      and that .  what was that  then .     demanded granny .      fowl pest .  careful  i   m bringing us down .         are you laughing at me .         just pleased for you  esme .  you   ll go down in history for this  you know .      they drifted between the timbers of the bridge .  granny weatherwax alighted cautiously on the greasy planking and adjusted her dress .      yes .  well     she added  nonchalantly .      better than black aliss  everyone   ll say     nanny ogg went on .      some people will say anything     said granny .  she peered over the parapet at the foaming torrent far below  and then up at the distant outcrop on which stood lancre castle .      do you think they will .     she added  nonchalantly .      mark my words .         hmm .         but you   ve got to complete the spell  mind .      granny weatherwax nodded .  she turned to face the dawn  raised her arms  and completed the spell .     it is almost impossible to convey the sudden passage of fifteen years and two months in words .   it   s a lot easier in pictures  when you just use a calendar with lots of pages blowing off  or a clock with hands moving faster and faster until they blur  or trees bursting into blossom and fruiting in a matter of seconds     well  you know .  or the sun becomes a fiery streak across the sky  and days and nights flicker past jerkily like a bad zoetrope  and the fashions visible in the clothes shop across the road whip on and off faster than a lunchtime stripper with five pubs to do .   there are any amount of ways  but they won   t be required because  in fact  none of this happened .   the sun did jerk sideways a bit  and it seemed that the trees on the rimward side of the gorge were rather taller  and nanny couldn   t shake off the sensation that someone had just sat down heavily on her  squashed her flat  and then opened her out again .   this was because the kingdom did not  in so many words  move through time in the normal flickering sky  high speed photography sense of the word .  it moved around it  which is much cleaner  considerably easier to achieve  and saves all that traveling around trying to find a laboratory opposite a dress shop that will keep the same dummy in the window for sixty years  which has traditionally been the most time consuming and expensive bit of the whole business .     the kiss lasted more than fifteen years .   not even frogs can manage that .   the fool drew back  his eyes glazed  his expression one of puzzlement .      did you feel the world move .     he said .   magrat peered over his shoulder at the forest .      i think she   s done it     she said .      done what .      magrat hesitated .     oh .  nothing .  nothing much  really .         shall we have another try .  i don   t think we got it quite right that time .      magrat nodded .   this time it lasted only fifteen seconds .  it seemed longer .     a tremor ran through the castle  shaking the breakfast tray from which the duke felmet  much to his relief  was eating porridge that wasn   t too salty .   it was felt by the ghosts that now filled nanny ogg   s cottage like a rugby team in a telephone box .   it spread to every henhouse in the kingdom  and a number of hands relaxed their grip .  and thirty two purple faced cockerels took a deep breath and crowed like maniacs  but they were too late  too late          i still reckon you were up to something     said granny weatherwax .      have another cup of tea     said nanny pleasantly .      you won   t go and put any drink in it  will you     granny said flatly .     it was the drink what did it last night .  i would never have put myself forward like that .  it   s shameful .         black aliss never done anything like it     said nanny  encouragingly .     i mean  it was a hundred years  all right  but it was only one castle she moved .  i reckon anyone could do a castle .      granny   s frown puckered at the edge .      and she let all weeds grow over it     she observed primly .      right enough .         very well done     said king verence  eagerly .     we all thought it was superb .  being in the ethereal plane  of course  we were in a position to observe closely .         very good  your graciousness     said nanny ogg .  she turned and observed the crowding ghosts behind him  who hadn   t been granted the privilege of sitting at  or partly through  the kitchen table .      but you lot can bugger off back to the outhouse     she said .     the cheek .  except the kiddies  they can stay     she added .     poor little mites .         i am afraid it feels so good to be out of the castle     said the king .   granny weatherwax yawned .      anyway     she said     we   ve got to find the boy now .  that   s the next step .         we shall look for him directly after lunch .         lunch .         it   s chicken     said nanny .     and you   re tired .  besides  making a decent search will take a long time .         he   ll be in ankh morpork     said granny .     mark my words .  everyone ends up there .  we   ll start with ankh morpork .  you don   t have to search for people when destiny is involved  you just wait for them in ankh morpork .      nanny brightened up .     our karen got married to an innkeeper from there     she said .     i haven   t seen the baby yet .  we could get free board and everything .         we needn   t actually go .  the whole point is that he should come here .  there   s something about that city     said granny .     it   s like a drain .           it   s five hundred miles away .     said magrat .     you   ll be away for ages .         i can   t help it     said the fool .     the duke   s given me special instructions .  he trusts me .         huh .  to hire more soldiers  i expect .         no .  nothing like that .  not as bad as that .     the fool hesitated .  he   d introduced felmet to the world of words .  surely that was better than hitting people with swords .  wouldn   t that buy time .  wouldn   t it be best for everybody  in the circumstances .      but you don   t have to go .  you don   t want to go .         that doesn   t have much to do with it .  i promised to be loyal to him           yes  yes  until you   re dead .  but you don   t even believe that .  you were telling me how much you hated the whole guild and everything .         well  yes .  but i still have to do it .  i gave my word .      magrat came close to stamping her foot  but didn   t sink so low .      just when we were getting to know one another .     she shouted .     you   re pathetic .      the fool   s eyes narrowed .     i   d only be pathetic if i broke my word     he said .     but i may be incredibly ill advized .  i   m sorry .  i   ll be back in a few weeks  anyway .         don   t you understand i   m asking you not to listen to him .         i said i   m sorry .  i couldn   t see you again before i go  could i .         i shall be washing my hair     said magrat stiffly .      when .         whenever .        hwel pinched the bridge of his nose and squinted wearily at the wax spattered paper .   the play wasn   t going at all well .   he   d sorted out the falling chandelier  and found a place for a villain who wore a mask to conceal his disfigurement  and he   d rewritten one of the funny bits to allow for the fact that the hero had been born in a handbag .  it was the clowns who were giving him trouble again .  they kept changing every time he thought about them .  he preferred them in twos  that was traditional  but now there seemed to be a third one  and he was blowed if he could think of any funny lines for him .   his quill moved scratchily over the latest sheet of paper  trying to catch the voices that had streamed through his dreaming mind and had seemed so funny at the time .   his tongue began to stick out of the corner of his mouth .  he was sweating .   this iss my little study  he wrote .  hey  with a little study youe could goe a long way .  and i wishe youed start now .  iffe you can   t leave yn a cab then leave yn a huff .  iff thates too soone  thenn leave yn a minute and a huff .  say  have you gott a pensil .  a crayon .      hwel stared at this in horror .  on the page it looked nonsensical  ridiculous .  and yet  and yet  in the thronged auditorium of his mind     he dipped the quill in the inkpot  and chased the echoes further .   seconde clown  atsa right  boss .   third clowne   business with bladder on stick  honk .  honk .   hwel gave up .  yes  it was funny  he knew it was funny  he   d heard the laughter in his dreams .  but it wasn   t right .  not yet .  maybe never .  it was like the other idea about the two clowns  one fat  one thin   thys ys amain dainty messe youe have got me into  stanleigh   he had laughed until his chest ached  and the rest of the company had looked at him in astonishment .  but in his dreams it was hilarious .   he laid down the pen and rubbed his eyes .  it must be nearly midnight  and the habit of a lifetime told him to spare the candles although  for a fact  they could afford all the candles they could eat now  whatever vitoller might say .   hour gongs were being struck all across the city and night watchmen were proclaiming that it was indeed midnight and also that  in the face of all the evidence  all was well .  many of them got as far as the end of the sentence before being mugged .   hwel pushed open the shutters and looked out at ankh morpork .   it would be tempting to say the twin city was at its best this time of year  but that wouldn   t be entirely correct .  it was at its most typical .   the river ankh  the cloaca of half a continent  was already pretty wide and silt laden when it reached the city   s outskirts .  by the time it left it didn   t so much flow as exude .  owing to the accretion of the mud of centuries the bed of the river was in fact higher than some of the low lying areas and now  with the snow melt swelling the flow  many of the low rent districts on the morpork side were flooded  if you can use that word for a liquid you could pick up in a net .  this sort of thing happened every year and would have caused havoc with the drains and sewage systems  so it is just as well that the city didn   t have very many .  its inhabitants merely kept a punt handy in the back yard and  periodically  built another story on the house .   it was reckoned to be very healthy there .  very few germs were able to survive .   hwel looked across a sort of misty sea in which buildings clustered like a sandcastle competition at high tide .  flares and lighted windows made pleasing patterns on the iridescent surface  but there was one glare of light  much closer to hand  which particularly occupied his attention .   on a patch of slightly higher ground by the river  bought by vitoller for a ruinous sum  a new building was rising .  it was growing even by night  like a mushroom   hwel could see the cressets burning all along the scaffolding as the hired craftsmen and even some of the players themselves refused to let the mere shade of the sky interrupt their labors .   new buildings were rare in morpork  but this was even a new type of building .   the dysk .   vitoller had been aghast at the idea at first  but young tomjon had kept at him .  and everyone knew that once the lad had got the feel of it he could persuade water to flow uphill .      but we   ve always moved around  laddie     said vitoller  in the desperate voice of one who knows that  at the end of it all  he   s going to lose the argument .     i can   t go around settling down at my time of life .         it   s not doing you any good     said tomjon firmly .     all these cold nights and frosty mornings .  you   re not getting any younger .  we should stay put somewhere  and let people come to us .  and they will  too .  you know the crowds we   re getting now .  hwel   s plays are famous .         it   s not my plays     hwel had said .     it   s the players .         i can   t see me sitting by a fire in a stuffy room and sleeping on feather beds and all that nonsense     said vitoller  but he   d seen the look on his wife   s face and had given in .   and then there had been the theater itself .  making water run uphill was a parlor trick compared to getting the cash out of vitoller but  it was a fact  they had been doing well these days .  ever since tomjon had been big enough to wear a ruff and say two words without his voice cracking .   hwel and vitoller had watched the first few beams of the wooden framework go up .      it   s against nature     vitoller had complained  leaning on his stick .     capturing the spirit of the theater  putting it in a cage .  it   ll kill it .         oh  i don   t know     said hwel diffidently .  tomjon had laid his plans well  he   d devoted an entire evening to hwel before even broaching the subject to his father  and now the dwarf   s mind was on fire with the possibilities of backdrops and scenery changes and wings and flies and magnificent engines that could lower gods from the heavens and trapdoors that could raise demons from hell .  hwel was no more capable of objecting to the new theater than a monkey was of resenting a banana plantation .      damn thing hasn   t even got a name     vitoller had said .     i should call it the golde mine  because that   s what it   s costing me .  where   s the money going to come from  that   s what i   d like to know .      in fact they   d tried a lot of names  none of which suited tomjon .      it   s got to be a name that means everything     he said .     because there   s everything inside it .  the whole world on the stage  do you see .      and hwel had said  knowing as he said it that what he was saying was exactly right     the disc .      and now the dysk was nearly done  and still he hadn   t written the new play .   he shut the window and wandered back to his desk  picked up the quill  and pulled another sheet of paper toward him .  a thought struck him .  the whole world was a stage  to the gods     presently he began to write .   all the disc it is but an theater  he wrote  ane alle men and wymmen are but players .  he made the mistake of pausing  and another inspiration sleeted down  sending his train of thought off along an entirely new track .   he looked at what he had written and added  except those who selle popcorn .   after a while he crossed this out  and tried  like unto thee staje of a theater ys the world  whereon alle persons strut as players .   this seemed a bit better .   he thought for a bit  and continued conscientiously  sometimes they walke on .  sometimes they walke off .   he seemed to be losing it .  time  time  what he needed was an infinity     there was a muffled cry and a thump from the next room .  hwel dropped the quill and pushed open the door cautiously .   the boy was sitting up in bed  white faced .  he relaxed when hwel came in .      hwel .         what   s up  lad .  nightmares .         gods  it was terrible .  i saw them again .  i really thought for a minute that        hwel  who was absent mindedly picking up the clothes that tomjon had strewn around the room  paused in his work .  he was keen on dreams .  that was when the ideas came .      that what .     he said .      it was like   i mean  i was sort of inside something  like a bowl  and there were these three terrible faces peering in at me .         aye .         yes  and then they all said     all hail       and then they started arguing about my name  and then they said     anyway  who shall be king hereafter .     and then one of them said     here after what .     and one of the other two said     just hereafter  girl  it   s what you   re supposed to say in these circumstances  you might try and make an effort     and then they all peered closer  and one of the others said     he looks a bit peaky  i reckon it   s all that foreign food     and then the youngest one said     nanny  i   ve told you already  there   s no such place as thespia     and then they bickered a bit  and one of the old ones said     he can   t hear us  can he .  he   s tossing and turning a bit     and the other one said     you know i   ve never been able to get sound on this thing  esme     and then they bickered some more  and it went cloudy  and then   i woke up       he finished lamely .     it was horrible  because every time they came close to the bowl it sort of magnified everything  so all you could see was eyes and nostrils .      hwel hoisted himself onto the edge of the narrow bed .      funny old things  dreams     he said .      not much funny about that one .         no  but i mean  last night  i had this dream about a little bandy legged man walking down a road     said hwel .     he had a little black hat on  and he walked as though his boots were full of water .      tomjon nodded politely .      yes .     he said .     and    .         well  that was it .  and nothing .  he had this little cane which he twirled and  you know  it was incredibly        the dwarf   s voice trailed off .  tomjon   s face had that familiar expression of polite and slightly condescending puzzlement that hwel had come to know and dread .      anyway  it was very amusing     he said  half to himself .  but he knew he   d never convince the rest of the company .  if it didn   t have a custard pie in it somewhere  they said  it wasn   t funny .   tomjon swung his legs out of bed and reached for his britches .      i   m not going back to sleep     he said .     what   s the time .         it   s after midnight     said hwel .     and you know what your father said about going to bed late .         i   m not     said tomjon  pulling on his boots .     i   m getting up early .  getting up early is very healthy .  and now i   m going out for a very healthy drink .  you can come too     he added     to keep an eye on me .      hwel gave him a doubting look .      you also know what your father says about going out drinking     he said .      yes .  he said he used to do it all the time when he was a lad .  he said he   d think nothing of quaffing ale all night and coming home at   a . m .   smashing windows .  he said he was a bit of a roister doister  not like these white livered people today who can   t hold their drink .     tomjon adjusted his doublet in front of the mirror  and added     you know  hwel  i reckon responsible behavior is something to get when you grow older .  like varicose veins .      hwel sighed .  tomjon   s memory for ill judged remarks was legendary .      all right     he said .     just the one  though .  somewhere decent .         i promise .     tomjon adjusted his hat .  it had a feather in it .      by the way     he said     exactly how does one quaff .         i think it means you spill most of it     said hwel .     if the water of the river ankh was rather thicker and more full of personality than ordinary river water  so the air in the mended drum was more crowded than normal air .  it was like dry fog .   tomjon and hwel watched it spilling out into the street .  the door burst open and a man came through backward  not actually touching the ground until he hit the wall on the opposite side of the street .   an enormous troll  employed by the owners to keep a measure of order in the place  came out dragging two more limp bodies which he deposited on the cobbles  kicking them once or twice in soft places .      i reckon they   re roistering in there  don   t you .     said tomjon .      it looks like it     said hwel .  he shivered .  he hated taverns .  people always put their drinks down on his head .   they scurried in quickly while the troll was holding one unconscious drinker up by one leg and banging his head on the cobbles in a search for concealed valuables .   drinking in the drum has been likened to diving in a swamp  except that in a swamp the alligators don   t pick your pockets first .  two hundred eyes watched the pair as they pushed their way through the crowd to the bar  a hundred mouths paused in the act of drinking  cursing or pleading  and ninety nine brows crinkled with the effort of working out whether the newcomers fell into category a  people to be frightened of or b  people to frighten .   tomjon walked through the crowd as though it was his property and  with the impetuosity of youth  rapped on the bar .  impetuosity was not a survival trait in the mended drum .      two pints of your finest ale  landlord     he said  in tones so carefully judged that the barman was astonished to find himself obediently filling the first mug before the echoes had died away .   hwel looked up .  there was an extremely big man on his right  wearing the outside of several large bulls and more chains than necessary to moor a warship .  a face that looked like a building site with hair on it glared down at him .      bloody hell     it said .     it   s a bloody lawn ornament .      hwel went cold .  cosmopolitan as they were  the people of morpork had a breezy  no nonsense approach to the nonhuman races  i . e .  hit them over the head with a brick and throw them in the river .  this did not apply to trolls  naturally  because it is very difficult to be racially prejudiced against creatures seven feet tall who can bite through walls  at least for very long .  but people three feet high were absolutely designed to be discriminated against .   the giant prodded hwel on the top of his head .      where   s your fishing rod  lawn ornament .     he said .   the barman pushed the mugs across the puddled counter .      here you are     he said  leering .     one pint .  and one half pint .      tomjon opened his mouth to speak  but hwel nudged him sharply in the knee .  put up with it  put up with it  slip out as soon as possible  it was the only way        where   s your little pointy hat  then .     said the bearded man .   the room had gone quiet .  this looked like being cabaret time .      i said  where   s your pointy hat  dopey .      the barman got a grip of the blackthorn stick with nails in which lived under the counter  just in case  and said     er           i was talking to the lawn ornament here .      the man took the dregs of his own drink and poured them carefully over the silent dwarf   s head .      i ain   t drinking here again     he muttered  when even this failed to have any effect .     it   s bad enough they let monkeys drink here  but pygmies        now the silence in the bar took on a whole new intensity in which the sound of a stool being slowly pushed back was like the creak of doom .  all eyes swiveled to the other end of the room  where sat the one drinker in the mended drum who came into category c .   what tomjon had thought was an old sack hunched over the bar was extending arms and   other arms  except that they were its legs .  a sad  rubbery face turned toward the speaker  its expression as melancholy as the mists of evolution .  its funny lips curled back .  there was absolutely nothing funny about its teeth .      er     said the barman again  his voice frightening even him in that terrible simian silence .     i don   t think you meant that  did you .  not about monkeys  eh .  you didn   t really  did you .         what the hell   s that .     hissed tomjon .      i think it   s an orangutan     said hwel .     an ape .         a monkey   s a monkey     said the bearded man  at which several of the drum   s more percipient customers started to edge for the door .     i mean  so what .  but these bloody lawn ornaments        hwel   s fist struck out at groin height .   dwarfs have a reputation as fearsome fighters .  any race of three foot tall people who favor axes and go into battle as into a championship tree felling competition soon get talked about .  but years of wielding a pen instead of a hammer had relieved hwel   s punches of some of their stopping power  and it could have been the end of him when the big man yelled and drew his sword if a pair of delicate  leathery hands hadn   t instantly jerked the thing from his grip and  with only a small amount of effort  bent it double .    when the giant growled  and turned around  an arm like a couple of broom handles strung together with elastic and covered with red fur unfolded itself in a complicated motion and smacked him across the jaw so hard that he rose several inches in the air and landed on a table .   by the time that the table had slid into another table and overturned a couple of benches there was enough impetus to start the night   s overdue brawl  especially since the big man had a few friends with him .  since no one felt like attacking the ape  who had dreamily pulled a bottle from the shelf and smashed the bottom off on the counter  they hit whoever happened to be nearest  on general principles .  this is absolutely correct etiquette for a tavern brawl .   hwel walked under a table and dragged tomjon  who was watching all this with interest  after him .      so this is roistering .  i always wondered .         i think perhaps it would be a good idea to leave     said the dwarf firmly .     before there   s  you know  any trouble .      there was a thump as someone landed on the table above them  and a tinkle of broken glass .      is it real roistering  do you suppose  or merely rollicking .     said tomjon  grinning .      it   s going to be bloody murder in a minute  my lad .      tomjon nodded  and crawled back out into the fray .  hwel heard him thump on the bar counter with something and call for silence .   hwel put his arms over his head in panic .      i didn   t mean       he began .   in fact calling for silence was a sufficiently rare event in the middle of a tavern brawl that silence was what tomjon got .  and silence was what he filled .   hwel started as he heard the boy   s voice ring out  full of confidence and absolutely first class projection .      brothers .  and yet may i call all men brother  for on this night        the dwarf craned up to see tomjon standing on a chair  one hand raised in the prescribed declamatory fashion .  around him men were frozen in the act of giving one another a right seeing to  their faces turned to his .   down at tabletop height hwel   s lips moved in perfect synchronization with the words as tomjon went through the familiar speech .  he risked another look .   the fighters straightened up  pulled themselves together  adjusted the hang of their tunics  glanced apologetically at one another .  many of them were in fact standing to attention .   even hwel felt a fizz in his blood  and he   d written those words .  he   d slaved half a night over them  years ago  when vitoller had declared that they needed another five minutes in act iii of the king of ankh .      scribble us something with a bit of spirit in it     he   d said .     a bit of zip and sizzle  y   know .  something to summon up the blood and put a bit of backbone in our friends in the ha   penny seats .  and just long enough to give us time to change the set .      he   d been a bit ashamed of that play at the time .  the famous battle of morpork  he strongly suspected  had consisted of about two thousand men lost in a swamp on a cold  wet day  hacking one another into oblivion with rusty swords .  what would the last king of ankh have said to a pack of ragged men who knew they were outnumbered  outflanked and outgeneralled .  something with bite  something with edge  something like a drink of brandy to a dying man  no logic  no explanation  just words that would reach right down through a tired man   s brain and pull him to his feet by his testicles .   now he was seeing its effect .   he began to think the walls had fallen away  and there was a cold mist blowing over the marshes  its choking silence broken only by the impatient cries of the carrion birds     and this voice .   and he   d written the words  they were his  no half crazed king had ever really spoken like this .  and he   d written all this to fill in a gap so that a castle made of painted sacking stretched over a frame could be shoved behind a curtain  and this voice was taking the coal dust of his words and filling the room with diamonds .   i made these words  hwel thought .  but they don   t belong to me .  they belong to him .   look at those people .  not a patriotic thought among them  but if tomjon asked them  this bunch of drunkards would storm the patrician   s palace tonight .  and they   d probably succeed .   i just hope his mouth never falls into the wrong hands     as the last syllables died away  their white hot echoes searing across every mind in the room  hwel shook himself and crawled out of hiding and jabbed tomjon on the knee .      come away now  you fool     he hissed .     before it wears off .      he grasped the boy firmly by the arm  handed a couple of complimentary tickets to the stunned barman  and hurried up the steps .  he didn   t stop until they were a street away .      i thought i was doing rather well there     said tomjon .      a good deal too well  i reckon .      the boy rubbed his hands together .     right .  where shall we go next .         next .         tonight is young .         no  tonight is dead .  it   s today that   s young     said the dwarf hurriedly .      well  i   m not going home yet .  isn   t there somewhere a bit more friendly .  we haven   t actually drunk anything .      hwel sighed .      a troll tavern     said tomjon .     i   ve heard about them .  there   s some down in the shades .   i   d like to see a troll tavern .         they   re for trolls only  boy .  molten lava to drink and rock music and cheese    n    chutney flavored pebbles .         what about dwarf bars .         you   d hate it     said hwel  fervently .     besides  you   d run out of headroom .         low dives  are they .         look at it like this   how long do you think you could sing about gold .            it   s yellow and it goes chink and you can buy things with it        said tomjon experimentally  as they strolled through the crowds on the plaza of broken moons .     four seconds  i think .         right .  five hours of it gets a bit repetitive .     hwel kicked a pebble gloomily .  he   d investigated a few dwarf bars last time they were in town  and hadn   t approved .  for some reason his fellow expatriates  who at home did nothing more objectionable than mine a bit of iron ore and hunt small creatures  felt impelled  once in the big city  to wear chain mail underwear  go around with axes in their belts  and call themselves names like timkin rumbleguts .  and no one could beat a city dwarf when it came to quaffing .  sometimes they missed their mouths altogether .      anyway     he added     you   d get thrown out for being too creative .  the actual words are     gold  gold  gold  gold  gold  gold .            is there a chorus .            gold  gold  gold  gold  gold        said hwel .      you left out a    gold    there .         i think it   s because i wasn   t cut out to be a dwarf .         cut down  lawn ornament     said tomjon .   there was a little hiss of indrawn breath .      sorry     said tomjon hurriedly .     it   s just that father           i   ve known your father for a long time     said hwel .     through thick and thin  and there was a damn sight more thin than thick .  since before you were bor       he hesitated .     times were hard in those days     he mumbled .     so what i   m saying is   well  some things you earn .         yes .  i   m sorry .         you see  just       hwel paused at the mouth of a dark alley .     did you hear something .     he said .   they squinted into the alley  once again revealing themselves as newcomers to the city .  morporkians don   t look down dark alleys when they hear strange noises .  if they see four struggling figures their first instinct is not to rush to anyone   s assistance  or at least not to rush to the assistance of the one who appears to be losing and on the wrong end of someone else   s boot .  nor do they shout    oi .     above all  they don   t look surprised when the assailants  instead of guiltily running off  flourish a small piece of cardboard in front of them .      what   s this .     said tomjon .      it   s a clown .     said hwel .     they   ve mugged a clown .            theft licence    .     said tomjon  holding the card up to the light .      that   s right     said the leader of the three .     only don   t expect us to do you too     cos we   re on our way home .         s   right     said one of his assistants .     it   s the thingy  the quota .         but you were kicking him .         worl  not a lot .  not what you   d call actual kicking .         more foot nudging  sort of thing     said the third thief .      fair   s fair .  he bloody well went and fetched ron here a right thump  didn   t he .         yeah .  some people have no idea .         why  you heartless       hwel began  but tomjon laid a cautioning hand on his head .       the boy turned the card over .  the obverse read     j .  h .     flannelfoot    boggis and nephews  bespoke thieves     the old firm      estblshd am        all type theft carryed out professionly and  with disgression  houses cleared .     hr service .   no job too small .   let us quote you for our  family rate       it seems to be in order     he said reluctantly .   hwel paused in the act of helping the dazed victim to his feet .      in order .     he shouted .     to rob someone .         we   ll give him a chitty  of course     said boggis .     lucky we found him first  really .  some of these newcomers in the business  they   ve got no idea .          cowboys     agreed a nephew .      how much did you steal .     said tomjon .   boggis opened the clown   s purse  which was stuck in his belt .  then he went pale .      oh  bleeding hell     he said .  the nephews clustered around .      we   re for it  sort of thing .         second time this year  uncle .      boggis glared at the victim .      well  how was i to know .  i wasn   t to know  was i .  i mean  look at him  how much would you expect him to have on him .  couple of coppers  right .  i mean  we   d never have done for him  only it was on our way home .  you try and do someone a favor  this is what happens .         how much has he got  then .     said tomjon .      there must be a hundred silver dollars in here     moaned boggis  waving a purse .     i mean  that   s not my league .  that   s not my class .  i can   t handle that sort of money .  you   ve got to be in the guild of lawyers or something to steal that much .  it   s way over my quota  is that .         give it back then     said tomjon .      but i done him a receipt .         they   ve all got  you know  numbers on     explained the younger of the nephews .     the guild checks up  sort of        hwel grabbed tomjon   s hand .      will you excuse us a moment .     he said to the frantic thief  and dragged tomjon to the other side of the alley .      ok     he said .     who   s gone mad .  them .  me .  you .      tomjon explained .      it   s legal .         up to a certain point .  fascinating  isn   t it .  man in a pub told me about it  sort of thing .         but he   s stolen too much .         so it appears .  i gather the guild is very strict about it .      there was a groan from the victim hanging between them .  he tinkled gently .      look after him     said tomjon .     i   ll sort this out .      he went back to the thieves  who were looking very worried .      my client feels     he said     that the situation could be resolved if you give the money back .         ye es     said boggis  approaching the idea as if it was a brand new theory of cosmic creation .     but it   s the receipt  see  we have to fill it up  time and place  signed and everything           my client feels that possibly you could rob him of  let us say  five copper pieces     said tomjon  smoothly .         i bloody don   t .        shouted the fool  who was coming around .      that represents two copper pieces as the going rate  plus expenses of three copper pieces for time  call out fees           wear and tear on cosh     said boggis .      exactly .         very fair .  very fair .     boggis looked over tomjon   s head at the fool  who was now completely conscious and very angry .     very fair     he said loudly .     statesmanlike .  much obliged  i   m sure .     he looked down at tomjon .     and anything for yourself  sir .     he added .     just say the word .  we   ve got a special on gbh this season .  practically painless  you   ll barely feel a thing .         hardly breaks the skin     said the older nephew .     plus you get choice of limb .         i believe i am well served in that area     said tomjon smoothly .      oh .  well .  right you are then .  no problem .         which merely leaves     continued tomjon  as the thieves started to walk away     the question of legal fees .        the gentle grayness at the stump of the night flowed across ankh morpork .  tomjon and hwel sat on either side of the table in their lodgings  counting .      three silver dollars and eighteen copper pieces in profit  i make it     said tomjon .      that was amazing     said the fool .     i mean  the way they volunteered to go home and get some more money as well  after you gave them that speech about the rights of man .      he dabbed some more ointment on his head .      and the youngest one started to cry     he added .     amazing .         it wears off     said hwel .      you   re a dwarf  aren   t you .      hwel didn   t feel he could deny this .      i can tell you   re a fool     he said .      yes .  it   s the bells  isn   t it .     said the fool wearily  rubbing his ribs .      yes  and the bells .     tomjon grimaced and kicked hwel under the table .      well  i   m very grateful     said the fool .  he stood up  and winced .     i   d really like to show my gratitude     he added .     is there a tavern open around here .      tomjon joined him at the window  and pointed down the length of the street .      see all those tavern signs .     he said .      yes .  gosh .  there   s hundreds .         right .  see the one at the end  with the blue and white sign .         yes .  i think so .         well  as far as i know  that   s the only one around here that   s ever closed .         then pray allow me to treat you to a drink .  it   s the least i can do     said the fool nervously .     and i   m sure the little fellow would like something to quaff .      hwel gripped the edge of the table and opened his mouth to roar .   and stopped .   he stared at the two figures .  his mouth stayed open .   it closed again with a snap .      something the matter .     said tomjon .   hwel looked away .  it had been a long night .     trick of the light     he muttered .     and i could do with a drink     he added .     a bloody good quaff .      in fact  he thought  why fight it .     i   ll even put up with the singing     he said .        was    the nex    wor    .         s   gold .  i think .         ah .      hwel looked unsteadily into his mug .  drunkenness had this to be said for it  it stopped the flow of inspirations .      and you left out the    gold        he said .      where .     said tomjon .  he was wearing the fool   s hat .   hwel considered this .     i reckon     he said  concentrating     it was between the    gold    and the    gold    .  an    i reckon     he peered again into the mug .  it was empty  a horrifying sight .     i reckon     he tried again  and finally gave up  and substituted     i reckon i could do with another drink .         my shout this time     said the fool .     hahaha .  my squeak .  hahaha .     he tried to stand up  and banged his head .   in the gloom of the bar a dozen axes were gripped more firmly .  the part of hwel that was sober  and was horrified to see the rest of him being drunk  urged him to wave his hand at the beetling brows glaring at them through the gloom .      s   all right     he said  to the bar at large .     he don   t mean it  he ver    funny wossname  idiot .  fool .  ver    funny fool  all way from wassisplace .         lancre     said the fool  and sat down heavily on the bar .      s   right .  long way away from wossname  sounds like foot disease .  don   t know how to behave .  don   t know many dwarfs .         hahaha     said the fool  clutching his head .     bit short of them where i come from .      someone tapped hwel on the shoulder .  he turned and looked into a craggy  hairy face under an iron helmet .  the dwarf in question was tossing a throwing axe up and down in a meaningful way .      you ought to tell your friend to be a bit less funny     he suggested .     otherwise he will be amusing the demons in hell .      hwel squinted at him through the alcoholic haze .      who   re you .     he said .      grabpot thundergust     said the dwarf  striking his chain mailed torso .     and i say        hwel peered closer .      here  i know you     he said .     you got a cosmetics mill down hobfast street .  i bought a lot of greasepaint off you last week        a look of panic crossed thundergust   s face .  he leaned forward in panic .     shutup  shutup     he whispered .      that   s right  it said the halls of elven perfume and rouge co .      said hwel happily .      ver    good stuff     said tomjon  who was trying to stop himself from sliding off the tiny bench .     especially your no .      corpse green  my father swears it   s the best .  first class .      the dwarf hefted his axe uneasily .     well  er     he said .     oh .  but .  yes .  well  thank you .  only the finest ingredients  mark you .         chop them up with that  do you .     said hwel innocently  pointing to the axe .     or is it your night off .      thundergust   s brows beetled again like a cockroach convention .      here  you   re not with the theater .         tha   s us     said tomjon .     strolling players .     he corrected himself .     standing still players now .  haha .  slidin    down players now .      the dwarf dropped his axe and sat down on the bench  his face suddenly softened with enthusiasm .      i went last week     he said .     bloody good  it was .  there was this girl and this fellow  but she was married to this old man  and there was this other fellow  and they said he   d died  and she pined away and took poison  but then it turned out this man was the other man really  only he couldn   t tell her on account of       thundergust stopped  and blew his nose .     everyone died in the end     he said .     very tragic .  i cried all the way home  i don   t mind telling you .  she was so pale .         no .     and a layer of powder     said tomjon cheerfully .     plus a bit of brown eyeshadow .         eh .         and a couple of hankies in the vest     he added .      what   s he saying .     said the dwarf to the company at  for want of a better word  large .   hwel smiled into his tankard .      give    em a bit of gretalina   s soliloquy  boy     he said .      right .      tomjon stood up  hit his head  sat down and then knelt on the floor as a compromise .  he clasped his hands to what would have been  but for a few chance chromosomes  his bosom .      you lie who call it summer       he began .   the assembled dwarfs listened in silence for several minutes .  one of them dropped his axe  and was noisily hushed by the rest of them .         and melting snow .  farewell     tomjon finished .     drinks phial  collapses behind battlements  down ladder  out of dress and into tabard for comic guard no .     wait one  entrance left .  what ho  good           that   s about enough     said hwel quietly .   several of the dwarfs were crying into their helmets .  there was a chorus of blown noses .   thundergust dabbed at his eyes with a chain mail handkerchief .      that was the most saddest thing i   ve ever heard     he said .  he glared at tomjon .     hang on     he said  as realization dawned .     he   s a man .  i bloody fell in love with that girl on stage .     he nudged hwel .     he   s not a bit of an elf  is he .         absolutely human     said hwel .     i know his father .      once again he stared hard at the fool  who was watching them with his mouth open  and looked back at tomjon .   nah  he thought .  coincidence .      s   acting     he said .     a good actor can be anything  right .      he could feel the fool   s eye boring into the back of his short neck .      yes  but dressing up as women  it   s a bit       said thundergust doubtfully .   tomjon slipped off his shoes and knelt down on them  bringing his face level with the dwarf   s .  he gave him a calculating stare for a few seconds  and then adjusted his features .   and there were two thundergusts .  true  one of them was kneeling and had apparently been shaved .      what ho  what ho     said tomjon in the dwarf   s voice .   this was by way of being a hilarious gag to the rest of the dwarfs  who had an uncomplicated sense of humor .  as they gathered around the pair hwel felt a gentle touch on the shoulder .      you two are with a theater .     said the fool  now almost sober .      s   right .         then i   ve come five hundred miles to find you .        it was  as hwel would have noted in his stage directions  later the same day .  the sounds of hammering as the dysk theater rose from its cradle of scaffolding thumped through hwel   s head and out the other side .   he could remember the drinking  he was certain .  and the dwarfs bought lots more rounds when tomjon did his impersonations .  then they had all gone to another bar thundergust knew  and then they   d gone to a klatchian take away  and after that it was just a blur     he wasn   t very good at quaffing .  too much of the drink actually landed in his mouth .   judging by the taste in it  some incontinent creature of the night had also scored a direct hit .      can you do it .     said vitoller .   hwel smacked his lips to get rid of the taste .      i expect     said tomjon .     it sounded interesting  the way he told it .  wicked king ruling with the help of evil witches .  storms .  ghastly forests .  true heir to throne in life and death struggle .  flash of dagger .  screams  alarums .  evil king dies .  good triumphs .  bells ring out .         showers of rose petals could be arranged     said vitoller .     i know a man who can get them at practically cost .      they both looked at hwel  who was drumming his fingers on his stool .  all three found their attention drawn to the bag of silver the fool had given hwel .  even by itself it represented enough money to complete the dysk .  and there had been talk of more to follow .  patronage  that was the thing .      you   ll do it then  will you .     said vitoller .      it   s got a certain something     hwel conceded .     but   i don   t know           i   m not trying to pressure you     said vitoller .  all three pairs of eyes swiveled back to the money bag .      it seems a bit fishy     tomjon conceded .     i mean  the fool is decent enough .  but the way he tells it   it   s very odd .  his mouth says the words  and his eyes say something else .  and i got the impression he   d much rather we believed his eyes .         on the other hand     said vitoller hurriedly     what harm could it do .  the pay   s the thing .      hwel raised his head .      what .     he said muzzily .      i said  the play   s the thing     said vitoller .   there was silence again  except for the drumming of hwel   s fingertips .  the bag of silver seemed to have grown larger .  in fact  it seemed to fill the room .      the thing is       vitoller began  unnecessarily loudly .      the way i see it       hwel began .   they both stopped .      after you .  sorry .         it wasn   t important .  go ahead .         i was going to say  we could afford to build the dysk anyway     said hwel .      just the shell and the stage     said vitoller .     but not all the other things .  not the trapdoor mechanism  or the machine for lowering gods out of heaven .  or the big turntable  or the wind fans .         we used to manage without all that stuff     said hwel .     remember the old days .  all we had was a few planks and a bit of painted sacking .  but we had a lot of spirit .  if we wanted wind we had to make it ourselves .     he drummed his fingers for a while .     of course     he added quietly     we should be able to afford a wave machine .  a small one .  i   ve got this idea about this ship wrecked on an island  where there   s this           sorry .     vitoller shook his head .      but we   ve had some huge audiences .     said tomjon .      sure  lad .  sure .  but they pay in ha   pennies .  the artificers want silver .  if we wanted to be rich men   people     he corrected hurriedly     we should have been born carpenters .     vitoller shifted uneasily .     i already owe chrystophrase the troll more than i should .      the other two stared .      he   s the one that has people   s limbs torn off .     said tomjon .      how much do you owe him .     said hwel .      it   s all right     said vitoller hurriedly     i   m keeping up the interest payments .  more or less .         yes  but how much does he want .         an arm and a leg .      the dwarf and boy stared at him in horror .     how could you have been so           i did it for you two .  tomjon deserves a better stage  he doesn   t want to go ruining his health sleeping in lattys and never knowing a home  and you  my man  you need somewhere settled  with all the proper things you ought to have  like trapdoors and   wave machines and so forth .  you talked me into it  and i thought  they   re right .  it   s no life out on the road  giving two performances a day to a bunch of farmers and going around with a hat afterward  what sort of future is that .  i thought  we   ve got to get a place somewhere  with comfortable seats for the gentry  people who don   t throw potatoes at the stage .  i said  blow the cost .  i just wanted you to           all right  all right .     shouted hwel .     i   ll write it .         i   ll act it     said tomjon .      i   m not forcing you  mind     said vitoller .     it   s your own choice .      hwel frowned at the table .  there were  he had to admit  some nice touches .  three witches was good .  two wouldn   t be enough  four would be too many .  they could be meddling with the destinies of mankind  and everything .  lots of smoke and green light .  you could do a lot with three witches .  it was surprising no one had thought of it before .      so we can tell this fool that we   ll do it  can we .     said vitoller  his hand on the bag of silver .   and of course you couldn   t go wrong with a good storm .  and there was the ghost routine that vitoller had cut out of please yourself  saying they couldn   t afford the muslin .  and perhaps he could put death in  too .  young dafe would make a damn good death  with white make up and platform soles        how far away did he say he   d come from .     he said .      the ramtops     and the playmaster .     some little kingdom no one has ever heard of .  sounds like a chest infection .         it   d take months to get there .         i   d like to go  anyway     said tomjon .     that   s where i was born .      vitoller looked at the ceiling .  hwel looked at the floor .  anything was better  just at that moment  than looking at each other   s face .      that   s what you said     said the boy .     when you did a tour of the mountains  you said .         yes  but i can   t remember where     said vitoller .     all those little mountain towns looked the same to me .  we spent more time pushing the lattys across rivers and dragging them up hills than we ever did on the stage .         i could take some of the younger lads and we could make a summer of it     said tomjon .     put on all the old favorites .  and we could still be back by soulcake day .  you could stay here and see to the theater  and we could be back for a grand opening .     he grinned at his father .     it   d be good for them     he said slyly .     you always said some of the young lads don   t know what a real acting life is like .         hwel   s still got to write the play     vitoller pointed out .   hwel was silent .  he was staring at nothing at all .  after a while one hand fumbled in his doublet and brought out a sheaf of paper  and then disappeared in the direction of his belt and produced a small corked ink pot and a bundle of quills .   they watched as  without once looking at them  the dwarf smoothed out the paper  opened the ink pot  dipped a quill  held it poised like a hawk waiting for its prey  and then began to write .   vitoller nodded at tomjon .   walking as quietly as they could  they left the room .     around mid afternoon they took up a tray of food and a bundle of paper .   the tray was still there at teatime .  the paper had gone .   a few hours later a passing member of the company reported hearing a yell of    it can   t work .  it   s back to front .     and the sound of something being thrown across the room .   around supper vitoller heard a shouted request for more candles and fresh quills .   tomjon tried to get an early night  but sleep was murdered by the sound of creativity from the next room .  there were mutterings about balconies  and whether the world really needed wave machines .  the rest was silence  except for the insistent scratching of quills .   eventually  tomjon dreamed .      now .  have we got everything this time .         yes  granny .         light the fire  magrat .         yes  granny .         right .  let   s see now           i wrote it all down  granny .         i can read  my girl  thank you very much .  now  what   s this .     round about the cauldron go  in the poisoned entrails throw       what are these supposed to be .         our jason slaughtered a pig yesterday  esme .         these look like perfectly good chitterlin   s to me  gytha .  there   s a couple of decent meals in them  if i   m any judge .         please  granny .         there   s plenty of starvin    people in klatch who wouldn   t turn up their nose at    em  that   s all i   m saying   all right  all right .     whole grain wheat and lentils too  in the cauldron seethe and stew    .  what happened to the toad .         please  granny .  you   re slowing it down .  you know goodie was against all unnecessary cruelty .  vegetable protein is a perfectly acceptable substitute .         that means no newt or fenny snake either  i suppose .         no  granny .         or tiger   s chaudron .         here .         what the hell   s this  excuse my klatchian .         it   s a tiger   s chaudron .  our wane bought it off a merchant from forn parts .         you sure .         our wane asked special  esme .         looks like any other chaudron to me .  oh  well .     double hubble  stubble trouble  fire burn and cauldron bub       why isn   t the cauldron bubbling  magrat .      tomjon awoke  shivering .  the room was dark .  outside a few stars pierced the mists of the city  and there was the occasional whistle of burglars and footpads as they went about their strictly lawful occasions .   there was silence from the next room  but he could see the light of a candle under the door .   he went back to bed .   across the turgid river the fool had also awakened .  he was staying in the fool   s guild  not out of choice but because the duke hadn   t given him any money for anything else  and getting to sleep had been difficult in any case .  the chilly walls had brought back too many memories .  besides  if he listened hard he could hear the muted sobs and occasional whimpers from the students    dormitories  as they contemplated with horror the life that lay ahead of them .   he punched the rock hard pillow  and sank into a fitful sleep .  perchance to dream .      slab and grue  yes .  but it doesn   t say how slab and grue .         goodie whemper recommended testing a bit in a cup of cold water  like toffee .         how inconvenient that we didn   t think to bring one  magrat .         i think we should be getting on  esme .  the night   s nearly gone .         just don   t blame me if it doesn   t work properly  that   s all .  lessee      baboon hair and       who   s got the baboon hair .  oh  thank you  gytha  though it looks more like cat hair to me  but never mind .     baboon hair and mandrake root     and if that   s real mandrake i   m very surprised     carrot juice and tongue of boot     i see  a little humor  i suppose           please hurry .         all right  all right .     owl hoot and glow worm glimmer .  boil   and then allow to simmer .            you know  esme  this doesn   t taste half bad .         you   re not supposed to drink it  you daft doyenne .      tomjon sat bolt upright in bed .  that was them again  the same faces  the bickering voices  distorted by time and space .   even after he looked out of the window  where fresh daylight was streaming through the city  he could still hear the voices grumbling into the distance  like old thunder  fading away        i for one didn   t believe it about the tongue of boot .         it   s still very runny .  do you think we should put some corn flour into it .         it won   t matter .  either he   s on his way  or he isn   t        he got up and doused his face in the washbasin .   silence rolled in swathes from hwel   s room .  tomjon slipped on his clothes and pushed open the door .   it looked as though it had snowed indoors  great heavy flakes that had drifted into odd corners of the room .  hwel sat at his low table in the middle of the floor  his head pillowed on a pile of paper  snoring .   tomjon tiptoed across the room and picked up a discarded ball of paper at random .  he smoothed it out and read     king  now  i   m just going to put the crown on this bush here  and you will tell me if anyone tries to take it  won   t you .   groundlings  yes .   king  now if i could just find my horsey       st assassin pops up behind rock .    audience  behind you .     st assassin disappears .    king  you   re trying to play tricks on old kingy  you naughty       there was a lot of crossing out  and a large blot .  tomjon threw it aside and selected another ball at random .     king  is this a duck knife dagger i see behind beside in front of before me  its beak handle pointing at me my hand .    st murderer  i   faith  it is not so .  oh no it isn   t .    nd murderer  thou speakest truth  sire .  oh yes it is .     judging by the creases in the paper  this one had been thrown at the wall particularly hard .  hwel had once explained to tomjon his theory about inspirations  and by the look of it a whole shower had fallen last night .   fascinated by this insight into the creative processes  however  tomjon tried a third discarded attempt     queen  faith  there is a sound without .  mayhap it is my husband returning .  quick  into the garderobe  and wait not upon the order of your going .   murderer  marry  but your maid still has my pantoufles .   maid  opening door   the archbishop  your majesty .   priest  under bed   bless my soul .    divers alarums     tomjon wondered vaguely what divers alarums  which hwel always included somewhere in the stage directions  actually were .  hwel always refused to say .  perhaps they referred to dangerous depths  or lack of air pressure .   he sidled toward the table and  with great care  pulled the sheaf of paper from under the sleeping dwarf   s head  lowering it gently onto a cushion .   the top sheet read     verence felmet small god   s eve a night of knives daggers kings  by  hwel of vitoller   s men .  a comedy tragedy in eight five six three nine acts .   characters  felmet  a good king .   verence  a bad king .   wethewacs  ane evil witch  hogg  ane likewise evil witch  magerat  ane sirene     tomjon flicked over the page .     scene  a drawing room ship at sea street in pseudopolis blasted moor .  enter three witches         the boy read for a while and then turned to the last page .   gentles  leave us dance and sing  and wish good health unto the king .   exeunt all  singing falala  etc .  shower of rose petals .  ringing of bells .  gods descend from heaven  demons rise from hell  much ado with turntable  etc .   the end .     hwel snored .   in his dreams gods rose and fell  ships moved with cunning and art across canvas oceans  pictures jumped and ran together and became flickering images  men flew on wires  flew without wires  great ships of illusion fought against one another in imaginary skies  seas opened  ladies were sawn in half  a thousand special effects men giggled and gibbered .  through it all he ran with his arms open in desperation  knowing that none of this really existed or ever would exist and all he really had was a few square yards of planking  some canvas and some paint on which to trap the beckoning images that invaded his head .   only in our dreams are we free .  the rest of the time we need wages .        it   s a good play     said vitoller     apart from the ghost .         the ghost stays     said hwel sullenly .      but people always jeer and throw things .  anyway  you know how hard it is to get all the chalk dust out of the clothes .         the ghost stays .  it   s a dramatic necessity .         you said it was a dramatic necessity in the last play .         well  it was .         and in please yourself  and in a wizard of ankh  and all the rest of them .         i like ghosts .      they stood to one side and watched the dwarf artificers assembling the wave machine .  it consisted of half a dozen long spindles  covered in complex canvas spirals painted in shades of blue and green and white  and stretching the complete width of the stage .  an arrangement of cogs and endless belts led to a treadmill in the wings .  when the spirals were all turning at once people with weak stomachs had to look away .      sea battles     breathed hwel .     shipwrecks .  tritons .  pirates .         squeaky bearings  laddie     groaned vitoller  shifting his weight on his stick .     maintenance expenses .  overtime .         it does look extremely   intricate     hwel admitted .     who designed it .         a daft old chap in the street of cunning artificers     said vitoller .     leonard of quirm .  he   s a painter really .  he just does this sort of thing for a hobby .  i happened to hear that he   s been working on this for months .  i just snapped it up quick when he couldn   t get it to fly .      they watched the mock waves turn .      you   re bent on going .     said vitoller  at last .      yes .  tomjon   s still a bit wild .  he needs an older head around the place .         i   ll miss you  laddie .  i don   t mind telling you .  you   ve been like a son to me .  how old are you  exactly .  i never did know .         a hundred and two .      vitoller nodded gloomily .  he was sixty  and his arthritis was playing him up .      you   ve been like a father to me  then     he said .      it evens out in the end     said hwel diffidently .     half the height  twice the age .  you could say that on the overall average we live about the same length of time as humans .      the playmaster sighed .     well  i don   t know what i will do without you and tomjon around  and that   s a fact .         it   s only for the summer  and a lot of the lads are staying .  in fact it   s mainly the apprentices that are going .  you said yourself it   d be good experience .      vitoller looked wretched and  in the chilly air of the half finished theater  a good deal smaller than usual  like a balloon two weeks after the party .  he prodded some wood shavings distractedly with his stick .      we grow old  master hwel .  at least     he corrected himself     i grow old and you grow older .  we have heard the gongs at midnight .         aye .  you don   t want him to go  do you .         i was all for it at first .  you know .  then i thought  there   s destiny afoot .  just when things are going well  there   s always bloody destiny .  i mean  that   s where he came from .  somewhere up in the mountains .  now fate is calling him back .  i shan   t see him again .         it   s only for the summer        vitoller held up a hand .     don   t interrupt .  i   d got the right dramatic flow there .         sorry .      flick  flick  went the stick on the wood shavings  knocking them into the air .      i mean  you know he   s not my flesh and blood .         he   s your son  though     said hwel .     this hereditary business isn   t all it   s cracked up to be .         it   s fine of you to say that .         i mean it .  look at me .  i wasn   t supposed to be writing plays .  dwarfs aren   t even supposed to be able to read .  i shouldn   t worry too much about destiny  if i was you .  i was destined to be a miner .  destiny gets it wrong half the time .         but you said he looks like the fool person .  i can   t see it myself  mark you .         the light   s got to be right .         could be some destiny at work there .      hwel shrugged .  destiny was funny stuff  he knew .  you couldn   t trust it .  often you couldn   t even see it .  just when you knew you had it cornered  it turned out to be something else   coincidence  maybe  or providence .  you barred the door against it  and it was standing behind you .  then just when you thought you had it nailed down it walked away with the hammer .   he used destiny a lot .  as a tool for his plays it was even better than a ghost .  there was nothing like a bit of destiny to get the old plot rolling .  but it was a mistake to think you could spot the shape of it .  and as for thinking it could be controlled       granny weatherwax squinted irritably into nanny ogg   s crystal ball .  it wasn   t a particularly good one  being a greenish glass fishing float brought back from forn seaside parts by one of her sons .  it distorted everything including  she suspected  the truth .      he   s definitely on his way     she said  at last .     in a cart .         a fiery white charger would have been favorite     said nanny ogg .     you know .  caparisoned  and that .         has he got a magic sword .     said magrat  craning to see .   granny weatherwax sat back .      you   re a disgrace  the pair of you     she said .     i don   t know   magic chargers  fiery swords .  ogling away like a couple of milkmaids .         a magic sword is important     said magrat .     you   ve got to have one .  we could make him one     she added wistfully .     out of thunderbolt iron .  i   ve got a spell for that .  you take some thunderbolt iron     she said uncertainly     and then you make a sword out of it .         i can   t be having with that old stuff     said granny .     you can wait days for the damn things to hit and then they nearly take your arm off .         and a strawberry birthmark     said nanny ogg  ignoring the interruption .   the other two looked at her expectantly .      a strawberry birthmark     she repeated .     it   s one of those things you   ve got to have if you   re a prince coming to claim your kingdom .  that   s so   s everyone will know .  o   course  i don   t know how they know it   s strawberry .         can   t abide strawberries     said granny vaguely  quizzing the crystal again .   in its cracked green depths  smelling of bygone lobsters  a minute tomjon kissed his parents  shook hands or hugged the rest of the company  and climbed aboard the leading latty .   it must of worked  she told herself .  else he wouldn   t be coming here  would he .  all those others must be his trusty band of good companions .  after all  common sense  he   s got to come five hundred miles across difficult country  anything could happen .   i daresay the armor and swords is in the carts .   she detected a twinge of doubt  and set out to quell it instantly .  there isn   t any other reason for him to come  stands to reason .  we got the spell exactly right .  except for the ingredients .  and most of the poetry .  and it probably wasn   t the right time .  and gytha took most of it home for the cat  which couldn   t of been proper .   but he   s on his way .  what can   t speak  can   t lie .      best put the cloth over it when you   ve done  esme     said nanny .     i always get worried someone   ll peer in at me when i   m having my bath .         he   s on his way     said granny  the satisfaction in her voice so strong you could have ground corn with it .  she dropped the black velvet bag over the ball .      it   s a long road     said nanny .     there   s many a slip twixt dress and drawers .  there could be bandits .         we shall watch over him     said granny .      that   s not right .  if he   s going to be king he ought to be able to fight his own battles     said magrat .      we don   t want him to go wasting his strength     said nanny primly .     we want him good and fresh for when he gets here .         and then  i hope  we shall leave him to fight his battles in his own way     said magrat .   granny clapped her hands together in a businesslike fashion .      quite right     she said .     provided he looks like winning .      they had been meeting at nanny ogg   s cottage .  magrat made an excuse to tarry after granny left  around dawn  allegedly to help nanny with tidying up .      whatever happened to not meddling .     she said .      what do you mean .         you know  nanny .         it   s not proper meddling     said nanny awkwardly .     just helping matters along .         surely you can   t really think that .      nanny sat down and fidgeted with a cushion .      well  see  all this not meddling business is fine in the normal course of things     she said .     not meddling is easy when you don   t have to .  and then i   ve got the family to think about .  our jason   s been in a couple of fights because of what people have been saying .  our shawn was thrown out of the army .  the way i see it  when we get the new king in  he should owe us a few favors .  it   s only fair .         but only last week you were saying       magrat stopped  shocked at this display of pragmatism .      a week is a long time in magic     said nanny .     fifteen years  for one thing .  anyway  esme is determined and i   m in no mood to stop her .         so what you   re saying     said magrat  icily     is that this    not meddling    thing is like taking a vow not to swim .  you   ll absolutely never break it unless of course you happen to find yourself in the water .         better than drowning     nanny said .   she reached up to the mantelpiece and took down a clay pipe that was like a small tar pit .  she lit it with a spill from the remains of the fire  while greebo watched her carefully from his cushion .   magrat idly lifted the hood from the ball and glared at it .      i think     she said     that i will never really understand about witchcraft .  just when i think i   ve got a grip on it  it changes .         we   re all just people .     nanny blew a cloud of blue smoke at the chimney .     everyone   s just people .         can i borrow the crystal .     said magrat suddenly .      feel free     said nanny .  she grinned at magrat   s back .     had a row with your young man .     she said .      i really don   t know what you   re talking about .         haven   t seen him around for weeks .         oh  the duke sent him to       magrat stopped  and went on      sent him away for something or other .  not that it bothers me at all  either way .         so i see .  take the ball  by all means .      magrat was glad to get back home .  no one was about on the moors at night anyway  but over the last couple of months things had definitely been getting worse .  on top of the general suspicion of witches  it was dawning on the few people in lancre who had any dealings with the outside world that a  either more things had been happening than they had heard about before or b  time was out of joint .  it wasn   t easy to prove   but the few traders who came along the mountain tracks after the winter seemed to be rather older than they should have been .  unexplained happenings were always more or less expected in the ramtops because of the high magical potential  but several years disappearing overnight was a bit of a first .   she locked the door  fastened the shutters  and carefully laid the green glass globe on the kitchen table .   she concentrated       the fool dozed under the tarpaulins of the river barge  heading up the ankh at a steady two miles an hour .  it wasn   t an exciting method of transport but it got you there eventually .   he looked safe enough  but he was tossing and turning in his sleep .   magrat wondered what it was like  spending your whole life doing something you didn   t want to do .  like being dead  she considered  only worse  the reason being  you were alive to suffer it .   she considered the fool to be weak  badly led and sorely in need of some backbone .  and she was longing for him to get back  so she could look forward to never seeing him again .     it was a long  hot summer .   they didn   t rush things .  there was a lot of country between ankh morpork and the ramtops .  it was  hwel had to admit  fun .  it wasn   t a word dwarfs were generally at home with .   please yourself went over well .  it always did .  the apprentices excelled themselves .  they forget lines  and played jokes  in sto lat the whole third act of gretalina and mellias was performed against the backdrop for the second act of the mage wars  but no one seemed to notice that the greatest love scene in history was played on a set depicting a tidal wave sweeping across a continent .  that was possibly because tomjon was playing gretalina .  the effect was so disconcertingly riveting that hwel made him swap roles for the next house  if you could apply the term to a barn hired for the day  and the effect still had more rivets than a suit of plate armor  including the helmet  and even though gretalina in this case was now young wimsloe  who was a bit simple and tended to stutter and whose spots might eventually clear up .   the following day  in some nameless village in the middle of an endless sea of cabbages  he let tomjon play old miskin in please yourself  a role that vitoller always excelled in .  you couldn   t let anyone play it who was under the age of forty  not unless you wanted an old miskin with a cushion up his jerkin and greasepaint wrinkles .   hwel didn   t consider himself old .  his father had still been digging three tons of ore a day at the age of two hundred .   now  he felt old .  he watched tomjon hobble off the stage  and for a fleeting instant knew what it was to be a fat old man  pickled in wine  fighting old wars that no one cared about anymore  hanging grimly onto the precipice of late middle age for fear of dropping off into antiquity  but only with one hand  because with the other he was giving the finger to death .  of course  he   d known that when he wrote the part .  but he hadn   t known it .   the same magic didn   t seem to infuse the new play .  they tried it a few times  just to see how it went .  the audience watched attentively  and went home .  they didn   t even bother to throw anything .  it wasn   t that they thought it was bad .  they didn   t think it was anything .   but all the right ingredients were there  weren   t they .  tradition was full of people giving evil rulers a well justified seeing to .  witches were always a draw .  the apparition of death was particularly good  with some lovely lines .  mix them all together   and they seemed to cancel out  become a mere humdrum way of filling the stage for a couple of hours .   late at night  when the cast was asleep  hwel would sit up in one of the carts and feverishly rewrite .  he rearranged scenes  cut lines  added lines  introduced a clown  included another fight  and tuned up the special effects .  it didn   t seem to have any effect .  the play was like some marvelous intricate painting  a feast of impressions close to  a mere blur from the distance .   when the inspirations were sleeting fast he even tried changing the style .  in the morning the early risers grew accustomed to finding discarded experiments decorating the grass around the carts  like extremely literate mushrooms .   tomjon kept one of the strangest        st witche  he   s late .    pause    nd witche  he said he would come .    pause    rd witche  he said he would come but he hasn   t .  this is my last newt .  i saved it for him .  and he hasn   t come .    pause        i think     said tomjon  later     you ought to slow down a bit .  you   ve done what was ordered .  no one said it had to sparkle .         it could  you know .  if i could just get it right .         you   re absolutely sure about the ghost  are you .     said tomjon .  the way he threw the line away made it clear that he wasn   t .      there   s nothing wrong with the ghost     snapped hwel .     the scene with the ghost is the best i   ve done .         i was just wondering if this is the right play for it  that   s all .         the ghost stays .  now let   s get on  boy .        two days later  with the ramtops a blue and white wall that was beginning to dominate the hubward horizon  the company was attacked .  there wasn   t much drama  they had just manhandled the lattys across a ford and were resting in the shade of a grove of trees  which suddenly fruited robbers .   hwel looked along the line of half a dozen stained and rusty blades .  their owners seemed slightly uncertain about what to do next .      we   ve got a receipt somewhere       he began .   tomjon nudged him .     these don   t look like guild thieves     he hissed .     they definitely look freelance to me .      it would be nice to say that the leader of the robbers was a black bearded  swaggering brute  with a red headscarf and one gold earring and a chin you could clean pots with .  actually it would be practically compulsory .  and  in fact  this was so .  hwel thought the wooden leg was overdoing it  but the man had obviously studied the role .      well now     said the bandit chief .     what have we here  and do they have any money .         we   re actors     said tomjon .      that ought to answer both questions     said hwel .      and none of your repartee     said the bandit .     i   ve been to the city  i have .  i know repartee when i see it and       he half turned to his followers  raising an eyebrow to indicate that the next remark was going to be witty      if you   re not careful i can make a few cutting remarks of my own .      there was dead silence behind him until he made an impatient gesture with his cutlass .      all right     he said  against a chorus of uncertain laughter .     we   ll just take any loose change  valuables  food and clothing you might be having .         could i say something .     said tomjon .   the company backed away from him .  hwel smiled at his own feet .      you   re going to beg for mercy  are you .     said the bandit .      that   s right .      hwel thrust his hands deep into his pockets and looked up at the sky  whistling under his breath and trying not to break into a maniac grin .  he was aware that the other actors were also looking expectantly at tomjon .   he   s going to give them the mercy speech from the troll   s tale  he thought        the point i   d just like to make is that       said tomjon  and his stance changed subtly  his voice became deeper  his right hand flung out dramatically          the worth of man lies not in feats of arms  or the fiery hunger o   the ravening           it   s going to be like when that man tried to rob us back in sto lat  hwel thought .  if they end up giving us their swords  what the hell can we do with them .  and it   s so embarrassing when they start crying .   it was at this moment that the world around him took a green tint and he thought he could make out  right on the cusp of hearing  other voices .      there   s men with swords  granny .            rend with glowing blades the marvel of the world       tomjon said  and the voices at the edge of imagination said     no king of mine is going to beg anything off anyone .  give me that milk jug  magrat .            the heart of compassion  the kiss           that was a present from my aunt .            this jewel of jewels  this crown of crowns .      there was silence .  one or two of the bandits were weeping silently into their hands .   their chief said     is that it .      for the first time in his life tomjon looked nonplussed .      well  yes     he said .     er .  would you like me to repeat it .         it was a good speech     the bandit conceded .     but i don   t see what it   s got to do with me .  i   m a practical man .  hand over your valuables .      his sword came up until it was level with tomjon   s throat .      and all the rest of you shouldn   t be standing there like idiots     he added .     come on .  or the boy gets it .      wimsloe the apprentice raised a cautious hand .      what .     said the bandit .      a are you s sure you listened carefully  sir .         i won   t tell you again .  either i hear the clink of coins  or you hear a gurgle .      in fact what they all heard was a whistling noise  high in the air  and the crash as a milk jug  its sides frosted with the ice of altitude  dropped out of the sky onto the spike atop the chief   s helmet .   the remaining bandits took one look at the results  and fled .   the actors stared down at the recumbent bandit .  hwel prodded a lump of frozen milk with his boot .      well  well     he said weakly .      he didn   t take any notice .     whispered tomjon .      a born critic     said the dwarf .  it was a blue and white jug .  funny how little details stood out at a time like this .  it had been smashed several times in the past  he could see  because the pieces had been carefully glued together again .  someone had really loved that jug .      what we   re dealing with here     he said  rallying some shreds of logic     is a freak whirlwind .  obviously .         but milk jugs don   t just drop out of the sky     said tomjon  demonstrating the astonishing human art of denying the obvious .      i don   t know about that .  i   ve heard of fish and frogs and rocks     said hwel .     there   s nothing against crockery .     he began to rally .     it   s just one of these uncommon phenomenons .  they happen all the time in this part of the world  there   s nothing unusual about it .      they got back onto the carts and rode on in unaccustomed silence .  young wimsloe collected every bit of jug he could find and stored them carefully in the props box  and spent the rest of the day watching the sky  hoping for a sugar basin .     the lattys toiled up the dusty slopes of the ramtops  mere motes in the foggy glass of the crystal .      are they all right .     said magrat .      they   re wandering all over the place     said granny .     they may be good at the acting  but they   ve got something to learn about the traveling .         it was a nice jug     said magrat .     you can   t get them like that anymore .  i mean  if you   d have said what was on your mind  there was a flatiron  on the shelf .         there   s more to life than milk jugs .         it had a daisy pattern around the top .      granny ignored her .      i think     she said     it   s time we had a look at this new king .  close up .     she cackled .      you cackled  granny     said magrat darkly .      i did not .  it was     granny fumbled for a word     a chuckle .         i bet black aliss used to cackle .         you want to watch out you don   t end up the same way as she did     said nanny  from her seat by the fire .     she went a bit funny at the finish  you know .  poisoned apples and suchlike .         just because i might have chuckled a   a bit roughly     sniffed granny .  she felt that she was being unduly defensive .     anyway  there   s nothing wrong with cackling .  in moderation .           i think     said tomjon     that we   re lost .      hwel looked at the baking purple moorland around them  which stretched up to the towering spires of the ramtops themselves .  even in the height of summer there were pennants of snow flying from the highest peaks .  it was a landscape of describable beauty .   bees were busy  or at least endeavoring to look and sound busy  in the thyme by the trackside .  cloud shadows flickered over the alpine meadows .  there was the kind of big  empty silence made by an environment that not only doesn   t have any people in it  but doesn   t need them either .   or signposts .      we were lost ten miles ago     said hwel .     there   s got to be a new word for what we are now .         you said the mountains were honeycombed with dwarf mines     said tomjon .     you said a dwarf could tell wherever he was in the mountains .         underground  i said .  it   s all a matter of strata and rock formations .  not on the surface .  all the landscape gets in the way .         we could dig you a hole     said tomjon .   but it was a nice day and  as the road meandered through clumps of hemlock and pine  outposts of the forest  it was pleasant enough to let the mules go at their own pace .  the road  hwel felt  had to go somewhere .   this geographical fiction has been the death of many people .  roads don   t necessarily have to go anywhere  they just have to have somewhere to start .      we are lost  aren   t we .     said tomjon  after a while .      certainly not .         where are we  then .         the mountains .  perfectly clear on any atlas .         we ought to stop and ask someone .      tomjon gazed around at the rolling countryside .  somewhere a lonely curlew howled  or possibly it was a badgar   hwel was a little hazy about rural matters  at least those that took place higher than about the limestone layer .  there wasn   t another human being within miles .      who did you have in mind .     he said sarcastically .      that old woman in the funny hat     said tomjon  pointing .     i   ve been watching her .  she keeps ducking down behind a bush when she thinks i   ve seen her .      hwel turned and looked down at a bramble bush  which wobbled .      ho there  good mother     he said .   the bush sprouted an indignant head .      whose mother .     it said .   hwel hesitated .     just a figure of speech  mrs   miss           mistress     snapped granny weatherwax .     and i   m a poor old woman gathering wood     she added defiantly .   she cleared her throat .     lawks     she went on .     you did give me a fright  young master .  my poor old heart .      there was silence from the carts .  then tomjon said     i   m sorry .         what .     said granny .      your poor old heart what .         what about my poor old heart .     said granny  who wasn   t used to acting like an old woman and had a very limited repertoire in this area .  but it   s traditional that young heirs seeking their destiny get help from mysterious old women gathering wood  and she wasn   t about to buck tradition .      it   s just that you mentioned it     said hwel .      well  it isn   t important .  lawks .  i expect you   re looking for lancre     said granny testily  in a hurry to get to the point .      well  yes     said tomjon .     all day .         you   ve come too far     said granny .     go back about two miles  and take the track on the right  past the stand of pines .      wimsloe tugged at tomjon   s shirt .      when you m meet a m mysterious old lady in the road     he said     you   ve got to offer to s share your lunch .  or help her across the r river .         you have .         it   s t terribly b bad luck not to .      tomjon gave granny a polite smile .      would you care to share our lunch  good mo   old wo   ma   am .      granny looked doubtful .      what is it .         salt pork .      she shook her head .     thanks all the same     she said graciously .     but it gives me wind .      she turned on her heel and set off through the bushes .      we could help you across the river if you like     shouted tomjon after her .      what river .     said hwel .     we   re on the moor  there can   t be a river in miles .         y you   ve got to get them on y your side     said wimsloe .     then t they help you .         perhaps we should have asked her to wait while we went and looked for one     said hwel sourly .   they found the turning .  it led into a forest criss crossed with as many tracks as a marshalling yard  the sort of forest where the back of your head tells you the trees are turning around to watch you as you go past and the sky seems to be very high up and a long way off .  despite the heat of the day a dank  impenetrable gloom hovered among the tree trunks  which crowded up to the track as if intending to obliterate it completely .   they were soon lost again  and decided that being lost somewhere where you didn   t know where you were was even worse than being lost in the open .      she could have given more explicit instructions     said hwel .      like ask at the next crone     said tomjon .     look over there .      he stood up in the seat .      ho there  old   good       he hazarded .   magrat pushed back her shawl .      just a humble wood gatherer     she snapped .  she held up a twig for proof .  several hours waiting with nothing but trees to talk to hadn   t improved her temper .   wimsloe nudged tomjon  who nodded and fixed his face in an ingratiating smile .      would you care to share our lunch  old   good wo   miss .     he said .     it   s only salt pork  i   m afraid .         meat is extremely bad for the digestive system     said magrat .     if you could see inside your colon you   d be horrified .         i think i would     muttered hwel .      did you know that an adult male carries up to five pounds of undigested red meat in his intestines at all times .     said magrat  whose informative lectures on nutrition had been known to cause whole families to hide in the cellar until she went away .     whereas pine kernels and sunflower seeds           there aren   t any rivers around that you need helping over  are there .     said tomjon desperately .      don   t be silly     said magrat .     i   m just a humble wood gatherer  lawks  collecting a few sticks and mayhap directing lost travelers on the road to lancre .         ah     said hwel     i thought we   d get to that .         you fork left up ahead and turn right at the big stone with the crack in it  you can   t miss it     said magrat .      fine     growled hwel .     well  we won   t keep you .  i   m sure you   ve got a lot of wood to collect and so forth .      he whistled the mules into a plod again  grumbling to himself .   when  an hour later  the track ran out among a landscape of house sized boulders  hwel laid down the reins carefully and folded his arms .  tomjon stared at him .      what do you think you   re doing .     he said .      waiting     said the dwarf grimly .      it   ll be getting dark soon .         we won   t be here long     said hwel .   eventually nanny ogg gave up and came out from behind her rock .      it   s salt pork  understand .     said hwel sharply .     take it or leave it  ok .  now   which way   s lancre .         keep on  left at the ravine  then you pick up the track that leads to a bridge  you can   t miss it     said nanny promptly .   hwel grabbed the reins .     you forgot about the lawks .         bugger .  sorry .  lawks .         and you   re a humble old wood gatherer  i expect     hwel went on .      spot on  lad     said nanny cheerfully .     just about to make a start  as a matter of fact .      tomjon nudged the dwarf .      you forgot about the river     he said .  hwel glared at him .      oh yes     he muttered     and can you wait here while we go and find a river .         to help you across     said tomjon carefully .   nanny ogg gave him a bright smile .     there   s a perfectly good bridge     she said .     but i wouldn   t say no to a lift .  move over .      to hwel   s irritation nanny ogg hitched up her skirts and scrambled onto the board  inserting herself between tomjon and the dwarf and then twisting like an oyster knife until she occupied half the seat .      you mentioned salt pork     she said .     there wouldn   t be any mustard  would there .         no     said hwel sullenly .      can   t abide salt pork without condiments     said nanny conversationally .     but pass it over  anyway .     wimsloe wordlessly handed over the basket holding the troupe   s supper .  nanny lifted the lid and gave it a critical assessment .      that cheese in there is a bit off     she said .     it needs eating up quick .  what   s in the leather bottle .         beer     said tomjon  a fraction of a second before hwel had the presence of mind to say     water .         pretty weak stuff     said nanny  eventually .  she fumbled in her apron pocket for her tobacco pouch .      has anyone got a light .     she inquired .   a couple of actors produced bundles of matches .  nanny nodded  and put the pouch away .      good     she said .     now  has anyone got any tobacco .        half an hour later the lattys rattled over the lancre bridge  across some of the outlying farmlands  and through the forests that made up most of the kingdom .      this is it .     said tomjon .      well  not all of it     said nanny  who had been expecting rather more enthusiasm .     there   s lots more of it behind the mountains over there .  but this is the flat bit .         you call this flat .         flattish     nanny conceded .     but the air   s good .  that   s the palace up there  offering outstanding views of the surrounding countryside .         you mean forests .         you   ll like it here     said nanny encouragingly .      it   s a bit small .      nanny thought about this .  she   d spent nearly all her life inside the boundaries of lancre .  it had always seemed about the right size to her .      bijou     she said .     handy foreverywhere .         everywhere where .      nanny gave up .     everywhere close     she said .   hwel said nothing .  the air was good  rolling down the unclimbable slopes of the ramtops like a sinus wash  tinted with turpentine from the high forests .  they passed through a gateway into what was  up here  probably called a town  the cosmopolitan he had become decided that  down on the plains  it would just about have qualified as an open space .      there   s an inn     said tomjon doubtfully .   hwel followed his gaze .     yes     he said  eventually .     yes  it probably is .         when are we going to do the play .         i don   t know .  i think we just send up to the castle and say we   re here .     hwel scratched his chin .     fool said the king or whoever would want to see the script .      tomjon looked around lancre town .  it seemed peaceful enough .  it didn   t look like the kind of place likely to turn actors out at nightfall .  it needed the population .      this is the capital city of the kingdom     said nanny ogg .     well designed streets  you   ll notice .         streets .     said tomjon .      street     corrected granny .     also houses in quite good repair  stone   s throw from river           throw .         drop     nanny conceded .     neat middens  look  and extensive           madam  we   ve come to entertain the town  not buy it     said hwel .   nanny ogg looked sidelong at tomjon .      just wanted you to see how attractive it is     she said .      your civic pride does you credit     said hwel .     and now  please  leave the cart .  i   m sure you   ve got some wood to gather .  lawks .         much obliged for the snack     said nanny  climbing down .      meals     corrected hwel .   tomjon nudged him .     you ought to be more polite     he said .     you never know .     he turned to nanny .     thank you  good   oh  she   s gone .           they   ve come to do a theater     said nanny .   granny weatherwax carried on shelling beans in the sun  much to nanny   s annoyance .      well .  aren   t you going to say something .  i   ve been finding out things     she said .     picking up information .  not sitting around making soup           stew .         i reckon it   s very important     sniffed nanny .      what kind of a theater .         they didn   t say .  something for the duke  i think .         what   s he want a theater for .         they didn   t say that  either .         it   s probably all a trick to get in the castle     granny said knowingly .     very clever idea .  did you see anything in the carts .         boxes and bundles and such .         they   ll be full of armor and weapons  depend upon it .      nanny ogg looked doubtful .      they didn   t look very much like soldiers to me .  they were awfully young and spotty .         clever .  i expect in the middle of the play the king will manifest his destiny  right where everyone can see him .  good plan .         that   s another thing     said nanny  picking up a bean pod and chewing it .     he doesn   t seem to like the place much .         of course he does .  it   s in his blood .         i brought him the pretty way .  he didn   t seem very impressed .      granny hesitated .      he was probably suspicious of you     she concluded .     he was probably too overcome to speak  really .      she put down the bowl of beans and looked thoughtfully at the trees .      have you got any family still working up at the castle .     she said .      shirl and daff help out in the kitchens since the cook went off his head .         good .  i   ll have a word with magrat .  i think we should see this theater .           perfect     said the duke .      thank you     said hwel .      you   ve got it exactly spot on about that dreadful accident     said the duke .     you might almost have been there .  ha .  ha .         you weren   t  were you .     said lady felmet  leaning forward and glaring at the dwarf .      i just used my imagination     said hwel hurriedly .  the duchess glared at him  suggesting that his imagination could consider itself lucky it wasn   t being dragged off to the courtyard to explain itself to four angry wild horses and a length of chain .      exactly right     said the duke  leafing one handedly through the pages .     this is exactly  exactly  exactly how it was .         will have been     snapped the duchess .   the duke turned another page .      you   re in this too     he said .     amazing .  it   s a word for word how i   m going to remember it .  i see you   ve got death in it  too .         always popular     said hwel .     people expect it .         how soon can you act it .         stage it     corrected hwel  and added     we   ve tried it out .  as soon as you like .     and then we can get away from here  he said to himself  away from your eyes like two raw eggs and this female mountain in the red dress and this castle which seems to act like a magnet for the wind .  this is not going to go down as one of my best plays  i know that much .      how much did we say we were going to pay you .     said the duchess .      i think you mentioned another hundred silver pieces     said hwel .      worth every penny     said the duke .   hwel left hurriedly  before the duchess could start to bargain .  but he felt he   d gladly pay something to be out of this place .  bijou  he thought .  gods  how could anyone like a kingdom like this .     the fool waited in the meadow with the lake .  he stared wistfully at the sky and wondered where the hell magrat was .  this was  she said  their place  the fact that a few dozen cows also shared it at the moment didn   t appear to make any difference .   she turned up in a green dress and a filthy temper .      what   s all this about a play .     she said .   the fool sagged onto a willow log .      aren   t you glad to see me .     he said .      well  yes .  of course .  now  this play           my lord wants something to convince people that he is the rightful king of lancre .  himself mostly  i think .         is that why you went to the city .         yes .         it   s disgusting .      the fool sat calmly .     you would prefer the duchess   s approach .     he said .     she just thinks they ought to kill everyone .  she   s good at that sort of thing .  and then there   d be fighting  and everything .  lots of people would die anyway .  this way might be easier .         oh  where   s your spunk  man .         pardon .         don   t you want to die nobly for a just cause .         i   d much rather live quietly for one .  it   s all right for you witches  you can do what you like  but i   m circumscribed     said the fool .   magrat sat down beside him .  find out all about this play  granny had ordered .  go and talk to that jingling friend of yours .  she   d replied  he   s very loyal .  he might not tell me anything .  and granny had said  this is no time for half measures .  if you have to  seduct him .      when   s this play going to be  then .     she said  moving closer .      marry  i   m sure i   m not allowed to tell you     said the fool .     the duke said to me  he said  don   t tell the witches that it   s tomorrow night .         i shouldn   t  then     agreed magrat .      at eight o   clock .         i see .         but meet for sherry beforehand at seven thirty  i   faith .         i expect you shouldn   t tell me who is invited  either     said magrat .      that   s right .  most of the dignitaries of lancre .  you understand i   m not telling you this .         that   s right     said magrat .      but i think you have a right to know what it is you   re not being told .         good point .  is there still that little gate around the back  that leads to the kitchens .         the one that is often left unguarded .         yes .         oh  we hardly ever guard it these days .         do you think there might be someone guarding it at around eight o   clock tomorrow .         well  i might be there .         good .      the fool pushed away the wet nose of an inquisitive cow .      the duke will be expecting you     he added .      you said he said we weren   t to know .         he said i mustn   t tell you .  but he also said     they   ll come anyway  i hope they do .     strange  really .  he seemed in a very good mood when he said it .  um .  can i see you after the show .         is that all he said .         oh  there was something about showing witches their future .  i didn   t understand it .  i really would like to see you after the show  you know .  i brought           i think i might be washing my hair     said magrat vaguely .     excuse me  i really ought to be going .         yes  but i brought you this pres       said the fool vaguely  watching her departing figure .   he sagged as she disappeared between the trees  and looked down at the necklace wound tightly between his nervous fingers .  it was  he had to admit  terribly tasteless  but it was the sort of thing she liked  all silver and skulls .  it had cost him too much .   a cow  misled by his horns  stuck its tongue in his ear .   it was true  the fool thought .  witches did do unpleasant things to people  sometimes .     tomorrow night came  and the witches went by a roundabout route to the castle  with considerable reluctance .      if he wants us to be here  i don   t want to go     said granny .     he   s got some plan .  he   s using headology on us .         there   s something up     said magrat .     he had his men set fire to three cottages in our village last night .  he always does that when he   s in a good mood .  that new sergeant is a quick man with the matches  too .         our daff said she saw them actors practicin    this morning     said nanny ogg  who was carrying a bag of walnuts and a leather bottle from which rose a rich  sharp smell .     she said it was all shouting and stabbing and then wondering who done it and long bits with people muttering to themselves in loud voices .         actors     said granny  witheringly .     as if the world weren   t full of enough history without inventing more .         they shout so loud  too     said nanny .     you can hardly hear yourself talk .     she was also carrying  deep in her apron pocket  a lump of haunted castle rock .  the king was getting in free .   granny nodded .  but  she thought  it was going to be worth it .  she hadn   t got the faintest idea what tomjon had in mind  but her inbuilt sense of drama assured her that the boy would be bound to do something important .  she wondered if he would leap off the stage and stab the duke to death  and realized that she was hoping like hell that he would .      all hail wossname     she said under her breath     who shall be king here  after .         let   s get a move on     said nanny .     all the sherry   ll be gone .      the fool was waiting despondently inside the little wicket gate .  his face brightened when he saw magrat  and then froze in an expression of polite surprise when he saw the other two .      there   s not going to be any trouble  is there .     he said .     i don   t want there to be any trouble .  please .         i   m sure i don   t know what you mean     said granny regally  sweeping past .      wotcha  jinglebells     said nanny  elbowing the man in the ribs .     i hope you haven   t been keeping our girl here up late o   nights .         nanny .     said magrat  shocked .  the fool gave the terrified  ingratiating rictus of young men everywhere when confronted by importunate elderly women commenting on their intimately personal lives .   the older witches brushed past .  the fool grabbed magrat   s hand .      i know where we can get a good view     he said .   she hesitated .      it   s all right     said the fool urgently .     you   ll be perfectly safe with me .         yes  i will  won   t i     said magrat  trying to look around him to see where the others had gone .      they   re staging the play outside  in the big courtyard .  we   ll get a lovely view from one of the gate towers  and no one else will be there .  i put some wine up there for us  and everything .      when she still looked half reluctant he added     and there   s a cistern of water and a fireplace that the guards use sometimes .  in case you want to wash your hair .        the castle was full of people standing around in that polite  sheepish way affected by people who see each other all day and are now seeing each other again in unusual social circumstances  like an office party .  the witches passed quite unremarked among them and found seats in the rows of benches in the main courtyard  set up before a hastily assembled stage .   nanny ogg waved her bag of walnuts at granny .      want one .     she said .   an alderman of lancre shuffled past her and pointed politely to the seat on her left .      is anyone sitting here .     he said .      yes     said nanny .   the alderman looked distractedly at the rest of the benches  which were filling up fast  and then down at the clearly empty space in front of him .  he hitched up his robes with a determined expression .      i think that since the play is commencing to start  your friends must find a seat elsewhere  when they arrive     he said  and sat down .   within seconds his face went white .  his teeth began to chatter .  he clutched at his stomach and groaned .       i told you     said nanny  as he lurched away .     what   s the good of asking if you   re not going to listen .     she leaned toward the empty seat .     walnut .         no  thank you     said king verence  waving a spectral hand .     they go right through me  you know .         pray  gentles all  list to our tale           what   s this .     hissed granny .     who   s the fellow in the tights .         he   s the prologue     said nanny .     you have to have him at the beginning so everyone knows what the play   s about .         can   t understand a word of it     muttered granny .     what   s a gentle  anyway .         type of maggot     said nanny .      that   s nice  isn   t it .     hallo maggots  welcome to the show .     puts people in a nice frame of mind  doesn   t it .      there was a chorus of    sshs .         these walnuts are damn tough     said nanny  spitting one out into her hand .     i   m going to have to take my shoe off to this one .      granny subsided into unaccustomed  troubled silence  and tried to listen to the prologue .  the theater worried her .  it had a magic of its own  one that didn   t belong to her  one that wasn   t in her control .  it changed the world  and said things were otherwise than they were .  and it was worse than that .  it was magic that didn   t belong to magical people .  it was commanded by ordinary people  who didn   t know the rules .  they altered the world because it sounded better .   the duke and duchess were sitting on their thrones right in front of the stage .  as granny glared at them the duke half turned  and she saw his smile .   i want the world the way it is  she thought .  i want the past the way it was .  the past used to be a lost better than it is now .   and the band struck up .   hwel peered around a pillar and signaled to wimsloe and brattsley  who hobbled out into the glare of the torches .   old man  an elder      what hath befell the land .      old woman  a crone         tis a terror        the dwarf watched them for a few seconds from the wings  his lips moving soundlessly .  then he scuttled back to the guardroom where the rest of the cast were still in the last hasty stages of dressing .  he uttered the stage manager   s traditional scream of rage .      c   mon     he ordered .     soldiers of the king  at the double .  and the witches   where are the blasted witches .      three junior apprentices presented themselves .      i   ve lost my wart .         the cauldon   s all full of yuk .         there   s something living in this wig .         calm down  calm down     screamed hwel .     it   ll all be all right on the night .         this is the night  hwel .      hwel snatched a handful of putty from the makeup table and slammed on a wart like an orange .  the offending straw wig was rammed on its owner   s head  livestock and all  and the cauldron was very briefly inspected and pronounced full of just the right sort of yuk  nothing wrong with yuk like that .   on stage a guard dropped his shield  bent down to pick it up  and dropped his spear .  hwel rolled his eyes and offered up a silent prayer to any gods that might be watching .   it was already going wrong .  the earlier rehearsals had their little teething troubles  it was true  but hwel had known one or two monumental horrors in his time and this one was shaping up to be the worst .  the company was more jittery than a potful of lobsters .  out of the corner of his ear he heard the on stage dialogue falter  and scurried to the wings .         avenge the terror of thy father   s death       he hissed  and hurried back to the trembling witches .  he groaned .  divers alarums .  this lot were supposed to be terrorizing a kingdom .  he had about a minute before the cue .      right .     he said  pulling himself together .     now  what are you .  you   re evil hags  right .         yes  hwel     they said meekly .      tell me what you are     he commanded .      we   re evil hags  hwel .         louder .         we   ve evil hags .      hwel stalked the length of the quaking line  then turned abruptly on his heel     and what are you going to do .      the  nd witche scratched his crawling wig .      we   re going to curse people .     he ventured .     it says in the script           i can   t hear you .         we   re going to curse people .     they chorused  springing to attention and staring straight ahead to avoid his gaze .   hwel stumped back along the line .      what are you .         we   re hags  hwel .         what kind of hags .         we   re black and midnight hags .     they yelled  getting into the spirit .      what kind of black and midnight hags .         evil black and midnight hags .         are you scheming .         yeah .         are you secret .         yeah .      hwel drew himself to his full height  such as it was .      what are you .     he screamed .      we   re scheming evil secret black and midnight hags .         right .     he pointed a vibrating finger toward the stage and lowered his voice and  at that moment  a dramatic inspiration dived through the atmosphere and slammed into his creative node  causing him to say     now i want you to get out there and give    em hell .  not for me .  not for the goddam captain .     he shifted the butt of an imaginary cigar from one side of his mouth to the other  and pushed back a nonexistent tin helmet  and rasped     but for corporal walkowski and his little dawg .      they stared at him in disbelief .   on cue  someone shook a sheet of tin and broke the spell .   hwel rolled his eyes .  he   d grown up in the mountains  where thunderstorms stalked from peak to peak on legs of lightning .  he remembered thunderstorms that left mountains a different shape and flattened whole forests .  somehow  a sheet of tin wasn   t the same  no matter how enthusiastically it was shaken .   just once  he thought  just once .  let me get it right just once .   he opened his eyes and glared at the witches .      what are you hanging around here for .     he yelled .     get out there and curse them .      he watched them scamper onto the stage  and then tomjon tapped him on the head .      hwel  there   s no crown .         hmm .     said the dwarf  his mind wrestling with ways of building thunder and lightning machines .      there   s no crown  hwel .  i   ve got to wear a crown .         of course there   s a crown .  the big one with the red glass  very impressive  we used it in that place with the big square           i think we left it there .      there was another tinny roll of thunder but  even so  the part of hwel that was living the play heard a faltering voice on stage .  he darted to the wings .         i have smother   d many a babe       he hissed  and sprinted back .      well  just find another one  then     he said vaguely .     in the props box .  you   re the evil king  you   ve got to have a crown .  get on with it  lad  you   re on in a few minutes .  improvise .      tomjon wandered back to the box .  he   d grown up among crowns  big golden crowns made of wood and plaster  studded with finest glass .  he   d cut his teeth on the hat brims of authority .  but most of them had been left in the dysk now .  he pulled out collapsible daggers and skulls and vases  the strata of the years and  right at the bottom  his fingers closed on something thin and crown shaped  which no one had ever wanted to wear because it looked so uncrownly .   it would be nice to say it tingled under his hand .  perhaps it did .     granny was sitting as still as a statue  and almost as cold .  the horror of realization was stealing over her .      that   s us     she said .     round that silly cauldron .  that   s meant to be us  gytha .      nanny ogg paused with a walnut halfway to her gums .  she listened to the words .      i never shipwrecked anybody .     she said .     they just said they shipwreck people .  i never did .      up in the tower magrat elbowed the fool in the ribs .      green blusher     she said  staring at the  rd witche .     i don   t look like that .  i don   t  do i .         absolutely not     said the fool .      and that hair .      the fool peered through the crenellations like an over eager gargoyle .      it looks like straw     he said .     not very clean  either .      he hesitated  picking at the lichened stonework with his fingers .  before he   d left the city he   d asked hwel for a few suitable words to say to a young lady  and he had been memorizing them on the way home .  it was now or never .      i   d like to know if i could compare you to a summer   s day .  because   well  june   th was quite nice  and   oh .  you   ve gone          king verence gripped the edge of his seat  his fingers went through it .  tomjon had strutted onto the stage .      that   s him  isn   t it .  that   s my son .      the uncracked walnut fell from nanny ogg   s fingers and rolled onto the floor .  she nodded .   verence turned a haggard  transparent face toward her .      but what is he doing .  what is he saying .      nanny shook her head .  the king listened with his mouth open as tomjon  lurching crabwise across the stage  launched into his major speech .      i think he   s meant to be you     said nanny  distantly .      but i never walked like that .  why   s he got a hump on his back .  what   s happened to his leg .     he listened some more  and added  in horrified tones     and i certainly never did that .  or that .  why is he saying i did that .      the look he gave nanny was full of pleading .  she shrugged .   the king reached up  lifted off his spectral crown  and examined it .      and it   s my crown he   s wearing .  look  this is it .  and he   s saying i did all those       he paused for a minute  to listen to the latest couplet  and added     all right .  maybe i did that .  so i set fire to a few cottages .  but everyone does that .  it   s good for the building industry  anyway .      he put the ghostly crown back on his head .      why   s he saying all this about me .     he pleaded .      it   s art     said nanny .     it wossname  holds a mirror up to life .      granny turned slowly in her seat to look at the audience .  they were staring at the performance  their faces rapt .  the words washed over them in the breathless air .  this was real .  this was more real even than reality .  this was history .  it might not be true  but that had nothing to do with it .   granny had never had much time for words .  they were so insubstantial .  now she wished that she had found the time .  words were indeed insubstantial .  they were as soft as water  but they were also as powerful as water and now they were rushing over the audience  eroding the levees of veracity  and carrying away the past .   that   s us down there  she thought .  everyone knows who we really are  but the things down there are what they   ll remember   three gibbering old baggages in pointy hats .  all we   ve ever done  all we   ve ever been  won   t exist anymore .   she looked at the ghost of the king .  well  he   d been no worse than any other king .  oh  he might burn down the odd cottage every now and again  in a sort of absent minded way  but only when he was really angry about something  and he could give it up any time he liked .  where he wounded the world  he left the kind of wounds that healed .   whoever wrote this theater knew about the uses of magic .  even i believe what   s happening  and i know there   s no truth in it .   this is art holding a mirror up to life .  that   s why everything is exactly the wrong way around .   we   ve lost .  there is nothing we can do against this without becoming exactly what we aren   t .   nanny ogg gave her a violent nudge in the ribs .      did you hear that .     she said .     one of    em said we put babbies in the cauldron .  they   ve done a slander on me .  i   m not sitting here and have   em say we put babbies in a cauldron .      granny grabbed her shawl as she tried to stand up .      don   t do anything .     she hissed .     it   ll make things worse .            ditch delivered by a drabe     they said .  that   ll be young millie hipwood  who didn   t dare tell her mum and then went out gathering firewood .  i was up all night with that one     nanny muttered .     fine girl she produced .  it   s a slander .  what   s a drabe .     she added .      words     said granny  half to herself .     that   s all that   s left .  words .         and now there   s a man with a trumpet come on .  what   s he going to do .  oh .  end of act one     said nanny .   the words won   t be forgotten  thought granny .  they   ve got a power to them .  they   re damn good words  as words go .   there was yet another rattle of thunder  which ended with the kind of crash made  for example  by a sheet of tin escaping from someone   s hands and hitting the wall .   in the world outside the stage the heat pressed down like a pillow  squeezing the very life out of the air .  granny saw a footman bend down to the duke   s ear .  no  he won   t stop the play .  of course he won   t .  he wants it to run its course .   the duke must have felt the heat of her gaze on the back of his neck .  he turned  focused on her  and gave her a strange little smile .  then he nudged his wife .  they both laughed .   granny weatherwax was often angry .  she considered it one of her strong points .  genuine anger was one of the world   s great creative forces .  but you had to learn how to control it .  that didn   t mean you let it trickle away .  it meant you dammed it  carefully  let it develop a working head  let it drown whole valleys of the mind and then  just when the whole structure was about to collapse  opened a tiny pipeline at the base and let the iron hard stream of wrath power the turbines of revenge .   she felt the land below her  even through several feet of foundations  flagstones  one thickness of leather and two thicknesses of sock .  she felt it waiting .   she heard the king say     my own flesh and blood .  why has he done this to me .  i   m going to confront him .      she gently took nanny ogg   s hand .      come  gytha     she said .     lord felmet sat back in his throne and beamed madly at the world  which was looking good right at the moment .  things were working out better than he had dared to hope .  he could feel the past melting behind him  like ice in the spring thaw .   on an impulse he called the footman back .      call the captain of the guard     he said     and tell him to find the witches and arrest them .      the duchess snorted .      remember what happened last time  foolish man .         we left two of them loose     said the duke .     this time   all three .  the tide of public feeling is on our side .  that sort of thing affects witches  depend upon it .      the duchess cracked her knuckles to indicate her view of public opinion .      you must admit  my treasure  that the experiment seems to be working .         it would appear so .         very well .  don   t just stand there  man .  before the play ends  tell him .  those witches are to be under lock and key .        death adjusted his cardboard skull in front of the mirror  twitched his cowl into a suitable shape  stood back and considered the general effect .  it was going to be his first speaking part .  he wanted to get it right .      cower now  brief mortals     he said .     for i am death     gainst whom no   no   no   hwel     gainst whom no .         oh  good grief  dafe .        gainst whom no lock will hold nor fasten   d portal bar     i really don   t see why you have difficulty with   not that way up  you idiots .     hwel strode off through the backstage m  l  e in pursuit of a pair of importunate scene shifters .      right     said death  to no one in particular .  he turned back to the mirror .         gainst whom no   tumpty tum   nor tumpty tumpty bar     he said  uncertainly  and flourished his scythe .  the end fell off .      do you think i   m fearsome enough .     he said  as he tried to fix it on again .   tomjon  who was sitting on his hump and trying to drink some tea  gave him an encouraging nod .      no problem  my friend     he said .     compared to a visit from you  even death himself would hold no fears .  but you could try a bit more hollowness .         how d   you mean .      tomjon put down his cup .  shadows seemed to move across his face  his eyes sank  his lips drew back from his teeth  his skin stretched and paled .      i have come to get you  you terrible actor     he intoned  each syllable falling into place like a coffin lid .  his features sprang back into shape .      like that     he said .   dafe  who had flattened himself against the wall  relaxed a bit and gave a nervous giggle .      gods  i don   t know how you do it     he said .     honestly  i   ll never be as good as you .         there really isn   t anything to it .  now run along  hwel   s fit to be tied as it is .      dafe gave him a look of gratitude and ran off to help with the scene shifting .   tomjon sipped his tea uneasily  the backstage noises whirring around him like so much fog .  he was worried .   hwel had said that everything about the play was fine  except for the play itself .  and tomjon kept thinking that the play itself was trying to force itself into a different shape .  his mind had been hearing other words  just too faint for hearing .  it was almost like eavesdropping on a conversation .  he   d had to shout more to drown out the buzzing in his head .   this wasn   t right .  once a play was written it was  well  written .  it shouldn   t come alive and start twisting itself around .   no wonder everyone needed prompting all the time .  the play was writhing under their hands  trying to change itself .   ye gods  he   d be glad to get out of this spooky castle  and away from this mad duke .  he glanced around  decided that it would be some time before the next act was called  and wandered aimlessly in search of fresher air .   a door yielded to his touch and he stepped out onto the battlements .  he pushed it shut behind him  cutting off the sounds of the stage and replacing them by a velvet hush .  there was a livid sunset imprisoned behind bars of cloud  but the air was as still as a mill pond and as hot as a furnace .  in the forest below some night bird screamed .   he walked to the other end of the battlements and peered down into the sheer depths of the gorge .  far beneath  the lancre boiled in its eternal mists .   he turned  and walked into a draft of such icy coldness that he gasped .   unusual breezes plucked at his clothing .  there was a strange muttering in his ear  as though someone was trying to talk to him but couldn   t get the speed right .  he stood rigid for a moment  getting his breath  and then fled for the door .        but we   re not witches .         why do you look like them  then .  tie their hands  lads .         yes  excuse me  but we   re not really witches .      the captain of the guard looked from face to face .  his gaze took in the pointy hats  the disordered hair smelling of damp haystacks  the sickly green complexions and the herd of warts .  guard captain for the duke wasn   t a job that offered long term prospects for those who used initiative .  three witches had been called for  and these seemed to fit the bill .   the captain never went to the theater .  when he was on the rack of adolescence he   d been badly frightened by a punch and judy show  and since then had taken pains to avoid any organized entertainment and had kept away from anywhere where crocodiles could conceivably be expected .  he   d spent the last hour enjoying a quiet drink in the guardroom .      i said tie their hands  didn   t i .     he snapped .      shall we gag them as well  cap   n .         but if you   d just listen  we   re with the theater           yes     said the captain  shuddering .     gag them .         please        the captain leaned down and stared at three pairs of frightened eyes .  he was trembling .      that     he said     is the last time you   ll eat anyone   s sausage .      he was aware that now the soldiers were giving him odd looks as well .  he coughed and pulled himself together .      very well then  my theatrical witches     he said .     you   ve done your show  and now it   s time for your applause .     he nodded to his men .      clap them in chains     he said .     three other witches sat in the gloom behind the stage  staring vacantly into the darkness .  granny weatherwax had picked up a copy of the script  which she peered at from time to time  as if seeking ideas .         divers alarums and excursions        she read  uncertainly .      that means lots of terrible happenings     said magrat .     you always put that in plays .         alarums and what .     said nanny ogg  who hadn   t been listening .      excursions     said magrat patiently .      oh .     nanny ogg brightened a bit .     the seaside would be nice     she said .      do shut up  gytha     said granny weatherwax .     they   re not for you .  they   re only for divers  like it says .  probably so they can recover from all them alarums .         we can   t let this happen     said magrat  quickly and loudly .     if this gets about  witches   ll always be old hags with green blusher .         and meddlin    in the affairs of kings     said nanny .     which we never do  as is well known .         it   s not the meddlin    i object to     said granny weatherwax  her chin on her hand .     it   s the evil meddling .         and the unkindness to animals     muttered magrat .     all that stuff about eye of dog and ear of toad .  no one uses that kind of stuff .      granny weatherwax and nanny ogg carefully avoided one another   s faces .      drabe .     said nanny ogg bitterly .      witches just aren   t like that     said magrat .     we live in harmony with the great cycles of nature  and do no harm to anyone  and it   s wicked of them to say we don   t .  we ought to fill their bones with hot lead .      the other two looked at her with a certain amount of surprised admiration .  she blushed  although not greenly  and looked at her knees .      goodie whemper did a recipe     she confessed .     it   s quite easy .  what you do is  you get some lead  and you           i don   t think that would be appropriate     said granny carefully  after a certain amount of internal struggle .     it could give people the wrong idea .         but not for long     said nanny wistfully .      no  we can   t be having with that sort of thing     said granny  a little more firmly this time .     we   d never hear the last of it .         why don   t we just change the words .     said magrat .     when they come back on stage we could just put the    fluence on them so they forget what they   re saying  and give them some new words .         i suppose you   re an expert at theater words .     said granny sarcastically .     they   d have to be the proper sort  otherwise people would suspect .         shouldn   t be too difficult     said nanny ogg dismissively .     i   ve been studyin    it .  you go tumpty tumpty tumpty .      granny gave this some consideration .      there   s more to it than that  i believe     she said .     some of those speeches were very good .  i couldn   t understand hardly any of it .         there   s no trick to it at all     nanny ogg insisted .     anyway  half of them are forgetting their lines as it is .  it   ll be easy .         we could put words in their mouths .     said magrat .   nanny ogg nodded .     i don   t know about new words     she said .     but we can make them forget these words .      they both looked at granny weatherwax .  she shrugged .      i suppose it   s worth a try     she conceded .      witches as yet unborn will thank us for it     said magrat ardently .      oh  good     said granny .      at last .  what are you three playing at .  we   ve been looking for you everywhere .      the witches turned to see an irate dwarf trying to loom over them .      us .     said magrat .     but we   re not in           oh yes you are  remember  we put it in last week .  act two  downstage  around the cauldron .  you haven   t got to say anything .  you   re symbolizing occult forces at work .  just be as wicked as you can .  come on  there   s good lads .  you   ve done well so far .      hwel slapped magrat on the bottom .     good complexion you   ve got there  wilph     he said encouragingly .     but for goodness    sake use a bit more padding  you   re still the wrong shape .  fine warts there  billem .  i must say     he added  standing back     you look as nasty a bunch of hags as a body might hope to clap eyes on .  well done .  shame about the wigs .  now run along .  curtain up in one minute .  break a leg .      he gave magrat another ringing slap on her rump  slightly hurting his hand  and hurried off to shout at someone else .   none of the witches dared to speak .  magrat and nanny ogg found themselves instinctively turning toward granny .   she sniffed .  she looked up .  she looked around .  she looked at the brightly lit stage behind her .  she brought her hands together with a clap that echoed around the castle  and then rubbed them together .      useful     she said grimly .     let   s do the show right here .      nanny squinted sullenly after hwel .     break your own leg     she muttered .     hwel stood in the wings and gave the signal for the curtains .  and for the thunder .   it didn   t come .      thunder .     he hissed  in a voice heard by half the audience .     get on with it .      a voice from behind the nearest pillar wailed     i went and bent the thunder  hwel .  it just goes clonk clonk .      hwel stood silent for a moment  counting .  the company watched him  awestruck but not  unfortunately  thunderstruck .   at last he raised his fists to the open sky and said     i wanted a storm .  just a storm .  not even a big storm .  any storm .  now i want to make myself absolutely clear .  i have had enough .  i want thunder right now .      the stab of lightning that answered him turned the multihued shadows of the castle into blinding white and searing black .  it was followed by a roll of thunder  on cue .   it was the loudest noise hwel had ever heard .  it seemed to start inside his head and work its way outward .   it went on and on  shaking every stone in the castle .  dust rained down .  a distant turret broke away with balletic slowness and  tumbling end over end  dropped gently into the hungry depths of the gorge .   when it finished it left a silence that rang like a bell .   hwel looked up at the sky .  great black clouds were blowing across the castle  blotting out the stars .   the storm was back .   it had spent ages learning its craft .  it had spent years lurking in distant valleys .  it had practiced for hours in front of a glacier .  it had studied the great storms of the past .  it had honed its art to perfection .  and now  tonight  with what it could see was clearly an appreciative audience waiting for it  it was going to take them by  well   tempest .   hwel smiled .  perhaps the gods did listen  after all .  he wished he   d asked for a really good wind machine as well .   he gestured frantically at tomjon .      get on with it .      the boy nodded  and launched into his main speech .      and now our domination is complete        behind him on the stage the witches bent over the cauldron .      it   s just tin  this one     hissed nanny .     and it   s full of all yuk .         and the fire is just red paper     whispered magrat .     it looked so real from up there  it   s just red paper .  look  you can poke it           never mind     said granny .     just look busy  and wait until i say .      as the evil king and the good duke began the exchange that was going to lead to the exciting duel scene they became uncomfortably aware of activity behind them  and occasional chuckles from the audience .  after a totally inappropriate burst of laughter tomjon risked a sideways glance .   one of the witches was taking their fire to bits .  another one was trying to clean the cauldron .  the third one was sitting with her arms folded  glaring at him .      the very soil cries out at tyranny       said wimsloe  and then caught the expression on tomjon   s face and followed his gaze .  his voice trailed into silence .         and calls me forth for vengeance        prompted tomjon helpfully .      b but       whispered wimsloe  trying to point surreptitiously with his dagger .      i wouldn   t be seen dead with a cauldron like this     said nanny ogg  in a whisper loud enough to carry to the back of the courtyard .     two days    work with a scourer and a bucket of sand  is this .            and calls me forth for vengeance       hissed tomjon .  out of the tail of his eye he saw hwel in the wings  frozen in an attitude of incoherent rage .      how do they make it flicker .     said magrat .      be quiet  you two     said granny .     you   re upsetting people .     she raised her hat to wimsloe .     go ahead  young man .  don   t mind us .         wha .     said wimsloe .      aha  it calls you forth for vengeance  does it .     said tomjon  in desperation .     and the heavens cry revenge  too  i expect .      on cue  the storm produced a thunderbolt that blew the top off another tower     the duke crouched in his seat  his face a panorama of fear .  he extended what had once been a finger .      there they are     he breathed .     that   s them .  what are they doing in my play .  who said they could be in my play .      the duchess  who was less inclined to deal in rhetorical questions  beckoned to the nearest guard .   on stage tomjon was sweating under the load of the script .  wimsloe was incoherent .  now gumridge  who was playing the part of the good duchess in a wig of flax  had lost the thread as well .      aha  thou callst me an evil king  though thou wisperest it so none save i may hear it     tomjon croaked .     and thou hast summoned the guard  possibly by some most secret signal  owing nought to artifice of lips or tongue .      a guard came on crabwise  still stumbling from hwel   s shove .  he stared at granny weatherwax .      hwel says what the hell   s going on .     he hissed .      what was that .     said tomjon .     did i hear you say i come  my lady .         get these people off  he says .      tomjon advanced to the front of the stage .      thou babblest  man .  see how i dodge thy tortoise spear .  i said  see how i dodge thy tortoise spear .  thy spear  man .  you   re holding it in thy bloody hand  for goodness    sake .      the guard gave him a desperate  frozen grin .   tomjon hesitated .  three other actors around him were staring fixedly at the witches .  looming up in front of him with all the inevitability of a tax demand was a sword fight during which  it was beginning to appear  he would have to parry his own wild thrusts and stab himself to death .   he turned to the three witches .  his mouth opened .   for the first time in his life his awesome memory let him down .  he could think of nothing to say .   granny weatherwax stood up .  she advanced to the edge of the stage .  the audience held its breath .  she held up a hand .      ghosts of the mind and all device away  i bid the truth to have       she hesitated      its tumpty tumpty day .      tomjon felt the chill engulf him .  the others  too  jolted into life .   up from out of the depths of their blank minds new words rushed  words red with blood and revenge  words that had echoed among the castle   s stones  words stored in silicon  words that would have themselves heard  words that gripped their mouths so tightly that an attempt not to say them would result in a broken jaw .      do you fear him now .     said gumridge .     and he so amazed with drink .  take his dagger  husband   you are a blade   s width from the kingdom .         i dare not     wimsloe said  trying to look in astonishment at his own lips .      who will know .     gumridge waved a hand toward the audience .  he   d never act so well again .     see  there is only eyeless night .  take the dagger now  take the kingdom tomorrow .  have a stab at it  man .      wimsloe   s hand shook .      i have it  wife     he said .     is this a dagger i see before me .         of course it   s a bloody dagger .  come on  do it now .  the weak deserve no mercy .  we   ll say he fell down the stairs .         but people will suspect .         are there no dungeons .  are there no pilliwinks .  possession is nine parts of the law  husband  when what you possess is a knife .      wimsloe drew his arm back .      i cannot .  he has been kindness itself to me .         and you can be death itself to him          dafe could hear the voices a long way off .  he adjusted his mask  checked the deathliness of his appearance in the mirror  and peered at the script in the empty backstage gloom .      cower now  brief mortals     he said .     i am death     gainst who      gainst who        whom .      oh  thanks     said the boy distractedly .        gainst whom no lock may hold        will hold .      will hold nor fasten   d portal bar  here to   to   to        here to take my tally on this night of kings .   dafe sagged .      you   re so much better at it     he moaned .     you   ve got the right voice and you can remember the words .     he turned around .     it   s only three lines and hwel will   have   my   guts   for .      he froze .  his eyes widened and became two saucers of fear as death snapped his fingers in front of the boy   s rigid face .   forget  he commanded  and turned and stalked silently toward the wings .   his eyeless skull took in the line of costumes  the waxy debris of the makeup table .  his empty nostrils snuffed up the mixed smells of mothballs  grease and sweat .   there was something here  he thought  that nearly belonged to the gods .  humans had built a world inside the world  which reflected it in pretty much the same way as a drop of water reflects the landscape .  and yet   and yet     inside this little world they had taken pains to put all the things you might think they would want to escape from   hatred  fear  tyranny  and so forth .  death was intrigued .  they thought they wanted to be taken out of themselves  and every art humans dreamt up took them further in .  he was fascinated .   he was here for a very particular and precise purpose .  there was a soul to be claimed .  there was no time for inconsequentialities .  but what was time  after all .   his feet did an involuntary little clicking dance across the stones .  alone  in the gray shadows  death tapdanced .      the next night in your dressing room they hang a star     he pulled himself together  adjusted his scythe  and waited silently for his cue .   he   d never missed one yet .   he was going to get out there and slay them .        and you can be death itself to him .  now .      death entered  his feet clicking across the stage .   cower now  brief mortals  he said  for i am death     gainst whom no   no      gainst whom     he hesitated .  he hesitated  for the very first time in the eternity of his existence .   for although the death of the discworld was used to dealing with people by the million  at the same time every death was intimate and personal .   death was seldom seen except by those of an occult persuasion and his clients themselves .  the reason that no one else saw him was that the human brain is clever enough to edit sights too horrible for it to cope with  but the problem here was that several hundred people were in fact expecting to see death at this point  and were therefore seeing him .   death turned slowly and stared back at hundreds of watching eyes .   even in the grip of the truth tomjon recognized a fellow actor in distress  and fought for mastery of his lips .            lock will hold          he whispered  through teeth fixed in a grimace .   death gave him a manic grin of stagefright .   what .  he whispered  in a voice like an anvil being hit with a small lead hammer .            lock will hold  nor fasten   d portal           said tomjon encouragingly .      lock will hold nor fasten   d portal   uh   repeated death desperately  watching his lips .            bar .            bar .      no  i cannot do it .     said wimsloe .     i will be seen .  down there in the hall  someone watches .         there is no one .         i feel the stare .         dithering idiot .  must i put it in for you .  see  his foot is upon the top stair .      wimsloe   s face contorted with fear and uncertainty .  he drew back his hand .      no .      the scream came from the audience .  the duke was half risen from his seat  his tortured knuckles at his mouth .  as they watched he lurched forward between the shocked people .      no .  i did not do it .  it was not like that .  you cannot say it was like that .  you were not there .     he stared at the upturned faces around him  and sagged .      nor was i     he giggled .     i was asleep at the time  you know .  i remember it quite well .  there was blood on the counterpane  there was blood on the floor  i could not wash off the blood  but these are not proper subjects for the inquiry .  i cannot allow the discussion of national security .  it was just a dream  and when i awoke  he   d be alive tomorrow .  and tomorrow it wouldn   t have happened because it was not done .  and tomorrow you can say i did not know .  and tomorrow you can say i had no recollection .  what a noise he made in falling .  enough to wake the dead   who would have thought he had so much blood in him .        by now he had climbed onto the stage  and grinned brightly at the assembled company .      i hope that sorts it all out     he said .     ha .  ha .      in the silence that followed tomjon opened his mouth to utter something suitable  something soothing  and found that there was nothing he could say .   but another personality stepped into him  took over his lips  and spoke thusly      with my own bloody dagger  you bastard .  i know it was you .  i saw you at the top of the stairs  sucking your thumb .  i   d kill you now  except for the thought of having to spend eternity listening to your whining .  i  verence  formerly king of           what testimony is this .     said the duchess .  she stood in front of the stage  with half a dozen soldiers beside her .      these are just slanders     she added .     and treason to boot .  the rantings of mad players .         i was bloody king of lancre .     shouted tomjon .      in which case you are the alleged victim     said the duchess calmly .     and unable to speak for the prosecution .  it is against all precedent .      tomjon   s body turned toward death .      you were there .  you saw it all .      i suspect i would not be considered an appropriate witness .      therefore there is no proof  and where there is no proof there is no crime     said the duchess .  she motioned the soldiers forward .      so much for your experiment     she said to her husband .     i think my way is better .      she looked around the stage  and found the witches .      arrest them     she said .      no     said the fool  stepping out of the wings .      what did you say .         i saw it all     said the fool  simply .     i was in the great hall that night .  you killed the king  my lord .         i did not .     screamed the duke .     you were not there .  i did not see you there .  i order you not to be there .         you did not dare say this before     said lady felmet .      yes  lady .  but i must say it now .      the duke focused unsteadily on him .      you swore loyalty unto death  my fool     he hissed .      yes  my lord .  i   m sorry .         you   re dead .      the duke snatched a dagger from wimsloe   s unresisting hand  darted forward  and plunged it to the hilt into the fool   s heart .  magrat screamed .   the fool rocked back and forth unsteadily .      thank goodness that   s over     he said  as magrat pushed her way through the actors and clasped him to what could charitably be called her bosom .  it struck the fool that he had never looked a bosom squarely in the face  at least since he was a baby  and it was particularly cruel of the world to save the experience until after he was dead .   he gently moved one of magrat   s arms and pulled the despicable horned cowl from his head  and tossed it as far as possible .  he didn   t have to be a fool anymore or  he realized  bother about vows or anything .  what with bosoms as well  death seemed to be an improvement .      i didn   t do it     said the duke .   no pain  thought the fool .  funny  that .  on the other hand  you obviously can   t feel pain when you are dead .  it would be wasted .      you all saw that i didn   t do it     said the duke .   death gave the fool a puzzled look .  then he reached into the recesses of his robes and pulled out an hourglass .  it had bells on it .  he gave it a gentle shake  which made them tinkle .      i gave no orders that any such thing should be done     said the duke calmly .  his voice came from a long way off  from wherever his mind was now .  the company stared at him wordlessly .  it wasn   t possible to hate someone like this  only to feel acutely embarrassed about being anywhere near him .  even the fool felt embarrassed  and he was dead .   death tapped the hourglass  and then peered at it to see if it had gone wrong .      you are all lying     said the duke  in tranquil tones .     telling lies is naughty .      he stabbed several of the nearest actors in a dreamy  gentle way  and then held up the blade .      you see .     he said .     no blood .  it wasn   t me .     he looked up at the duchess  towering over him now like a red tsunami over a small fishing village .      it was her     he said .     she did it .      he stabbed her once or twice  on general principles  and then stabbed himself and let the dagger drop from his fingers .   after a few seconds reflection he said  in a voice far nearer the worlds of sanity     you can   t get me now .      he turned to death .     will there be a comet .     he said .     there must be a comet when a prince dies .  i   ll go and see  shall i .      he wandered away .  the audience broke into applause .      you   ve got to admit he was real royalty     said nanny ogg  eventually .     it only goes to show  royalty goes eccentric far better than the likes of you and me .      death held the hourglass to his skull  his face radiating puzzlement .   granny weatherwax picked up the fallen dagger and tested the blade with her finger .  it slid into the handle quite easily  with a faint squeaking noise .   she passed it to nanny .      there   s your magic sword     she said .   magrat looked at it  and then back at the fool .      are you dead or not .     she said .      i must be     said the fool  his voice slightly muffled .     i think i   m in paradise .         no  look  i   m serious .         i don   t know .  but i   d like to breathe .         then you must be alive .         everyone   s alive     said granny .     it   s a trick dagger .  actors probably can   t be trusted with real ones .         after all  they can   t even keep a cauldron clean     said nanny .      whether everyone is alive or not is a matter for me     said the duchess .     as ruler it is my pleasure to decide .  clearly my husband has lost his wits .     she turned to her soldiers .     and i decree           now .     hissed king verence in granny   s ear .     now .      granny weatherwax drew herself up .      be silent  woman .     she said .     the true king of lancre stands before you .      she clapped tomjon on the shoulder .      what  him .         who  me .         ridiculous     said the duchess .     he   s a mummer  of sorts .         she   s right  miss     said tomjon  on the edge of panic .     my father runs a theater  not a kingdom .         he is the true king .  we can prove it     said granny .      oh  no     said the duchess .     we   re not having that .  there   s no mysterious returned heirs in this kingdom .  guards   take him .      granny weatherwax held up a hand .  the soldiers lurched from foot to foot  uncertainly .      she   s a witch  isn   t she .     said one of them  tentatively .      certainly     said the duchess .   the guards shifted uneasily .      we seen where they turn people into newts     said one .      and then shipwreck them .         yeah  and alarum the divers .         yeah .         we ought to talk about this .  we ought to get extra for witches .         she could do anything to us  look .  she could be a drabe  even .         don   t be foolish     said the duchess .     witches don   t do that sort of thing .  they   re just stories to frighten people .      the guard shook his head .      it looked pretty convincing to me .         of course it did  it was meant       the duchess began .  she sighed  and snatched a spear out of the guard   s hand .      i   ll show you the power of these witches     she said  and hurled it at granny   s face .   granny moved her hand across at snakebite speed and caught the spear just behind the head .      so     she said     and it comes to this  does it .         you don   t frighten me  wyrd sisters     said the duchess .   granny stared her in the eye for a few seconds .  she gave a grunt of surprise .      you   re right     she said .     we really don   t  do we           do you think i haven   t studied you .  your witchcraft is all artifice and illusion  to amaze weak minds .  it holds no fears for me .  do your worst .      granny studied her for a while .      my worst .     she said  eventually .  magrat and nanny ogg shuffled gently out of her way .   the duchess laughed .      you   re clever     she said .     i   ll grant you that much .  and quick .  come on  hag .  bring on your toads and demons  i   ll        she stopped  her mouth opening and shutting a bit without any words emerging .  her lips drew back in a rictus of terror  her eyes looked beyond granny  beyond the world  toward something else .  one knuckled hand flew to her mouth and she made a little whimpering noise .  she froze  like a rabbit that has just seen a stoat and knows  without any doubt  that it is the last stoat that it will ever see .      what have you done to her .     said magrat  the first to dare to speak .  granny smirked .      headology     said granny  and smirked .     you don   t need any black aliss magic for it .         yes  but what have you done .         no one becomes like she is without building walls inside their head     she said .     i   ve just knocked them down .  every scream .  every plea .  every pang of guilt .  every twinge of conscience .  all at once .  there   s a little trick to it .      she gave magrat a condescending smile .     i   ll show you one day  if you like .      magrat thought about it .     it   s horrible     she said .      nonsense     granny smiled terribly .     everyone wants to know their true self .  now  she does .         sometimes  you have to be kind to be cruel     said nanny ogg approvingly .      i think it   s probably the worst thing that could happen to anyone     said magrat  as the duchess swayed backward and forward .      for goodness    sake use your imagination  girl     said granny .     there are far worse things .  needles under the fingernails  for one .  stuff with pliers .         red hot knives up the jacksie     said nanny ogg .     handle first  too  so you cut your fingers trying to pull them out           this is simply the worst that i can do     said granny weatherwax primly .     it   s all right and proper  too .  a witch should act like that  you know .  there   s no need for any dramatic stuff .  most magic goes on in the head .  it   s headology .  now  if you   d        a noise like a gas leak escaped from the duchess   s lips .  her head jerked back suddenly .  she opened her eyes  blinked  and focused on granny .  sheer hatred suffused her features .      guards .     she said .     i told you to take them .      granny   s jaw sagged .     what .     she said .     but   but i showed you your true self           i   m supposed to be upset by that  am i .     as the soldiers sheepishly grabbed granny   s arms the duchess pressed her face close to granny   s  her tremendous eyebrows a v of triumphant hatred .     i   m supposed to grovel on the floor  is that it .  well  old woman  i   ve seen exactly what i am  do you understand  and i   m proud of it .  i   d do it all again  only hotter and longer .  i enjoyed it  and i did it because i wanted to .      she thumped the vast expanse of her chest .      you gawping idiots .     she said .     you   re so weak .  you really think that people are basically decent underneath  don   t you .      the crowd on the stage backed away from the sheer force of her exultation .      well  i   ve looked underneath     said the duchess .     i know what drives people .  it   s fear .  sheer  deep down fear .  there   s not one of you who doesn   t fear me  i can make you widdle your drawers out of terror  and now i   m going to take        at this point nanny ogg hit her on the back of the head with the cauldron .      she does go on  doesn   t she .     she said conversationally  as the duchess collapsed .     she was a bit eccentric  if you ask me .      there was a long  embarrassed silence .   granny weatherwax coughed .  then she treated the soldiers holding her to a bright  friendly smile  and pointed to the mound that was now the duchess .      take her away and put her in a cell somewhere     she commanded .  the men snapped to attention  grabbed the duchess by her arms  and pulled her upright with considerable difficulty .      gently  mind     said granny .   she rubbed her hands together and turned to tomjon  who was watching her with his mouth open .      depend on it     she hissed .     here and now  my lad  you don   t have a choice .  you   re the king of lancre .         but i don   t know how to be a king .         we all seed you .  you had it down just right  including the shouting .         that   s just acting .         act  then .  being a king is  is       granny hesitated  and snapped her fingers at magrat .     what do you call them things  there   s always a hundred of them in anything .      magrat looked bewildered .     do you mean percents .     she said .      them     agreed granny .     most of the percents in being a king is acting  if you ask me .  you ought to be good at it .      tomjon looked for help into the wings  where hwel should have been .  the dwarf was in fact there  but he wasn   t paying much attention .  he had the script in front of him  and was rewriting furiously .     but i assure you  you are not dead .  take it from me .   the duke giggled .  he had found a sheet from somewhere and had draped it over himself  and was sidling along some of the castle   s more deserted corridors .  sometimes he would go    whoo oo    in a low voice .   this worried death .  he was used to people claiming that they were not dead  because death always came as a shock  and a lot of people had some trouble getting over it .  but people claiming that they were dead with every breath in their body was a new and unsettling experience .      i shall jump out on people     said the duke dreamily .     i shall rattle my bones all night  i shall perch on the roof and foretell a death in the house        that   s banshees .      i shall if i want     said the duke  with a trace of earlier determination .     and i shall float through walls  and knock on tables  and drip ectoplasm on anyone i don   t like .  ha .  ha .      it won   t work .  living people aren   t allowed to be ghosts .  i   m sorry .   the duke made an unsuccessful attempt to float through a wall  gave up  and opened a door out onto a crumbling section of the battlements .  the storm had died away a bit  and a thin rind of moon lurked behind the clouds like a ticket tout for eternity .   death stalked through the wall behind him .      well then     said the duke     if i   m not dead  why are you here .      he jumped up onto the wall and flapped his sheet .   waiting .      wait forever  bone face .     said the duke triumphantly .     i shall hover in the twilight world  i shall find some chains to shake  i shall        he stepped backward  lost his balance  landed heavily on the wall and slid .  for a moment the remnant of his right hand scrabbled ineffectually at the stonework  and then it vanished .   death is obviously potentially everywhere at the same time  and in one sense it is no more true to say that he was on the battlements  picking vaguely at non existent particles of glowing metal on the edge of his scythe blade  than that he was waist deep in the foaming  rock toothed waters in the depths of lancre gorge  his calcareous gaze sweeping downward and stopping abruptly at a point where the torrent ran a few treacherous inches over a bed of angular pebbles .   after a while the duke sat up  transparent in the phosphorescent waves .      i shall haunt their corridors     he said     and whisper under the doors on still nights .     his voice grew fainter  almost lost in the ceaseless roar of the river .     i shall make basket chairs creak most alarmingly  just you wait and see .      death grinned at him .   now you   re talking .   it started to rain .     ramtop rain has a curiously penetrative quality which makes ordinary rain seem almost arid .  it poured in torrents over the castle roofs  and somehow seemed to go right through the tiles and fill the great hall with a warm  uncomfortable moistness .    the hall was crowded with half the population of lancre .  outside  the rushing of the rain even drowned out the distant roar of the river .  it soaked the stage .  the colors ran and mingled in the painted backdrop  and one of the curtains sagged away from its rail and flapped sadly into a puddle .   inside  granny weatherwax finished speaking .      you forgot about the crown     whispered nanny ogg .      ah     said granny .     yes  the crown .  it   s on his head  d   you see .  we hid it among the crowns when the actors left  the reason being  no one would look for it there .  see how it fits him so perfectly .      it was a tribute to granny   s extraordinary powers of persuasion that everyone did see how perfectly it fitted tomjon .  in fact the only one who didn   t was tomjon himself  who was aware that it was only his ears that were stopping it becoming a necklace .      imagine the sensation when he put it on for the first time     she went on .     i expect there was an eldritch tingling sensation .         actually  it felt rather       tomjon began  but no one was listening to him .  he shrugged and leaned over to hwel  who was still scribbling busily .      does eldritch mean uncomfortable .     he hissed .   the dwarf looked at him with unfocused eyes .      what .         i said  does eldritch mean uncomfortable .         eh .  oh .  no .  no  i shouldn   t think so .         what does it mean then .         dunno .  oblong  i think .     hwel   s glance returned to his scrawls as though magnetized .     can you remember what he said after all those tomorrows .  i didn   t catch the bit after that           and there wasn   t any need for you to tell everyone i was   adopted     said tomjon .      that   s how it was  you see     said the dwarf vaguely .     best to be honest about these things .  now then  did he actually stab her  or just accuse her .         i don   t want to be a king .     tomjon whispered hoarsely .     everyone says i take after dad .         funny thing  all this taking after people     said the dwarf vaguely .     i mean  if i took after my dad  i   d be a hundred feet underground digging rocks  whereas       his voice died away .  he stared at the nib of his pen as though it held an incredible fascination .      whereas what .         eh .         aren   t you even listening .         i knew it was wrong when i wrote it  i knew it was the wrong way round   what .  oh  yes .  be a king .  it   s a good job .  it seems there   s a lot of competition  at any rate .  i   m very happy for you .  once you   re a king  you can do anything you want .      tomjon looked at the faces of the lancre worthies around the table .  they had a keen  calculating look  like the audience at a fatstock show .  they were weighing him up .  it crept upon him in a cold and clammy way that once he was king  he could do anything he wanted .  provided that what he wanted to do was be king .      you could build your own theater     said hwel  his eyes lighting up for a moment .     with as many trapdoors as you wanted  and magnificent costumes .  you could act in a new play every night .  i mean  it would make the dysk look like a shed .         who would come to see me .     said tomjon  sagging in his seat .      everyone .         what  every night .         you could order them to     said hwel  without looking up .   i knew he was going to say that  tomjon thought .  he can   t really mean it  he added charitably .  he   s got his play .  he doesn   t really exist in this world  not right now at the moment .   he took off the crown and turned it over and over in his hands .  there wasn   t much metal in it  but it felt heavy .  he wondered how heavy it would get if you wore it all the time .   at the head of the table was an empty chair containing  he had been assured  the ghost of his real father .  it would have been nice to report that he had experienced anything more  when being introduced to it  than an icy sensation and a buzzing in the ears .      i suppose i could help father pay off on the dysk     he said .      that would be nice  yes     said hwel .   he spun the crown in his fingers and listened glumly to the talk flowing back and forth over his head .      fifteen years .     said the mayor of lancre .      we had to     said granny weatherwax .      i thought the baker was a bit early last week .         no  no     said the witch impatiently .     it doesn   t work like that .  no one   s lost anything .         according to my figuring     said the man who doubled as lancre   s beadle  town clerk and grave digger     we   ve all lost fifteen years .         no  we   ve all gained them     said the mayor .     it stands to reason .  time   s like this sort of wiggly road  see  but we took a short cut across the fields .         not at all     said the clerk  sliding a sheet of paper across the table .     look here        tomjon let the waters of debate close over him again .   everyone wanted him to be king .  no one thought twice about what he wanted .  his views didn   t count .   yes  that was it .  no one wanted him to be king  not precisely him .  he just happened to be convenient .   gold does not tarnish  at least physically  but tomjon felt that the thin band of metal in his hands had an unpleasant depth to its luster .  it had sat on too many troubled heads .  if you held it to your ear  you could hear the screams .   he became aware of someone else looking at him  their gaze playing across his face like a blowlamp on a lolly .  he looked up .   it was the third witch  the young   the youngest one  with the intense expression and the hedgerow hairstyle .  sitting next to old fool as though she owned a controlling interest .   it wasn   t his face she was examining .  it was his features .  her eyeballs were tracking him from nape to nose like a pair of calipers .  he gave her a little brave smile  which she ignored .  just like everyone else  he thought .   only the fool noticed him  and returned the smile with an apologetic grin and a tiny conspiratorial wave of the fingers that said     what are we doing here  two sensible people like us .     the woman was looking at him again  turning her head this way and that and narrowing her eyes .  she kept glancing at fool and back to tomjon .  then she turned to the oldest witch  the only person in the entire hot  damp room who seemed to have acquired a mug of beer  and whispered in her ear .   the two started a spirited  whispered conversation .  it was  thought tomjon  a particularly feminine way of talking .  it normally took place on doorsteps  with all the participants standing with their arms folded and  if anyone was so ungracious as to walk past  they   d stop abruptly and watch them in silence until they were safely out of earshot .   he became aware that granny weatherwax had stopped talking  and that the entire hall was staring at him expectantly .      hallo .     he said .      it might be a good idea to hold the coronation tomorrow     said granny .     it   s not good for a kingdom to be without a ruler .  it doesn   t like it .      she stood up  pushed back her chair  and came and took tomjon   s hand .  he followed her unprotestingly across the flagstones and up the steps to the throne  where she put her hands on his shoulders and pressed him gently down onto the threadbare red plush cushions .   there was a scraping of benches and chairs .  he looked around in panic .      what   s happening now .     he said .      don   t worry     said granny firmly .     everyone wants to come and swear loyalty to you .  you just nod graciously and ask everyone what they do and if they enjoy it .  oh  and you   d better give them the crown back .      tomjon removed it quickly .      why .     he said .      they want to present it to you .         but i   ve already got it .     said tomjon desperately .   granny gave a patient sigh .      only in the wossname  real sense     she said .     this is more ceremonial .         you mean unreal .         yes     said granny .     but much more important .      tomjon gripped the arms of the throne .      fetch me hwel     he said .      no  you must do it like that .  it   s precedent  you see  first you meet the           i said  fetch me the dwarf .  didn   t you hear me  woman .     this time tomjon got the spin and pitch of his voice just right  but granny rallied magnificently .      i don   t think you quite realize who you are talking to  young man     she said .   tomjon half rose in his seat .  he had played a great many kings  and most of them weren   t the kind of kings who shook hands graciously and asked people whether they enjoyed their work .  they were far more the type of kings who got people to charge into battle at five o   clock on a freezing morning and still managed to persuade them that this was better than being in bed .  he summoned them all  and treated granny weatherwax to a blast of royal hauteur  pride and arrogance .      we thought we were talking to a subject     he said .     now do as we say .      granny   s face was immobile for several seconds as she worked out what to do next .  then she smiled to herself  said lightly     as you wish     and went and dislodged hwel  who was still writing .   the dwarf gave a stiff bow .      none of that     snapped tomjon .     what do i do next .         i don   t know .  do you want me to write an acceptance speech .         i told you .  i don   t want to be king .         could be a problem with an acceptance speech  then     the dwarf agreed .     have you really thought about this .  being king is a great role .         but it   s the only one you get to play .         hmm .  well  just tell them    no     then .         just like that .  will it work .         it   s got to be worth a try .      a group of lancre dignitaries were approaching with the crown on a cushion .  they wore expressions of constipated respect coupled with just a hint of self satisfaction .  they carried the crown as if it was a present for a good boy .   the mayor of lancre coughed behind his hand .      a proper coronation will take some time to arrange     he began     but we would like           no     said tomjon .   the mayor hesitated .     pardon .     he said .      i won   t accept it .      the mayor hesitated again .  his lips moved and his eyes glazed slightly .  he felt that he had got lost somewhere  and decided it would be best to start again .      a proper coronation will take       he ventured .      it won   t     said tomjon .     i will not be king .      the mayor was mouthing like a carp .      hwel .     said tomjon desperately .     you   re good with words .         the problem we   ve got here     said the dwarf     is that    no    is apparently not among the options when you are offered a crown .  i think he could cope with    maybe .         tomjon stood up  and grabbed the crown .  he held it above his head like a tambourine .      listen to me  all of you     he said .     i thank you for your offer  it   s a great honor .  but i can   t accept it .  i   ve worn more crowns than you can count  and the only kingdom i know how to rule has got curtains in front of it .  i   m sorry .      dead silence greeted this .  they did not appear to have been the right words .      another problem     said hwel conversationally     is that you don   t actually have a choice .  you are the king  you see .  it   s a job you are lined up for when you   re born .         i   d be no good at it .         that doesn   t matter .  a king isn   t something you   re good at  it   s something you are .         you can   t leave me here .  there   s nothing but forests .      tomjon felt the suffocating cold sensation again  and the slow buzzing in his ears .  for a moment he thought he saw  faint as a mist  a tall sad man in front of him  stretching out a hand in supplication .      i   m sorry     he whispered .     i really am .      through the fading shape he saw the witches  watching him intently .   beside him hwel said     the only chance you   d have is if there was another heir .  you don   t remember any brothers and sisters  do you .         i don   t remember anyone .  hwel  i        there was another ferocious argument among the witches .  and then magrat was striding  striding across the hall  moving like a tidal wave  moving like a rush of blood to the head  shaking off granny weatherwax   s restraining hand  bearing down on the throne like a piston  and dragging the fool behind her .        i say .         er .  halloee .         er  i say  excuse me  can anyone hear us .      the castle up above was full of hubbub and general rejoicing  and there was no one to hear the polite and frantic voices that echoed along the dungeon passages  getting politer and more frantic with each passing hour .      um  i say .  excuse me .  billem   s got this terrible thing about rats  if you don   t mind .  cooeee .      let the camera of the mind   s eye pan slowly back along the dim  ancient corridors  taking in the dripping fungi  the rusting chains  the damp  the shadows        can anyone hear us .  look  it   s really too much .  there   s been some laughable mistake  look  the wigs come right off        let the plaintive echoes dwindle among the cobwebbed corners and rodent haunted tunnels  until they   re no more than a reedy whisper on the cusp of hearing .      i say .  i say  excuse me  help .      someone is bound to come down here again one of these days .     some time afterward magrat asked hwel if he believed in long engagements .  the dwarf paused in the task of loading up the latty .       about a week  maximum     he said at last .     with matinees  of course .        a month went past .  the early damp earth odors of autumn drifted over the velvety dark moors  where the watery starlight was echoed by one spark of a fire .   the standing stone was back in its normal place  but still poised to run if any auditors came into view .   the witches sat in careful silence .  this was not going to rate among the hundred most exciting coven meetings of all time .  if mussorgsky had seen them  the night on the bare mountain would have been over by teatime .   then granny weatherwax said     it was a good banquet  i thought .         i was nearly sick     said nanny ogg proudly .     and my shirl helped out in the kitchen and brought me home some scraps .         i heard     said granny coldly .     half a pig and three bottles of fizzy wine went missing  they say .         it   s nice that some people think of the old folk     said nanny ogg  completely unabashed .     i got a coronation mug  too .     she produced it .     it says    viva verence ii rex .     fancy him being called rex .  i can   t say it   s a good likeness  mind you .  i don   t recall him having a handle sticking out of his ear .      there was another long  terribly polite pause .  then granny said     we were a bit surprised you weren   t there  magrat .         we thought you   d be up at the top of the table  kind of thing     said nanny .     we thought you   d have moved in up there .      magrat stared fixedly at her feet .      i wasn   t invited     she said meekly .      well  i don   t know about invited     said granny .     we weren   t invited .  people don   t have to invite witches  they just know we   ll turn up if we want to .  they soon find room for us     she added  with some satisfaction .      you see  he   s been very busy     said magrat to her feet .     sorting everything out  you know .  he   s very clever  you know .  underneath .         very sober lad     said nanny .      anyway  it   s full moon     said magrat quickly .     you   ve got to go to coven meetings at full moon  no matter what other pressing engagements there may be .         have y    .     nanny ogg began  but granny nudged her sharply in the ribs .      it   s a very good thing he   s paying so much attention to getting the kingdom working again     said granny  soothingly .     it shows proper consideration .  i daresay he   ll get around to everything  sooner or later .  it   s very demanding  being a king .         yes     said magrat  her voice barely audible .   the silence that followed was almost solid .  it was broken by nanny  in a voice as bright and brittle as ice .      well  i brought a bottle of that fizzy wine with me     she said .     in case he   d   in case   in case we felt like a drink     she rallied  and waved it at the other two .      i don   t want any     said magrat sullenly .      you drink up  girl     said granny weatherwax .     it   s a chilly night .  it   d be good for your chest .      she squinted at magrat as the moon drifted out from behind its cloud .      here     she said .     your hair looks a bit grubby .  it looks as though you haven   t washed it for a month .      magrat burst into tears .     the same moon shone down on the otherwise unremarkable town of rham nitz  some ninety miles from lancre .   tomjon left the stage to thunderous applause at the concluding act of the troll of ankh .  a hundred people would go home tonight wondering whether trolls were really as bad as they had hitherto thought although  of course  this wouldn   t actually stop them disliking them in any way whatsoever .   hwel patted him on the back as he sat down at the makeup table and started scraping off the thick gray sludge that was intended to make him look like a walking rock .      well done     he said .     the love scene   just right .  and when you turned around and roared at the wizard i shouldn   t think there was a dry seat in the house .         i know .      hwel rubbed his hands together .      we can afford a tavern tonight     he said .     so if we just           we   ll sleep in the carts     said tomjon firmly  squinting at himself in the shard of mirror .      but you know how much the fo   the king gave us .  it could be feather beds all the way home .         it   s straw mattresses and a good profit for us     said tomjon .     and that   ll buy you gods from heaven and demons from hell and the wind and the waves and more trapdoors than you can count  my lawn ornament .      hwel   s hand rested on tomjon   s shoulder for a moment .  then he said     you   re right  boss .         certainly i am .  how   s the play going .         hmm .  what play .     said hwel  innocently .   tomjon carefully removed a plaster brow ridge .      you know     he said .     that one .  the lancre king .         oh .  coming along .  coming along  you know .  i   ll get it right one of these days .     hwel changed the subject with speed .     you know  we could work our way down to the river and take a boat home .  that would be nice  wouldn   t it .         but we could work our way home over land and pick up some more cash .  that would be better  wouldn   t it .     tomjon grinned .     we took one hundred and three pence tonight  i counted heads during the judgment speech .  that   s nearly one silver piece after expenses .         you   re your father   s son  and no mistake     said hwel .   tomjon sat back and looked at himself in the mirror .      yes     he said     i thought i had better be .        magrat didn   t like cats and hated the idea of mousetraps .  she   d always felt that it should be possible to come to some sort of arrangement with creatures like mice so that all available food was rationed in the best interest of all parties .  this was a very humanitarian outlook  which is to say that it was not a view shared by mice  and therefore her moonlit kitchen was alive .   when there was a knocking at the door the entire floor appeared to rush toward the walls .   after a few seconds the knocking came again .   there was another pause .  then the knocking rattled the door on its hinges  and a voice cried     open in the name of the king .      a second voice said  in hurt tones     you don   t have to shout like that .  why did you shout like that .  i didn   t order you to shout like that .  it   s enough to frighten anybody  shouting like that .         sorry  sire .  it goes with the job  sire .         just knock again .  a bit more gently  please .      the knocking might have been a bit softer .  magrat   s apron dropped off its hook on the back of the door .      are you sure i can   t do it myself .         it   s not done  sire  kings knocking at humble cottage doors .  best leave it to me .  open in the           sergeant .         sorry  sire .  forgot myself .         try the latch .      there was the sound of someone being extremely hesitant .      don   t like the sound of that  sire     said the invisible sergeant .     could be dangerous .  if you want my advice  sire  i   d set fire to the thatch .         set fire .         yessire .  we always do that if they don   t answer the door .  brings them out a treat .         i don   t think that would be appropriate  sergeant .  i think i   ll try the latch  if it   s all the same to you .         breaks my heart to see you do it  sire .         well  i   m sorry .         you could at least let me buff it up for you .         no .         well  couldn   t i just set fire to the privy    .         absolutely not .         that chicken house over there looks as if it would go up like           sergeant .         sire .         go back to the castle .         what  and leave you all alone  sire .         this is a matter of extreme delicacy  sergeant .  i am sure you are a man of sterling qualities  but there are times when even a king needs to be alone .  it concerns a young woman  you understand .         ah .  point taken  sire .         thank you .  help me dismount  please .         sorry about all that  sire .  tactless of me .         don   t mention it .         if you need any help getting her alight           please go back to the castle  sergeant .         yes  sire .  if you   re sure  sire .  thank you  sire .         sergeant .         yes  sire .         i shall need someone to take my cap and bells back to the fools    guild in ankh morpork now i   m leaving .  it seems to me you   re the ideal man .         thank you  sire .  much obliged .         it   s your  ah  burning desire to be of service .         yes  sire .         make sure they put you up in one of the guest rooms .         yes  sire .  thank you  sire .      there was the sound of a horse trotting away .  a few seconds later the latch clonked and the fool crept in .   it takes considerable courage to enter a witch   s kitchen in the dark  but probably no more than it takes to wear a purple shirt with velvet sleeves and scalloped edges .  it had this in its favor  though .  there were no bells on it .   he had brought a bottle of sparkling wine and a bouquet of flowers  both of which had gone flat during the journey .  he laid them on the table  and sat down by the embers of the fire .   he rubbed his eyes .  it had been a long day .  he wasn   t  he felt  a good king  but he   d had a lifetime of working hard at being something he wasn   t cut out to be  and he was persevering .  as far as he could see  none of his predecessors had tried at all .  so much to do  so much to repair  so much to organize     on top of it all there was the problem with the duchess .  somehow he   d felt moved to put her in a decent cell in an airy tower .  she was a widow  after all .  he felt he ought to be kind to widows .  but being kind to the duchess didn   t seem to achieve much  she didn   t understand it  she thought it was just weakness .  he was dreadfully afraid that he might have to have her head cut off .   no  being a king was no laughing matter .  he brightened up at the thought .  there was that to be said about it .   and  after a while  he fell asleep .     the duchess was not asleep .  she was currently halfway down the castle wall on a rope of knotted sheets  having spent the previous day gradually chipping away the mortar around the bars of her window although  in truth  you could hack your way out of the average lancre castle wall with a piece of cheese .  the fool .  he   d given her cutlery  and plenty of bedclothes .  that was how these people reacted .  they let their fear do their thinking for them .  they were scared of her  even when they thought they had her in their power  and the weak never had the strong in their power  never truly in their power  .  if she   d thrown herself in prison  she would have found considerable satisfaction in making herself regret she   d ever been born .  but they   d just given her blankets  and worried about her .   well  she   d be back .  there was a big world out there  and she knew how to pull the levers that made people do what she wanted .  she wouldn   t burden herself with a husband this time  either .  weak .  he was the worst of them  no courage in him to be as bad as he knew he was  inside .   she landed heavily on the moss  paused to catch her breath and then  with the knife ready in her hand  slipped away along the castle walls and into the forest .   she   d go all the way down to the far border and swim the river there  or maybe build a raft .  by morning she   d be too far away for them ever to find her  and she doubted very much that they   d ever come looking .   weak .   she moved through the forest with surprising speed .  there were tracks  after all  wide enough for carts  and she had a pretty good sense of direction .  besides  all she needed to do was go downhill .  if she found the gorge then she just had to follow the flow .   and then there seemed to be too many trees .  there was still a track  and it went more or less in the right direction  but the trees on either side of it were planted rather more thickly than one might expect and  when she tried to turn back  there was no track at all behind her .  she took to turning suddenly  half expecting to see the trees moving  but they were always standing stoically and firmly rooted in the moss .   she couldn   t feel a wind  but there was a sighing in the treetops .      all right     she said  under her breath .     all right .  i   m going anyway .  i want to go .  but i will be back .      it was at this point that the track opened out into a clearing that hadn   t been there the day before and wouldn   t be there tomorrow  a clearing in which the moonlight glittered off assembled antlers and fangs and serried ranks of glowing eyes .   the weak banded together can be pretty despicable  but it dawned on the duchess that an alliance of the strong can be more of an immediate problem .   there was total silence for a few seconds  broken only by a faint panting  and then the duchess grinned  raised her knife  and charged the lot of them .   the front ranks of the massed creatures opened to let her pass  and then closed in again .  even the rabbits .   the kingdom exhaled .     on the moors under the very shadow of the peaks the mighty nocturnal chorus of nature had fallen silent .  the crickets had ceased their chirping  the owls had hooted themselves into silence  and the wolves had other matters to attend to .   there was a song that echoed and boomed from cliff to cliff  and resounded up the high hidden valleys  causing miniature avalanches .  it funnelled along the secret tunnels under glaciers  losing all meaning as it rang between the walls of ice .   to find out what was actually being sung you would have to go all the way back down to the dying fire by the standing stone  where the cross resonances and waves of conflicting echoes focused on a small  elderly woman who was waving an empty bottle .         with a snail if you slow to a crawl  but the hedgehog           it tastes better at the bottom of the bottle  doesn   t it     magrat said  trying to drown out the chorus .      that   s right     said granny  draining her cup .      is there any more .         i think gytha finished it  by the sound of it .      they sat on the fragrant heather and stared up at the moon .      well  we   ve got a king     said granny .     and there   s an end of it .         it   s thanks to you and nanny  really     said magrat  and hiccupped .      why .         none of them would have believed me if you hadn   t spoken up .         only because we was asked     said granny .      yes  but everyone knows witches don   t lie  that   s the important thing .  i mean  everyone could see they looked so alike  but that could have been coincidence .  you see     magrat blushed     i looked up droit de seigneur .  goodie whemper had a dictionary .      nanny ogg stopped singing .      yes     said granny weatherwax .     well .      magrat became aware of an uncomfortable atmosphere .      you did tell the truth  didn   t you .     she said .     they really are brothers  aren   t they .         oh yes     said gytha ogg .     definitely .  i saw to his mother when your   when the new king was born .  and to the queen when young tomjon was born  and she told me who his father was .         gytha .         sorry .      the wine was going to her head  but the wheels in magrat   s mind still managed to turn .      just a minute     she said .      i remember the fool   s father     said nanny ogg  speaking slowly and deliberately .     very personable young man  he was .  he didn   t get on with his dad  you know  but he used to visit sometimes .  to see old friends .         he made friends easily     said granny .      among the ladies     agreed nanny .     very athletic  wasn   t he .  could climb walls like nobody   s business  i remember hearing .         he was very popular at court     said granny .     i know that much .         oh  yes .  with the queen  at any rate .         the king used to go out hunting such a lot     said granny .      it was that droit of his     said nanny .     always out and about with it  he was .  hardly ever home o   nights .         just a minute     magrat repeated .   they looked at her .      yes .     said granny .      you told everyone they were brothers and that verence was the older .         that   s right .         and you let everyone believe that        granny weatherwax pulled her shawl around her .      we   re bound to be truthful     she said .     but there   s no call to be honest .         no  no  what you   re saying is that the king of lancre isn   t really           what i   m saying is     said granny firmly     that we   ve got a king who is no worse than most and better than many and who   s got his head screwed on right           even if it is against the thread     said nanny .         and the old king   s ghost has been laid to rest happy  there   s been an enjoyable coronation and some of us got mugs we weren   t entitled to  them being only for the kiddies and  all in all  things are a lot more satisfactory than they might be .  that   s what i   m saying .  never mind what should be or what might be or what ought to be .  it   s what things are that   s important .         but he   s not really a king .         he might be     said nanny .      but you just said           who knows .  the late queen wasn   t very good at counting .  anyway  he doesn   t know he isn   t royalty .         and you   re not going to tell him  are you .     said granny weatherwax .   magrat stared at the moon  which had a few clouds across it .      no     she said .      right  then     said granny .     anyway  look at it like this .  royalty has to start somewhere .  it might as well start with him .  it looks as though he means to take it seriously  which is a lot further than most of them take it .  he   ll do .      magrat knew she had lost .  you always lost against granny weatherwax  the only interest was in seeing exactly how .     but i   m surprised at the two of you  i really am     she said .     you   re witches .  that means you have to care about things like truth and tradition and destiny  don   t you .         that   s where you   ve been getting it all wrong     said granny .     destiny is important  see  but people go wrong when they think it controls them .  it   s the other way around .         bugger destiny     agreed nanny .   granny glared at her .      after all  you never thought being a witch was going to be easy  did you .         i   m learning     said magrat .  she looked across the moor  where a thin rind of dawn glowed on the horizon .      i think i   d better be off     she said .     it   s getting early .         me too     said nanny ogg .     our shirl frets if i   m not home when she comes to get my breakfast .      granny carefully scuffed over the remains of the fire .      when shall we three meet again .     she said .     hmm .      the witches looked at one another sheepishly .      i   m a bit busy next month     said nanny .     birthdays and such .  er .  and the work has really been piling up with all this hurly burly .  you know .  and there   s all the ghosts to think about .         i thought you sent them back to the castle     said granny .      well  they didn   t want to go     said nanny vaguely .     to be honest  i   ve got used to them around the place .  they   re company of an evening .  they hardly scream at all  now .         that   s nice     said granny .     what about you  magrat .         there always seems to be such a lot to do at this time of year  don   t you find .     said magrat .      quite     said granny weatherwax  pleasantly .     it   s no good getting yourself tied down to appointments all the time  is it .  let   s just leave the whole question open  shall we .      they nodded .  and  as the new day wound across the landscape  each one busy with her own thoughts  each one a witch alone  they went home .      the end

he   d never found anyone prepared to explain it to him .  but it was definitely something a feudal lord ought to have and  he was pretty sure  it needed regular exercise .  he imagined it was some kind of large hairy dog .  he was definitely going to get one  and damn well exercise it .    written by wizards  who are celibate and get some pretty funny ideas around four o   clock in the morning .    she did nothing  although sometimes when she saw him in the village she   d smile in a faint  puzzled way .  after three weeks of this the suspense was too much for him and he took his own life  in fact he took it all the way across the continent  where he became a reformed character and never went home again .    all of them  unfortunately  unprintable .    the vermine is a small black and white furry creature  much famed for its pelt .  it is a more careful relative of the lemming  it only throws itself over small pebbles .    they worked .  witches    remedies generally did  regardless of the actual form of delivery .    a killing insult in dwarfish  but here used as a term of endearment .  it means    lawn ornament .       in a manner of speaking .    someone has to do it .  it   s all very well calling for eye of newt  but do you mean common  spotted or great crested .  which eye  anyway .  will tapioca do just as well .  if we substitute egg white will the spell a  work b  fail or c  melt the bottom out of the cauldron .  goodie whemper   s curiosity about such things was huge and insatiable .       nearly insatiable .  it was probably satiated in her last flight to test whether a broomstick could survive having its bristles pulled out one by one in midair .  according to the small black raven she had trained as a flight recorder  the answer was almost certainly no .    witches never curtsy .    no one knows why men say things like this .  any minute now he is probably going to say he likes a girl with spirit .    they always do  everywhere .  no one sees them arrive .  the logical explanation is that the franchise includes the stall  the paper hat and a small gas powered time machine .    involving a red hot poker  a privy  ten pounds of live eels  a three mile stretch of frozen river  a butt of wine  a couple of tulip bulbs  a number of poisoned eardrops  an oyster and a large man with a mallet .  king murune didn   t make friends easily .    possibly the first attempt at the in flight refuelling of a broomstick .    an explanation may be needed at this point .  the librarian of the magic library at unseen university  the disc   s premier college of wizardry  had been turned into an orangutan some years previously by a magical accident in that accident prone academy  and since then had strenuously resisted all well meaning efforts to turn him back .  for one thing  longer arms and prehensile toes made getting around the higher shelves a whole lot easier  and being an ape meant you didn   t have to bother with all this angst business .  he had also been rather pleased to find that his new body  although looking deceptively like a rubber sack full of water  gave him three times the strength and twice the reach of his old one .    the shades is an ancient part of ankh morpork considered considerably more unpleasant and disreputable than the rest of the city .  this always amazes visitors .    ankh morpork   s enviable system of licensed criminals owes much to the current patrician  lord vetinari .  he reasoned that the only way to police a city of a million inhabitants was to recognize the various gangs and robber guilds  give them professional status  invite the leaders to large dinners  allow an acceptable level of street crime and then make the guild leaders responsible for enforcing it  on pain of being stripped of their new civic honors along with large areas of their skins .  it worked .  criminals  it turned out  made a very good police force  unauthorized robbers soon found  for example  that instead of a night in the cells they could now expect an eternity at the bottom of the river .   however  there was the problem of apportioning the crime statistics  and so there arose a complex system of annual budgeting  chits and allowances to see that a  the members could make a reasonable living and b  no citizen was robbed or assaulted more than an agreed number of times .  many foresighted citizens in fact arranged to get an acceptable minimum of theft  assault  etc  over at the beginning of the financial year  often in the privacy and comfort of their own homes  and thus be able to walk the streets quite safely for the rest of the year .  it all ticked over extremely peacefully and efficiently  demonstrating once again that compared to the patrician of ankh  machiavelli could not have run a whelk stall .    because of the way time was recorded among the various states  kingdoms and cities .  after all  when over an area of a hundred square miles the same year is variously the year of the small bat  and anticipated monkey  the hunting cloud  fat cows  three bright stallions and at least nine numbers recording the time since   assorted kings  prophets  and strange events were either crowned  born or happened  and each year has a different number of months  and some of them don   t have weeks  and one of them refuses to accept the day as a measure of time  the only thing it is possible to be sure of is that good sex doesn   t last long enough .        the calendar of the theocracy of muntab counts down  not up .  no one knows why  but it might not be a good idea to hang around and find out .      except for the zabingo tribe of the great nef  of course .    the observant will realize that this was because the king was already seated there .  it was not because the man had used the phrase    commence to start    in cold blood .  but it ought to have been .    like bognor .    at least  of supervising the loading .  actual physical assistance was a little difficult because he had  the day before  slipped on something and broken his leg .    there is a school of thought that says that witches and wizards can never go home .  they went  though  just the same .
