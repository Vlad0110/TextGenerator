across the blackness as though the creator had smashed the windscreen of his car and hadn   t bothered to stop to sweep up the pieces .   this is the gulf between universes  the chill deeps of space that contain nothing but the occasional random molecule  a few lost comets and        but a circle of blackness shifts slightly  the eye reconsiders perspective  and what was apparently the awesome distance of interstellar wossname becomes a world under darkness  its stars the lights of what will charitably be called civilization .   for  as the world tumbles lazily  it is revealed as the discworld   flat  circular  and carried through space on the back of four elephants who stand on the back of great a   tuin  the only turtle ever to feature on the hertzsprung russell diagram  a turtle ten thousand miles long  dusted with the frost of dead comets  meteor pocked  albedo eyed .  no one knows the reason for all this  but it is probably quantum .   much that is weird could happen on a world on the back of a turtle like that .   it   s happening already .   the stars below are campfires  out in the desert  and the lights of remote villages high in the forested mountains .  towns are smeared nebulae  cities are vast constellations  the great sprawling city of ankh morpork  for example  glows like a couple of colliding galaxies .   but here  away from the great centers of population  where the circle sea meets the desert  there is a line of cold blue fire .  flames as chilly as the slopes of hell roar toward the sky .  ghostly light flickers across the desert .   the pyramids in the ancient valley of the djel are flaring their power into the night .   the energy streaming up from their paracosmic peaks may  in chapters to come  illuminate many mysteries  why tortoises hate philosophy  why too much religion is bad for goats  and what it is that handmaidens actually do .   it will certainly show what our ancestors would be thinking if they were alive today .  people have often speculated about this .  would they approve of modern society  they ask  would they marvel at present day achievements .  and of course this misses a fundamental point .  what our ancestors would really be thinking  if they were alive today  is     why is it so dark in here .        in the cool of the river valley dawn the high priest dios opened his eyes .  he didn   t sleep these days .  he couldn   t remember when he last slept .  sleep was too close to the other thing and  anyway  he didn   t seem to need it .  just lying down was enough   at least  just lying down here .  the fatigue poisons dwindled away  like everything else .  for a while .   long enough  anyway .   he swung his legs off the slab in the little chamber .  with barely a conscious prompting from his brain his right hand grasped the snake entwined staff of office .  he paused to make another mark on the wall  pulled his robe around him and stepped smartly down the sloping passage and out into the sunlight  the words of the invocation of the new sun already lining up in his mind .  the night was forgotten  the day was ahead .  there was much careful advice and guidance to be given  and dios existed only to serve .   dios didn   t have the oddest bedroom in the world .  it was just the oddest bedroom anyone has ever walked out of .     and the sun toiled across the sky .   many people have wondered why .  some people think a giant dung beetle pushes it .  as explanations go it lacks a certain technical edge  and has the added drawback that  as certain circumstances may reveal  it is possibly correct .   it reached sundown without anything particularly unpleasant happening to it   and its dying rays chanced to shine in through a window in the city of ankh morpork and gleam off a mirror .   it was a full length mirror .  all assassins had a full length mirror in their rooms  because it would be a terrible insult to anyone to kill them when you were badly dressed .   teppic examined himself critically .  the outfit had cost him his last penny  and was heavy on the black silk .  it whispered as he moved .  it was pretty good .   at least the headache was going .  it had nearly crippled him all day  he   d been in dread of having to start the run with purple spots in front of his eyes .   he sighed and opened the black box and took out his rings and slipped them on .  another box held a set of knives of klatchian steel  their blades darkened with lamp black .  various cunning and intricate devices were taken from velvet bags and dropped into pockets .  a couple of long bladed throwing tlingas were slipped into their sheaths inside his boots .  a thin silk line and folding grapnel were wound around his waist  over the chain mail shirt .  a blowpipe was attached to its leather thong and dropped down his back under his cloak  teppic pocketed a slim tin container with an assortment of darts  their tips corked and their stems braille coded for ease of selection in the dark .   he winced  checked the blade of his rapier and slung the baldric over his right shoulder  to balance the bag of lead slingshot ammunition .  as an after thought he opened his sock drawer and took a pistol crossbow  a flask of oil  a roll of lockpicks and  after some consideration  a punch dagger  a bag of assorted caltraps and a set of brass knuckles .   teppic picked up his hat and checked its lining for the coil of cheesewire .  he placed it on his head at a jaunty angle  took a last satisfied look at himself in the mirror  turned on his heel and  very slowly  fell over .     it was high summer in ankh morpork .  in fact it was more than high .  it was stinking .   the great river was reduced to a lava like ooze between ankh  the city with the better address  and morpork on the opposite bank .  morpork was not a good address .  morpork was twinned with a tar pit .  there was not a lot that could be done to make morpork a worse place .  a direct hit by a meteorite  for example  would count as gentrification .   most of the river bed was a honeycomb crust of cracked mud .  currently the sun appeared to be a big copper gong nailed to the sky .  the heat that had dried up the river fried the city by day and baked it by night  curling ancient timbers  turning the traditional slurry of the streets into a drifting  choking ocher dust .   it wasn   t ankh morpork   s proper weather .  it was by inclination a city of mists and drips  of slithers and chills .  it sat panting on the crisping plains like a toad on a firebrick .  and even now  around midnight  the heat was stifling  wrapping the streets like scorched velvet  searing the air and squeezing all the breath out of it .   high in the north face of the assassins    guildhouse there was a click as a window was pushed open .   teppic  who had with considerable reluctance divested himself of some of the heavier of his weapons  took a deep draft of the hot  dead air .   this was it .   this was the night .   they said you had one chance in two unless you drew old mericet as examiner  in which case you might as well cut your throat right at the start .   teppic had mericet for strategy and poison theory every thursday afternoon  and didn   t get along with him .  the dormitories buzzed with rumors about mericet  the number of kills  the astonishing technique   he   d broken all the records in his time .  they said he   d even killed the patrician of ankh morpork .  not the present one  that is .  one of the dead ones .   maybe it would be nivor  who was fat and jolly and liked his food and did traps and deadfalls on tuesdays .  teppic was good at traps  and got on well with the master .  or it could be the kompt de yoyo  who did modern languages and music .  teppic was gifted at neither  but the kompt was a keen edificeer and liked boys who shared his love of dangling by one hand high above the city streets .   he stuck one leg over the sill and unhitched his line and grapnel .  he hooked the gutter two floors up and slipped out of the window .   no assassin ever used the stairs .     in order to establish continuity with later events  this may be the time to point out that the greatest mathematician in the history of the discworld was lying down and peacefully eating his supper .   it is interesting to note that  owing to this mathematician   s particular species  what he was eating for his supper was his lunch .     gongs around the ankh morpork sprawl were announcing midnight when teppic crept along the ornate parapet four stories above filigree street  his heart pounding .   there was a figure outlined against the afterglow of the sunset .  teppic paused alongside a particularly repulsive gargoyle to consider his options .   fairly solid classroom rumor said that if he inhumed his examiner before the test  that was an automatic pass .  he slipped a number three throwing knife from its thigh sheath and hefted it thoughtfully .  of course  any attempt  any overt move which missed would attract immediate failure and loss of privileges .      the silhouette was absolutely still .  teppic   s eyes swiveled to the maze of chimneys  gargoyles  ventilator shafts  bridges and ladders that made up the rooftop scenery of the city .   right  he thought .  that   s some sort of dummy .  i   m supposed to attack it and that means he   s watching me from somewhere else .   will i be able to spot him .  no .   on the other hand  maybe i   m meant to think it   s a dummy .  unless he   s thought of that as well     he found himself drumming his fingers on the gargoyle  and hastily pulled himself together .  what is the sensible course of action at this point .   a party of revellers staggered through a pool of light in the street far below .   teppic sheathed the knife and stood up .      sir     he said     i am here .      a dry voice by his ear said  rather indistinctly     very well .      teppic stared straight ahead .  mericet appeared in front of him  wiping gray dust off his bony face .  he took a length of pipe out of his mouth and tossed it aside  then pulled a clipboard out of his coat .  he was bundled up even in this heat .  mericet was the kind of person who could freeze in a volcano .      ah     he said  his voice broadcasting disapproval     mr .  teppic .  well  well .         a fine night  sir     said teppic .  the examiner gave him a chilly look  suggesting that observations about the weather acquired an automatic black mark  and made a note on his clipboard .      we   ll take a few questions first     he said .      as you wish  sir .         what is the maximum permitted length of a throwing knife .     snapped mericet .   teppic closed his eyes .  he   d spent the last week reading nothing but the cordat  he could see the page now  floating tantalizingly just inside his eyelids   they never ask you lengths and weights  students had said knowingly  they expect you to bone up on the weights and lengths and throwing distances but they never     naked terror hotwired his brain and kicked his memory into gear .  the page sprang into focus .         maximum length of a throwing knife may be ten finger widths  or twelve in wet weather        he recited .        throwing distance is              name three poisons acknowledged for administration by ear .      a breeze sprang up  but it did nothing to cool the air  it just shifted the heat about .      sir  wasp agaric  achorion purple and mustick  sir     said teppic promptly .      why not spime .     snapped mericet  fast as a snake .   teppic   s jaw dropped open .  he floundered for a while  trying to avoid the gimlet gaze a few feet away from him .      s sir  spime isn   t a poison  sir     he managed .     it is an extremely rare antidote to certain snake venoms  and is obtained       he settled down a bit  more certain of himself  all those hours idly looking through the old dictionaries had paid off      is obtained from the liver of the inflatable mongoose  which           what is the meaning of this sign .     said mericet .         is found only in the       teppic   s voice trailed off .  he squinted down at the complex rune on the card in mericet   s hand  and then stared straight past the examiner   s ear again .      i haven   t the faintest idea  sir     he said .  out of the corner of his ear he thought he heard the faintest intake of breath  the tiniest seed of a satisfied grunt .      but if it were the other way up  sir     he went on     it would be thiefsign for    noisy dogs in this house .         there was absolute silence for a moment .  then  right by his shoulder  the old assassin   s voice said     is the killing rope permitted to all categories .         sir  the rules call for three questions  sir     teppic protested .      ah .  and that is your answer  is it .         sir  no  sir .  it was an observation  sir .  sir  the answer you are looking for is that all categories may bear the killing rope  but only assassins of the third grade may use it as one of the three options  sir .         you are sure of that  are you .         sir .         you wouldn   t like to reconsider .     you could have used the examiner   s voice to grease a wagon .      sir  no  sir .         very well .     teppic relaxed .  the back of his tunic was sticking to him  chilly with sweat .      now  i want you to proceed at your own pace toward the street of bookkeepers     said mericet evenly     obeying all signs and so forth .  i will meet you in the room under the gong tower at the junction with audit alley .  and   take this  if you please .      he handed teppic a small envelope .   teppic handed over a receipt .  then mericet stepped into the pool of shade beside a chimney pot  and disappeared .   so much for the ceremony .   teppic took a few deep breaths and tipped the envelope   s contents into his hand .  it was a guild bond for ten thousand ankh morpork dollars  made out to    bearer .     it was an impressive document  surmounted with the guild seal of the double cross and the cloaked dagger .   well  no going back now .  he   d taken the money .  either he   d survive  in which case of course he   d traditionally donate the money to the guild   s widows and orphans fund  or it would be retrieved from his dead body .  the bond looked a bit dog eared  but he couldn   t see any bloodstains on it .   he checked his knives  adjusted his swordbelt  glanced behind him  and set off at a gentle trot .   at least this was a bit of luck .  the student lore said there were only half a dozen routes used during the test  and on summer nights they were alive with students tackling the roofs  towers  eaves and colls of the city .  edificing was a keen inter house sport in its own right  it was one of the few things teppic was sure he was good at   he   d been captain of the team that beat scorpion house in the wall game finals .  and this was one of the easier courses .   he dropped lightly over the edge of the roof  landed on a ridge  ran easily across the sleeping building  jumped a narrow gap onto the tiled roof of the young men   s reformed cultists of the ichor god bel shamharoth association gym  jogged gently over the gray slope  swarmed up a twelve foot wall without slowing down  and vaulted onto the wide flat roof of the temple of blind io .   a full  orange moon hung on the horizon .  there was a real breeze up here  not much  but as refreshing as a cold shower after the stifling heat of the streets .  he speeded up  enjoying the coolness on his face  and leapt accurately off the end of the roof onto the narrow plank bridge that led across tinlid alley .   and which someone  in defiance of all probability  had removed .     at times like this one   s past life flashes before one   s eyes       his aunt had wept  rather theatrically  teppic had thought  since the old lady was as tough as a hippo   s instep .  his father had looked stern and dignified  whenever he could remember to  and tried to keep his mind free of beguiling images of cliffs and fish .  the servants had been lined up along the hall from the foot of the main stairway  handmaidens on one side  eunuchs and butlers on the other .  the women bobbed a curtsey as he walked by  creating a rather nice sine wave effect which the greatest mathematician on the disc  had he not at this moment been occupied by being hit with a stick and shouted at by a small man wearing what appeared to be a nightshirt  might well have appreciated .      but     teppic   s aunt blew her nose     it   s trade  after all .      his father patted her hand .     nonsense  flower of the desert     he said     it is a profession  at the very least .         what is the difference .     she sobbed .   the old man sighed .     the money  i understand .  it will do him good to go out into the world and make friends and have a few corners knocked off  and it will keep him occupied and prevent him from getting into mischief .         but   assassination   he   s so young  and he   s never shown the least inclination       she dabbed at her eyes .     it   s not from our side of the family     she added accusingly .     that brother in law of yours           uncle vyrt     said his father .      going all over the world killing people .         i don   t believe they use that word     said his father .     i think they prefer words like conclude  or annul .  or inhume  i understand .         inhume .         i think it   s like exhume  o flooding of the waters  only it   s before they bury you .         i think it   s terrible .     she sniffed .     but i heard from lady nooni that only one boy in fifteen actually passes the final exam .  perhaps we   d just better let him get it out of his system .      king teppicymon xxvii nodded gloomily  and went by himself to wave goodbye to his son .  he was less certain than his sister about the unpleasantness of assassination  he   d been reluctantly in politics for a long time  and felt that while assassination was probably worse than debate it was certainly better than war  which some people tended to think of as the same thing only louder .  and there was no doubt that young vyrt always had plenty of money  and used to turn up at the palace with expensive gifts  exotic suntans and thrilling tales of the interesting people he   d met in foreign parts  in most cases quite briefly .   he wished vyrt was around to advice .  his majesty had also heard that only one student in fifteen actually became an assassin .  he wasn   t entirely certain what happened to the other fourteen  but he was pretty sure that if you were a poor student in a school for assassins they did a bit more than throw the chalk at you  and that the school dinners had an extra dimension of uncertainty .   but everyone agreed that the assassins    school offered the best all around education in the world .  a qualified assassin should be at home in any company  and able to play at least one musical instrument .  anyone inhumed by a graduate of the guild school could go to his rest satisfied that he had been annulled by someone of taste and discretion .   and  after all  what was there for him at home .  a kingdom two miles wide and one hundred and fifty miles long  which was almost entirely under water during the flood season  and threatened on either side by stronger neighbors who tolerated its existence only because they   d be constantly at war if it wasn   t there .   oh  djelibeybi  had been great once  when upstarts like tsort and ephebe were just a bunch of nomads with their towels on their heads .  all that remained of those great days was the ruinously expensive palace  a few dusty ruins in the desert and   the pharaoh sighed   the pyramids .  always the pyramids .   his ancestors had been keen on pyramids .  the pharaoh wasn   t .  pyramids had bankrupted the country  drained it drier than ever the river did .  the only curse they could afford to put on a tomb these days was    bugger off .      the only pyramids he felt comfortable about were the very small ones at the bottom of the garden  built every time one of the cats died .   he   d promised the boy   s mother .   he missed artela .  there   d been a terrible row about taking a wife from outside the kingdom  and some of her foreign ways had puzzled and fascinated even him .  maybe it was from her he   d got the strange dislike of pyramids  in djelibeybi that was like disliking breathing .  but he   d promised that pteppic could go to school outside the kingdom .  she   d been insistent about that .     people never learn anything in this place     she   d said .     they only remember things .      if only she   d remembered about not swimming in the river     he watched two of the servants load teppic   s trunk onto the back of the coach  and for the first time either of them could remember laid a paternal hand on his son   s shoulder .   in fact he was at a loss for something to say .  we   ve never really had time to get to know one another  he thought .  there   s so much i could have given him .  a few bloody good hidings wouldn   t have come amiss .      um     he said .     well  my boy .         yes  father .         this is  er  the first time you   ve been away from home by yourself           no  father .  i spent last summer with lord fhem ptahem  you remember .         oh  did you .     the pharaoh recalled the palace had seemed quieter at the time .  he   d put it down to the new tapestries .      anyway     he said     you   re a young man  nearly thirteen           twelve  father     said teppic patiently .      are you sure .         it was my birthday last month  father .  you bought me a warming pan .         did i .  how singular .  did i say why .         no  father .     teppic looked up at his father   s mild  puzzled features .     it was a very good warming pan     he added reassuringly .     i like it a lot .         oh .  good .  er .     his majesty patted his son   s shoulder again  in a vague way  like a man drumming his fingers on his desk while trying to think .  an idea appeared to occur to him .   the servants had finished strapping the trunk onto the roof of the coach and the driver was patiently holding open the door .      when a young man sets out in the world     said his majesty uncertainly     there are  well  it   s very important that he remembers   the point is  that it is a very big world after all  with all sorts   and of course  especially so in the city  where there are many additional       he paused  waving one hand vaguely in the air .   teppic took it gently .      it   s quite all right  father     he said .     dios the high priest explained to me about taking regular baths  and not going blind .      his father blinked at him .      you   re not going blind .     he said .      apparently not  father .         oh .  well .  jolly good     said the king .     jolly  jolly good .  that is good news .         i think i had better be going  father .  otherwise i shall miss the tide .      his majesty nodded  and patted his pockets .      there was something       he muttered  and then tracked it down  and slipped a small leather bag into teppic   s pocket .  he tried the shoulder routine again .      a little something     he murmured .     don   t tell your aunt .  oh  you can   t  anyway .  she   s gone for a lie down .  it   s all been rather too much for her .      all that remained then was for teppic to go and sacrifice a chicken at the statue of khuft  the founder of djelibeybi  so that his ancestor   s guiding hand would steer his footsteps in the world .  it was only a small chicken  though  and when khuft had finished with it the king had it for lunch .   djelibeybi really was a small  self centered kingdom .  even its plagues were half hearted .  all self respecting river kingdoms have vast supernatural plagues  but the best the old kingdom had been able to achieve in the last hundred years was the plague of frog .      that evening  when they were well outside the delta of the djel and heading across the circle sea to ankh morpork  teppic remembered the bag and examined its contents .  with love  but also with his normal approach to things  his father had presented him with a cork  half a tin of saddle soap  a small bronze coin of uncertain denomination  and an extremely elderly sardine .     it is a well known fact that when one is about to die the senses immediately become excruciatingly sharp and it has always been believed that this is to enable their owner to detect any possible exit from his predicament other than the obvious one .   this is not true .  the phenomenon is a classical example of displacement activity .  the senses are desperately concentrating on anything apart from the immediate problem   which in teppic   s case consisted of a broad expanse of cobblestones some eighty feet away and closing   in the hope that it will go away .   the trouble is that it soon will .   whatever the reason  teppic was suddenly acutely aware of things around him .  the way the moonlight glowed on the rooftops .  the smell of fresh bread wafting from a nearby bakery .  the whirring of a cockchafer as it barrelled past his ear  upward .  the sound of a baby crying  in the distance  and the bark of a dog .  the gentle rush of the air  with particular reference to its thinness and lack of handholds       there had been more than seventy of them enrolling that year .  the assassins didn   t have a very strenuous entrance examination  the school was easy to get into  easy to get out of  the trick was to get out upright  .  the courtyard in the center of the guild buildings was thronged with boys who all had two things in common   overlarge trunks  which they were sitting on  and clothes that had been selected for them to grow into  and which they were more or less sitting in .  some optimists had brought weapons with them  which were confiscated and sent home over the next few weeks .   teppic watched them carefully .  there were distinct advantages to being the only child of parents too preoccupied with their own affairs to worry much about him  or indeed register his existence for days at a time .   his mother  as far as he could remember  had been a pleasant woman and as self centered as a gyroscope .  she   d liked cats .  she didn   t just venerate them   everyone in the kingdom did that   but she actually liked them  too .  teppic knew that it was traditional in river kingdoms to approve of cats  but he suspected that usually the animals in question were graceful  stately creatures  his mother   s cats were small  spitting  flat headed  yellow eyed maniacs .   his father spent a lot of time worrying about the kingdom and occasionally declaring that he was a seagull  although this was probably from general forgetfulness .  teppic had occasionally speculated about his own conception  since his parents were rarely in the same frame of reference  let alone the same state of mind .   but it had apparently happened and he was left to bring himself up on a trial and error basis  mildly hindered and occasionally enlivened by a succession of tutors .  the ones hired by his father were best  especially on those days when he was flying as high as he could  and for one glorious winter teppic had as his tutor an elderly ibis poacher who had in fact wandered into the royal gardens in search of a stray arrow .   that had been a time of wild chases with soldiers  moonlight rambles in the dead streets of the necropolis and  best of all  the introduction to the puntbow  a fearsomely complicated invention which at considerable risk to its operators could turn a slough full of innocent waterfowl into so much floating p  t   .   he   d also had the run of the library  including the locked shelves   the poacher had several other skills to ensure gainful employment in inclement weather   which had given him many hours of quiet study  he was particularly attached to the shuttered palace  translated from the khalian by a gentleman  with hand colored plates for the connoisseur in a strictly limited edition .  it was confusing but instructive and  when a rather fey young tutor engaged by the priests tried to introduce him to certain athletic techniques favored by the classical pseudopolitans  teppic considered the suggestion for some time and then floored the youth with a hatstand .   teppic hadn   t been educated .  education had just settled on him  like dandruff .   it started to rain  in the world outside his head .  another new experience .  he   d heard about it  of course  how water came down out of the sky in small bits .  he just hadn   t expected there to be so much of it .  it never rained in djelibeybi .   masters moved among the boys like damp and slightly scruffy blackbirds  but he was eyeing a group of older students lolling near the pillared entrance to the school .  they also wore black   different colors of black .   that was his first introduction to the tertiary colors  the colors on the far side of blackness  the colors that you get if you split blackness with an eight sided prism .  they are also almost impossible to describe in a non magical environment  but if someone were to try they   d probably start by telling you to smoke something illegal and take a good look at a starling   s wing .   the seniors were critically inspecting the new arrivals .   teppic stared at them .  apart from the colors  their clothes were cut off the edge of the latest fashion  which was currently inclining toward wide hats  padded shoulders  narrow waists and pointed shoes and gave its followers the appearance of being very well dressed nails .   i   m going to be like them  he told himself .   although probably better dressed  he added .   he recalled uncle vyrt  sitting out on the steps overlooking the djel on one of his brief  mysterious visits .     satin and leather are no good .  or jewelry of any kind .  you can   t have anything that will shine or squeak or clink .  stick to rough silk or velvet .  the important thing is not how many people you inhume  it   s how many fail to inhume you .        he   d been moving at an unwise pace  which might assist now .  as he arced over the emptiness of the alley he twisted in the air  thrust out his arms desperately  and felt his fingertips brush a ledge on the building opposite .  it was enough to pivot him  he swung around  hit the crumbling brickwork with sufficient force to knock what remained of his breath out of him  and slid down the sheer wall          boy .      teppic looked up .  there was a senior assassin standing beside him  with a purple teaching sash over his robes .  it was the first assassin he   d seen  apart from vyrt .  the man was pleasant enough .  you could imagine him making sausages .      are you talking to me .     he said      you will stand up when you address a master     said the rosy face .      i will .     teppic was fascinated .  he wondered how this could be achieved .  discipline had not hitherto been a major feature in his life .  most of his tutors had been sufficiently unnerved by the sight of the king occasionally perched on top of a door that they raced through such lessons as they had and then locked themselves in their rooms .      i will sir     said the teacher .  he consulted the list in his hand .      what is your name  boy .     he continued .      prince pteppic of the old kingdom  the kingdom of the sun     said teppic easily .     i appreciate you are ignorant of the etiquette  but you should not call me sir  and you should touch the ground with your forehead when you address me .         pateppic  is it .     said the master .      no .  pteppic .         ah .  teppic     said the master  and ticked off a name on his list .  he gave teppic a generous smile .      well  now  your majesty     he said     i am grunworth nivor  your housemaster .  you are in viper house .  to my certain knowledge there are at least eleven kingdoms of the sun on the disc and  before the end of the week  you will present me with a short essay detailing their geographical location  political complexion  capital city or principal seat of government  and a suggested route into the bedchamber of the head of state of your choice .  however  in all the world there is only one viper house .  good morning to you  boy .      he turned away and homed in on another cowering pupil .      he   s not a bad sort     said a voice behind teppic .     anyway  all the stuff   s in the library .  i   ll show you if you like .  i   m chidder .      teppic turned .  he was being addressed by a boy of about his own age and height  whose black suit   plain black  for first years   looked as though it had been nailed onto him in bits .  the youth was holding out a hand .  teppic gave it a polite glance .      yes .     he said .      what   s your name  kiddo .      teppic drew himself up .  he was getting fed up with this treatment .     kiddo .  i   ll have you know the blood of pharaohs runs in my veins .      the other boy looked at him unabashed  with his head on one side and a faint smile on his face .      would you like it to stay there .     he said .     the baker was just along the alley  and a handful of the staff had stepped out into the comparative cool of the pre dawn air for a quick smoke and a break from the desert heat of the ovens .  their chattering spiraled up to teppic  high in the shadows  gripping a fortuitous window sill while his feet scrabbled for a purchase among the bricks .   it   s not that bad  he told himself .  you   ve tackled worse .  the hubward face of the patrician   s palace last winter  for example  when all the gutters had overflowed and the walls were solid ice .  this isn   t much more than a    maybe a   .   .  you and old chiddy used to go up walls like this rather than stroll down the street  it   s just a matter of perspective .   perspective .  he glanced down  at seventy feet of infinity .  splat city  man  get a grip on yourself .  on the wall .  his right foot found a worn section of mortar  into which his toes planted with barely a conscious instruction from a brain now feeling too fragile to take more than a distant interest in the proceedings .   he took a breath  tensed  and then dropped one hand to his belt  seized a dagger  and thrust it between the bricks beside him before gravity worked out what was happening .  he paused  panting  waiting for gravity to lose interest in him again  and then swung his body sideways and tried the same thing a second time .   down below one of the bakers told a suggestive joke  and brushed a speck of mortar from his ear .  as his colleagues laughed teppic stood up in the moonlight  balancing on two slivers of klatchian steel  and gently walked his palms up the wall to the window whose sill had been his brief salvation .   it was wedged shut .  a good blow would surely open it  but only at about the same moment as it sent him reeling back into empty air .  teppic sighed and  moving with the delicacy of a watchmaker  drew his diamond compasses from their pouch and dragged a slow  gentle circle on the dusty glass          you carry it yourself     said chidder    that   s the rule around here .      teppic looked at the trunk .  it was an intriguing notion .      at home we   ve people who do that     he said .     eunuchs and so on .         you should of brought one with you .         they don   t travel well     said teppic .  in fact he   d adamantly refused all suggestions that a small retinue should accompany him  and dios had sulked for days .  that was not how a member of the royal blood should go forth into the world  he said .  teppic had remained firm .  he was pretty certain that assassins weren   t expected to go about their business accompanied by handmaidens and buglers .  now  however  the idea seemed to have some merit .  he gave the trunk an experimental heave  and managed to get it across his shoulders .      your people are pretty rich  then .     said chidder  ambling along beside him .   teppic thought about this .     no  not really     he said .     they mainly grow melons and garlic and that kind of thing .  and stand in the streets and shout    hurrah .            this is your parents you   re talking about .     said chidder  puzzled .      oh  them .  no  my father   s a pharaoh .  my mother was a concubine  i think .         i thought that was some sort of vegetable .         i don   t think so .  we   ve never really discussed it .  anyway  she died when i was young .         how dreadful     said chidder cheerfully .      she went for a moonlight swim in what turned out to be a crocodile .     teppic tried politely not to be hurt at the boy   s reaction .      my father   s in commerce     said chidder  as they passed through the archway .      that   s fascinating     said teppic dutifully .  he felt quite broken by all these new experiences  and added     i   ve never been to commerce  but i understand they   re very fine people .      over the next hour or two chidder  who ambled gently through life as though he   d already worked it all out  introduced teppic to the various mysteries of the dormitories  the classrooms and the plumbing .  he left the plumbing until last  for all sorts of reasons .      not any .     he said .      there   s buckets and things     said teppic vaguely     and lots of servants .         bit old fashioned  this kingdom of yours .      teppic nodded .     it   s the pyramids     he said .     they take all the money .         expensive things  i should imagine .         not particularly .  they   re just made of stone .     teppic sighed .     we   ve got lots of stone     he said     and sand .  stone and sand .  we   re really big on them .  if you ever need any stone and sand  we   re the people for you .  it   s fitting out the insides that is really expensive .  we   re still avoiding paying for grandfather   s  and that wasn   t very big .  just three chambers .      teppic turned and looked out of the window  they were back in the dormitory at this point .      the whole kingdom   s in debt     he said  quietly .     i mean even our debts are in debt .  that   s why i   m here  really .  someone in our house needs to earn some money .  a royal prince can   t hang around looking ornamental anymore .  he   s got to get out and do something useful in the community .      chidder leaned on the window sill .      couldn   t you take some of the stuff out of the pyramids  then .     he said .      don   t be silly .         sorry .      teppic gloomily watched the figures below .      there   s a lot of people here     he said  to change the subject .     i didn   t realize it would be so big .     he shivered .     or so cold     he added .      people drop out all the time     said chidder .     can   t stand the course .  the important thing is to know what   s what and who   s who .  see that fellow over there .      teppic followed his pointing finger to a group of older students  who were lounging against the pillars by the entrance .      the big one .  face like the end of your boot .         that   s fliemoe .  watch out for him .  if he invites you for toast in his study  don   t go .         and who   s the little kid with the curls .     said teppic .  he pointed to a small lad receiving the attentions of a washed out looking lady .  she was licking her handkerchief and dabbing apparent smudges off his face .  when she stopped that  she straightened his tie .   chidder craned to see .     oh  just some new kid     he said .     arthur someone .  still hanging onto his mummy  i see .  he won   t last long .         oh  i don   t know     said teppic .     we do  too  and we   ve lasted for thousands of years .        a disc of glass dropped into the silent building and tinkled on the floor .  there was no other sound for several minutes .  then there was the faint clonk clonk of an oil can .  a shadow that had been lying naturally on the window sill  a morgue for blue bottles  turned out to be an arm which was moving with vegetable slowness toward the window   s catch .   there was a scrape of metal  and then the whole window swung out in tribological silence .   teppic dropped over the sill and vanished into the shadow below it .   for a minute or two the dusty space was filled with the intense absence of noise caused by someone moving with extreme care .  once again there was the squirting of oil  and then a metallic whisper as the bolt of a trapdoor leading onto the roof moved gently aside .   teppic waited for his breath to catch up with him  and in that moment heard the sound .  it was down among the white noise at the edge of hearing  but there was no doubt about it .  someone was waiting just above the trapdoor  and they   d just put their hand on a piece of paper to stop it rattling in the breeze .   his own hand dropped from the bolt .  he eased his way with exquisite care back across the greasy floor and felt his way along a rough wooden wall until he came to the door .  this time he took no chances  but uncorked his oil can and let a silent drop fall onto the hinges .   a moment later he was through .  a rat  idly patrolling the drafty passage beyond  had to stop itself from swallowing its own tongue as he floated past .   there was another doorway at the end  and a maze of musty storerooms until he found a stairway .  he judged himself to be about thirty yards from the trapdoor .  there hadn   t been any flues that he could see .  there ought to be a clear shot across the roof .   he hunkered down and pulled out his knife roll  its velvet blackness making a darker oblong in the shadows .  he selected a number five  not everyone   s throwing knife  but worthwhile if you had the trick of it .   shortly afterward his head rose very carefully over the edge of the roof  one arm bent behind it but ready to uncurl in a complex interplay of forces that would combine to send a few ounces of steel gliding across the night .   mericet was sitting by the trapdoor  looking at his clipboard .  teppic   s eyes swiveled to the oblong of the plank bridge  stored meticulously against the parapet a few feet away .   he was certain he had made no noise .  he   d have to swear that the examiner heard the sound of his gaze falling on him .   the old man raised his bald head .      thank you  mr .  teppic     he said     you may proceed .      teppic felt the sweat of his body grow cold .  he stared at the plank  and then at the examiner  and then at his knife .      yes  sir     he said .  this didn   t seem like enough  in the circumstances .  he added     thank you  sir .        he   d always remember the first night in the dormitory .  it was long enough to accommodate all eighteen boys in viper house  and drafty enough to accommodate the great outdoors .  its designer may have had comfort in mind  but only so that he could avoid it wherever possible  he had contrived a room that could actually be colder than the weather outside .      i thought we got rooms to ourselves     said teppic .   chidder  who had laid claim to the least exposed bed in the whole refrigerator  nodded at him .      later on     he said .  he lay back  and winced .     do they sharpen these springs  do you reckon .      teppic said nothing .  the bed was in fact rather more comfortable than the one he   d slept in at home .  his parents  being high born  naturally tolerated conditions for their children which would have been rejected out of hand by destitute sandflies .   he stretched out on the thin mattress and analyzed the day   s events .  he   d been enrolled as an assassin  all right  a student assassin  for more than seven hours and they hadn   t even let him lay a hand on a knife yet .  of course  tomorrow was another day     chidder leaned over .      where   s arthur .     he said .   teppic looked at the bed opposite him .  there was a pathetically small sack of clothing positioned neatly in its center  but no sign of its intended occupant .      do you think he   s run away .     he said  staring around at the shadows .      could be     said chidder .     it happens a lot  you know .  mummy   s boys  away from home for the first time        the door at the end of the room swung open slowly and arthur entered  backward  tugging a large and very reluctant billy goat .  it fought him every step of the way down the aisle between the bedsteads .   the boys watched in silence for several minutes as he tethered the animal to the end of his bed  upended the sack on the blankets  and took out several black candles  a sprig of herbs  a rope of skulls  and a piece of chalk .  taking the chalk  and adopting the shiny  pink faced expression of someone who is going to do what they know to be right no matter what  arthur drew a double circle around his bed and then  getting down on his chubby knees  filled the space between them with as unpleasant a collection of occult symbols as teppic had ever seen .  when they were completed to his satisfaction he placed the candles at strategic points and lit them  they spluttered and gave off a smell that suggested that you really wouldn   t want to know what they were made of .   he drew a short  red handled knife from the jumble on the bed and advanced toward the goat     a pillow hit him on the back of the head .      garn .  pious little bastard .      arthur dropped the knife and burst into tears .  chidder sat up in bed .      that was you  cheesewright .     he said .     i saw you .      cheesewright  a skinny young man with red hair and a face that was one large freckle  glared at him .      well  it   s too much     he said .     a fellow can   t sleep with all this religion going on .  i mean  only little kids say their prayers at bedtime these days  we   re supposed to be learning to be assassins           you can jolly well shut up  cheesewright     shouted chidder .     it   d be a better world if more people said their prayers  you know .  i know i don   t say mine as often as i should        a pillow cut him off in mid sentence .  he bounded out of bed and vaulted at the red haired boy  fists flailing .   as the rest of the dormitory gathered around the scuffling pair teppic slid out of bed and padded over to arthur  who was sitting on the edge of his bed and sobbing .   he patted him uncertainly on the shoulder  on the basis that this sort of thing was supposed to reassure people .      i shouldn   t cry about it  youngster     he said  gruffly .      but   but all the runes have been scuffed     said arthur .     it   s all too late now .  and that means the great orm will come in the night and wind out my entrails on a stick .         does it .         and suck out my eyes  my mother said .         gosh .     said teppic  fascinated .     really .     he was quite glad his bed was opposite arthur   s  and would offer an unrivalled view .     what religion would this be .         we   re strict authorized ormits     said arthur .  he blew his nose .     i noticed you don   t pray     he said .     don   t you have a god .         oh yes     said teppic hesitantly     no doubt about that .         you don   t seem to want to talk to him .      teppic shook his head .     i can   t     he said     not here .  he wouldn   t be able to hear  you see .         my god can hear me anywhere     said arthur fervently .      well  mine has difficulty if you   re on the other side of the room     said teppic .     it can be very embarrassing .         you   re not an offlian  are you .     said arthur .  offler was a crocodile god  and lacked ears .      no .         what god do you worship  then .         not exactly worship     said teppic  discomforted .     i wouldn   t say worship .  i mean  he   s all right .  he   s my father  if you must know .      arthur   s pink rimmed eyes widened .      you   re the son of a god .     he whispered .      it   s all part of being a king  where i come from     said teppic hurriedly .     he doesn   t have to do very much .  that is  the priests do the actual running of the country .  he just makes sure that the river floods every year  d   you see  and services the great cow of the arch of the sky .  well  used to .         the great           my mother     explained teppic .     it   s all very embarrassing .         does he smite people .         i don   t think so .  he   s never said .      arthur reached down to the end of the bed .  the goat  in the confusion  had chewed through its rope and trotted but of the door  vowing to give up religion in future .      i   m going to get into awful trouble     he said .     i suppose you couldn   t ask your father to explain things to the great orm .         he might be able to     said teppic doubtfully .     i was going to write home tomorrow anyway .         the great orm is normally to be found in one of the nether hells     said arthur     where he watches everything we do .  everything i do  anyway .  there   s only me and mother left now  and she doesn   t do much that needs watching .         i   ll be sure and tell him .         do you think the great orm will come tonight .         i shouldn   t think so .  i   ll ask my father to be sure and tell him not to .      at the other end of the dormitory chidder was kneeling on cheesewright   s back and knocking his head repeatedly against the wall .      say it again     he commanded .     come on      there   s nothing wrong                 there   s nothing wrong with a chap being man enough       curse you  chidder  you beastly           i can   t hear you  cheesewright     said chidder .         man enough to say his prayers in front of other chaps     you rotter .         right .  and don   t you forget it .      after lights out teppic lay in bed and thought about religion .  it was certainly a very complicated subject .   the valley of the djel had its own private gods  gods which had nothing to do with the world outside .  it had always been very proud of the fact .  the gods were wise and just and regulated the lives of men with skill and foresight  there was no question about that  but there were some puzzles .   for example  he knew his father made the sun come up and the river flood and so on .  that was basic  it was what the pharaohs had done ever since the time of khuft  you couldn   t go around questioning things like that .  the point was  though  did he just make the sun come up in the valley or everywhere in the world .  making the sun come up in the valley seemed a more reasonable proposition  after all  his father wasn   t getting any younger  but it was rather difficult to imagine the sun coming up everywhere else and not the valley  which led to the distressing thought that the sun would come up even if his father forgot about it  which was a very likely state of affairs .  he   d never seen his father do anything much about making the sun rise  he had to admit .  you   d expect at least a grunt of effort around about the dawn .  his father never got up until after breakfast .  the sun came up just the same .   he took some time to get to sleep .  the bed  whatever chidder said  was too soft  the air was too cold and  worst of all  the sky outside the high windows was too dark .  at home it would have been full of flarelight from the necropolis  its silent flames eerie but somehow familiar and comforting  as though the ancestors were watching over their valley .  he didn   t like the darkness     the following night in the dormitory one of the boys from further along the coast shyly tried to put the boy in the next bed inside a wickerwork cage he made in craft and set fire to him  and the night after that snoxall  who had the bed by the door and came from a little country out in the forests somewhere  painted himself green and asked for volunteers to have their intestines wound around a tree .  on thursday a small war broke out between those who worshipped the mother goddess in her aspect of the moon and those who worshipped her in her aspect of a huge fat woman with enormous buttocks .  after that the masters intervened and explained that religion  while a fine thing  could be taken too far .     teppic had a suspicion that unpunctuality was unforgivable .  but surely mericet would have to be at the tower ahead of him .  and he was going by the direct route .  the old man couldn   t possibly get there before him .  mind you  he couldn   t possibly have got to the bridge in the alley first   he must have taken the bridge away before he met me and then he climbed up on the roof while i was climbing up the wall  teppic told himself  without believing a word of it .   he ran along a roof ridge  senses alert for dislodged tiles or tripwires .  his imagination equipped every shadow with watching figures .   the gong tower loomed ahead of him .  he paused  and looked at it .  he had seen it a thousand times before  and scaled it many times although it barely rated a   .    notwithstanding that the brass dome on top was an interesting climb .  it was just a familiar landmark .  that made it worse now  it bulked in front of him  a stubby menacing shape against the grayness of the sky .   he advanced more slowly now  approaching the tower obliquely across the sloping roof .  it came to him that his initials were there  on the dome  along with chiddy   s and those of hundreds of other young assassins  and that they   d carry on being up there even if he died tonight .  it was sort of comforting .  only not very .   he unslung his rope and made an easy throw onto the wide parapet that ran around the tower  just under the dome .  he tested it  and heard the gentle clink as it caught .   then he tugged it as hard as possible  bracing himself with one foot on a chimney stack .   abruptly  and with no sound  a section of parapet slid outward and dropped .   there was a crash as it hit the roof below and then slid down the tiles .  another pause was punctuated by a distant thump as it hit the silent street .  a dog barked .   stillness ruled the rooftops .  where teppic had been the breeze stirred the burning air .   after several minutes he emerged from the deeper shadow of a chimney stack  smiling a strange and terrible smile .   nothing the examiner could do could possibly be unfair .  an assassin   s clients were invariably rich enough to pay for extremely ingenious protection  up to and including hiring assassins of his own .   mericet wasn   t trying to kill him  he was merely trying to make him kill himself .   he sidled up to the base of the tower and found a drainpipe .  it hadn   t been coated with slipall  rather to his surprise  but his gently questing fingers did find the poisoned needles painted black and glued to the inner face of the pipe .  he removed one with his tweezers and sniffed it .   distilled bloat .  pretty expensive stuff  with an astonishing effect .  he took a small glass vial from his belt and collected as many needles as he could find  and then put on his armored gloves and  with the speed of a sloth  started to climb .        now it may well be that  as you travel across the city on your lawful occasions  you will find yourselves in opposition to fellow members  even one of the gentlemen  with whom you are currently sharing a bench .  and this is quite right and what are you doing mr .  chidder no don   t tell me i   m sure i wouldn   t want to know see me afterward proper .  it is open to everyone to defend themselves as best they may .  there are  however  other enemies who will dog your steps and against whom you are all ill prepared who are they mr .  cheesewright .      mericet spun around from his blackboard like a vulture who has just heard a death rattle and pointed the chalk at cheesewright  who gulped .      thieves    guild  sir .     he managed .      step out here  boy .      there were whispered rumors in the dormitories about what mericet had done to slovenly pupils in the past  which were always vague but horrifying .  the class relaxed .  mericet usually concentrated on one victim at a time  so all they had to do now was look keen and enjoy the show .  crimson to his ears  cheesewright got to his feet and trooped down the aisle between the desks .   the master inspected him thoughtfully .      well  now     he said     and here we have cheesewright  g .   skulking across the quaking rooftops .  see the determined ears .  see the firm set of those knees .      the class tittered dutifully .  cheesewright gave them an idiotic grin and rolled his eyes .      but what are these sinister figures that march in step with him  hey .  since you find this so funny  mr .  teppic  perhaps you would be so good as to tell mr .  cheesewright .      teppic froze in mid laugh .   mericet   s gaze bored into him .  he   s just like dios the high priest  teppic thought .  even father   s frightened of dios .   he knew what he ought to do  and he was damned if he was going to do it .  he ought to be scared .      ill preparedness     he said .     carelessness .  lack of concentration .  poor maintenance of tools .  oh  and over confidence  sir .      mericet held his gaze for some time  but teppic had practiced on the palace cats .   finally the teacher gave a brief smile that had absolutely nothing to do with humor  tossed the chalk in the air  caught it again  and said     mr .  teppic is exactly right .  especially about the over confidence .        there was a ledge leading to an invitingly open window .  there was oil on the ledge  and teppic invested several minutes in screwing small crampons into cracks in the stonework before advancing .   he hung easily by the window and proceeded to take a number of small metal rods from his belt .  they were threaded at the ends  and after a few seconds    brisk work he had a rod about three feet long on the end of which he affixed a small mirror .   that revealed nothing in the gloom beyond the opening .  he pulled it back and tried again  this time attaching his hood into which he   d stuffed his gloves  to give the impression of a head cautiously revealing itself against the light .  he was confident that it would pick up a bolt or a dart  but it remained resolutely unattacked .   he was chilly now  despite the heat of the night .  black velvet looked good  but that was about all you could say for it .  the excitement and the exertion meant he was now wearing several pints of clammy water .   he advanced .   there was a thin black wire on the window sill  and a serrated blade screwed to the sash window above it .  it was the work of a moment to wedge the sash with more rods and then cut the wire  the window dropped a fraction of an inch .  he grinned in the darkness .   a sweep with a long rod inside the room revealed that there was a floor  apparently free of obstructions .  there was also a wire at about chest height .  he drew the rod back  affixed a small hook on the end  sent it back  caught the wire  and tugged .   there came the dull smack of a crossbow bolt hitting old plaster .   a lump of clay on the end of the same rod  pushed gently across the floor  revealed several caltraps .  teppic hauled them back and inspected them with interest .  they were copper .  if he   d tried the magnet technique  which was the usual method  he wouldn   t have found them .   he thought for a while .  he had slip on priests in his pouch .  they were devilish things to prowl around a room in  but he shuffled into them anyway .   priests were metal reinforced overshoes .  they saved your soles .  this is an assassin joke .   mericet was a poisons man  after all .  bloat  if he tipped them with that teppic would plate himself all over the walls .  they wouldn   t need to bury him  they   d just redecorate over the top .   the rules .  mericet would have to obey the rules .  he couldn   t simply kill him  with no warning .  he   d have to let him  by carelessness or over confidence  kill himself .   he dropped lightly onto the floor inside the room and let his eyes adjust to the darkness .  a few exploratory swings with the rods detected no more wires  there was a faint crunch underfoot as a priest crushed a caltrap .      in your own time  mr .  teppic .      mericet was standing in a corner .  teppic heard the faint scratching of his pencil as he made a note .  he tried to put the man out of his mind .  he tried to think .   there was a figure lying on a bed .  it was entirely covered by a blanket .   this was the last bit .  this was the room where everything was decided .  this was the bit the successful students never told you about .  the unsuccessful ones weren   t around to ask .   teppic   s mind filled up with options .  at a time like this  he thought  some divine guidance would be necessary .     where are you  dad .      he envied his fellow students who believed in gods that were intangible and lived a long way away on top of some mountain .  a fellow could really believe in gods like that .  but it was extremely hard to believe in a god when you saw him at breakfast every day .   he unslung his crossbow and screwed its greased sections together .  it wasn   t a proper weapon  but he   d run out of knives and his lips were too dry for the blowpipe .   there was a clicking from the corner .  mericet was idly tapping his teeth with his pencil .   it could be a dummy under there .  how would he know .  no  it had to be a real person .  you heard tales .  perhaps he could try the rods     he shook his head  raised the crossbow  and took careful aim .      whenever you like mr .  teppic .      this was it .   this was where they found out if you could kill .   this was what he had been trying to put out of his mind .   he knew he couldn   t .     octeday afternoons was political expediency with lady t   malia  one of the few women to achieve high office in the guild .  in the lands around the circle sea it was generally agreed that one way to achieve a long life was not to have a meal with her ladyship .  the jewelry of one hand alone carried enough poison to inhume a small town .  she was stunningly beautiful  but with the kind of calculated beauty that is achieved by a team of skilled artists  manicurists  plasterers  corsetiers and dressmakers and three hours    solid work every morning .  when she walked there was a faint squeak of whalebone under incredible stress .   the boys were learning .  as she talked they didn   t watch her figure .  they watched her fingers .      and thus     she said     let us consider the position before the founding of the guild .  in this city  and indeed in many places elsewhere  civilization is nurtured and progresses by the dynamic interplay of interests among many large and powerful advantage cartels .      in the days before the founding of the guild the seeking of advancement among these consortia invariably resulted in regrettable disagreements which were terminated with extreme prejudice .  these were extremely deleterious to the common interest of the city .  please understand that where disharmony rules  commerce flags .      and yet  and yet .     she clasped her hands to her bosom .  there was a creak like a galleon beating against a gale .      clearly there was a need for an extreme yet responsible means of settling irreconcilable differences     she went on     and thus was laid the groundwork for the guild .  what bliss       the sudden peak in her voice guiltily jerked several dozen young men out of their private reveries      it must have been to have been present in those early days  when men of stout moral purpose set out to forge the ultimate political tool short of warfare .  how fortunate you are now  in training for a guild which demands so much in terms of manners  deportment  bearing and esoteric skills  and yet offers a power once the preserve only of the gods .  truly  the world is the mollusc of your choice        chidder translated much of this behind the stables during the dinner break .      i know what terminate with extreme prejudice means     said cheesewright loftily .     it means to inhume with an axe .         it bloody well doesn   t     said chidder .      how do you know  then .         my family have been in commerce for years     said chidder .      huh     said cheesewright .     commerce .      chidder never went into details about what kind of commerce it was .  it had something to do with moving items around and supplying needs  but exactly what items and which needs was never made clear .   after hitting cheesewright he explained carefully that terminate with extreme prejudice did not simply require that the victim was inhumed  preferably in an extremely thorough way  but that his associates and employees were also intimately involved  along with the business premises  the building  and a large part of the surrounding neighborhood  so that everyone involved would know that the man had been unwise enough to make the kind of enemies who could get very angry and indiscriminate .      gosh     said arthur .      oh  that   s nothing     said chidder     one hogswatch night my grandad and his accounts department went and had a high level business conference with the hubside people and fifteen bodies were never found .  very bad  that sort of thing .  upsets the business community .         all the business community  or just that part of it floating face down in the river .     said teppic .      that   s the point .  better it should be like this     said chidder  shaking his head .     you know .  clean .  that   s why my father said i should join the guild .  i mean  you   ve got to get on with the business these days  you can   t spend your whole time on public relations .        the end of the crossbow trembled .   he liked everything else about the school  the climbing  the music studies  the broad education .  it was the fact that you ended up killing people that had been preying on his mind .  he   d never killed anyone .   that   s the whole point  he told himself .  this is where everyone finds out if you can  including you .   if i get it wrong now  i   m dead .   in his corner  mericet began to hum a discouraging little tune .   there was a price the guild paid for its license .  it saw to it that there were no careless  half hearted or  in a manner of speaking  murderously inefficient assassins .  you never met anyone who   d failed the test .   people did fail .  you just never met them .  maybe there was one under there  maybe it was chidder  even  or snoxall or any one of the lads .  they were all doing the run this evening .  maybe if he failed he   d be bundled under there     teppic tried to sight on the recumbent figure .      ahem     coughed the examiner .   his throat was dry .  panic rose like a drunkard   s supper .  his teeth wanted to chatter .  his spine was freezing  his clothes a collection of damp rags .  the world slowed down .   no .  he wasn   t going to .  the sudden decision hit him like a brick in a dark alley  and was nearly as surprising .  it wasn   t that he hated the guild  or even particularly disliked mericet  but this wasn   t the way to test anyone .  it was just wrong .   he decided to fail .  exactly what could the old man do about it  here .   and he   d fail with flair .   he turned to face mericet  looked peacefully into the examiner   s eyes  extended his crossbow hand in some vague direction to his right  and pulled the trigger .   there was a metallic twang .   there was a click as the bolt ricocheted off a nail in the window sill .  mericet ducked as it whirred over his head .  it hit a torch bracket on the wall  and went past teppic   s white face purring like a maddened cat .   there was a thud as it hit the blanket  and then silence .      thank you  mr .  teppic .  if you could bear with me just one moment .      the old assassin pored over his clipboard  his lips moving .   he took the pencil  which dangled from it by a bit of frayed string  and made a few marks on a piece of pink paper .      i will not ask you to take it from my hands     he said     what with one thing and another .  i shall leave it on the table by the door .      it wasn   t a particularly pleasant smile  it was thin and dried up  a smile with all the warmth long ago boiled out of it  people normally smiled like that when they had been dead for about two years under the broiling desert sun .  but at least you felt he was making the effort .   teppic hadn   t moved .     i   ve passed .     he said .      that would appear to be the case .         but           i am sure you know that we are not allowed to discuss the test with pupils .  however  i can tell you that i personally do not approve of these modern flashy techniques .  good morning to you .     and mericet stalked out .   teppic tottered over to the dusty table by the door and looked down  horrified  at the paper .  sheer habit made him extract a pair of tweezers from his pouch in order to pick it up .   it was genuine enough .  there was the seal of the guild on it  and the crabbed squiggle that was undoubtedly mericet   s signature  he   d seen it often enough  generally at the bottom of test papers alongside comments like      .  see me .   he padded over to the figure on the bed and pulled back the blanket .     it was nearly one in the morning .  ankh morpork was just beginning to make a night of it .   it had been dark up above the rooftops  in the aerial world of thieves and assassins .  but down below the life of the city flowed through the streets like a tide .   teppic walked through the throng in a daze .  anyone else who tried that in the city was asking for a guided tour of the bottom of the river  but he was wearing assassin   s black and the crowd just automatically opened in front of him and closed behind .  even the pickpockets kept away .  you never knew what you might find .  he wandered aimlessly through the gates of the guild house and sat down on a black marble seat  with his chin on his knuckles .   the fact was that his life had come to an end .  he hadn   t thought about what was going to happen next .  he hadn   t dared to think that there was going to be a next .   someone tapped him on the shoulder .  as he turned  chidder sat down beside him and wordlessly produced a slip of pink paper .      snap     he said .      you passed too .     said teppic .   chidder grinned .     no problem     he said .     it was nivor .  no problem .  he gave me a bit of trouble on the emergency drop  though .  how about you .         hmm .  oh .  no .     teppic tried to get a grip on himself .     no trouble     he said .      heard from any of the others .         no .      chidder leaned back .     cheesewright will make it     he said loftily     and young arthur .  i don   t think some of the others will .  we could give them twenty minutes  what do you say .      teppic turned an agonized face toward him .      chiddy  i           what .         when it came to it  i           what about it .      teppic looked at the cobbles .     nothing     he said .      you   re lucky   you just had a good airy run over the rooftops .  i had the sewers and then up the garderobe in the haberdashers    tower .  i had to go in and change when i got here .         you had a dummy  did you .     said teppic .      good grief  didn   t you .         but they let us think it was going to be real .     teppic wailed .      it felt real  didn   t it .         yes .         well  then .  and you passed .  so no problem .         but didn   t you wonder who might be under the blanket  who it was  and why    .         i was worried that i might not do it properly     chidder admitted .     but then i thought  well  it   s not up to me .         but i       teppic stopped .  what could he do .  go and explain .  somehow that didn   t seem a terribly good idea .   his friend slapped him on the back .      don   t worry about it .     he said .     we   ve done it .      and chidder held up his thumb pressed against the first two fingers of his right hand  in the ancient salute of the assassins .     a thumb pressed against two fingers  and the lean figure of dr .  cruces  head tutor  looming over the startled boys .      we do not murder    he said .  it was a soft voice  the doctor never raised his voice  but he had a way of giving it the pitch and spin that could make it be heard through a hurricane .      we do not execute .  we do not massacre .  we never  you may be very certain  we never torture .  we have no truck with crimes of passion or hatred or pointless gain .  we do not do it for a delight in inhumation  or to feed some secret inner need  or for petty advantage  or for some cause or belief  i tell you  gentlemen  that all these reasons are in the highest degree suspect .  look into the face of a man who will kill you for a belief and your nostrils will snuff up the scent of abomination .  hear a speech declaring a holy war and  i assure you  your ears should catch the clink of evil   s scales and the dragging of its monstrous tail over the purity of the language .      no  we do it for the money .      and  because we above all must know the value of a human life  we do it for a great deal of money .      there can be few cleaner motives  so shorn of all pretense .      nil mortifi  sine lucre .  remember .  no killing without payment .      he paused for a moment .      and always give a receipt     he added .        so it   s all ok     said chidder .  teppic nodded gloomily .  that was what was so likeable about chidder .  he had this enviable ability to avoid thinking seriously about anything he did .   a figure approached cautiously through the open gates .   the light from the torch in the porters    lodge glinted off blond curly hair .      you two made it  then     said arthur  nonchalantly flourishing the slip .   arthur had changed quite a lot in seven years .  the continuing failure of the great orm to wreak organic revenge for lack of piety had cured him of his tendency to run everywhere with his coat over his head .  his small size gave him a natural advantage in those areas of the craft involving narrow spaces .  his innate aptitude for channelled violence had been revealed on the day when fliemoe and some cronies had decided it would be fun to toss the new boys in a blanket  and picked arthur first  ten seconds later it had taken the combined efforts of every boy in the dormitory to hold arthur back and prise the remains of the chair from his fingers .  it had transpired that he was the son of the late johan ludorum  one of the greatest assassins in the history of the guild .  sons of dead assassins always got a free scholarship .  yes  it could be a caring profession at times .   there hadn   t been any doubt about arthur passing .  he   d been given extra tuition and was allowed to use really complicated poisons .  he was probably going to stay on for post graduate work .   they waited until the gongs of the city struck two .  clockwork was not a precise technology in ankh morpork  and many of the city   s various communities had their own ideas of what constituted an hour in any case  so the chimes went on bouncing around the rooftops for five minutes .   when it was obvious that the city   s consensus was in favor of it being well past two the three of them stopped looking silently at their shoes .      well  that   s it     said chidder .      poor old cheesewright     said arthur .     it   s tragic  when you think about it .         yes  he owed me fourpence     agreed chidder .     come on .  i   ve arranged something for us .        king teppicymon xxvii got out of bed and clapped his hands over his ears to shut out the roar of the sea .  it was strong tonight .   it was always louder when he was feeling out of sorts .  he needed something to distract himself .  he could send for ptraci  his favorite handmaiden .  she was special .  her singing always cheered him up .  life seemed so much brighter when she stopped .   or there was the sunrise .  that was always comforting .  it was pleasant to sit wrapped in a blanket on the topmost roof of the palace  watching the mists lift from the river as the golden flood poured over the land .  you got that warm  contented feeling of another job well done .  even if you didn   t actually know how you   d done it     he got up  shuffled on his slippers  and padded out of his bedroom and down the wide corridor that led to the huge spiral stairs and the roof .  a few rushlights illuminated the statues of the other local gods  painting the walls with shifting shadow pictures of things dog headed  fish bodied  spider armed .  he   d known them since childhood .  his juvenile nightmares would have been quite formless without them .   the sea .  he   d only seen it once  when he was a boy .  he couldn   t recall a lot about it  except the size .  and the noise .  and the seagulls .   they   d preyed on his mind .  they seemed to have it far better worked out  seagulls .  he wished he could come back as one  one day  but of course that wasn   t an option if you were a pharaoh .  you never came back .  you didn   t exactly go away  in fact .        well  what is it .     said teppic .      try it     said chidder     just try it .  you   ll never have the chance again .         seems a shame to spoil it     said arthur gallantly  looking down at the delicate pattern on his plate .     what are all the little red things .         they   re just radishes     said chidder dismissively .     they   re not the important part .  go on .      teppic reached over with the little wooden fork and skewered a paper thin sliver of white fish .  the squishi chef was scrutinizing him with the air of one watching a toddler on his first birthday .  so  he realized  was the rest of the restaurant .   he chewed it carefully .  it was salty and faintly rubbery  with a hint of sewage outfall .      nice .     said chidder anxiously .  several nearby diners started to clap .      different     teppic conceded  chewing .     what is it .         deep sea blowfish     said chidder .      it   s all right     he said hastily as teppic laid down his fork meaningfully     it   s perfectly safe provided every bit of stomach  liver and digestive tract is removed  that   s why it cost so much  there   s no such thing as a second best blowfish chef  it   s the most expensive food in the world  people write poems about it           could be a taste explosion     muttered teppic  getting a grip on himself .  still  it must have been done properly  otherwise the place would now be wearing him as wallpaper .  he poked carefully at the sliced roots which occupied the rest of the plate .      what do these do to you .     he said .      well  unless they   re prepared in exactly the right way over a six week period they react catastrophically with your stomach acids     said chidder .     sorry .  i thought we should celebrate with the most expensive meal we could afford .         i see .  fish and chips for men    said teppic .      do they have any vinegar in this place .     said arthur  his mouth full .     and some mushy peas would go down a treat .      but the wine was good .  not incredibly good  though .  not one of the great vintages .  but it did explain why teppic had gone through the whole of the day with a headache .   it had been the hangunder .  his friend had bought four bottles of otherwise quite ordinary white wine .  the reason it was so expensive was that the grapes it was made from hadn   t actually been planted yet .      light moves slowly  lazily on the disc .  it   s in no hurry to get anywhere .  why bother .  at lightspeed  everywhere is the same place .   king teppicymon xxvii watched the golden disc float over the edge of the world .  a flight of cranes took off from the mist covered river .   he   d been conscientious  he told himself .  no one had ever explained to him how one made the sun come up and the river flood and the corn grow .  how could they .  he was the god  after all .  he should know .  but he didn   t  so he   d just gone through life hoping like hell that it would all work properly  and that seemed to have done the trick .  the trouble was  though  that if it didn   t work  he wouldn   t know why not .  a recurrent nightmare was of dios the high priest shaking him awake one morning  only it wouldn   t be a morning  of course  and of every light in the palace burning and an angry crowd muttering in the star lit darkness outside and everyone looking expectantly at him     and all he   d be able to say was     sorry .      it terrified him .  how easy to imagine the ice forming on the river  the eternal frost riming the palm trees and snapping off the leaves  which would smash when they hit the frozen ground  and the birds dropping lifeless from the sky     shadow swept over him .  he looked up through eyes misted with tears at a gray and empty horizon  his mouth dropping open in horror .   he stood up  flinging aside the blanket  and raised both hands in supplication .  but the sun had gone .  he was the god  this was his job  it was the only thing he was here to do  and he had failed the people .   now he could hear in his mind   s ear the anger of the crowd  a booming roar that began to fill his ears until the rhythm became insistent and familiar  until it reached the point where it pressed in no longer but drew him out  into that salty blue desert where the sun always shone and sleek shapes wheeled across the sky .   the pharaoh raised himself on his toes  threw back his head  spread his wings .  and leapt .   as he soared into the sky he was surprised to hear a thump behind him .  and the sun came out from behind the clouds .   later on  the pharaoh felt awfully embarrassed about it .     the three new assassins staggered slowly along the street  constantly on the point of falling over but never quite reaching it  trying to sing    a wizard   s staff has a knob on the end    in harmony or at least in the same key .         tis big an    i   ss round an    weighs three to the       sang chidder .     blast  what   ve i stepped in .         anyone know where we are .     said arthur .      we   we were headed for the guildhouse     said teppic     only must of took the wrong way  that   s the river up ahead .  can smell it .      caution penetrated arthur   s armor of alcohol .      could be dangerous pep   plep   people around  this time o    night     he hazarded .      yep     said chidder  with satisfaction     us .  got ticket to prove it .  got test and everything .  like to see anyone try anything with us .         right     agreed teppic  leaning against him for support of a sort .     we   ll slit them from wossname to thingy .         right .      they lurched uncertainly out onto the brass bridge .   in fact there were dangerous people around in the pre dawn shadows  and currently these were some twenty paces behind them .   the complex system of criminal guilds had not actually made ankh morpork a safer place  it just rationalized its dangers and put them on a regular and reliable footing .  the major guilds policed the city with more thoroughness and certainly more success than the old watch had ever managed  and it was true that any freelance and unlicensed thief caught by the thieves    guild would soon find himself remanded in custody for social inquiry reports plus having his knees nailed together .   however  there were always a few spirits who would venture a precarious living outside the lawless  and five men of this description were closing cautiously on the trio to introduce them to this week   s special offer  a cut throat plus theft and burial in the river mud of your choice .   people normally keep out of the way of assassins because of an instinctive feeling that killing people for very large sums of money is disapproved of by the gods  who generally prefer people to be killed for very small sums of money or for free  and could result in hubris  which is the judgment of the gods .  the gods are great believers in justice  at least as far as it extends to humans  and have been known to dispense it so enthusiastically that people miles away are turned into a cruet .   however  assassin   s black doesn   t frighten everyone  and in certain sections of society there is a distinct cachet in killing an assassin .  it   s rather like smashing a sixer in conkers .   broadly  therefore  the three even now lurching across the deserted planks of the brass bridge were dead drunk assassins and the men behind them were bent on inserting the significant comma .   chidder wandered into one of the heraldic wooden hippopotami  that lined the seaward edge of the bridge  bounced off and flopped over the parapet .      feel sick     he announced .      feel free     said arthur     that   s what the river   s for .      teppic sighed .  he was attached to rivers  which he felt were designed to have water lilies on top and crocodiles underneath  and the ankh always depressed him because if you put a water lily in it  it would dissolve .  it drained the huge silty plains all the way to the ramtop mountains  and by the time it had passed through ankh morpork  pop .  one million  it could only be called a liquid because it moved faster than the land around it  actually being sick in it would probably make it  on average  marginally cleaner .   he stared down at the thin trickle that oozed between the central pillars  and then raised his gaze to the gray horizon .      sun   s coming up     he announced .      don   t remember eating that     muttered chidder .   teppic stepped back  and a knife ripped past his nose and buried itself in the buttocks of the hippo next to him .   five figures stepped out of the mists .  the three assassins instinctively drew together .      you come near me  you   ll really regret it     moaned chidder  clutching his stomach .     the cleaning bill will be horrible .         well now  what have we here .     said the leading thief .  this is the sort of thing that gets said in these circumstances      thieves    guild  are you .     said arthur .      no     said the leader     we   re the small and unrepresentative minority that gets the rest a bad name .  give us your valuables and weapons  please .  this won   t make any difference to the outcome  you understand .  it   s just that corpse robbing is unpleasant and degrading .         we could rush them     said teppic  uncertainly .      don   t look at me     said arthur     i couldn   t find my arse with an atlas .         you   ll really be sorry when i   m sick     said chidder .   teppic was aware of the throwing knives stuffed up either sleeve  and that the chances of him being able to get hold of one in time still to be alive to throw it were likely to be very small .   at times like this religious solace is very important .  he turned and looked toward the sun  just as it withdrew from the cloudbanks of the dawn .   there was a tiny dot in the center of it .     the late king teppicymon xxvii opened his eyes .      i was flying     he whispered     i remember the feeling of wings .  what am i doing here .      he tried to stand up .  there was a temporary feeling of heaviness  which suddenly dropped away so that he rose to his feet almost without any effort .  he looked down to see what had caused it .      oh dear     he said .   the culture of the river kingdom had a lot to say about death and what happened afterward .  in fact it had very little to say about life  regarding it as a sort of inconvenient prelude to the main event and something to be hurried through as politely as possible  and therefore the pharaoh reached the conclusion that he was dead very quickly .  the sight of his mangled body on the sand below him played a major part in this .   there was a grayness about everything .  the landscape had a ghostly look  as though he could walk straight through it .  of course  he thought  i probably can .   he rubbed the analog of his hands .  well  this is it .  this is where it gets interesting  this is where i start to really live .   behind him a voice said  good morning .   the king turned .      hallo     he said .     you   d be        death  said death .   the king looked surprised .      i understood that death came as a three headed giant scarab beetle     he said .   death shrugged .  well .  now you know .      what   s that thing in your hand .      this .  it   s a scythe .      strange looking object  isn   t it .     said the pharaoh .     i thought death carried the flail of mercy and the reaping hook of justice .      death appeared to think about this .   what in .  he said .      pardon .      are we still talking about a giant beetle .      ah .  in his mandibles  i suppose .  but i think he   s got arms in one of the frescoes in the palace .     the king hesitated .     seems a bit silly  really  now i come to tell someone .  i mean  a giant beetle with arms .  and the head of an ibis  i seem to recall .      death sighed .  he was not a creature of time  and therefore past and future were all one to him  but there had been a period when he   d made an effort to appear in whatever form the client expected .  this foundered because it was usually impossible to know what the client was expecting until after they were dead .  and then he   d decided that  since no one ever really expected to die anyway  he might as well please himself and he   d henceforth stuck to the familiar black cowled robe  which was neat and very familiar and acceptable everywhere  like the best credit cards .      anyway     said the pharaoh     i expect we   d better be going .      where to .      don   t you know .      i am here only to see that you die at the appointed time .  what happens next is up to you .      well       the king automatically scratched his chin .     i suppose i have to wait until they   ve done all the preparations and so forth .  mummified me .  and built a bloody pyramid .  um .  do i have to hang around here to wait for all that .      i assume so .  death clicked his fingers and a magnificent white horse ceased its grazing on some of the garden greenery and trotted toward him .      oh .  well  i think i shall look away .  they take all the squishy inside bits out first  you know .     a look of faint worry crossed his face .  things that had seemed perfectly sensible when he was alive seemed a little suspect now that he was dead .      it   s to preserve the body so that it may begin life anew in the netherworld     he added  in a slightly perplexed voice .     and then they wrap you in bandages .  at least that seems logical .      he rubbed his nose .     but then they put all this food and drink in the pyramid with you .  bit weird  really .      where are one   s internal organs at this point .      that   s the funny thing  isn   t it .  they   re in a jar in the next room     said the king  his voice edged with doubt .     we even put a damn great model cart in dad   s pyramid .      his frown deepened .     solid wood  it was     he said  half to himself     with gold leaf all over it .  and four wooden bullocks to pull it .  then we whacked a damn great stone over the door        he tried to think  and found that it was surprisingly easy .  new ideas were pouring into his mind in a cold  clear stream .  they had to do with the play of light on the rocks  the deep blue of the sky  the manifold possibilities of the world that stretched away on every side of him .  now that he didn   t have a body to importune him with its insistent demands the world seemed full of astonishments  but unfortunately among the first of them was the fact that much of what you thought was true now seemed as solid and reliable as marsh gas .  and also that  just as he was fully equipped to enjoy the world  he was going to be buried inside a pyramid .   when you die  the first thing you lose is your life .  the next thing is your illusions .   i can see you have got a lot to think about  said death  mounting up .  and now  if you   ll excuse me        hang on a moment        yes .      when i   fell  i could have sworn that i was flying .      that part of you that was divine did fly  naturally .  you are now fully mortal .      mortal .      take it from me .  i know about these things .      oh .  look  there   s quite a few questions i   d like to ask        there always are .  i   m sorry .  death clapped his heels to his horse   s flanks  and vanished .   the king stood there as several servants came hurrying along the palace wall  slowed down as they approached his corpse  and advanced with caution .      are you all right  o jeweled master of the sun .     one of them ventured .      no  i   m not     snapped the king  who was having some of his basic assumptions about the universe severely rattled  and that never puts anyone in a good mood .     i   m by way of being dead just at the moment .  amazing  isn   t it     he added bitterly .      can you hear us  o divine bringer of the morning .     inquired the other servant  tiptoeing closer .      i   ve just fallen off a hundred foot wall onto my head  what do you think .     shouted the king .      i don   t think he can hear us  jahmet     said the other servant .      listen     said the king  whose urgency was equaled only by the servants    total inability to hear anything he was saying     you must find my son and tell him to forget about the pyramid business  at least until i   ve thought about it a bit  there are one or two points which seem a little self contradictory about the whole afterlife arrangements  and           shall i shout .     said jahmet .      i don   t think you can shout loud enough .  i think he   s dead .      jahmet looked down at the stiffening corpse .      bloody hell     he said eventually .     well  that   s tomorrow up the spout for a start .        the sun  unaware that it was making its farewell performance  continued to drift smoothly above the rim of the world .  and out of it  moving faster than any bird should be able to fly  a seagull bore down on ankh morpork  on the brass bridge and eight still figures  on one staring face     seagulls were common enough in ankh .  but as this one flew over the group it uttered one long  guttural scream that caused three of the thieves to drop their knives .  nothing with feathers ought to have been able to make a noise like that .  it had claws in it .   the bird wheeled in a tight circle and fluttered to a perch on a convenient wooden hippo  where it glared at the group with mad red eyes .   the leading thief tore his fascinated gaze away from it just as he heard arthur say  quite pleasantly     this is a number two throwing knife .  i got ninety six percent for throwing knives .  which eyeball don   t you need .      the leader stared at him .  as far as the other young assassins were concerned  he noticed  one was still staring fixedly at the seagull while the other was busy being noisily sick over the parapet .      there   s only one of you     he said .     there   s five of us .         but soon there will only be four of you     said arthur .   moving slowly  like someone in a daze  teppic reached out his hand to the seagull .  with any normal seagull this would have resulted in the loss of a thumb  but the creature hopped onto it with the smug air of the master returning to the old plantation .   it seemed to make the thieves increasingly uneasy .  arthur   s smile wasn   t helping either .      that   s a nice bird     said the leader  in the inanely cheerful tones of the extremely worried .  teppic was dreamily stroking its bullet head .      i think it would be a good idea if you went away     said arthur  as the bird shuffled sideways onto teppic   s wrist .  gripping with webbed feet  thrusting out its wings to maintain its balance  it should have looked clownish but instead looked full of hidden power  as though it was an eagle   s secret identity .  when it opened its mouth  revealing a ridiculous purple bird tongue  there was a suggestion that this seagull could do a lot more than menace a seaside tomato sandwich .      is it magic .     said one of the thieves  and was quickly hushed .      we   ll be going  then     said the leader     sorry about the misunderstanding        teppic gave him a warm  unseeing smile .   then they all heard the insistent little noise .  six pairs of eyes swiveled around and down  chidder   s were already in position .   below them  pouring darkly across the dehydrated mud  the ankh was rising .     dios  first minister and high priest among high priests  wasn   t a naturally religious man .  it wasn   t a desirable quality in a high priest  it affected your judgment  made you unsound .  start believing in things and the whole business became a farce .   not that he had anything against belief .  people needed to believe in gods  if only because it was so hard to believe in people .  the gods were necessary .  he just required that they stayed out of the way and let him get on with things .   mind you  it was a blessing that he had the looks for it .  if your genes saw fit to give you a tall frame  a bald head and a nose you could plow rocks with  they probably had a definite aim in mind .   he instinctively distrusted people to whom religion came easily .  the naturally religious  he felt  were unstable and given to wandering in the desert and having revelations   as if the gods would lower themselves to that sort of thing .  and they never got anything done .  they started thinking that rituals weren   t important .  they started thinking that you could talk to the gods direct .  dios knew  with the kind of rigid and unbending certainty you could pivot the world on  that the gods of djelibeybi liked ritual as much as anyone else .  after all  a god who was against ritual would be like a fish who was against water .   he sat on the steps of the throne with his staff across his knees  and passed on the king   s orders .  the fact that they were not currently being issued by any king was not a problem .  dios had been high priest now for  well  more years than he cared to remember  he knew quite clearly what orders a sensible king would be giving  and he gave them .   anyway  the face of the sun was on the throne  and that was what mattered .  it was a solid gold  head enveloping mask  to be worn by the current ruler on all public occasions  its expression  to the sacrilegious  was one of good natured constipation .  for thousands of years it had symbolized kingship in djelibeybi .  it had also made it very difficult to tell kings apart .   this was extremely symbolic as well  although no one could remember what of .   there was a lot of that sort of thing in the old kingdom .  the staff across his knees  for example  with its very symbolic snakes entwined symbolically around an allegorical camel prod .  the people believed this gave the high priests power over the gods and the dead  but this was probably a metaphor  i . e .   a lie .   dios shifted position .      has the king been ushered to the room of going forth .     he said .   the circle of lesser high priests nodded .      dil the embalmer is attending upon him at this instant  o dios .         very well .  and the builder of pyramids has been instructed .      hoot koomi  high priest of khefin  the two faced god of gateways  stepped forward .      i took the liberty of attending to that myself  o dios     he purred .   dios tapped his fingers on his staff .     yes     he said     i have no doubt that you did .      it was widely expected by the priesthood that koomi would be the one to succeed dios in the event of dios ever actually dying  although hanging around waiting for dios to die had never seemed to be a rewarding occupation .  the only dissenting opinion was that of dios himself  who  if he had any friends  would probably have confided in them certain conditions that would need to apply first  viz .   blue moons  aerial pigs and he  dios  being seen in hell .  he would probably have added that the only difference between koomi and a sacred crocodile was the crocodile   s basic honesty of purpose .      very well     he said .      if i may remind your lordship .     said koomi .  the faces of the other priests went a nice safe blank as dios glared .      yes  koomi .         the prince  o dios .  has he been summoned .         no     said dios .      then how will he know .     said koomi .      he will know     said dios firmly .      how will this be .         he will know .  and now you are all dismissed .  go away .  see to your gods .      they scurried out  leaving dios alone on the steps .  it had been his accustomed position for so long that he   d polished a groove in the stonework  into which he fitted exactly .   of course the prince would know .  it was part of the neatness of things .  but in the grooves of his mind  ground deep by the years of ritual and due observance  dios detected a certain uneasiness .  it was not at home in there .  uneasiness was something that happened to other people .  he hadn   t got where he was today by allowing room for doubt .  yet there was a tiny thought back there  a tiny certainty  that there was going to be trouble with this new king .   well .  the boy would soon learn .  they all learned .   he shifted position  and winced .  the aches and pains were back  and he couldn   t allow that .  they got in the way of his duty  and his duty was a sacred trust .   he   d have to visit the necropolis again .  tonight .        he   s not himself  you can see that .         who is he  then .     said chidder .   they splashed unsteadily down the street  not drunkenly this time  but with the awkward gait of two people trying to do the steering for three .  teppic was walking  but not in a way that gave them any confidence that his mind was having any part of it .   around them doors were being thrown open  curses were being cursed  there was the sound of furniture being dragged up to first floor rooms .      must have been a hell of a storm up in the mountains     said arthur .     it doesn   t usually flood like this even in the spring .         maybe we should burn some feathers under his nose     suggested chidder .      that bloody seagull would be favorite     arthur growled .      what seagull .         you saw it .         well  what about it .         you did see it  didn   t you .     uncertainty flickered its dark flame in arthur   s eyes .  the seagull had disappeared in all the excitement .      my attention was a bit occupied     said chidder diffidently .     it must have been those mint wafers they served with the coffee .  i thought they were a bit off .         definitely a touch eldritch  that bird     said arthur .     look  let   s put him down somewhere while i empty the water out of my boots  can we .      there was a bakery nearby  its doors thrown open so that the trays of new loaves could cool in the early morning .  they propped teppic against the wall .      he looks as though someone hit him on the head     said chidder .     no one did  did they .      arthur shook his head .  teppic   s face was locked in a gentle grin .  whatever his eyes were focused on wasn   t occupying the usual set of dimensions .      we ought to get him back to the guild and into the san        he stopped .  there was a peculiar rustling sound behind him .  the loaves of bread were bouncing gently on their trays .  one or two of them vibrated onto the floor  where they spun around like overturned beetles .   then  their crusts cracking open like eggshells  they sprouted hundreds of green shoots .   within a few seconds the trays were waving stands of young corn  their heads already beginning to fill out and bend over .  through them marched chidder and arthur  poker faced  doing the     meter nonchalant walk with teppic held rigidly between them .      is it him doing all this .         i   ve got a feeling that       arthur looked behind them  just in case any angry bakers had come out and spotted such aggressively wholemeal produce  and stopped so suddenly that the other two swung around him  like a rudder .   they looked thoughtfully at the street .      not something you see every day  that     said chidder at last .      you mean the way there   s grass and stuff growing up everywhere he puts his feet .         yes .      their eyes met .  as one  they looked down at teppic   s shoes .  he was already ankle deep in greenery  which was cracking the centuries old cobbles in its urgency .   without speaking a word  they gripped his elbows and lifted him into the air .      the san     said arthur .      the san     agreed chidder .   but they both knew  even then  that this was going to involve more than a hot poultice .     the doctor sat back .      fairly straightforward     he said  thinking quickly .     a case of mortis portalis tackulatum with complications .         what   s that mean .     said chidder .      in layman   s terms     the doctor sniffed     he   s as dead as a doornail .         what are the complications .      the doctor looked shifty .     he   s still breathing     he said .     look  his pulse is nearly humming and he   s got a temperature you could fry eggs on .     he hesitated  aware that this was probably too straightforward and easily understood  medicine was a new art on the disc  and wasn   t going to get anywhere if people could understand it .      pyrocerebrum ouerf culinaire     he said  after working it out in his head .      well  what can you do about it .     said arthur .      nothing .  he   s dead .  all the medical tests prove it .  so  er   bury him  keep him nice and cool  and tell him to come and see me next week .  in daylight  for preference .  but he   s still breathing .         these are just reflex actions that might easily confuse the layman     said the doctor airily .   chidder sighed .  he suspected that the guild  who after all had an unrivalled experience of sharp knives and complex organic compounds  was much better at elementary diagnostics than were the doctors .  the guild might kill people  but at least it didn   t expect them to be grateful for it .   teppic opened his eyes .      i must go home     he said .      dead  is he .     said chidder .   the doctor was a credit to his profession .     it   s not unusual for a corpse to make distressing noises after death     he said valiantly     which can upset relatives and        teppic sat bolt upright .      also  muscular spasms in the stiffening body can in certain circumstances       the doctor began  but his heart wasn   t in it anymore .  then an idea occurred to him .      it   s a rare and mysterious ailment     he said     which is going around a lot at the moment .  it   s caused by a   a   by something so small it can   t be detected in any way whatsoever     he finished  with a self congratulatory smile on his face .  it was a good one  he had to admit .  he   d have to remember it .      thank you very much     said chidder  opening the door and ushering him through .     next time we   re feeling really well  we   ll definitely call you in .         it   s probably a walrus     said the doctor  as he was gently but firmly propelled out of the room .     he   s caught a walrus  there   s a lot of it going        the door slammed shut .   teppic swung his legs off the bed and clutched at his head .      i   ve got to go home     he repeated .      why .     said arthur .      don   t know .  the kingdom wants me .         you seemed to be taken pretty bad there       arthur began .  teppic waved his hands dismissively .      look     he said     please  i don   t want anyone sensibly pointing out things .  i don   t want anyone telling me i should rest .  none of it matters .  i will be back in the kingdom as soon as possible .  it   s not a case of must  you understand .  i will .  and you can help me  chiddy .         how .         your father has an extremely fast vessel he uses for smuggling     said teppic flatly .     he will lend it to me  in exchange for favorable consideration of future trading opportunities .  if we leave inside the hour  it will do the journey in plenty of time .         my father is an honest trader .         on the contrary .  seventy percent of his income last year was from undeclared trading in the following commodities       teppic   s eyes stared into nothingness      from illegal transport of gullanes and leuchars  nine percent .  from night running of untaxed           well  thirty percent honest     chidder admitted     which is a lot more honest than most .  you   d better tell me how you know .  extremely quickly .         i   don   t know     said teppic .     when i was   asleep  it seemed i knew everything .  everything about everything .  i think my father is dead .         oh     said chidder .     gosh  i   m sorry .         oh  no .  it   s not like that .  it   s what he would have wanted .  i think he was rather looking forward to it .  in our family  death is when you really start to  you know  enjoy life .  i expect he   s rather enjoying it .        in fact the pharaoh was sitting on a spare slab in the ceremonial preparation room watching his own soft bits being carefully removed from his body and put into the special canopic jars .   this is not a sight often seen by people   at least  not by people in a position to take a thoughtful interest .   he was rather upset .  although he was no longer officially inhabiting his body he was still attached to it by some sort of occult bond  and it is hard to be very happy at seeing two artisans up to the elbows in bits of you .   the jokes aren   t funny  either .  not when you are  as it were  the butt .      look  master dil     said gern  a plump  red faced young man who the king had learned was the new apprentice .     look   right   watch this  watch this   look   your name in lights .  get it .  your name in lights  see .         just put them in the jar  boy     said dil wearily .     and while we   re on the subject i didn   t think much of the gottle of geer routine  either .         sorry  master .         and pass me over a number three brain hook while you   re up that end  will you .         coming right up  master     said gern .      and don   t jog me .  this is a fiddly bit .         sure thing .      the king craned nearer .   gern rummaged around at his end of the job and then gave a long  low whistle .      will you look at the color of this .     he said .     you wouldn   t think so  would you .  is it something they eat  master .      dil sighed .     just put it in the pot  gern .         right you are  master .  master .         yes  lad .         which bit   s got the god in it  master .      dil squinted up the king   s nostril  trying to concentrate .      that gets sorted out before he comes down here     he said patiently .      i wondered     said gern     because there   s not a jar for it  see .         no .  there wouldn   t be .  it   d have to be a rather strange jar  gern .      gern looked a bit disappointed .     oh     he said     so he   s just ordinary  then  is he .         in a strictly organic sense     said dil  his voice slightly muffled .      our mum said he was all right as a king     said gern .     what do you think .      dil paused with ajar in his hand  and seemed to give the conversation some thought for the first time .      never think about it until they come down here     he said .     i suppose he was better than most .  nice pair of lungs .  clean kidneys .  good big sinuses  which is what i always look for in a king .     he looked down  and delivered his professional judgment .     pleasure to work with  really .         our mum said his heart was in the right place     said gern .  the king  hovering dismally in the corner  gave a gloomy nod .  yes  he thought .  jar three  top shelf .   dil wiped his hands on a rag  and sighed .  possibly thirty five years in the funeral business  which had given him a steady hand  a philosophic manner and a keen interest in vegetarianism  had also granted him powers of hearing beyond the ordinary .  because he was almost persuaded that  right beside his ear  someone else sighed too .   the king wandered sadly over to the other side of the room  and stared at the dull liquid of the preparation vat .   funny  that .  when he was alive it had all seemed so sensible  so obvious .  now he was dead it looked a huge waste of effort .   it was beginning to annoy him .  he watched dil and his apprentice tidy up  burn some ceremonial resins  lift him   it   up  carry it respectfully across the room and slide it gently into the oily embrace of the preservative .   teppicymon xxvii gazed into the murky depths at his own body lying sadly on the bottom  like the last pickled gherkin in the jar .   he raised his eyes to the sacks in the corner .  they were full of straw .  he didn   t need telling what was going to be done with it .     the boat didn   t glide .  it insinuated itself through the water  dancing across the waves on the tips of the twelve oars  spreading like an oil slick  gliding like a bird .  it was matt black and shaped like a shark .   there was no drummer to beat the rhythm .  the boat didn   t want the weight .  anyway  he   d have needed the full kit  including snares .   teppic sat between the lines of silent rowers  in the narrow gully that was the cargo hold .  better not to speculate what cargoes .  the boat looked designed to move very small quantities of things very quickly and without anyone noticing  and he doubted whether even the smugglers    guild was aware of its existence .  commerce was more interesting than he thought .   they found the delta with suspicious ease   how many times had this whispering shadow slipped up the river  he wondered   and above the exotic smells from the mysterious former cargo he could detect the scents of home .  crocodile dung .  reed pollen .  waterlily blossoms .  lack of plumbing .  the rank of lions and reek of hippos .   the leading oarsman tapped him gently on the shoulder and motioned him up  steadied him as he stepped overboard into a few feet of water .  by the time he   d waded ashore the boat had turned and was a mere suspicion of a shadow downstream .   because he was naturally curious  teppic wondered where it would lie up during the day  since it had the look about it of a boat designed to travel only under cover of darkness  and decided that it   d probably lurk somewhere in the high reed marshes on the delta .   and because he was now a king  he made a mental note to have the marshes patrolled periodically from now on .  a king should know things .   he stopped  ankle deep in river ooze .  he had known everything .   arthur had rambled on vaguely about seagulls and rivers and loaves of bread sprouting  which suggested he   d drunk too much .  all teppic could remember was waking up with a terrible sense of loss  as his memory failed to hold and leaked away its new treasures .  it was like the tremendous insights that come in dreams and vanish on waking .  he   d known everything  but as soon as he tried to remember what it was it poured out of his head  as from a leaky bucket .   but it had left him with a new sensation .  before  his life had been ambling along  bent by circumstance .  now it was clicking along on bright rails .  perhaps he hadn   t got it in him to be an assassin  but he knew he could be a king .   his feet found solid ground .  the boat had dropped him off a little way downstream of the palace and  blue in the moonlight  the pyramid flares on the far bank were filling the night with their familiar glow .   the abodes of the happy dead came in all sizes although not  of course  in all shapes .  they clustered thickly nearer the city  as though the dead like company .   and even the oldest ones were all complete .  no one had borrowed any of the stones to build houses or make roads .  teppic felt obscurely proud of that .  no one had unsealed the doors and wandered around inside to see if the dead had any old treasures they weren   t using anymore .  and every day  without fail  food was left in the little antechambers  the commissaries of the dead occupied a large part of the palace .   sometimes the food went  sometimes it didn   t .  the priests  however  were very clear on this point .  regardless of whether the food was consumed or not  it had been eaten by the dead .  presumably they enjoyed it  they never complained  or came back for seconds .   look after the dead  said the priests  and the dead would look after you .  after all  they were in the majority .   teppic pushed aside the reeds .  he straightened his clothing  brushed some mud off his sleeve and set off for the palace .   ahead of him  dark against the flarelight  stood the great statue of khuft .  seven thousand years ago khuft had led his people out of   teppic couldn   t remember  but somewhere where they hadn   t liked being  probably  and for thoroughly good reasons  it was at times like this he wished he knew more history   and had prayed in the desert and the gods of the place had shown him the old kingdom .  and he had entered  yea  and taken possession thereof  that it should ever be the dwelling place of his seed .  something like that  anyway .  there were probably more yeas and a few verilys  with added milk and honey .  but the sight of that great patriarchal face  that outstretched arm  that chin you could crack stones on  bold in the flarelight  told him what he already knew .   he was home  and he was never going to leave again .   the sun began to rise .     the greatest mathematician alive on the disc  and in fact the last one in the old kingdom  stretched out in his stall and counted the pieces of straw in his bedding .  then he estimated the number of nails in the wall .  then he spent a few minutes proving that an automorphic resonance field has a semi infinite number of irresolute prime ideals .  after that  in order to pass the time  he ate his breakfast again .       part ii      the book of the dead      two weeks went past .  ritual and ceremony in their due times kept the world under the sky and the stars in their courses .  it was astonishing what ritual and ceremony could do .   the new king examined himself in the mirror  and frowned .      what   s it made of .     he said .     it   s rather foggy .         bronze  sire .  polished bronze     said dios  handing him the flail of mercy .      in ankh morpork we had glass mirrors with silver on the back .  they were very good .         yes  sire .  here we have bronze  sire .         do i really have to wear this gold mask .         the face of the sun  sire .  handed down through all the ages .  yes  sire .  on all public occasions  sire .      teppic peered out through the eye slots .  it was certainly a handsome face .  it smiled faintly .  he remembered his father visiting the nursery one day and forgetting to take it off  teppic had screamed the place down .      it   s rather heavy .         it is weighted with the centuries     said dios  and passed over the obsidian reaping hook of justice .      have you been a priest long  dios .         many years  sire  man and eunuch .  now           father said you were high priest even in grandad   s time .  you must be very old .         well preserved  sire .  the gods have been kind to me     said dios  in the face of the evidence .     and now  sire  if we could just hold this as well           what is it .         the honeycomb of increase  sire .  very important .      teppic juggled it into position .      i expect you   ve seen a lot of changes     he said politely .   a look of pain passed over the old priest   s face  but quickly  as if it was in a hurry to get away .     no  sire     he said smoothly     i have been very fortunate .         oh .  what   s this .         the sheaf of plenty  sire .  extremely significant  very symbolic .         if you could just tuck it under my arm  then   have you ever heard of plumbing  dios .      the priest snapped his fingers at one of the attendants .     no  sire     he said  and leaned forward .     this is the asp of wisdom .  i   ll just tuck it in here  shall i .         it   s like buckets  but not as  um  smelly .         sounds dreadful  sire .  the smell keeps bad influences away  i have always understood .  this  sire  is the gourd of the waters of the heavens .  if we could just raise our chin           this is all necessary  is it .     said teppic indistinctly .      it is traditional  sire .  if we could just rearrange things a little  sire   here is the three pronged spear of the waters of the earth  i think we will be able to get this finger around it .  we shall have to see about our marriage  sire .         i   m not sure we would be compatible  dios .      the high priest smiled with his mouth .     sire is pleased to jest  sire     he said urbanely .     however  it is essential that you marry .         i am afraid all the girls i know are in ankh morpork     said teppic airily  knowing in his heart that this broad statement referred to mrs .  collar  who had been his bedder in the sixth form  and one of the serving wenches who   d taken a shine to him and always gave him extra gravy .   but   and his blood pounded at the memory   there had been the annual assassins    ball and  because the young assassins were trained to move freely in society and were expected to dance well  and because well cut black silk and long legs attracted a certain type of older woman  they   d whirled the night away through baubons  galliards and slow stepping pavonines  until the air thickened with musk and hunger .  chidder  whose simple open face and easygoing manner were a winner every time  came back to bed very late for days afterward and tended to fall asleep during lessons         quite unsuitable  sire .  we would require a consort well versed in the observances .  of course  our aunt is available  sire .      there was a clatter .  dios sighed  and motioned the attendants to pick things up .      if we could just begin again  sire .  this is the cabbage of vegetative increase           sorry     said teppic     i didn   t hear you say i should marry my aunt  did i .         you did  sire .  interfamilial marriage is a proud tradition of our lineage     said dios .      but my aunt is my aunt     dios rolled his eyes .  he   d advised the late king repeatedly about the education of his son  but the man was stubborn  stubborn .  now he   d have to do it on the fly .  the gods were testing him  he decided .  it took decades to make a monarch  and he had weeks to do it in .      yes  sire     he said patiently .     of course .  and she is also your uncle  your cousin and your father .         hold on .  my father        the priest raised his hand soothingly .     a technicality     he said .     your great great grandmother once declared she is king as a matter of political expediency and i don   t believe the edict is ever rescinded .         but she was a woman  though .      dios looked shocked .     oh no  sire .  she is a man .  she herself declared this .         but look  a chap   s aunt           quite so  sire .  i quite understand .         well  thank you     said teppic .      it is a great shame that we have no sisters .         sisters .         it does not do to water the divine blood  sire .  the sun might not like it .  now this  sire  is the scapula of hygiene .  where would you like it put .        king teppicymon xxvii was watching himself being stuffed .  it was just as well he didn   t feel hunger these days .  certainly he would never want to eat chicken again .      very nice stitching there  master .         just keep your finger still  gern .         my mother does stitching like that .  she   s got a pinny with stitching like that  has our mum     said gern conversationally .      keep it still  i said .         it   s got all ducks and hens on it     gern supplied helpfully .   dil concentrated on the job in hand .  it was good workmanship  he was prepared to admit .  the guild of embalmers and allied trades had awarded him medals for it .      it must make you feel really proud     said gern .      what .         well  our mam says the king goes on living  sort of thing  after all this stuffing and stitching .  sort of in the netherworld .  with your stitching in him .      and several sacks of straw and a couple of buckets of pitch  thought the shade of the king sadly .  and the wrapping off gern   s lunch  although he didn   t blame the lad  who   d just forgotten where he   d put it .  all eternity with someone   s lunch wrapping as part of your vital organs .  there had been half a sausage left  too .   he   d become quite attached to dil  and even to gern .  he seemed still to be attached to his body  too   at least  he felt uncomfortable if he wandered more than a few hundred yards away from it   and so in the course of the last couple of days he   d learned quite a lot about them .   funny  really .  he   d spent the whole of his life in the kingdom talking to a few priests and so forth .  he knew objectively there had been other people around   servants and gardeners and so forth   but they figured in his life as blobs .  he was at the top  and then his family  and then the priests and the nobles of course  and then there were the blobs .  damn fine blobs  of course  some of the finest blobs in the world  as loyal a collection of blobs as a king might hope to rule .  but blobs  none the less .   but now he was absolutely engrossed in the daily details of dil   s shy hopes for advancement within the guild  and the unfolding story of gern   s clumsy overtures to glwenda  the garlic farmer   s daughter who lived nearby .  he listened in fascinated astonishment to the elaboration of a world as full of subtle distinctions of grade and station as the one he had so recently left  it was terrible to think that he might never know if gern overcame her father   s objections and won his intended  or if dil   s work on this job   on him   would allow him to aspire to the rank of exalted grand ninety degree variance of the natron lodge of the guild of embalmers and allied trades .   it was as if death was some astonishing optical device which turned even a drop of water into a complex hive of life .   he found an overpowering urge to counsel dil on elementary politics  or apprise gern of the benefits of washing and looking respectable .  he tried it several times .  they could sense him  there was no doubt about that .  but they just put it down to drafts .   now he watched dil pad over to the big table of bandages  and come back with a thick swatch which he held reflectively against what even the king was now prepared to think of as his corpse .      i think the linen     he said at last .     it   s definitely his color .      gern put his head on one side .      he   d look good in the hessian     he said .     or maybe the calico .         not the calico .  definitely not the calico .  on him it   s too big .         he could molder into it .  with wear  you know .      dil snorted .     wear .  wear .  you shouldn   t talk to me about calico and wear .  what happens if someone robs the tomb in a thousand years    time and him in calico  i   d like to know .  he   d lurch halfway down the corridor  maybe throttle one of them  i   ll grant you  but then he   s coming undone  right .  the elbows   ll be out in no time  i   ll never live it down .         but you   ll be dead  master .         dead .  what   s that got to do with it .     dil riffled through the samples .     no  it   ll be the hessian .  got plenty of give in it  hessian .  good traction  too .  he   ll really be able to lurch up speed in the passages  if he ever needs to .      the king sighed .  he   d have preferred something lightweight in taffeta .      and go and shut the door     dil added .     it   s getting breezy in here .           and now it   s time     said the high priest     for us to see our late father .     he allowed himself a quiet smile .     i am sure he is looking forward to it     he added .   teppic considered this .  it wasn   t something he was looking forward to  but at least it would get everyone   s mind off him marrying relatives .  he reached down in what he hoped was a kingly fashion to stroke one of the palace cats .  this also was not a good move .  the creature sniffed it  went cross eyed with the effort of thought  and then bit his fingers .      cats are sacred     said dios  shocked at the words teppic uttered .      long legged cats with silver fur and disdainful expressions are  maybe     said teppic  nursing his hand     i don   t know about this sort .  i   m sure sacred cats don   t leave dead ibises under the bed .  and i   m certain that sacred cats that live surrounded by endless sand don   t come indoors and do it in the king   s sandals  dios .         all cats are cats     said dios  vaguely  and added     if we would be so gracious as to follow us .     he motioned teppic toward a distant arch .   teppic followed slowly .  he   d been back home for what seemed like ages  and it still didn   t feel right .  the air was too dry .  the clothes felt wrong .  it was too hot .  even the buildings seemed wrong .  the pillars  for one thing .  back ho   back at the guild  pillars were graceful fluted things with little bunches of stone grapes and things around the top .  here they were massive pear shaped lumps  where all the stone had run to the bottom .   half a dozen servants trailed behind him  carrying the various items of regalia .   he tried to imitate dios   s walk  and found the movements coming back to him .  you turned your torso this way  then you turned your head this way  and extended your arms at forty five degrees to your body with the palms down  and then you attempted to move .   the high priest   s staff raised echoes as it touched the flagstones .  a blind man could have walked barefoot through the palace by tracing the time worn dimples it had created over the years .      i am afraid that we will find that our father has changed somewhat since we last saw him     said dios conversationally  as they undulated by the fresco of queen khaphut accepting tribute from the kingdoms of the world .      well  yes     said teppic  bewildered by the tone .     he   s dead  isn   t he .         there   s that  too     said dios  and teppic realized that he hadn   t been referring to something as trivial as the king   s current physical condition .   he was lost in a horrified admiration .  it wasn   t that dios was particularly cruel or uncaring  it was simply that death was a mere irritating transition in the eternal business of existence .  the fact that people died was just an inconvenience  like them being out when you called .   it   s a strange world  he thought .  it   s all busy shadows  and it never changes .  and i   m part of it .      who   s he .     he said  pointing to a particularly big fresco showing a tall man with a hat like a chimney and a beard like a rope riding a chariot over a lot of other  much smaller  people .      his name is in the cartouche below     said dios primly .      what .         the small oval  sire     said dios .   teppic peered closely at the dense hieroglyphics .         thin eagle  eye  wiggly line  man with a stick  bird sitting down  wiggly line        he read .  dios winced .      i believe we must apply ourselves more to the study of modern languages     he said  recovering a bit .     his name is pta ka ba .  he is king when the djel empire extends from the circle sea to the rim ocean  when almost half the continent pays tribute to us .      teppic realized what it was about the man   s speech that was strange .  dios would bend any sentence to breaking point if it meant avoiding a past tense .  he pointed to another fresco .      and her .     he said .      she is queen khat leon ra pta     said dios .     she wins the kingdom of howonderland by stealth .  this is the time of the second empire .         but she is dead .     said teppic .      i understand so     said the high priest  after the slightest of pauses .  yes .  the past tense definitely bothered dios .      i have learned seven languages     said teppic  secure in the knowledge that the actual marks he had achieved in three of them would remain concealed in the ledgers of the guild .      indeed  sire .         oh  yes .  morporkian  vanglemesht  ephebe  laotation and   several others       said teppic .      ah .     dios nodded  smiled  and continued to proceed down the corridor  limping slightly but still measuring his pace like the ticking of centuries .     the barbarian lands .        teppic looked at his father .  the embalmers had done a good job .  they were waiting for him to tell them so .   part of him  which still lived in ankh morpork  said  this is a dead body  wrapped up in bandages  surely they can   t think that this will help him get better .  in ankh  you die and they bury you or burn you or throw you to the ravens .  here  it just means you slow down a bit and get given all the best food .  it   s ridiculous  how can you run a kingdom like this .  they seem to think that being dead is like being deaf  you just have to speak up a bit .   but a second  older voice said  we   ve run a kingdom like this for seven thousand years .  the humblest melon farmer has a lineage that makes kings elsewhere look like mayflies .  we used to own the continent  before we sold it again to pay for pyramids .  we don   t even think about other countries less than three thousand years old .  it all seems to work .      hallo  father     he said .   the shade of teppicymon xxvii  which had been watching him closely  hurried across the room .      you   re looking well .     he said .     good to see you .  look  this is urgent .  please pay attention  it   s about death           he says he is pleased to see you     said dios .      you can hear him .     said teppic .     i didn   t hear anything .         the dead  naturally  speak through the priests     said the priest .     that is the custom  sire .         but he can hear me  can he .         of course .         i   ve been thinking about this whole pyramid business and  look  i   m not certain about it .      teppic leaned closer .     auntie sends her love     he said loudly .  he thought about this .     that   s my aunt  not yours .     i hope  he added .      i say .  i say .  can you hear me .         he bids you greetings from the world beyond the veil     said dios .      well  yes  i suppose i do  but look  i don   t want you to go to a lot of trouble and build           we   re going to build you a marvelous pyramid  father .  you   ll really like it there .  there   ll be people to look after you and everything .     teppic glanced at dios for reassurance .     he   ll like that  won   t he .         i don   t want one .     screamed the king .     there   s a whole interesting eternity i haven   t seen yet .  i forbid you to put me in a pyramid .         he says that is very proper  and you are a dutiful son     said dios .      can you see me .  how many fingers am i holding up .  think it   s fun  do you  spending the rest of your death under a million tons of rock  watching yourself crumble to bits .  is that your idea of a good epoch .         it   s rather drafty in here  sire     said dios .     perhaps we should get on .         anyway  you can   t possibly afford it .         and we   ll put your favorite frescoes and statues in with you .  you   ll like that  won   t you     said teppic desperately .     all your bits and pieces around you .         he will like it  won   t he .     he asked dios  as they walked back to the throne room .     only  i don   t know  i somehow got a feeling he isn   t too happy about it .         i assure you  sire     said dios     he can have no other desire .      back in the embalming room king teppicymon xxvii tried to tap gern on the shoulder  which had no effect .  he gave up and sat down beside himself .      don   t do it  lad     he said bitterly .     never have descendants .        and then there was the great pyramid itself .   teppic   s footsteps echoed on the marble tiles as he walked around the model .  he wasn   t sure what one was supposed to do here .  but kings  he suspected  were often put in that position  there was always the good old fallback  which was known as taking an interest .      well  well     he said .     how long have you been designing pyramids .      ptaclusp  architect and jobbing pyramid builder to the nobility  bowed deeply .      all my life  o light of noonday .         it must be fascinating     said teppic .  ptaclusp looked sidelong at the high priest  who nodded .      it has its points  o fount of waters     he ventured .  he wasn   t used to kings talking to him as though he was a human being .  he felt obscurely that it wasn   t right .   teppic waved a hand at the model on its podium .      yes     he said uncertainly .     well .  good .  four walls and a pointy tip .  jolly good .  first class .  says it all  really .     there still seemed to be too much silence around .  he plunged on .      good show     he said .     i mean  there   s no doubt about it .  this is   a   pyramid .  and what a pyramid it is .  indeed .      this still didn   t seem enough .  he sought for something else .     people will look at it in centuries to come and they   ll say  they   ll say   that is a pyramid .  um .      he coughed .     the walls slope nicely     he croaked .      but     he said .   two pairs of eyes swiveled toward his .      um     he said .   dios raised an eyebrow .      sire .         i seem to remember once  my father said that  you know  when he died  he   d quite like to  sort of thing  be buried at sea .      there wasn   t the choke of outrage he had expected .     he meant the delta .  it   s very soft ground by the delta     said ptaclusp .     it   d take months to get decent footings in .  then there   s your risk of sinking .  and the damp .  not good  damp  inside a pyramid .         no     said teppic  sweating under dios   s gaze     i think what he meant was  you know  in the sea .      ptaclusp   s brow furrowed .     tricky  that     he said thoughtfully .     interesting idea .  i suppose one could build a small one  a million tonner  and float it out on pontoons or something           no     said teppic  trying not to laugh     i think what he meant was  buried without           teppicymon xxvii means that he would want to be buried without delay     said dios  his voice like greased silk .     and there is no doubt that he would require to honor the very best you can build  architect .         no  i   m sure you   ve got it wrong     said teppic .   dios   s face froze .  ptaclusp   s slid into the waxen expression of someone with whom it is  suddenly  nothing to do .  he started to stare at the floor as if his very survival depended on his memorizing it in extreme detail .      wrong .     said dios .      no offense .  i   m sure you mean well     said teppic .     it   s just that  well  he seemed very clear about it at the time and           i mean well .     said dios  tasting each word as though it was a sour grape .  ptaclusp coughed .  he had finished with the floor .  now he started on the ceiling .   dios took a deep breath .     sire     he said     we have always been pyramid builders .  all our kings are buried in pyramids .  it is how we do things  sire .  it is how things are done .         yes  but           it does not admit of dispute     said dios .     who could wish for anything else .  sealed with all artifice against the desecrations of time       now the oiled silk of his voice became armor  hard as steel  scornful as spears      shielded for all time against the insults of change .      teppic glanced down at the high priest   s knuckles .  they were white  the bone pressing through the flesh as though in a rage to escape .   his gaze slid up the gray clad arm to dios   s face .  ye gods  he thought  it   s really true  he does look like they got tired of waiting for him to die and pickled him anyway .  then his eyes met those of the priest  more or less with a clang .   he felt as though his flesh was being very slowly blown off his bones .  he felt that he was no more significant than a mayfly .  a necessary mayfly  certainly  a mayfly that would be accorded all due respect  but still an insect with all the rights thereof .  and as much free will  in the fury of that gaze  as a scrap of papyrus in a hurricane .      the king   s will is that he be interred in a pyramid     said dios  in the tone of voice the creator must have used to sketch out the moon and stars .      er     said teppic .      the finest of pyramids for the king     said dios .   teppic gave up .      oh     he said .     good .  fine .  yes .  the very best  of course .      ptaclusp beamed with relief  produced his wax tablet with a flourish  and took a stylus from the recesses of his wig .  the important thing  he knew  was to clinch the deal as soon as possible .  let things slip in a situation like this and a man could find himself with           tons of bespoke limestone on his hands .      then that will be the standard model  shall we say  o water in the desert .      teppic looked at dios  who was standing and glaring at nothing now  staring the bulldogs of entropy into submission by willpower alone .      i think something larger     he ventured hopelessly .      that   s the executive     said ptaclusp .     very exclusive  o base of the eternal column .  last you a perpetuality .  also our special offer this eon is various measurements of paracosmic significance built into the very fabric at no extra cost .      he gave teppic an expectant look .      yes .  yes .  that will be fine     said teppic .   dios took a deep breath .     the king requires far more than that     he said .      i do .     said teppic  doubtfully .      indeed  sire .  it is your express wish that the greatest of monuments is erected for your father     said dios smoothly .  this was a contest  teppic knew  and he didn   t know the rules or how to play and he was going to lose .      it is .  oh .  yes .  yes .  i suppose it is  really .  yes .         a pyramid unequaled along the djel     said dios .     that is the command of the king .  it is only right and proper .         yes  yes  something like that .  er .  twice the normal size     said teppic desperately  and had the brief satisfaction of seeing dios look momentarily disconcerted .      sire .     he said .      it is only right and proper     said teppic .   dios opened his mouth to protest  saw teppic   s expression  and shut it again .   ptaclusp scribbled busily  his adam   s apple bobbing .  something like this only happened once in a business career .      can do you a very nice black marble facing on the outside     he said  without looking up .     we may have just enough in the quarry .  o king of the celestial orbs     he added hurriedly .      very good     said teppic .   ptaclusp picked up a fresh tablet .     shall we say the capstone picked out in electrum .  it   s cheaper to have built in right from the start  you don   t want to use just silver and then say later  i wish i   d had a           electrum  yes .         and the usual offices .         what .         the burial chamber  that is  and the outer chamber .  i   d recommend the memphis  very select  that comes with a matching extra large treasure room  so handy for all those little things one cannot bear to leave behind .     ptaclusp turned the tablet over and started on the other side .     and of course a similar suite for the queen  i take it .  o king who shall live forever .         eh .  oh  yes .  yes .  i suppose so     said teppic  glancing at dios .     everything .  you know .         then there   s mazes     said ptaclusp  trying to keep his voice steady .     very popular this era .  very important  your maze  it   s no good deciding you ought to have put a maze in after the robbers have been .  maybe i   m old fashioned  but i   d go for the labrys every time .  like we say  they may get in all right  but they   ll never get out .  it costs that little bit extra  but what   s money at a time like this .  o master of the waters .      something we don   t have  said a warning voice in the back of teppic   s head .  he ignored it .  he was in the grip of destiny .      yes     he said  straightening up .     the labrys .  two of them .      ptaclusp   s stylus went through his tablet .      his    n    hers  o stone of stones     he croaked .     very handy  very convenient .  with selection of traps from stock .  we can offer deadfalls  pitfalls  sliders  rolling balls  dropping spears  arrows           yes  yes     said teppic .     we   ll have them .  we   ll have them all .  all of them .      the architect took a deep breath .      and of course you   ll require all the usual steles  avenues  ceremonial sphinxes       he began .      lots     said teppic .     we leave it entirely up to you .      ptaclusp mopped his brow .      fine     he said .     marvellous .     he blew his nose .     your father  if i may make so bold  o sower of the seed  is extremely fortunate in having such a dutiful son .  i may add           you may go     said dios .     and we will expect work to start imminently .         without delay  i assure you     said ptaclusp .     er .      he seemed to be wrestling with some huge philosophical problem .      yes .     said dios coldly .      it   s uh .  there   s the matter of uh .  which is not to say uh .  of course  oldest client  valued customer  but the fact is that uh .  absolutely no doubt about credit worthiness uh .  would not wish to suggest in any way whatsoever that uh .      dios gave him a stare that would have caused a sphinx to blink and look away .      you wish to say something .     he said .     his majesty   s time is extremely limited .      ptaclusp worked his jaw silently  but the result was a foregone conclusion .  even gods had been reduced to sheepish mumbling in the face of dios   s face .  and the carved snakes on his staff seemed to be watching him too .      uh .  no  no .  sorry .  i was just  uh  thinking aloud .  i   ll depart  then  shall i .  such a lot of work to be done .  uh .     he bowed low .   he was halfway to the archway before dios added     completion in three months .  in time for inundation .          what .         you are talking to the      th monarch     said dios icily .   ptaclusp swallowed .     i   m sorry     he whispered     i mean  what .   o great king .  i mean  block haulage alone will take .  uh .     the architect   s lips trembled as he tried out various comments and  in his imagination  ran them full tilt into dios   s stare .     tsort wasn   t built in a day     he mumbled .      we do not believe we laid the specifications for that job     said dios .  he gave ptaclusp a smile .  in some ways it was worse than everything else .     we will  of course     he said     pay extra .         but you never pa       ptaclusp began  and then sagged .      the penalties for not completing on time will  of course  be terrible     said dios .     the usual clause .      ptaclusp hadn   t the nerve left to argue .     of course     he said  utterly defeated .     it is an honor .  will your eminences excuse me .  there are still some hours of daylight left .      teppic nodded .      thank you     said the architect .     may your loins be truly fruitful .  saving your presence  lord dios .      they heard him running down the steps outside .      it will be magnificent .  too big  but   magnificent     said dios .  he looked out between the pillars at the necropolic panorama on the far bank of the djel .      magnificent     he repeated .  he winced once more at the stab of pain in his leg .  ah .  he   d have to cross the river again tonight  no doubt of it .  he   d been foolish  putting it off for days .  but it would be unthinkable not to be in a position to serve the kingdom properly        something wrong  dios .     said teppic .      sire .         you looked a bit pale  i thought .      a look of panic flickered over dios   s wrinkled features .  he pulled himself upright .      i assure you  sire  i am in the best of health .  the best of health  sire .         you don   t think you   ve been overdoing it  do you .      this time there was no mistaking the expression of terror .      overdoing what  sire .         you   re always bustling  dios .  first one up  last one to bed .  you should take it easy .         i exist only to serve  sire     said dios  firmly .     i exist only to serve .      teppic joined him on the balcony .  the early evening sun glowed on a man made mountain range .  this was only the central massif  the pyramids stretched from the delta all the way up to the second cataract  where the djel disappeared into the mountains .  and the pyramids occupied the best land  near the river .  even the farmers would have considered it sacrilegious to suggest anything different .   some of the pyramids were small  and made of rough hewn blocks that contrived to look far older than the mountains that fenced the valley from the high desert .  after all  mountains had always been there .  words like    young    and    old    didn   t apply to them .  but those first pyramids had been built by human beings  little bags of thinking water held up briefly by fragile accumulations of calcium  who had cut rocks into pieces and then painfully put them back together again in a better shape .  they were old .   over the millennia the fashions had fluctuated .  later pyramids were smooth and sharp  or flattened and tiled with mica .  even the steepest of them  teppic mused  wouldn   t rate more than   .   on any edificeer   s scale  although some of the stelae and temples  which flocked around the base of the pyramids like tugboats around the dreadnoughts of eternity  could be worthy of attention .   dreadnoughts of eternity  he thought  sailing ponderously through the mists of time with every passenger traveling first class     a few stars had been let out early .  teppic looked up at them .  perhaps  he thought  there is life somewhere else .  on the stars  maybe .  if it   s true that there are billions of universes stacked alongside one another  the thickness of a thought apart  then there must be people elsewhere .   but wherever they are  no matter how mightily they try  no matter how magnificent the effort  they surely can   t manage to be as godawfully stupid as us .  i mean  we work at it .  we were given a spark of it to start with  but over hundreds of thousands of years we   ve really improved on it .   he turned to dios  feeling that he ought to repair a little bit of the damage .      you can feel the age radiating off them  can   t you     he said conversationally .      pardon  sire .         the pyramids  dios .  they   re so old .      dios glanced vaguely across the river .     are they .     he said .     yes  i suppose they are .         will you get one .     said teppic .      a pyramid .     said dios .     sire  i have one already .  it pleased one of your forebears to make provision for me .         that must have been a great honor     said teppic .  dios nodded graciously .  the staterooms of forever were usually reserved for royalty .      it is  of course  very small .  very plain .  but it will suffice for my simple needs .         will it .     said teppic  yawning .     that   s nice .  and now  if you don   t mind  i think i   ll turn in .  it   s been a long day .      dios bowed as though he was hinged in the middle .  teppic had noticed that dios had at least fifty finely tuned ways of bowing  each one conveying subtle shades of meaning .  this one looked like no .     i am your humble servant .      and a very good day it was too  if i may say so  sire .      teppic was lost for words .     you thought so .     he said .      the cloud effects at dawn were particularly effective .         they were .  oh .  do i have to do anything about the sunset .         your majesty is pleased to joke     said dios .     sunsets happen by themselves  sire .  haha .         haha     echoed teppic .   dios cracked his knuckles .     the trick is in the sunrise     he said .   the crumbling scrolls of knot said that the great orange sun was eaten every evening by the sky goddess  what  who saved one pip in time to grow a fresh sun for next morning .  and dios knew that this was so .   the book of staying in the pit said that the sun was the eye of yay  toiling across the sky each day in his endless search for his toenails .   and dios knew that this was so .   the secret rituals of the smoking mirror held that the sun was in fact a around hole in the spinning blue soap bubble of the goddess nesh  opening into the fiery real world beyond  and the stars were the holes that the rain comes through .  and dios knew that this  also  was so .   folk myth said the sun was a ball of fire which circled the world every day  and that the world itself was carried through the everlasting void on the back of an enormous turtle .  and dios also knew that this was so  although it gave him a bit of trouble .   and dios knew that net was the supreme god  and that fon was the supreme god  and so were hast  set  bin  sot  io  dhek  and ptooie  that herpetine triskeles alone ruled the world of the dead  and so did syncope  and silur the catfish headed god  and orexis nupt .   dios was maximum high priest to a national religion that had fermented and accreted and bubbled for more than seven thousand years and never threw a god away in case it turned out to be useful .  he knew that a great many mutually contradictory things were all true .  if they were not  then ritual and belief were as nothing  and if they were nothing  then the world did not exist .  as a result of this sort of thinking  the priests of the djel could give mindroom to a collection of ideas that would make even a quantum mechanic give in and hand back his toolbox .   dios   s staff knocked echoes from the stones as he limped along in the darkness down little frequented passages until he emerged on a small jetty .  untying the boat there  the high priest climbed in with difficulty  unshipped the oars and pushed himself out into the turbid waters of the dark djel .   his hands and feet felt too cold .  foolish  foolish .  he should have done this before .   the boat jerked slowly into midstream as full night rolled over the valley .  on the far bank  in response to the ancient laws  the pyramids started to light the sky .     lights also burned late in the house of ptaclusp associates  necropolitan builders to the dynasties .  the father and his twin sons were hunched over the huge wax designing tray  arguing .      it   s not as if they ever pay     said ptaclusp iia .     i mean it   s not just a case of not being able to  they don   t seem to have grasped the idea .  at least dynasties like tsort pay up within a hundred years or so .  why didn   t you           we   ve built pyramids along the djel for the last three thousand years     said his father stiffly     and we haven   t lost by it  have we .  no  we haven   t .  because the other kingdoms look to the djel  they say there   s a family that really knows its pyramids  conny sewers  they say we   ll have what they   re having  if you please  with knobs on .  anyway  they   re real royalty     he added     not like some of the ones you get these days   here today  gone next millennium .  they   re half gods  too .  you don   t expect real royalty to pay its way .  that   s one of the signs of real royalty  not having any money .         you don   t get more royal than them  then .  you   d need a new word     said iia .     we   re nearly royal in that case .         you don   t understand business  my son .  you think it   s all bookkeeping .  well  it isn   t .         it   s a question of mass .  and the power to weight ratio .      they both glared at ptaclusp iib  who was sitting staring at the sketches .  he was turning his stylus over and over in his hands  which were trembling with barely suppressed excitement .      we   ll have to use granite for the lower slopes     he said  talking to himself     the limestone wouldn   t take it .  not with all the power flows .  which will be  whooeee  they   ll be big .  i mean we   re not talking razor blades here .  this thing could put an edge on a rolling pin .      ptaclusp rolled his eyes .  he was only one generation into a dynasty and already it was trouble .  one son a born accountant  the other in love with this new fangled cosmic engineering .  there hadn   t been any such thing when he was a lad  there was just architecture .  you drew the plans  and then got in ten thousand lads on time and a half and double bubble at weekends .  they just had to pile the stuff up .  you didn   t have to be cosmic about it .   descendants .  the gods had seen fit to give him one son who charged you for the amount of breath expended in saying    good morning     and another one who worshipped geometry and stayed up all night designing aqueducts .  you scrimped and saved to send them to the best schools  and then they went and paid you back by getting educated .      what are you talking about .     he snapped .      the discharge alone       iib pulled his abacus toward him and rattled the pottery beads along the wires .     let   s say we   re talking twice the height of the executive model  which gives us a mass of   plus additional coded dimensions of occult significance as per spec   we couldn   t do this sort of thing even a hundred years ago  you realize  not with the primitive techniques we had then       his finger became a blur .   iia gave a snort and grabbed his own abacus .      limestone at two talents the ton       he said .     wear and tear on tools   masonry charges   demurrage   breakages   oh dear  oh dear   on cost   black marble at replacement prices        ptaclusp sighed .  two abaci rattling in tandem the whole day long  one changing the shape of the world and the other one deploring the cost .  whatever happened to the two bits of wood and a plumbline .   the last beads clicked against the stops .      it   d be a whole quantum leap in pyramidology     said iib  sitting back with a messianic grin on his face .      it   d be a whole kwa       iia began .      quantum     said iib  savoring the word .      it   d be a whole quantum leap in bankruptcy     said iia .     they   d have to invent a new word for that too .         it   d be worth it as a loss leader     said iib .      sure enough .  when it comes to making a loss  we   ll be in the lead     said iia sourly .      it   d practically glow .  in millennia to come people will look at it and say    that ptaclusp  he knew his pyramids all right .            they   ll call it ptaclusp   s folly  you mean .      by now the brothers were both standing up  their noses a few inches apart .      the trouble with you  sibling  is that you know the cost of everything and the value of nothing .         the trouble with you is   is   is that you don   t .         mankind must strive ever upward .         yes  on a sound financial footing  by khuft .         the search for knowledge           the search for probity        ptaclusp left them to it and stood staring out at the yard  where  under the glow of torches  the staff were doing a feverish stocktaking .   it   d been a small business when father passed it on to him   just a yard full of blocks and various sphinxes  needles  steles and other stock items  and a thick stack of unpaid bills  most of them addressed to the palace and respectfully pointing out that our esteemed account presented nine hundred years ago appeared to have been overlooked and prompt settlement would oblige .  but it had been fun in those days .  there was just him  five thousand laborers  and mrs .  ptaclusp doing the books .   you had to do pyramids  dad said .  all the profit was in mastabas  small family tombs  memorial needles and general jobbing necropoli  but if you didn   t do pyramids  you didn   t do anything .  the meanest garlic farmer  looking for something neat and long lasting with maybe some green marble chippings but within a budget  wouldn   t go to a man without a pyramid to his name .   so he   d done pyramids  and they   d been good ones  not like some you saw these days  with the wrong number of sides and walls you could put your foot through .  and yes  somehow they   d gone from strength to strength .   to build the biggest pyramid ever     in three months     with terrible penalties if it wasn   t done on time .  dios hadn   t specified how terrible  but ptaclusp knew his man and they probably involved crocodiles .  they   d be pretty terrible  all right     he stared at the flickering light on the long avenues of statues  including the one of bloody hat the vulture headed god of unexpected guests  bought on the off chance years ago and turned down by the client owing to not being up to snuff in the beak department and unshiftable ever since even at a discount .   the biggest pyramid ever     and after you   d knocked your pipes out seeing to it that the nobility had their tickets to eternity  were you allowed to turn your expertise homeward  i . e .   a bijou pyramidette for self and mrs .  ptaclusp  to ensure safe delivery into the netherworld .  of course not .  even dad had only been allowed to have a mastaba  although it was one of the best on the river  he had to admit  that red veined marble had been ordered all the way from howonderland  a lot of people had asked for the same  it had been good for business  that   s how dad would have liked it     the biggest pyramid ever     and they   d never remember who was under it .   it didn   t matter if they called it ptaclusp   s folly or ptaclusp   s glory .  they   d call it ptaclusp   s .   he surfaced from this pool of thought to hear his sons still arguing .   if this was his posterity  he   d take his chances with     ton limestone blocks .  at least they were quiet .      shut up  the pair of you     he said .   they stopped  and sat down  grumbling .      i   ve made up my mind     he said .   iib doodled fitfully with his stylus .  iia strummed his abacus .      we   re going to do it     said ptaclusp  and strode out of the room .     and any son who doesn   t like it will be cast into the outer darkness where there is a wailing and a crashing of teeth     he called over his shoulder .   the two brothers  left to themselves  glowered at each other .   at last iia said     what does    quantum    mean  anyway .      iib shrugged .     it means add another nought     he said .      oh     said iia     is that all .        all along the river valley of the djel the pyramids were flaring silently into the night  discharging the accumulated power of the day .   great soundless flames erupted from their capstones and danced upward  jagged as lightning  cold as ice .   for hundreds of miles the desert glittered with the constellations of the dead  the aurora of antiquity .  but along the valley of the djel the lights ran together in one solid ribbon of fire .     it was on the floor and it had a pillow at one end .  it had to be a bed .   teppic found he was doubting it as he tossed and turned  trying to find some part of the mattress that was prepared to meet him halfway .  this is stupid  he thought  i grew up on beds like this .  and pillows carved out of rock .  i was born in this palace  this is my heritage  i must be prepared to accept it     i must order a proper bed and a feather pillow from ankh  first thing in the morning .  i  the king  have said this shall be done .   he turned over  his head hitting the pillow with a thud .  and plumbing .  what a great idea that was .  it was amazing what you could do with a hole in the ground .   yes  plumbing .  and bloody doors .  teppic definitely wasn   t used to having several attendants waiting on his will all the time  so performing his ablutions before bed had been extremely embarrassing .  and the people  too .  he was definitely going to get to know the people .  it was wrong  all this skulking in palaces .   and how was a fellow supposed to sleep with the sky over the river glowing like a firework .   eventually sheer exhaustion wrestled his body into some zone between sleeping and waking  and mad images stalked across his eyeballs .   there was the shame of his ancestors when future archaeologists translated the as yet unpainted frescoes of his reign        squiggle  constipated eagle  wiggly line  hippo   s bottom  squiggle     and in the year of the cycle of cephnet the sun god teppic had plumbing installed and scorned the pillows of his forebears .      he dreamed of khuft   huge  bearded  speaking in thunder and lightning  calling down the wrath of the heavens on this descendant who was betraying the noble past .   dios floated past his vision  explaining that as a result of an edict passed several thousand years ago it was essential that he marry a cat .   various headed gods vied for his attention  explaining details of godhood  while in the background a distant voice tried to attract his attention and screamed something about not wanting to be buried under a load of stone .  but he had no time to concentrate on this  because he saw seven fat cows and seven thin cows  one of them playing a trombone .   but that was an old dream  he dreamed that one nearly every night     and then there was a man firing arrows at a tortoise     and then he was walking over the desert and found a tiny pyramid  only a few inches high .  a wind sprang up and blew away the sand  only now it wasn   t a wind  it was the pyramid rising  sand tumbling down its gleaming sides     and it grew bigger and bigger  bigger than the world  so that at last the pyramid was so big that the whole world was a speck in the center .   and in the center of the pyramid  something very strange happened .   and the pyramid grew smaller  taking the world with it  and vanished     of course  when you   re a pharaoh  you get a very high class of obscure dream .     another day dawned  courtesy of the king  who was curled up on the bed and using his rolled up clothes as a pillow .  around the stone maze of the palace the servants of the kingdom began to wake up .   dios   s boat slid gently through the water and bumped into the jetty .  dios climbed out and hurried into the palace  bounding up the steps three at a time and rubbing his hands together at the thought of a fresh day laid out before him  every hour and ritual ticking neatly into place .  so much to organize  so much to be needed for       the chief sculptor and maker of mummy cases folded up his measure .      you done a good job there  master dil     he said .   dil nodded .  there was no false modesty between craftsmen .   the sculptor gave him a nudge .     what a team  eh .     he said .     you pickle    em  i crate    em .      dil nodded  but rather more slowly .  the sculptor looked down at the wax oval in his hands .      can   t say i think much of the death mask  mind     he said .   gern  who was working hard on the corner slab on one of the queen   s late cats  which he had been allowed to do all by himself  looked up in horror .      i done it very careful     he said sulkily .      that   s the whole point     said the sculptor .      i know     said dil sadly     it   s the nose  isn   t it .         it was more the chin .         and the chin .         yes .         yes .      they looked in gloomy silence at the waxen visage of the pharaoh .  so did the pharaoh .      nothing wrong with my chin .         you could put a beard on it     said dil eventually .     it   d cover a lot of it  would a beard .         there   s still the nose .         you could take half an inch off that .  and do something with the cheekbones .         yes .         yes .      gern was horrified .     that   s the face of our late king you   re talking about     he said .     you can   t do that sort of thing .  anyway  people would notice .     he hesitated .     wouldn   t they .      the two craftsmen eyed one another .      gern     said dil patiently     certainly they   ll notice .  but they won   t say anything .  they expect us to  er  improve matters .         after all     said the chief sculptor cheerfully     you don   t think they   re going to step up and say    it   s all wrong  he really had a face like a short sighted chicken     do you .         thank you very much .  thank you very much indeed  i must say .     the pharaoh went and sat by the cat .  it seemed that people only had respect for the dead when they thought the dead were listening .      i suppose     said the apprentice  with some uncertainty     he did look a bit ugly compared to the frescoes .         that   s the point  isn   t it     said dil meaningfully .   gern   s big honest spotty face changed slowly  like a cratered landscape with clouds passing across it .  it was dawning on him that this came under the heading of initiation into ancient craft secrets .      you mean even the painters change the       he began .   dil frowned at him .      we don   t talk about it     he said .   gern tried to force his features into an expression of worthy seriousness .      oh     he said .     yes .  i see  master .      the sculptor clapped him on the back .      you   re a bright lad  gern     he said .     you catch on .  after all  it   s bad enough being ugly when you   re alive .  think how terrible it would be to be ugly in the netherworld .      king teppicymon xxvii shook his head .  we all have to look alike when we   re alive  he thought  and now they make sure we   re identical when we   re dead .  what a kingdom .  he looked down and saw the soul of the late cat  which was washing itself .  when he was alive he   d hated the things  but just now it seemed positively companionable .  he patted it gingerly on its flat head .  it purred for a moment  and then attempted to strip the flesh from his hand .  it was on a definite hiding to nothing there .   he was aware with growing horror that the trio was now discussing a pyramid .  his pyramid .  it was going to be the biggest one ever .  it was going to go on a highly fertile piece of sloping ground on a prime site in the necropolis .  it was going to make even the biggest existing pyramid look like something a child might construct in a sand tray .  it was going to be surrounded by marble gardens and granite obelisks .  it was going to be the greatest memorial ever built by a son for his father .   the king groaned .     ptaclusp groaned .   it had been better in his father   s day .  you just needed a bloody great heap of log rollers and twenty years  which was useful because it kept everyone out of trouble during inundation  when all the fields were flooded .  now you just needed a bright lad with a piece of chalk and the right incantations .   mind you  it was impressive  if you liked that kind of thing .   ptaclusp iib walked around the great stone block  tidying an equation here  highlighting a hermetic inscription there .  he glanced up and gave his father a brief nod .   ptaclusp hurried back to the king  who was standing with his retinue on the cliff overlooking the quarry  the sun gleaming off the mask .  a royal visit  on top of everything else        we   re ready  if it please you  o arc of the sky     he said  breaking into a sweat  hoping against hope that     oh gods .  the king was going to put him at his ease again .   he looked imploringly at the high priest  who with the merest twitch of his features indicated that there was nothing he proposed to do about it .  this was too much  he wasn   t the only one to object to this  dil the master embalmer had been subjected to half an hour of having to talk about his family only yesterday  it was wrong  people expected the king to stay in the palace  it was too     the king ambled toward him in a nonchalant way designed to make the master builder feel he was among friends .  oh no  ptaclusp thought  he   s going to remember my name .      i must say you   ve done a tremendous amount in nine weeks  it   s a very good start .  er .  it   s ptaclusp  isn   t it .     said the king .   ptaclusp swallowed .  there was no help for it now .      yes  o hand upon the waters     he said     o fount of           i think    your majesty    or    sire    will do     said teppic .   ptaclusp panicked and glanced fearfully at dios  who winced but nodded again .      the king wishes you to address him       a look of pain crossed his face      informally .  in the fashion of the barba   of foreign lands .         you must consider yourself a very fortunate man to have such talented and hard working sons     said teppic  staring down at the busy panorama of the quarry .      i   will  o   sire     mumbled ptaclusp  interpreting this as an order .  why couldn   t kings order people around like in the old days .  you knew where you were then  they didn   t go around being charming and treating you as some sort of equal  as if you could make the sun rise too .      it must be a fascinating trade     teppic went on .      as your sire wishes  sire     said ptaclusp .     if your majesty would just give the word           and how exactly does all this work .         your sire .     said ptaclusp  horrified .      you make the blocks fly  do you .         yes  o sire .         that is very interesting .  how do you do it .      ptaclusp nearly bit through his lip .  betray craft secrets .  he was horrified .  against all expectation  dios came to his aid .      by means of certain secret signs and sigils  sire     he said     into the origin of which it is not wise to inquire .  it is the wisdom of       he paused       the moderns .         so much quicker than all that heaving stuff around  i expect     said teppic .      it had a certain glory  sire     said dios .     now  if i may suggest    .         oh .  yes .  press on  by all means .      ptaclusp wiped his forehead  and ran to the edge of the quarry .   he waved a cloth .     all things are defined by names .  change the name  and you change the thing .  of course there is a lot more to it than that  but paracosmically that is what it boils down to     ptaclusp iib tapped the stone lightly with his staff .   the air above it wavered in the heat and then  shedding a little dust  the block rose gently until it bobbed a few feet off the ground  held in check by mooring ropes .   that was all there was to it .  teppic had expected some thunder  or at least a gout of flame .  but already the workers were clustering around another block  and a couple of men were towing the first block down toward the site .      very impressive     he said sadly .      indeed  sire     said dios .     and now  we must go back to the palace .  it will soon be time for the ceremony of the third hour .         yes  yes  all right     snapped teppic .     very well done  ptaclusp .  keep up the good work .      ptaclusp bowed like a seesaw in flustered excitement and confusion .      very good  your sire     he said  and decided to go for the big one .     may i show your sire the latest plans .         the king has approved the plans already     said dios .     and  excuse me if i am mistaken  but it seems that the pyramid is well under construction .         yes  yes  but     said ptaclusp     it occurred to us  this avenue here  you see  overlooking the entrance  what a place  we thought  for a statue of for instance hat the vulture headed god of unexpected guests at practically cost        dios glanced at the sketches .      are those supposed to be wings .     he said .      not even cost  not even cost  tell you what i   ll do       said ptaclusp desperately .      is that a nose .     said dios .      more a beak  more a beak     said ptaclusp .     look  o priest  how about           i think not     said dios .     no .  i really think not .     he scanned the quarry for teppic  groaned  thrust the sketches into the builder   s hands and started to run .   teppic had strolled down the path to the waiting chariots  looking wistfully at the bustle around him  and paused to watch a group of workers who were dressing a corner piece .  they froze when they felt his gaze on them  and stood sheepishly watching him .      well  well     said teppic  inspecting the stone  although all he knew about stonemasonry could have been chiseled on a sand grain .     what a splendid piece of rock .      he turned to the nearest man  whose mouth fell open .      you   re a stonemason  are you .     he said .     that must be a very interesting job .      the man   s eyes bulged .  he dropped his chisel .     erk     he said .   a hundred yards away dios   s robes flapped around his legs as he pounded down the path .  he grasped the hem and galloped along  sandals flapping .      what   s your name .     said teppic .     aaaargle     said the man  terrified .      well  jolly good     said teppic  and took his unresisting hand and shook it .      sire .     dios bellowed .     no .      and the mason spun away  holding his right hand by the wrist  fighting it  screaming       teppic gripped the arms of the throne and glared at the high priest .      but it   s a gesture of fellowship  nothing more .  where i come from           where you come from  sire  is here .     thundered dios .      but  good grief  cutting it off .  it   s too cruel .      dios stepped forward .  now his voice was back to its normal oil smooth tones .      cruel  sire .  but it will be done with precision and care  with drugs to take away the pain .  he will certainly live .         but why .         i did explain  sire .  he cannot use the hand again without defiling it .  he is a devout man and knows this very well .  you see  sire  you are a god  sire .         but you can touch me .  so can the servants .         i am a priest  sire     said dios gently .     and the servants have special dispensation .      teppic bit his lip .      this is barbaric     he said .   dios   s features did not move .      it will not be done     teppic said .     i am the king .  i forbid it to be done  do you understand .      dios bowed .  teppic recognized no .      horrified disdain .      your wish will certainly be done  o fountain of all wisdom .  although  of course  the man himself may take matters into  if you will excuse me  his own hands .         what do you mean .     snapped teppic .      sire  if his colleagues had not stopped him he would have done it himself .  with a chisel  i understand .      teppic stared at him and thought  i am a stranger in a familiar land .      i see     he said eventually .   he thought a little further .      then the   operation is to be done with all care  and the man is to be given a pension afterward  d   you see .         as you wish  sire .         a proper one  too .         indeed  sire .  a golden handshake  sire     said dios impassively .      and perhaps we can find him some light job around the palace .         as a one handed stonemason  sire .     dios   s left eyebrow arched a fraction .      as whatever  dios .         certainly  sire .  as you wish .  i will undertake to see if we are currently short handed in any department .      teppic glared at him .     i am the king  you know     he said sharply .      the fact attends me with every waking hour  sire .         dios .     said teppic  as the high priest was leaving .      sire .         i ordered a feather bed from ankh morpork some weeks ago .  i suppose you would not know what became of it .      dios waved his hands in an expressive gesture .      i gather  sire  that there is considerable pirate activity off the khalian coast     he said .      doubtless the pirates are also responsible for the non appearance of the expert from the guild of plumbers and dunnikindivers .      teppic said sourly .      yes  sire .  or possibly bandits  sire .         or perhaps a giant two headed bird swooped down and carried him off     said teppic .      all things are possible  sire     said the high priest  his face radiating politeness .      you may go  dios .         sire .  may i remind you  sire  that the emissaries from tsort and ephebe will be attending you at the fifth hour .         yes .  you may go .      teppic was left alone  or at least as alone as he ever was  which meant that he was all by himself except for two fan wavers  a butler  two enormous howonder guards by the door  and a couple of handmaidens .   oh  yes .  handmaidens .  he hadn   t quite come to terms with the handmaidens yet .  presumably dios chose them  as he seemed to oversee everything in the palace  and he had shown surprisingly good taste in the matter of  for example  olive skins  bosoms and legs .  the clothing these two wore would between them have covered a small saucer .  and this was odd  because the net effect was to turn them into two attractive and mobile pieces of furniture  as sexless as pillars .  teppic sighed with the recollection of women in ankh morpork who could be clothed from neck to ankle in brocade and still cause a classroom full of boys to blush to the roots of their hair .   he reached down for the fruit bowl .  one of the girls immediately grasped his hand  moved it gently aside  and took a grape .      please don   t peel it     said teppic .     the peel   s the best part .  full of nourishing vitamins and minerals .  only i don   t suppose you   ve heard about them  have you  they   ve only been invented recently     he added  mainly to himself .     i mean  within the last seven thousand years     he finished sourly .   so much for time flowing past  he thought glumly .  it might do that everywhere else  but not here .  here it just piles up  like snow .  it   s as though the pyramids slow us down  like those things they used on the boat  whatd   you callem  sea anchors .  tomorrow here is just like yesterday  warmed over .   she peeled the grape anyway  while the snowflake seconds drifted down .     at the site of the great pyramid the huge blocks of stone floated into place like an explosion in reverse .  they were flowing between the quarry and the site  drifting silently across the landscape above deep rectangular shadows .      i   ve got to hand it to you     said ptaclusp to his son  as they stood side by side in the observation tower .     it   s astonishing .  one day people will wonder how we did it .         all that business with the log rollers and the whips is old hat     said iib .     you can throw them away .     the young architect smiled  but there was a manic hint to the rictus .   it was astonishing .  it was more astonishing than it ought to be .  he kept getting the feeling that the pyramid was     he shook himself mentally .  he should be ashamed of that sort of thinking .  you could get superstitious if you weren   t careful  in this job .   it was natural for things to form a pyramid   well  a cone  anyway .  he   d experimented this morning .  grain  salt  sand   not water  though  that   d been a mistake .  but a pyramid was only a neat cone  wasn   t it  a cone which had decided to be a bit tidier .   perhaps he   d overdone it just a gnat on the paracosmic measurements .   his father slapped him on the back .      very well done     he repeated .     you know  it almost looks as though it   s building itself .      iib yelped and bit his wrist  a childish trait that he always resorted to when he was nervous .  ptaclusp didn   t notice  because at that moment one of the foremen was running to the foot of the tower  waving his ceremonial measuring rod .   ptaclusp leaned over .      what .     he demanded .      i said  please to come at once  o master .      on the pyramid itself  on the working surface about halfway up  where some of the detailed work on the inner chambers was in progress  the word    impressive    was no longer appropriate .  the word    terrifying    seemed to fit the bill .   blocks were stacking up in the sky overhead in a giant  slow dance  passing and re passing  their mahouts yelling at one another and at the luckless controllers down on the pyramid top  who were trying to shout instructions above the noise .   ptaclusp waded into the cluster of workers around the center .  here  at least  there was silence .  dead silence .      all right  all right     he said .     what   s going   oh .      ptaclusp iib peered over his father   s shoulder  and stuck his wrist in his mouth .   the thing was wrinkled .  it was ancient .  it clearly had once been a living thing .  it lay on the slab like a very obscene prune .      it was my lunch     said the chief plasterer .     it was my bloody lunch .  i was really looking forward to that apple .         but it can   t start yet     whispered iib .     it can   t form temporal nodes yet  i mean  how does it know it   s going to be a pyramid .         i put my hand down for it  and it felt just like   it felt pretty unpleasant     the plasterer complained .      and it   s a negative node  too     added iib .     we shouldn   t be getting them at all .         is it still there .     said ptaclusp  and added     tell me yes .         if more blocks have been set into position it won   t be     said his son  looking around wildly .     as the center of mass changes  you see  the nodes will be pulled around .      ptaclusp pulled the young man to one side .      what are you telling me now .     he demanded  in a camel whisper      we ought to put a cap on it     mumbled iib .     flare off the trapped time .  wouldn   t be any problems then           how can we cap it .  it isn   t damn well finished     said ptaclusp .     what have you been and gone and done .  pyramids don   t start accumulating until they   re finished .  until they   re pyramids  see .  pyramid energy  see .  named after pyramids .  that   s why it   s called pyramid energy .         it must be something to do with the mass  or something     the architect hazarded     and the speed of construction .  the time is getting trapped in the fabric .  i mean  in theory you could get small nodes during construction  but they   d be so weak you wouldn   t notice  if you went and stood in one may be you   d become a few hours older or younger or       he began to gabble .      i recall when we did kheneth xiv   s tomb the fresco painter said it took him two hours to do the painting in the queen   s room  and we said it was three days and fined him     said ptaclusp  slowly .     there was a lot of guild fuss  i remember .         you just said that     said iib .      said what .         about the fresco painter .  just a moment ago .         no  i didn   t .  you couldn   t have been listening     said ptaclusp .      could have sworn you did .  anyway  this is worse than that business     said his son .     and it   s probably going to happen again .         we can expect more like it .         yes     said iib .     we shouldn   t get negative nodes  but it looks as though we will .  we can expect fast flows and reverse flows and probably even short loops .  i   m afraid we can expect all kinds of temporal anomalies .  we   d better get the men off .         i suppose you couldn   t work out a way we could get them to work in fast time and pay them for slow time .     said ptaclusp .     it   s just a thought .  your brother   s bound to suggest it .         no .  keep everyone off .  we   ll get the blocks in and cap it first .         all right  all right .  i was just thinking out loud .  as if we didn   t have enough problems        ptaclusp waded into the cluster of workers around the center .  here  at least  there was silence .  dead silence .      all right  all right     he said .     what   s going   oh .      ptaclusp iib peered over his father   s shoulder  and stuck his wrist in his mouth .   the thing was wrinkled .  it was ancient .  it clearly had once been a living thing .  it lay on the slab like a very obscene prune .      it was my lunch     said the chief plasterer .     it was my bloody lunch .  i was really looking forward to that apple .      ptaclusp hesitated .  this all seemed very familiar .  he   d had this feeling before .  an overwhelming sensation of reja vu .    he met the horrified gaze of his son .  together  dreading what they might see  they turned around slowly .   they saw themselves standing behind themselves  bickering over something iib was swearing that he had already heard .   he has  too  ptaclusp realized in dread .  that   s me over there .  i look a lot different from the outside .  and it   s me over here  too .  as well .  also .   it   s a loop .  just like in the river  a tiny whirlpool  only it   s in the flow of time .  and i   ve just gone around it twice .   the other ptaclusp looked up at him .   there was a long  agonizing moment of temporal strain  a noise like a mouse blowing bubblegum  and the loop broke  and the figure faded .      i know what   s causing it     muttered iib indistinctly  because of his wrist .     i know the pyramid isn   t complete  but it will be  so the effects are sort of echoing backward  dad  we ought to stop right now  it   s too big  i was wrong           shut up .  can you work out where the nodes will form .     said ptaclusp .     and come away over here  all the lads are staring .  pull yourself together  son .      iib instinctively put his hand to his belt abacus .      well  yes  probably     he said .     it   s just a function of mass distribution and           right     said the builder firmly .     start doing it .  and then get all the foremen to come and see me .      there was a glint like mica in ptaclusp   s eye .  his jaw was squared like a block of granite .  maybe it   s the pyramid that   s got me thinking like this  he said  i   m thinking fast  i know it .      and get your brother up here  too     he added .   it is the pyramid effect .  i   m remembering an idea i   m going to have .   best not to think too hard about that .  be practical .   he stared around at the half completed site .  the gods knew we couldn   t do it in time  he said .  now we don   t have to .  we can take as long as we like .      are you all right .     said iib .     dad  are you all right .         was that one of your time loops .     said ptaclusp dreamily .  what an idea .  no one would ever beat them on a contract ever again  they   d win bonuses for completion and it didn   t matter how long it took .      no .  dad  we ought           but you   re sure you can work out where these loops will occur  are you .         yes  i expect so  but           good .     ptaclusp was trembling with excitement .  maybe they   d have to pay the men more  but it would be worth it  and iia would be bound to think up some sort of scheme  finance was nearly as good as magic .  the lads would have to accept it .  after all  they   d complained about working with free men  they   d complained about working with howondanians  they   d complained about working with everyone except proper paid up guild members .  so they could hardly complain about working with themselves .   iib stepped back  and gripped the abacus for reassurance .      dad     he said cautiously     what are you thinking about .      ptaclusp beamed at him .     doppelgangs     he said .     politics was more interesting .  teppic felt that here  at least  he could make a contribution .   djelibeybi was old .  it was respected .  but it was also small and in the sword edged sense  which was what seemed to matter these days  had no power .  it wasn   t always thus  as dios told it .  once it had ruled the world by sheer force of nobility  hardly needing the standing army of twenty five thousand men it had in those high days .   now it wielded a more subtle power as a narrow state between the huge and thrusting empires of tsort and ephebe  each one both a threat and a shield .  for more than a thousand years the kings along the djel had  with extreme diplomacy  exquisite manners and the footwork of a centipede on adrenaline  kept the peace along the whole widdershins side of the continent .  merely having existed for seven thousand years can be a formidable weapon  if you use it properly .      you mean we   re neutral ground .     said teppic .      tsort is a desert culture like us     said dios  steepling his hands .     we have helped to shape it over the years .  as for ephebe       he sniffed .     they have some very strange beliefs .         how do you mean .         they believe the world is run by geometry  sire .  all lines and angles and numbers .  that sort of thing  sire       dios frowned      can lead to some very unsound ideas .         ah     said teppic  resolving to learn more about unsound ideas as soon as possible .     so we   re secretly on the side of tsort  yes .         no .  it is important that ephebe remains strong .         but we   ve more in common with tsort .         so we allow them to believe  sire .         but they are a desert culture .      dios smiled .     i am afraid they don   t take pyramids seriously  sire .      teppic considered all this .      so whose side are we really on .         our own  sire .  there is always a way .  always remember  sire  that your family was on its third dynasty before our neighbors had worked out  sire  how babies are made .      the tsort delegation did indeed appear to have studied djeli culture assiduously  almost frantically .  it was also clear that they hadn   t begun to understand it  they   d merely borrowed as many bits as seemed useful and then put them together in subtly wrong ways .  for example  to a man they employed the three turning walk  as portrayed on friezes  and only used by the djeli court on certain occasions .  occasional grimaces crossed their faces as their vertebrae protested .   they were also wearing the khruspids of morning and the bangles of going forth  as well as the kilt of yet with  and no wonder even the maidens on fan duty were hiding their smiles  matching greaves .    even teppic had to cough hurriedly .  but then  he thought  they don   t know any better .  they   re like children .   and this thought was followed by another one which added  these children could wipe us off the map in one hour .   hot on the synapses of the other two came a third thought  which said  it   s only clothes  for goodness sake  you   re beginning to take it all seriously .   the group from ephebe were more sensibly dressed in white togas .  they had a certain sameness about them  as if somewhere in the country there was a little press that stamped out small bald men with curly white beards .   the two parties halted before the throne  and bowed .      hallo     said teppic .      his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the flail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king  bids you welcome and commands you to take wine with him     said dios  clapping his hands for a butler .      oh yes     said teppic .     do sit down  won   t you .         his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord

the never dying king  commands you to be seated     said dios .   teppic racked his brains for a suitable speech .  he   d heard plenty in ankh morpork .  they were probably the same the whole world over .      i   m sure we shall get on           his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the hail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king  bids you harken .     dios boomed .         long history of friendship           harken to the wisdom of his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the hail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king .      the echoes died away .      could i have a word with you a moment  dios .      the high priest leaned down .      is all this necessary .     hissed teppic .   dios   s aquiline features took on the wooden expression of one who is wrestling with an unfamiliar concept .      of course  sire .  it is traditional     he said  at last .      i thought i was supposed to talk to these people .  you know  about boundaries and trade and so on .  i   ve been doing a lot of thinking about it and i   ve got several ideas .  i mean  it   s going to be a little difficult if you   re going to keep shouting .      dios gave him a polite smile .      oh no  sire .  that has all been sorted out  sire .  i met with them this morning .         what am i supposed to do  then .      dios made a slight circling motion with one hand .      just as you wish  sire .  it is normal to smile a little  and put them at their ease .         is that all .         sire could ask them whether they enjoy being diplomats  sire     said dios .  he met teppic   s glare with eyes as expressionless as mirrors .      i am the king     teppic hissed .      certainly  sire .  it would not do to sully the office with mere matters of leaden state  sire .  tomorrow  sire  you will be holding supreme court .  a very fit office for a monarch  sire .         ah .  yes .        it was quite complicated .  teppic listened carefully to the case  which was alleged cattle theft compounded by djeli   s onion layered land laws .  this is what it should be all about  he thought .  no one else can work out who owns the bloody ox  this is the sort of thing kings have to do .  now  let   s see  five years ago  he sold the ox to him  but as it turned out     he looked from the face of one worried farmer to the other .  they were both clutching their ragged straw hats close to their chests  and both of them wore the paralyzed wooden expressions of simple men who  in pursuit of their parochial disagreement  now found themselves on a marble floor in a great room with their god enthroned before their very eyes .  teppic didn   t doubt that either one would cheerfully give up all rights to the wretched creature in exchange for being ten miles away .   it   s a fairly mature ox  he thought  time it was slaughtered  even if it   s his it   s been fattening on his neighbor   s land all these years  half each would be about right  they   re really going to remember this judgment     he raised the sickle of justice .      his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the flail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king  will give judgment .  cower to the justice of his greatness the king tep        teppic cut dios off in mid intone .      having listened to both sides of the case     he said firmly  the mask giving it a slight boom     and  being impressed by the argument and counterargument  it seems to us only just that the beast in question should be slaughtered without delay and shared with all fairness between both plaintiff and defendant .      he sat back .  they   ll call me teppic the wise  he thought .  the common people go for this sort of thing .   the farmers gave him a long blank stare .  then  as if they were both mounted on turntables  they turned and looked to where dios was sitting in his place on the steps in a group of lesser priests .   dios stood up  smoothed his plain robe  and extended the staff .      harken to the interpreted wisdom of his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the flail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king     he said .     it is our divine judgment that the beast in dispute is the property of rhumusphut .  it is our divine judgment that the beast be sacrificed upon the altar of the concourse of gods in thanks for the attention of our divine self .  it is our further judgment that both rhumusphut and ktoffle work a further three days in the fields of the king in payment for this judgment .      dios raised his head until he was looking along his fearsome nose right into teppic   s mask .  he raised both hands .      mighty is the wisdom of his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the flail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king .      the farmers bobbed in terrified gratitude and backed out of the presence  framed between the guards .      dios     said teppic  levelly .      sire .         just attend upon me a moment  please .        sire .     repeated dios  materializing by the throne .      i could not help noticing  dios  excuse me if i am wrong  a certain flourish in the translation there .      the priest looked surprised .      indeed no  sire .  i was most precise in relaying your decision  saving only to refine the detail in accordance with precedent and tradition .         how was that .  the damn creature really belonged to both of them .         but rhumusphut is known to be punctilious in his devotions  sire  seeking every opportunity to laud and magnify the gods  whereas ktoffle has been known to harbor foolish thoughts .         what   s that got to do with justice .         everything  sire     said dios smoothly .      but now neither of them has the ox .         quite so  sire .  but ktoffle does not have it because he does not deserve it  while rhumusphut  by his sacrifice  has ensured himself greater stature in the netherworld .         and you   ll eat beef tonight  i suppose     said teppic .   it was like a blow  teppic might as well have picked up the throne and hit the priest with it .  dios took a step backward  aghast  his eyes two brief pools of pain .  when he spoke  there was a raw edge to his voice .      i do not eat meat  sire     he said .     it dilutes and tarnishes the soul .  may i summon the next ease  sire .      teppic nodded .     very well .      the next case was a dispute over the rent of a hundred square yards of riverside land .  teppic listened carefully .  good growing land was at a premium in djeli  since the pyramids took up so much of it .  it was a serious matter .   it was especially serious because the land   s tenant was by all accounts hard working and conscientious  while its actual owner was clearly rich and objectionable .   unfortunately  however one chose to stack the facts  he was also in the right .   teppic thought deeply  and then squinted at dios .  the priest nodded at him .      it seems to me       said teppic  as fast as possible but not fast enough .      harken to the judgment of his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the flail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king .         it seems to me   to us     teppic repeated     that  taking all matters in consideration beyond those of mere mortal artifice  the true and just outcome in this matter       he paused .  this  he thought  isn   t how a good king speaks .      the landlord has been weighed in the balance and found wanting     he boomed through the mask   s mouth slit .     we find for the tenant .      as one man the court turned to dios  who held a whispered consultation with the other priests and then stood up .      hear now the interpreted word of his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the flail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king .  ptorne the farmer will at once pay    toons in back rent to prince imtebos .  prince imtebos will at once pay    toons into the temple offerings of the gods of the river .  long live the king .  bring on the next case .      teppic beckoned to dios again .      is there any point in me being here .     he demanded in an overheated whisper .      please be calm  sire .  if you were not here  how would the people know that justice had been done .         but you twist everything i say .         no  sire .  sire  you give the judgment of the man .  i interpret the judgment of the king .         i see     said teppic grimly .     well  from now on        there was a commotion outside the hall .  clearly there was a prisoner outside who was less than confident in the king   s justice  and the king didn   t blame him .  he wasn   t at all happy about it  either .   it turned out to be a dark haired girl  struggling in the arms of two guards and giving them the kind of blows with fist and heel that a man would blush to give .  she wasn   t wearing the right kind of costume for the job  either .  it would be barely adequate for lying around peeling grapes in .   she saw teppic and  to his secret delight  flashed him a glance of pure hatred .  after an afternoon of being treated like a mentally deficient statue it was a pleasure to find someone prepared to take an interest in him .   he didn   t know what she had done  but judging by the thumps she was landing on the guards  it was a pretty good bet that she had done it to the very limits of her ability .   dios bent down to the level of the mask   s ear holes .      her name is ptraci     he said .     a handmaiden of your father .  she has refused to take the potion .         what potion .     said teppic .      it is customary for a dead king to take servants with him into the netherworld  sire .      teppic nodded gloomily .  it was a jealously guarded privilege  the only way a penniless servant could ensure immortality .  he remembered grandfather   s funeral  and the discreet clamor of the old man   s personal servants .  it had made father depressed for days .      yes  but it   s not compulsory     he said .      yes  sire .  it is not compulsory .         father had plenty of servants .         i gather she was his favorite  sire .         what exactly has she done wrong  then .      dios sighed  as one might if one were explaining things to an extremely backward child .      she has refused to take the potion  sire .         sorry .  i thought you said it wasn   t compulsory  dios .         yes  sire .  it is not  sire .  it is entirely voluntary .  it is an act of free will .  and she has refused it  sire .         ah .  one of those situations     said teppic .  djelibeybi was built on those sort of situations .  trying to understand them could drive you mad .  if one of his ancestors had decreed that night was day  people would go around groping in the light .   he leaned forward .      step forward  young lady     he said .   she looked at dios .      his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii           do we have to go all through that every time .         yes  sire   lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the flail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king  bids you declare your guilt .      the girl shook herself out of the guards    grip and faced teppic  trembling with terror .      he told me he didn   t want to be buried in a pyramid     she said .     he said the idea of those millions of tons of rock on top of him gave him nightmares .  i don   t want to die yet .         you refuse to gladly take the poison .     said dios .      yes .         but  child     said dios     then the king will have you put to death anyway .  surely it is better to go honorably  to a worthy life in the netherworld .         i don   t want to be a servant in the netherworld .      there was a groan of horror from the assembled priests .  dios nodded .      then the eater of souls will take you     he said .     sire  we look to your judgment .      teppic realized he was staring at the girl .  there was something hauntingly familiar about her which he couldn   t quite put his finger on .     let her go     he said .      his greatness the king teppicymon xxviii  lord of the heavens  charioteer of the wagon of the sun  steersman of the barque of the sun  guardian of the secret knowledge  lord of the horizon  keeper of the way  the flail of mercy  the high born one  the never dying king  has spoken .  tomorrow at dawn you will be cast to the crocodiles of the river .  great is the wisdom of the king .      ptraci turned and glared at teppic .  he said nothing .  he did not dare  for fear of what it might become .   she went away quietly  which was worse than sobbing or shouting .      that is the last case  sire     said dios .      i will retire to my quarters     said teppic coldly .     i have much to think about .         therefore i will have dinner sent in     said the priest .     it will be roast chicken .         i hate chicken .      dios smiled .     no  sire .  on wednesdays the king always enjoys chicken  sire .        the pyramids flared .  the light they cast on the landscape was curiously subdued  grainy  almost gray  but over the capstone of each tomb a zigzag flame crackled toward the sky .   a faint click of metal and stone sprang ptraci from a fitful doze into extreme wakefulness .  she stood up very carefully and crept toward the window .   unlike proper cell windows  which should be large and airy and requiring only the removal of a few inconvenient iron bars to ensure the escape of any captives  this window was a slit six inches wide .  seven thousand years had taught the kings along the djel that cells should be designed to keep prisoners in .  the only way they could get out through this slit was in bits .   but there was a shadow against the pyramid light  and a voice said     psst .      she flattened herself against the wall and tried to reach up to the slit .      who are you .         i   m here to help you .  oh damn .  do they call this a window .  look  i   m lowering a rope .      a thick silken cord  knotted at intervals  dropped past her shoulder .  she stared at it for a second or two  and then kicked off her curly toed shoes and climbed up it .   the face on the other side of the slit was half concealed by a black hood  but she could just make out a worried expression .      don   t despair     it said .      i wasn   t despairing .  i was trying to get some sleep .         oh .  pardon me  i   m sure .  i   ll just go away and leave you  shall i .         but in the morning i shall wake up and then i   ll despair .  what are you standing on  demon .         do you know what a crampon is .         no .         well  it   s two of them .      they stared at each other in silence .      ok     said the face at last .     i   ll have to go around and come in through the door .  don   t go away .     and with that it vanished upward .   ptraci let herself slide back down to the chilly stones of the floor .  come in through the door .  she wondered how it could manage that .  humans would need to open it first .   she crouched in the furthest corner of the cell  staring at the small rectangle of wood .   long minutes went past .  at one point she thought she heard a tiny noise  like a gasp .   a little later there was subtle clink of metal  so slight as to be almost beyond the range of hearing .   more time wound onto the spool of eternity and then the silence beyond the cell  which had been the silence caused by absence of sound  very slowly became the silence caused by someone making no noise .   she thought  it   s right outside the door .   there was a pause in which teppic oiled all the bolts and hinges so that  when he made the final assault  the door swished open in heart gripping noiselessness .      i say .     said a voice in the darkness .   ptraci pressed herself still further into the corner .      look  i   ve come to rescue you .      now she could make out a blacker shadow in the flarelight .  it stepped forward with rather more uncertainty than she would have expected from a demon .      are you coming or not .     it said .     i   ve only knocked out the guards  it   s not their fault  but we haven   t got a lot of time .         i   m to be thrown to the crocodiles in the morning     whispered ptraci .     the king himself decreed it .         he probably made a mistake .      ptraci   s eyes widened in horrified disbelief .      the soul eater will take me .     she said .      do you want it to .      ptraci hesitated .      well  then     said the figure  and took her unresisting hand .  he led her out of the cell  where she nearly tripped over the prone body of a guard .      who is in the other cells .     he said  pointing to the line of doors along the passage .      i don   t know     said ptraci .      let   s find out  shall we .      the figure touched a can to the bolts and hinges of the next door and pushed it open .  the flare from the narrow window illuminated a middle aged man  seated cross legged on the floor .      i   m here to rescue you     said the demon .   the man peered up at him .      rescue .     he said .      yes .  why are you here .      the man hung his head .     i spoke blasphemy against the king .         how did you do that .         i dropped a rock on my foot .  now my tongue is to be torn out .      the dark figure nodded sympathetically .      a priest heard you  did he .     he said .      no .  i told a priest .  such words should not go unpunished     said the man virtuously .   we   re really good at it  teppic thought .  mere animals couldn   t possibly manage to act like this .  you need to be a human being to be really stupid .     i think we ought to talk about this outside     he said .     why not come with me .      the man pulled back and glared at him .      you want me to run away .     he said .      seems a good idea  wouldn   t you say .      the man stared into his eyes  his lips moving silently .  then he appeared to reach a decision      guards .     he screamed .   the shout echoed through the sleeping palace .  his would be rescuer stared at him in disbelief .      mad     teppic said .     you   re all mad .      he stepped out of the room  grabbed ptraci   s hand  and hurried along the shadowy passages .  behind them the prisoner made the most of his tongue while he still had it and used it to scream a stream of imprecations .      where are you taking me .     said ptraci  as they marched smartly around a corner and into a pillar barred courtyard .   teppic hesitated .  he hadn   t thought much beyond this point .      why do they bother to bolt the doors .     he demanded  eyeing the pillars .     that   s what i want to know .  i   m surprised you didn   t wander back to your cell while i was in there .         i   i don   t want to die     she said quietly .      don   t blame you .         you mustn   t say that .  it   s wrong not to want to die .      teppic glanced up at the roof around the courtyard and unslung his grapnel .      i think i ought to go back to my cell     said ptraci  without actually making any move in that direction .     it   s wrong even to think of disobeying the king .         oh .  what happens to you  then .         something bad     she said vaguely .      you mean  worse than being thrown to the crocodiles or having your soul taken by the soul eater .     said teppic  and caught the grapnel firmly on some hidden ledge on the flat roof .      that   s an interesting point     said ptraci  winning the teppic award for clear thinking .      worth considering  isn   t it .     teppic tested his weight on the cord .      what you   re saying is  if the worst is going to happen to you anyway  you might as well not bother anymore     said ptraci .     if the soul eater is going to get you whatever you do  you might as well avoid the crocodiles  is that it .         you go up first     said teppic     i think someone   s coming .         who are you .      teppic fished in his pouch .  he   d come back to djeli an eon ago with just the clothes he stood up in  but they were the clothes he   d stood up in throughout his exam .  he balanced a number two throwing knife in his hand  the steel glinting in the flarelight .  it was possibly the only steel in the country  it wasn   t that djelibeybi hadn   t heard about iron  it was just that if copper was good enough for your great great great great grandfather  it was good enough for you .   no  the guards didn   t deserve knives .  they hadn   t done anything wrong .   his hand closed over the little mesh bag of caltraps .  these were a small model  a mere one inch per spike .  caltraps didn   t kill anyone  they just slowed them down a bit .  one or two of them in the sole of the foot induced extreme slowness and caution in all except the terminally enthusiastic .   he scattered a few across the mouth of the passage and ran back to the rope  hauling himself up in a few quick swings .  he reached the roof just as the leading guards ran under the lintel .  he waited until he heard the first curse  and then coiled up the rope and hurried after the girl .      they   ll catch us     she said .      i don   t think so .         and then the king will have us thrown to the crocodiles .         oh no  i don   t think       teppic paused .  it was an intriguing idea .      he might     he ventured .     it   s very hard to be sure about anything .         so what shall we do now .      teppic stared across the river  where the pyramids were ablaze .  the great pyramid was still under construction  by flarelight  a swarm of blocks  dwarfed by distance  hovered near its tip .  the amount of labor ptaclusp was putting on the job was amazing .   what a flare that will give  he thought .  it   ll be seen all the way to ankh .      horrible things  aren   t they     said ptraci  behind him .      do you think so .         they   re creepy .  the old king hated them  you know .  he said they nailed the kingdom to the past .         did he say why .         no .  he just hated them .  he was a nice old boy .  very kind .  not like this new one .     she blew her nose and replaced her handkerchief in its scarcely adequate space in her sequined bra .      er  what exactly did you have to do .  as a handmaiden  i mean .     said teppic  scanning the rooftop panorama to hide his embarrassment .   she giggled .     you   re not from around here  are you .         no .  not really .         talk to him  mainly .  or just listen .  he could really talk  but he always said no one ever really listened to what he said .         yes     said teppic  with feeling .     and that was all  was it .      she stared at him  and then giggled again .     oh  that .  no  he was very kind .  i wouldn   t of minded  you understand  i had all the proper training .  bit of a disappointment  really .  the women of my family have served under the kings for centuries  you know .         oh yes .     he managed .      i don   t know whether you   ve ever seen a book  it   s called the shuttered              palace     said teppic automatically .      i thought a gentleman like you   d know about it     said ptraci  nudging him .     it   s a sort of textbook .  well  my great great grandmother posed for a lot of the pictures .  not recently     she added  in case he hadn   t fully understood     i mean  that would be a bit off putting  she   s been dead for twenty five years .  when she was younger .  i look u lot like her  everyone says .         urk     agreed teppic .      she was famous .  she could put her feet behind her head  you know .  so can i .  i   ve got my grade three .         urk .         the old king told me once that the gods gave people a sense of humor to make up for giving them sex .  i think he was a bit upset at the time .         urk .     only the whites of teppic   s eyes were showing .      you don   t say much  do you .      the breeze of the night was blowing her perfume toward him .  ptraci used scent like a battering ram .      we   ve got to find somewhere to hide you     he said  concentrating on each word .     haven   t you got any parents or anything .     he tried to ignore the fact that in the shadowless flarelight she appeared to glow  and didn   t have much success .      well  my mother still works in the palace somewhere     said ptraci .     but i don   t think she   d be very sympathetic .         we   ve got to get you away from here     said teppic fervently .     if you can hide somewhere today  i can steal some horses or a boat or something .  then you could go to tsort or ephebe or somewhere .         foreign  you mean .  i don   t think i   d like that     said ptraci .      compared to the netherworld .         well .  put like that  of course       she took his arm .     why did you rescue me .         er .  because being alive is better than being dead  i think .         i   ve read up to number     congress of the five auspicious ants     said ptraci .     if you   ve got some yogurt  we could           no .  i mean  no .  not here .  not now .  there must be people looking for us  it   s nearly dawn .         there   s no need to yelp like that .  i was just trying to be kind .         yes .  good .  thank you .     teppic broke away and peered desperately over a parapet into one of the palace   s numerous light wells .      this leads to the embalmers    workshops     he said .     there must be plenty of places to hide down here .     he unwound the cord again .   various rooms led off the well .  teppic found one lined with benches and floored with wood shavings  a doorway led through to another room stacked with mummy cases  each one surmounted by the same golden dolly face he   d come to know and loathe .  he tapped on a few  and raised the lid of the nearest .      no one at home     he said .     you can have a nice rest in here .  i can leave the lid open a bit so you can get some air .         you can   t think i   d risk that .  supposing you didn   t come back .         i   ll be back tonight     said teppic .     and   and i   ll see if i can drop some food and water in some time today .      she stood on tiptoe  her ankle bangles jingling all the way down teppic   s libido .  he glanced down involuntarily and saw that every toenail was painted .  he remembered cheesewright telling them behind the stables one lunch hour that girls who painted their toenails were   well  he couldn   t quite remember now  but it had seemed pretty unbelievable at the time .      it looks very hard     she said .      what .         if i   ve got to lie in it  it   ll need some cushions .         i   ll put some wood shavings in  look .     said teppic .     but hurry up .  please .         all right .  but you will be back  won   t you .  promise .         yes  yes .  i promise .      he wedged a splinter of wood on the case to allow an airhole  heaved the lid back on and ran for it .   the ghost of the king watched him go .     the sun rose .  as the golden light spilled down the fertile valley of the djel the pyramid flares paled and became ghost dancers against the lightening sky .  they were now accompanied by a noise .  it had been there all the time  far too high pitched for mortal ears  a sound now dropping down from the far ultrasonic     kkkkkkkkkhhheeee     it screamed out of the sky  a thin rind of sound like a violin bow dragged across the raw surface of the brain .   kkkhheeeeeee     or a wet fingernail dragged over an exposed nerve  some said .  you could set your watch by it  they would have said  if anyone knew what one was .      keeee     it went deeper and deeper as the sunlight washed over the stones  passing through cat scream to dog growl .      ee   ee   ee     the flares collapsed .      ops .        a fine morning  sire .  i trust you slept well .      teppic waved a hand at dios  but said nothing .  the barber was working through the ceremony of going forth shaven .   the barber was trembling .  until recently he had been a one handed  unemployed stonemason .  then the terrible high priest had summoned him and ordered him to be the king   s barber  but it meant you had to touch the king but it was all right because it was all sorted out by the priests and nothing more had to be chopped off .  on the whole  it was better than he had thought  and a great honor to be single handedly responsible for the king   s beard  such as it was .      you were not disturbed in any way .     said the high priest .  his eyes scanned the room on a raster of suspicion  it was surprising that little lines of molten rock didn   t drip off the walls .      verrr           if you would but hold still  o never dying one     said the barber  in the pleading tone of voice employed by one who is assured of a guided tour of a crocodile   s alimentary tract if he nicks an ear .      you heard no strange noises  sire .     said dios .  he stepped back suddenly so that he could see behind the gilded peacock screen at the other end of the room .      norr .         your majesty looks a little peaky this morning  sire     said dios .  he sat down on the bench with the carved cheetahs on either end .  sitting down in the presence of the king  except on ceremonial occasions  was not something that was allowed .  it did  however  mean that he could squint under teppic   s low bed .   dios was rattled .  despite the aches and the lack of sleep  teppic felt oddly elated .  he wiped his chin .      it   s the bed     he said .     i think i have mentioned it .  mattresses  you know .  they have feathers in them .  if the concept is unfamiliar  ask the pirates of khali .  half of them must be sleeping on goose feather mattresses by now .         his majesty is pleased to joke     said dios .   teppic knew he shouldn   t push it any further  but he did so anyway .      something wrong  dios .     he said .      a miscreant broke into the palace last night .  the girl ptraci is missing .         that is very disturbing .         yes  sire .         probably a suitor or a swain or something .      dios   s face was like stone .     possibly  sire .         the sacred crocodiles will be going hungry  then .     but not for long  teppic thought .  walk to the end of any of the little jetties down by the bank  let your shadow fall on the river  and the mud yellow water would become  by magic  mud yellow bodies .  they looked like large  sodden logs  the main difference being that logs don   t open at one end and bite your legs off .  the sacred crocodiles of the djel were the kingdom   s garbage disposal  river patrol and occasional morgue .   they couldn   t simply be called big .  if one of the huge bulls ever drifted sideways onto the current  he   d dam the river .   the barber tiptoed out .  a couple of body servants tiptoed in .      i anticipated your majesty   s natural reaction  sire     dios continued  like the drip of water in deep limestone caverns .      jolly good     said teppic  inspecting the clothes for the day .     what was it  exactly .         a detailed search of the palace  room by room .         absolutely .  carry on  dios .      my face is perfectly open  he told himself .  i haven   t twitched a muscle out of place .  i know i haven   t .  he can read me like a stele .  i can outstare him .      thank you  sire .         i imagine they   ll be miles away by now     said teppic .     whoever they were .  she was only a handmaiden  wasn   t she .         it is unthinkable that anyone could disobey your judgments .  there is no one in the kingdom that would dare to .  their souls would be forfeit .  they will be hunted down  sire .  hunted down and destroyed .      the servants cowered behind teppic .  this wasn   t mere anger .  this was wrath .  real  old time  vintage wrath .  and waxing .  it waxed like a hatful of moons .      are you feeling all right  dios .      dios had turned to look out across the river .  the great pyramid was almost complete .  the sight of it seemed to calm him down or  at least  stabilize him on some new mental plateau .      yes  sire     he said .     thank you .     he breathed deeply .     tomorrow  sire  you are pleased to witness the capping of the pyramid .  a momentous occasion .  of course  it will be some time before the interior chambers are completed .         fine .  fine .  and this morning  i think  i should like to visit my father .         i am sure the late king will be pleased to see you  sire .  it is your wish that i should accompany you .         oh .        it   s a fact as immutable as the third law of sod that there is no such thing as a good grand vizier .  a predilection to cackle and plot is apparently part of the job spec .   high priests tend to get put in the same category .  they have to face the implied assumption that no sooner do they get the funny hat than they   re issuing strange orders  e . g .   princesses tied to rocks for itinerant sea monsters and throwing little babies in the sea .   this is a gross slander .  throughout the history of the disc most high priests have been serious  pious and conscientious men who have done their best to interpret the wishes of the gods  sometimes disembowelling or flaying alive hundreds of people in a day in order to make sure they   re getting it absolutely right .     king teppicymon xxvii   s casket lay in state .  crafted it was of foryphy  smaradgine  skelsa and delphinet  inlaid it was with pink jade and shode  perfumed and fumed it was with many rare resins and perfumes     it looked very impressive but  the king considered  it wasn   t worth dying for .  he gave up and wandered across the courtyard .   a new player had entered the drama of his death .   grinjer  the maker of models .   he   d always wondered about the models .  even a humble farmer expected to be buried with a selection of crafted livestock  which would somehow become real in the netherworld .  many a man made do with one cow like a toast rack in this world in order to afford a pedigree herd in the next .  nobles and kings got the complete set  including model carts  houses  boats and anything else too big or inconvenient to fit in the tomb .  once on the other side  they   d somehow become the genuine article .   the king frowned .  when he was alive he   d known that it was true .  not doubted it for a moment     grinjer stuck his tongue out of the corner of his mouth as  with great care  he tweezered a tiny oar to a perfect l   th scale river trireme .  every flat surface in his corner of the workshop was stacked with midget animals and artifacts  some of his more impressive ones hung from wires on the ceiling .   the king had already ascertained from overheard conversation that grinjer was twenty six  couldn   t find anything to stop the inexorable advance of his acne  and lived at home with his mother .  where  in the evenings  he made models .  deep in the duffel coat of his mind he hoped one day to find a nice girl who would understand the absolute importance of getting every detail right on a ceremonial six wheeled ox cart  and who would hold his glue pot  and always be ready with a willing thumb whenever anything needed firm pressure until the paste dried .   he was aware of trumpets and general excitement behind him .  he ignored it .  there always seemed to be a lot of fuss these days .  in his experience it was always about trivial things .  people just didn   t have their priorities right .  he   d been waiting two months for a few ounces of gum varneti  and it didn   t seem to bother anyone .  he screwed his eyeglass into a more comfortable position and slotted a minute steering oar into place .   someone was standing next to him .  well  they could make themselves useful        could you just put your finger here     he said  without glancing around .     just for a minute  until the glue sets .      there seemed to be a sudden drop in temperature .  he looked up into a smiling golden mask .  over its shoulder dios   s face was shading  in grinjer   s expert opinion  from no .      pale flesh  to no .      sunset purple  gloss  .      oh     he said .      it   s very good     said teppic .     what is it .     grinjer blinked at him .  then he blinked at the boat .      it   s an eighty foot khali fashion river trireme with fishtail spear deck and ramming prow     he said automatically .   he got the impression that more was expected of him .  he cast around for something suitable .      it   s got more than five hundred bits     he added .     every plank on the deck is individually cut  look .         fascinating     said teppic .     well  i won   t hold you up .  carry on the good work .         the sail really unfurls     said grinjer .     see  if you pull this thread  the        the mask had moved .  dios was there instead .  he gave grinjer a short glare which indicated that more would be heard about this later on  and hurried after the king .  so did the ghost of teppicymon xxvii .   teppic   s eyes swiveled behind the mask .  there was the open doorway into the room of caskets .  he could just make out the one containing ptraci  the wedge of wood was still under the lid .      our father  however  is over here .  sire     said dios .  he could move as silently as a ghost .      oh .  yes .     teppic hesitated and then crossed to the big case on its trestles .  he stared down at it for some time .  the gilded face on the lid looked like every other mask .      a very good likeness  sire     prompted dios .      ye ess     said teppic .     i suppose so .  he definitely looks happier .  i suppose .         hallo  my boy     said the king .  he knew that no one could hear him  but he felt happier talking to them all the same .  it was better than talking to himself .  he was going to have more than enough time for that .      i think it brings out the best in him  o commander of the heavens     said the head sculptor .      makes me look like a constipated wax dolly .      teppic cocked his head on one side .      yes     he said  uncertainly .     yes .  er .  well done .      he half turned to look through the doorway again .   dios nodded to the guards on either side of the passageway .      if you will excuse me  sire     he said urbanely .      hmm .         the guards will continue their search .         right .  oh        dios bore down on ptraci   s casket  flanked by guards .  he gripped the lid  thrust it backward  and said     behold .  what do we find .      dil and gern joined him .  they looked inside .      wood shavings     said dil .   gern sniffed .     they smell nice  though     he said .   dios   s fingers drummed on the lid .  teppic had never seen him at a loss before .  the man actually started tapping the sides of the case  apparently seeking any hidden panels .   he closed the lid carefully and looked blankly at teppic  who for the first time was very glad that the mask didn   t reveal his expression .      she   s not in there     said the old king .     she got out for a call of nature when the men went to have their breakfast .      she must have climbed out  teppic told himself .  so where is she now .   dios scanned the room carefully and then  after swinging slowly backward and forward like a compass needle  his eyes fixed on the king   s mummy case .  it was big .  it was roomy .  there was a certain inevitability about it .   he crossed the room in a couple of strides and heaved it open .      don   t bother to knock     the king grumbled .     it   s not as if i   m going anywhere .      teppic risked a look .  the mummy of the king was quite alone .      are you sure you   re feeling all right  dios .     he said .      yes  sire .  we cannot be too careful  sire .  clearly they are not here  sire .         you look as if you could do with a breath of fresh air     said teppic  upbraiding himself for doing this but doing it  nevertheless .  dios at a loss was an awe inspiring sight  and slightly disconcerting  it made one instinctively fear for the stability of things .      yes  sire .  thank you  sire .         have a sit down and someone will bring you a glass of water .  and then we will go and inspect the pyramid .      dios sat down .   there was a terrible little splintering noise .      he   s sat on the boat     said the king .     first humorous thing i   ve ever seen him do .        the pyramid gave a new meaning to the word    massive .     it bent the landscape around it .  it seemed to teppic that its very weight was deforming the shape of things  stretching the kingdom like a lead ball on a rubber sheet .   he knew that was a ridiculous idea .  big though the pyramid was  it was tiny compared to  say  a mountain .   but big  very big  compared to anything else .  anyway  mountains were meant to be big  the fabric of the universe was used to the idea .  the pyramid was a made thing  and much bigger than a made thing ought to be .   it was also very cold .  the black marble of its sides was shining white with frost in the roasting afternoon sun .  he was foolish enough to touch it and left a layer of skin on the surface .      it   s freezing .         it   s storing already  o breath of the river     said ptaclusp  who was sweating .     it   s the wossname  the boundary effect .         i note that you have ceased work on the burial chambers     said dios .      the men   the temperature   boundary effects   a bit too much to risk       muttered ptaclusp .     er .      teppic looked from one to the other .      what   s the matter .     he said .     are there problems .         er     said ptaclusp .      you   re way ahead of schedule .  marvelous work     said teppic .     you   ve put a tremendous amount of labor on the job .         er .  yes .  only .      there was silence except for the distant sounds of men at work  and the faint noise of the air sizzling where it touched the pyramid .      it   s bound to be all right when we get the capstone on     the pyramid builder managed eventually .     once it   s flaring properly  no problem .  er .      he indicated the electrum capstone .  it was surprisingly small  only a foot or so across  and rested on a couple of trestles .      we should be able to put it on tomorrow     said ptaclusp .     would your sire still be honoring us with the capping out ceremony .     in his nervousness he gripped the hem of his robe and began to twist it .     there   s drinks     he stuttered .     and a silver trowel that you can take away with you .  everyone shouts hurrah and throws their hats in the air .         certainly     said dios .     it will be an honor .         and for us too  your sire     said ptaclusp loyally .      i meant for you     said the high priest .  he turned to the wide courtyard between the base of the pyramid and the river  which was lined with statues and stelae commemorating king teppicymon   s mighty deeds   and pointed .      and you can get rid of that     he added .   ptaclusp gave him a look of unhappy innocence .      that statue     said dios     is what i am referring to .         oh .  ah .  well  we thought once you saw it in place  you see  in the right light  and what with hat the vulture headed god being very           it goes     said dios .      right you are  your reverence     said ptaclusp miserably .  it was  right now  the least of his problems  but on top of everything else he was beginning to think that the statue was following him around .   dios leaned closer .      you haven   t seen a young woman anywhere on the site  have you .     he demanded .      no women on the site  my lord     said ptaclusp .     very bad luck .         this one was provocatively dressed     the high priest said .      no  no women .         the palace is not far  you see .  there must be many places to hide over here     dios continued  insistently .   ptaclusp swallowed .  he knew that  all right .  whatever had possessed him        i assure you  your reverence     he said .   dios gave him a scowl  and then turned to where teppic  as it turned out  had been .      please ask him not to shake hands with anybody     said the builder  as dios hurried after the distant glint of sunlight on gold .  the king still didn   t seem to be able to get alongside the idea that the last thing the people wanted was a man of the people .  those workers who couldn   t get out of the way in time were thrusting their hands behind their back .   alone now  ptaclusp fanned himself and staggered into the shade of his tent .   where  waiting to see him  were ptaclusp iia  ptaclusp iia  ptaclusp iia and ptaclusp iia .  ptaclusp always felt uneasy in the presence of accountants  and four of them together was very bad  especially when they were all the same person .  three ptaclusp iibs were there as well  the other two  unless it was three by now  were out on the site .   he waved his hands in a conciliatory way .      all right  all right     he said .     what are today   s problems .      one of the iias pulled a stack of wax tablets toward him .      have you any idea  father     he began  employing that thin  razor edged voice that accountants use to preface something unexpected and very expensive     what calculus is .         you tell me     said ptaclusp  sagging onto a stool .      it   s what i   ve had to invent to deal with the wages bill  father     said another iia .      i thought that was algebra .     said ptaclusp .      we passed algebra last week     said a third iia .     it   s calculus now .  i   ve had to loop myself another four times to work on it  and there   s three of me working on       he glanced at his brothers      quantum accountancy .         what   s that for .     said his father wearily .      next week .     the leading accountant glared at the top slab .     for example     he said .     you know rthur the fresco painter .         what about him .         he   that is  they   have put in a bill for two years    work .  oh .         they said they did it on tuesday .  on account of how time is fractal in nature  they said .         they said that .     said ptaclusp .      it   s amazing what they pick up     said one of the accountants  glaring at the paracosmic architects .   ptaclusp hesitated .     how many of them are there .         how should we know .  we know there were fifty three .  then he went critical .  we   ve certainly seen him around a lot .     two of the iias sat back and steepled their fingers  always a bad sign in anyone having anything to do with money .     the problem is     one of them continued     that after the initial enthusiasm a lot of the workers looped themselves unofficially so that they could stay at home and send themselves out to work .         but that   s ridiculous     ptaclusp protested weakly .     they   re not different people  they   re just doing it to themselves .         that   s never stopped anyone  father     said iia .     how many men have stopped drinking themselves stupid at the age of twenty to save a stranger dying of liver failure at forty .      there was silence while they tried to work this one out .      a stranger    .     said ptaclusp uncertainly .      i mean himself  when older     snapped iia .     that was philosophy     he added .      one of the masons beat himself up yesterday     said one of the iibs gloomily .     he was fighting with himself over his wife .  now he   s going mad because he doesn   t know whether it   s an earlier version of him or someone he hasn   t been yet .  he   s afraid he   s going to creep up on him .  there   s worse than that  too .  dad  we   re paying forty thousand people  and we   re only employing two thousand .         it   s going to bankrupt us  that   s what you   re going to say     said ptaclusp .     i know .  it   s all my fault .  i just wanted something to hand on to you  you know .  i didn   t expect all this .  it seemed too easy to start with .      one of the iias cleared his throat .      it   s   uh   not quite as bad as all that     he said quietly .      what do you mean .      the accountant laid a dozen copper coins on the table .      well  er     he said .     you see  eh  it occurred to me  since there   s all this movement in time  that it   s not just people who can be looped  and  er  look  you see these coins .      one coin vanished .      they   re all the same coin  aren   t they     said one of his brothers .      well  yes     said the iia  very embarrassed  because interfering with the divine flow of money was alien to his personal religion .     the same coin at five minute intervals .         and you   re using this trick to pay the men .     said ptaclusp dully .      it   s not a trick .  i give them the money     said iia primly .     what happens to it afterward isn   t my responsibility  is it .         i don   t like any of this     said his father .      don   t worry .  it all evens out in the end     said one of the iias .     everyone gets what   s coming to them .         yes .  that   s what i   m afraid of     said ptaclusp .      it   s just a way of letting your money work for you     said another son .     it   s probably quantum .         oh  good     said ptaclusp weakly .      we   ll get the block on tonight  don   t worry     said one of the iibs .     after it   s flared the power off we can all settle down .         i told the king we   d do it tomorrow .      the ptaclusp iibs went pale in unison .  despite the heat  it suddenly seemed a lot colder in the tent .      tonight  father     said one of them .     surely you mean tonight .         tomorrow     said ptaclusp  firmly .     i   ve arranged an awning and people throwing lotus blossom .  there   s going to be a band .  tocsins and trumpets and tinkling cymbals .  and speeches and a meat tea afterward .  that   s the way we   ve always done it .  attracts new customers .  they like to have a look round .         father  you   ve seen the way it soaks up   you   ve seen the frost           let it soak .  we ptaclusps don   t go around capping off pyramids as though we were finishing off a garden wall .  we don   t knock off like a wossname in the night .  people expect a ceremony .         but           i   m not listening .  i   ve listened to too much of this new fangled stuff .  tomorrow .  i   ve had the bronze plaque made  and the velvet curtains and everything .      one of the iias shrugged .     it   s no good arguing with him     he said .     i   m from three hours ahead .  i remember this meeting .  we couldn   t change his mind .         i   m from two hours ahead     said one of his clones .     i remember you saying that  too .      beyond the walls of the tent  the pyramid sizzled with accumulated time .     there is nothing mystical about the power of pyramids .   pyramids are dams in the stream of time .  correctly shaped and orientated  with the proper paracosmic measurements correctly plumbed in  the temporal potential of the great mass of stone can be diverted to accelerate or reverse time over a very small area  in the same way that a hydraulic ram can be induced to pump water against the flow .   the original builders  who were of course ancients and therefore wise  knew this very well and the whole point of a correctly built pyramid was to achieve absolute null time in the central chamber so that a dying king  tucked up there  would indeed live forever   or at least  never actually die .  the time that should have passed in the chamber was stored in the bulk of the pyramid and allowed to flare off once every twenty four hours .   after a few eons people forgot this and thought you could achieve the same effect by a  ritual b  pickling people and c  storing their soft inner bits in jars .   this seldom works .   and so the art of pyramid tuning was lost  and all the knowledge became a handful of misunderstood rules and hazy recollections .  the ancients were far too wise to build very big pyramids .  they could cause very strange things  things that would make mere fluctuations in time look tiny by comparison .   by the way  contrary to popular opinion pyramids don   t sharpen razor blades .  they just take them back to when they weren   t blunt .  it   s probably because of quantum .     teppic lay on the strata of his bed  listening intently .   there were two guards outside the door  and another two on the balcony outside  and   he was impressed at dios   s forethought   one on the roof .  he could hear them trying to make no noise .   he   d hardly been able to protest .  if black clad miscreants were getting into the palace  then the person of the king had to be protected .  it was undeniable .   he slipped off the solid mattress and glided through the twilight to the statue of bast the cat headed god in the corner  twisted off the head  and pulled out his assassin   s costume .  he dressed quickly  cursing the lack of mirrors  and then padded across and lurked behind a pillar .   the only problem  as far as he could see  was not laughing .  being a soldier in djelibeybi was not a high risk job .  there was never a hint of internal rebellion and  since either neighbor could crush the kingdom instantly by force of arms  there was no real point in selecting keen and belligerent warriors .  in fact  the last thing the priesthood wanted was enthusiastic soldiers .  enthusiastic soldiers with no fighting to do soon get bored and start thinking dangerous thoughts  like how much better they could run the country .   instead the job attracted big  solid men  the kind of men who could stand stock still for hours at a time without getting bored  men with the build of an ox and the mental processes to match .  excellent bladder control was also desirable .   he stepped out onto the balcony .   teppic had learned how not to move stealthily .  millions of years of being eaten by creatures that know how to move stealthily has made humanity very good at spotting stealthy movement .  nor was it enough to make no noise  because little moving patches of silence always aroused suspicion .  the trick was to glide through the night with a quiet reassurance  just like the air did .   there was a guard standing just outside the room .  teppic drifted past him and climbed carefully up the wall .  it had been decorated with a complex bas relief of the triumphs of past monarchs  so teppic used his family to give him a leg up .   the breeze was blowing off the desert as he swung his legs over the parapet and walked silently across the roof  which was still hot underfoot .  the air had a recently cooked smell  tinted with spice .   it was a strange feeling  to be creeping across the roof of your own palace  trying to avoid your own guards  engaged on a mission in direct contravention of your own decree and knowing that if you were caught you would have yourself thrown to the sacred crocodiles .  after all  he   d apparently already instructed that he was to be shown no mercy if he was captured .   somehow it added an extra thrill .   there was freedom of a sort up here on the rooftops  the only kind of freedom available to a king of the valley .  it occurred to teppic that the landless peasants down on the delta had more freedom than he did  although the seditious and non kingly side of him said  yes  freedom to catch any diseases of their choice  starve as much as they wanted  and die of whatever dreadful ague took their fancy .  but freedom  of a sort .   a faint noise in the huge silence of the night drew him to the riverward edge of the roof .  the djel sprawled in the moonlight  broad and oily .   there was a boat in midstream  heading back from the far bank and the necropolis .  there was no mistaking the figure at the oars .  the flarelight gleamed off his bald head .   one day  teppic thought  i   ll follow him .  i   ll find out what it is he does over there .   if he goes over in daylight  of course .   in daylight the necropolis was merely gloomy  as though the whole universe had shut down for early closing .  he   d even explored it  wandering through streets and alleys that contrived to be still and dusty no matter what the weather was on the other  the living side of the water .  there was always a breathless feel about it  which was probably not to be wondered at .  assassins liked the night on general principles  but the night of the necropolis was something else .  or rather  it was the same thing  but a lot more of it .  besides  it was the only city anywhere on the disc where an assassin couldn   t find employment .   he reached the light well that opened on the embalmers    courtyard and peered down .  a moment later he landed lightly on the floor and slipped into the room of cases .      hallo  lad .      teppic opened the lid of the case .  it was still empty .      she   s in one of the ones at the back     said the king .     never had much of a sense of direction .      it was a great big palace .  teppic could barely find his way around it by daylight .  he considered his chances of carrying out a search in pitch darkness .      it   s a family trait  you know .  your grandad had to have left and right painted on his sandals  it was that bad .  it   s lucky for you that you take after your mother in that respect .      it was strange .  she didn   t talk  she chattered .  she didn   t seem to be able to hold a simple thought in her head for more than about ten seconds .  her brain appeared to be wired directly to her mouth  so that as soon as a thought entered her head she spoke it out loud .  compared to the ladies he had met at soirees in ankh  who delighted in entertaining young assassins and fed them expensive delicacies and talked to them of high and delicate matters while their eyes sparkled like carborundum drills and their lips began to glisten   compared to them  she was as empty as a  as a  well  as an empty thing .  nevertheless  he found he desperately wanted to find her .  the sheer undemandingness of her was like a drug .  the memory of her bosom was quite beside the point .      i   m glad you   ve come back for her     said the king vaguely .     she   s your sister  you know .  half sister  that is .  sometimes i wish i   d married her mother  but you see she wasn   t royal .  very bright woman  her mother .      teppic listened hard .  there it was again  a faint breathing noise  only heard at all because of the deep silence of the night .  he worked his way to the back of the room  listened again  and lifted the lid of a case .   ptraci was curled up on the bottom  fast asleep with her head on her arm .   he leaned the lid carefully against the wall and touched her hair .  she muttered something in her sleep  and settled into a more comfortable position .      er  i think you   d better wake up     he whispered .   she changed position again and muttered something like     wstflgl .      teppic hesitated .  neither his tutors nor dios had prepared him for this .  he knew at least seventy different ways of killing a sleeping person  but none to wake them up first .   he prodded her in what looked like the least embarrassing area of her skin .  she opened her eyes .      oh     she said .     it   s you .     and she yawned .      i   ve come to take you away     said teppic .     you   ve been asleep all day .         i heard someone talking     she said  stretching in a fashion that made teppic look away hurriedly .     it was that priest  the one with the face like a bald eagle .  he   s really horrible .         he is  isn   t he .     agreed teppic  intensely relieved to hear it said .      so i just kept quiet .  and there was the king .  the new king .         oh .  he was down here  was he .     said teppic weakly .  the bitterness in her voice was like a number four stabbing knife in his heart .      all the girls say he   s really weird     she added  as he helped her out of the case .     you can touch me  you know .  i   m not made of china .      he steadied her arm  feeling in sore need of a cold bath and a quick run around the rooftops .      you   re an assassin  aren   t you     she went on .     i remembered that after you   d gone .  an assassin from foreign parts .  all that black .  have you come to kill the king .         i wish i could     said teppic .     he   s really beginning to get on my nerves .  look  could you take your bangles off .         why .         they make such a noise when you walk .     even ptraci   s earrings appeared to chime the hours when she moved her head .      i don   t want to     she said .     i   d feel naked without them .         you   re nearly naked with them     hissed teppic .     please .         she can play the dulcimer     said the ghost of teppicymon xxvii  apropos of nothing much .     not very well  mind you .  she   s up to page five of    little pieces for tiny fingers .         teppic crept to the passage leading out of the embalming room and listened hard .  silence ruled in the palace  broken only by heavy breathing and the occasional clink behind him as ptraci stripped herself of her jewelry .  he crept back .      please hurry up     he said     we haven   t got ajot of       ptraci was crying .      er     said teppic .     er .         some of these were presents from my granny     sniffed ptraci .     the old king gave me some  too .  these earrings have been in my family for ever such a long time .  how would you like it if you had to do it .         you see  jewelry isn   t just something she wears     said the ghost of teppicymon xxvii .     it   s part of who she is .     my word  he added to himself  that   s probably an insight .  why is it so much easier to think when you   re dead .      i don   t wear any     said teppic .      you   ve got all those daggers and things .         well  i need them to do my job .         well then .         look  you don   t have to leave them here  you can put them in my pouch     he said .     but we must be going .  please .         goodbye     said the ghost sadly  watching them sneak out to the courtyard .  he floated back to his corpse  who wasn   t the best of company .     the breeze was stronger when they reached the roof .  it was hotter  too  and dry .   across the river one or two of the older pyramids were already sending up their flares  but they were weak and looked wrong .      i feel itchy     said ptraci .     what   s wrong .         it feels like we   re in for a thunderstorm     said teppic  staring across the river at the great pyramid .  its blackness had intensified  so that it was a triangle of deeper darkness in the night .  figures were running around its base like lunatics watching their asylum burn .      what   s a thunderstorm .         very hard to describe     he said  in a preoccupied voice .     can you see what they   re doing over there .      ptraci squinted across the river .      they   re very busy     she said .      looks more like panic to me .      a few more pyramids flared  but instead of roaring straight up the flames flickered and lashed backward and forward  driven by intangible winds .   teppic shook himself .     come on     he said .     let   s get you away from here .           i said we should have capped it this evening     shouted ptaclusp iib above the screaming of the pyramid .     i can   t float it up now  the turbulence up there must be terrific .      the ice of day was boiling off the black marble  which was already warm to the touch .  he stared distractedly at the capstone on its cradle and then at his brother  who was still in his nightshirt .      where   s father .     he said .      i sent one of us to go and wake him up     said iia .      who .         one of you  actually .         oh .     iib stared again at the capstone .     it   s not that heavy     he said .     two of us could manhandle it up there .     he gave his brother an inquiring look .      you must be mad .  send some of the men to do it .         they   ve all run away        down river another pyramid tried to flare  spluttered  and then ejected a screaming  ragged flame that arched across the sky and grounded near the top of the great pyramid itself .      it   s interfering with the others now .     shouted iib .     come on .  we   ve got to flare it off  it   s the only way .      about a third of the way up the pyramid   s flanks a crackling blue zigzag arced out and struck itself on a stone sphinx .  the air above it boiled .   the two brothers slung the stone between them and staggered to the scaffolding  while the dust around them whirled into strange shapes .      can you hear something .     said iib  as they stumbled onto the first platform .      what  you mean the fabric of time and space being put through the wringer .     said iia .   the architect gave his brother a look of faint admiration .  it was an unusual remark for an accountant .  then his face returned to its previous look of faint terror .      no  not that     he said .      well  the sound of the very air itself being subjected to horrible tortures .         not that  either     said iib  vaguely annoyed .     i mean the creaking noise .      three more pyramids struck their discharges  which fizzled through the roiling clouds overhead and poured into the black marble above them .      can   t hear anything like that     said iia .      i think it   s coming from the pyramid .         well  you can put your ear against it if you like  but i   m not going to .      the scaffolding swayed in the storm as they eased their way up another ladder  the heavy capstone rocking between them .      i said we shouldn   t do it     muttered the accountant  as the stone slid gently onto his toes .     we shouldn   t have built this .         just shut up and lift your end  will you .      and so  one rocking ladder after another  the brothers ptaclusp eased their bickering way up the flanks of the great pyramid  while the lesser tombs along the djel fired one after another  and the sky streamed with lines of sizzling time .   it was around about this point that the greatest mathematician in the world  lying in cozy flatulence in his stall below the palace  stopped chewing the cud and realized that something very wrong was happening to numbers .  all the numbers .     the camel looked along its nose at teppic .  its expression made it clear that of all the riders in all the world it would least like to ride it  he was right at the top of the list .  however  camels look like that at everyone .  camels have a very democratic approach to the human race .  they hate every member of it  without making any distinctions for rank or creed .   this one appeared to be chewing soap .   teppic looked distractedly down the shadowy length of the royal stables  which had once contained a hundred camels .  he   d have given the world for a horse  and a moderately sized continent for a pony .  but the stables now held only a handful of rotting war chariots  relics of past glories  an elderly elephant whose presence was a bit of a mystery  and this camel .  it looked an extremely inefficient animal .  it was going threadbare at the knees .      well  this is it     he said to ptraci .     i don   t dare try the river during the night .  i could try and get you over the border .         is that saddle on right .     said ptraci .     it looks awfully funny .         it   s on an awfully odd creature     said teppic .     how do we climb onto it .         i   ve seen the camel drivers at work     she replied .     i think they just hit them very hard with a big stick .      the camel knelt down and gave her a smug look .   teppic shrugged  pulled open the doors to the outside world  and stared into the faces of five guards .   he backed away .  they advanced .  three of them were holding the heavy djel bows  which could propel an arrow through a door or turn a charging hippo into three tons of mobile kebab .  the guards had never had to fire them at a fellow human  but looked as though they were prepared to entertain the idea .   the guard captain tapped one of the men on the shoulder  and said     go and inform the high priest .      he glared at teppic .      throw down all your weapons     he said .      what  all of them .         yes .  all of them .         it might take some time     said teppic cautiously .      and keep your hands where i can see them     the captain added .      we could be up against a real impasse here     teppic ventured .  he looked from one guard to another .  he knew a variety of methods of unarmed combat  but they all rather relied on the opponent not being about to fire an arrow straight through you as soon as you moved .  but he could probably dive sideways  and once he had the cover of the camel stalls he could bide his time     and that would leave ptraci exposed .  besides  he could hardly go around fighting his own guards .  that wasn   t acceptable behavior  even for a king .   there was a movement behind the guards and dios drifted into view  as silent and inevitable as an eclipse of the moon .  he was holding a lighted torch  which reflected wild highlights on his bald head .      ah     he said .     the miscreants are captured .  well done .     he nodded to the captain .     throw them to the crocodiles .         dios .     said teppic  as two of the guards lowered their bows and bore down on him .      did you speak .         you know who i am  man .  don   t be silly .      the high priest raised the torch .      you have the advantage of me  boy     he said .     metaphorically speaking .         this is not funny     said teppic .     i order you to tell them who i am .         as you wish .  this assassin     said dios  and the voice had the cut and sear of a thermic lance     has killed the king .         i am the king  damn it     said teppic .     how could i kill myself .         we are not stupid     said dios .     these men know the king does not skulk the palace at night  or consort with condemned criminals .  all that remains for us to find out is how you disposed of the body .      his eyes fixed on teppic   s face  and teppic realized that the high priest was  indeed  truly mad .  it was the rare kind of madness caused by being yourself for so long that habits of sanity have etched themselves into the brain .  i wonder how old he really is .  he thought .      these assassins are cunning creatures     said dios .     have a care of him .      there was a crash beside the priest .  ptraci had tried to throw a camel prod  and missed .   when everyone looked back teppic had vanished .  the guards beside him were busy collapsing slowly to the floor  groaning .   dios smiled .      take the woman     he snapped  and the captain darted forward and grabbed ptraci  who hadn   t made any attempt to run away .  dios bent down and picked up the prod .      there are more guards outside     he said .     i   m sure you will realize that .  it will be in your interests to step forward .         why .     said teppic  from the shadows .  he fumbled in his boot for his blowpipe .      you will then be thrown to the sacred crocodiles  by order of the king     said dios .      something to look forward to  eh .     said teppic  feverishly screwing bits together .      it would certainly be preferable to many alternatives     said dios .   in the darkness teppic ran his fingers over the little coded knobs on the darts .  most of the really spectacular poisons would have evaporated or dissolved into harmless ness by now  but there were a number of lesser potions designed to give their clients nothing more than a good night   s sleep .  an assassin might have to work his way to an inhumee past a number of alert bodyguards .  it was considered impolite to inhume them as well .      you could let us go     said teppic .     i suspect that   s what you want  isn   t it .  for me to go away and never come back .  that suits me fine .      dios hesitated .      you   re supposed to say    and let the girl go        he said .      oh  yes .  and that  too     said teppic .      no .  i would be failing in my duty to the king     said dios .      for goodness sake  dios  you know i am the king .         no .  i have a very clear picture of the king .  you are not the king     said the priest .   teppic peered over the edge of the camel stall .  the camel peered over his shoulder .   and then the world went mad .   all right  madder .     all the pyramids were blazing now  filling the sky with their sooty light as the brothers ptaclusp struggled to the main working platform .   iia collapsed on the planking  wheezing like an elderly bellows .  a few feet away the sloping side was hot to the touch  and there was no doubt in his mind now that the pyramid was creaking  like a sailing ship in a gale .  he had never paid much attention to the actual mechanics as opposed to the cost of pyramid construction  but he was pretty certain that the noise was as wrong as ii and ii making v .   his brother reached out to touch the stone  but drew his hand back as small sparks flashed around his fingers .      you can feel the warmth     he said .     it   s astonishing .         why .         heating up a mass like this .  i mean  the sheer tonnage           i don   t like it  two bee     iia quavered .     let   s just leave the stone here  shall we .  i   m sure it   ll be all right  and in the morning we can send a gang up here  they   ll know exactly what        his words were drowned out as another flare crackled across the sky and hit the column of dancing air fifty feet above them .  he grabbed part of the scaffolding .      sod take this     he said .     i   m off .         hang on a minute     said iib .     i mean  what is creaking .  stone can   t creak .         the whole bloody scaffolding is moving  don   t be daft .     he stared goggle eyed at his brother .     tell me it   s the scaffolding     he pleaded .      no  i   m certain this time .  it   s coming from inside .      they stared at one another  and then at the rickety ladder leading up to the tip  or to where the tip should be .      come on .     said iib .     it can   t flare off  it   s trying to find ways of discharging        there was a sound as loud as the groaning of continents .     teppic felt it .  he felt that his skin was several sizes too small .  he felt that someone was holding his ears and trying to twist his head off .   he saw the guard captain sag to his knees  fighting to get his helmet off  and he leapt the stall .   tried to leap the stall .  everything was wrong  and he landed heavily on a floor that seemed undecided about becoming a wall .  he managed to get to his feet and was pulled sideways  dancing awkwardly across the stable to keep his balance .   the stables stretched and shrank like a picture in a distorting mirror .  he   d gone to see some once in ankh  the three of them hazarding a half coin each to visit the transient marvels of dr .  mooner   s traveling take your breath away emporium .  but you knew then that it was only twisted glass that was giving you a head like a sausage and legs like footballs .  teppic wished he could be so certain that what was happening around him would allow of such a harmless explanation .  you   d probably need a wobbly glass mirror to make it look normal .   he ran on taffy legs toward ptraci and the high priest as the world was expanded and squeezed around him  and was momentarily gratified to see the girl squirm in dios   s grip and fetch him a tidy thump on the ear .   he moved as though in a dream  with the distances changing as though reality was an elastic thing .  another step sent him cannoning into the pair of them .  he grabbed ptraci   s arm and staggered back to the camel stall  where the creature was still cudding and watching the scene with the nearest thing a camel will ever get to mild interest  and snatched its halter .   no one seemed to be interested in stopping them as they helped each other through the doorway and out into the mad night .      it helps if you shut your eyes     said ptraci .   teppic tried it .  it worked .  a stretch of courtyard that his eyes told him was a quivering rectangle whose sides twanged like bowstrings became  well  just a courtyard under his feet .      gosh  that was clever     he said .     how did you think of that .         i always shut my eyes when i   m frightened     said ptraci .      good plan .         what   s happening .         i don   t know .  i don   t want to find out .  i think going away from here could be an amazingly sensible idea .  how do you make a camel kneel  did you say .  i   ve got any amount of sharp things .      the camel  who had a very adequate grasp of human language as it applied to threats  knelt down graciously .  they scrambled aboard and the landscape lurched again as the beast jacked itself back onto its feet .   the camel knew perfectly well what was happening .  three stomachs and a digestive system like an industrial distillation plant gave you a lot of time for sitting and thinking .   it   s not for nothing that advanced mathematics tends to be invented in hot countries .  it   s because of the morphic resonance of all the camels  who have that disdainful expression and famous curled lip as a natural result of an ability to do quadratic equations .   it   s not generally realized that camels have a natural aptitude for advanced mathematics  particularly where they involve ballistics .  this evolved as a survival trait  in the same way as a human   s hand and eye coordination  a chameleon   s camouflage and a dolphin   s renowned ability to save drowning swimmers if there   s any chance that biting them in half might be observed and commented upon adversely by other humans .   the fact is that camels are far more intelligent than dolphins .   they are so much brighter that they soon realized that the most prudent thing any intelligent animal can do  if it would prefer its descendants not to spend a lot of time on a slab with electrodes clamped to their brains or sticking mines on the bottom of ships or being patronized rigid by zoologists  is to make bloody certain humans don   t find out about it .  so they long ago plumped for a lifestyle that  in return for a certain amount of porterage and being prodded with sticks  allowed them adequate food and grooming and the chance to spit in a human   s eye and get away with it .   and this particular camel  the result of millions of years of selective evolution to produce a creature that could count the grains of sand it was walking over  and close its nostrils at will  and survive under the broiling sun for many days without water  was called you bastard .   and he was  in fact  the greatest mathematician in the world .   you bastard was thinking  there seems to be some growing dimensional instability here  swinging from zero to nearly forty five degrees by the look of it .  how interesting .  i wonder what   s causing it .  let v equal   .  let tau equal chi    cudcudcud let kappa y be an evil smelling bugger  differential tensor domain with four imaginary spin coefficients     ptraci hit him across the head with her sandal .     come on  get a move on .     she yelled .  you bastard thought  therefore h to the enabling power equals v s .  cudcudcud thus in hypersyllogica notation     teppic looked behind him .  the strange distortions in the landscape seemed to be settling down  and dios was     dios was striding out of the palace  and had actually managed to find several guards whose fear of disobedience overcame the terror of the mysteriously distorted world .   you bastard stood stoically chewing   cudcudcud which gives us an interesting shortening oscillation .  what would be the period of this .  let period   x .  cudcudcud let t   time .  let initial period     ptraci bounced up and down on his neck and kicked hard with her heels  an action which would have caused any anthropoid male to howl and bang his head against the wall .      it won   t move .  can   t you hit it .      teppic brought his hand down as hard as he could on you bastard   s hide  raising a cloud of dust and deadening every nerve in his fingers .  it was like hitting a large sack full of coathangers .      come on    he muttered .   dios raised a hand .      halt  in the name of the king .     he shouted .   an arrow thudded into you bastard   s hump .      equals   .   recurring .  reduce .  that gives us   ouch       seconds     you bastard turned his long neck around .  his great hairy eyebrows made accusing curves as his yellow eyes narrowed and took a fix on the high priest  and he put aside the interesting problem for a moment and dredged up the familiar ancient maths that his race had perfected long ago   let range equal forty one feet .  let windspeed equal   .  vector one eight  cud let glutinosity equal       teppic drew a throwing knife .   dios took a deep breath .  he   s going to order them to fire on us  teppic thought .  in my own name  in my own kingdom  i   m going to be shot .      angle two five  cud fire .   it was a magnificent volley .  the gob of cud had commendable lift and spin and hit with a sound like  a sound like half a pound of semi digested grass hitting someone in the face .  there was nothing else it could sound like .   the silence that followed was by way of being a standing ovation .   the landscape began to distort again .  this was clearly not a place to linger .  you bastard looked down at his front legs .   let legs equal four     he lumbered into a run .  camels apparently have more knees than any other creature and you bastard ran like a steam engine  with lots of extraneous movement at right angles to the direction of motion accompanied by a thunderous barrage of digestive noises .      bloody stupid animal     muttered ptraci  as they jolted away from the palace     but it looks like it finally got the idea .         gauge invariant repetition rate of   .  lz .  what   s she talking about  bloody stupid lives over in tsort     though they swung through the air as though jointed with bad elastic you bastard   s legs covered a lot of ground  and already they were bouncing through the sleeping packed earth streets of the city .      it   s starting again  isn   t it .     said ptraci .     i   m going to shut my eyes .      teppic nodded .  the firebrick hot houses around them were doing their slow motion mirror dance again  and the road was rising and falling in a way that solid land had no right to adopt .      it   s like the sea     he said .      i can   t see anything     said ptraci firmly .      i mean the sea .  the ocean .  you know .  waves .         i   ve heard about it .  is anyone chasing us .     teppic turned in the saddle .     not that i can make out     he said .     it looks as        from here he could see past the long  low bulk of the palace and across the river to the great pyramid itself .  it was almost hidden in dark clouds  but what he could see of it was definitely wrong .  he knew it had four sides  and he could see all eight of them .   it seemed to be moving in and out of focus  which he felt instinctively was a dangerous thing for several million tons of rock to do .  he felt a pressing urge to be a long way away from it .  even a dumb creature like the camel seemed to have the same idea .   you bastard was thinking    delta squared .  thus  dimensional pressure k will result in a ninety degree transformation in chi    x pu t for a k bundle of any three invariables .  or four minutes  plus or minus ten seconds     the camel looked down at the great pads of his feet .   let speed equal gallop .      how did you make it do that .     said teppic .      i didn   t .  it   s doing it by itself .  hang on .      this wasn   t easy .  teppic had saddled the camel but neglected the harness .  ptraci had handfuls of camel hair to hang on to .  all he had was handfuls of ptraci .  no matter where he tried to put his hands  they encountered warm  yielding flesh .  nothing in his long education had prepared him for this  whereas everything in ptraci   s obviously had .  her long hair whipped his face and smelled beguilingly of rare perfume .       are you all right .     he shouted above the wind .      i   m hanging on with my knees .         that must be very hard .         you get special training .      camels gallop by throwing their feet as far away from them as possible and then running to keep up .  knee joints clicking like chilly castanets  you bastard thrashed up the sloping road out of the valley and windmilled along the narrow gorge that led  under towering limestone cliffs  to the high desert beyond .   and behind them  tormented beyond measure by the inexorable tide of geometry  unable to discharge its burden of time  the great pyramid screamed  lifted itself off its base and  its bulk swishing through the air as unstoppable as something completely unstoppable  ground around precisely ninety degrees and did something perverted to the fabric of time and space .   you bastard sped along the gorge  his neck stretched out to its full extent  his mighty nostrils flaring like jet intakes .      it   s terrified .     ptraci yelled .     animals always know about this sort of thing .         what sort of thing .         forest fires and things .         we haven   t got any trees .         well  floods and   and things .  they   ve got some strange natural instinct .         phi      u v  .  lateral e v .  equals a tranche of seven to twelve     the sound hit them .  it was as silent as a dandelion clock striking midnight  but it had pressure .  it rolled over them  suffocating as velvet  nauseating as a battered saveloy .   and was gone .   you bastard slowed to a walk  a complicated procedure that involved precise instructions to each leg in turn .   there was a feeling of release  a sense of stress withdrawn .   you bastard stopped .  in the pre dawn glow he   d spotted a clump of thorned syphacia bushes growing in the rocks by the track .      angle left  x equals    .  y equals    .  z equals    .  bite     peace descended .  there was no sound except for the eructations of the camel   s digestive tract and the distant warbling of a desert owl .   ptraci slid off her perch and landed awkwardly .      my bottom     she announced  to the desert in general     is one huge blister .      teppic jumped down and half ran  half staggered up the scree by the roadside  then jogged across the cracked limestone plateau until he could get a good look at the valley .   it wasn   t there anymore .     it was still dark when dil the master embalmer woke up  his body twanging with the sensation that something was wrong .  he slipped out of bed  dressed hurriedly  and pulled aside the curtain that did duty as a door .   the night was soft and velvety .  behind the chirrup of the insects there was another sound  a frying noise  a faint sizzling on the edge of hearing .   perhaps that was what had woken him up .   the air was warm and damp .  curls of mist rose from the river  and     the pyramids weren   t flaring .   he   d grown up in this house  it had been in the family of the master embalmers for thousands of years  and he   d seen the pyramids flare so often that he didn   t notice them  any more than he noticed his own breathing .  but now they were dark and silent  and the silence cried out and the darkness glared .   but that wasn   t the worst part .  as his horrified eyes stared up at the empty sky over the necropolis they saw the stars  and what the stars were stuck to .   dil was terrified .  and then  when he had time to think about it  he was ashamed of himself .  after all  he thought  it   s what i   ve always been told is there .  it stands to reason .  i   m just seeing it properly for the first time .   there .  does that make me feel any better .   no .   he turned and ran down the street  sandals flapping  until he reached the house that held gern and his numerous family .  he dragged the protesting apprentice from the communal sleeping mat and pulled him into the street  turned his face to the sky and hissed     tell me what you can see .      gern squinted .      i can see the stars  master     he said .      what are they on  boy .      gern relaxed slightly .     that   s easy  master .  everyone knows the stars are on the body of the goddess nept who arches herself from   oh  bloody hell .         you can see her  too .         oh  mummy     whispered gern  and slid to his knees .   dil nodded .  he was a religious man .  it was a great comfort knowing that the gods were there .  it was knowing they were here that was the terrible part .   because the body of a woman arched over the heavens  faintly blue  faintly shadowy in the light of the watery stars .   she was enormous  her statistics interstellar .  the shadow between her galactic breasts was a dark nebula  the curve of her stomach a vast wash of glowing gas  her navel the seething  dark incandescence in which new stars were being born .  she wasn   t supporting the sky .  she was the sky .   her huge sad face  upside down on the turnwise horizon  stared directly at dil .  and dil was realizing that there are few things that so shake belief as seeing  clearly and precisely  the object of that belief .  seeing  contrary to popular wisdom  isn   t believing .  it   s where belief stops  because it isn   t needed anymore .      oh  sod     moaned gern .   dil struck him across the arm .      stop that     he said .     and come with me .         oh  master  whatever shall we do .      dil looked around at the sleeping city .  he hadn   t the faintest idea .      we   ll go to the palace     he said firmly .     it   s probably a trick of the  of the  of the dark .  anyway  the sun will be up presently .      he strode off  wishing he could change places with gern and show just a hint of gibbering terror .  the apprentice followed him at a sort of galloping creep .      i can see shadows against the stars  master .  can you see them  master .  around the edge of the world  master .         just mists  boy     said dil  resolutely keeping his eyes fixed in front of him and maintaining a dignified posture as appropriate to the keeper of the left hand door of the natron lodge and holder of several medals for needlework .      there     he said .     see  gern  the sun is coming up .      they stood and watched it .   then gern whimpered  very quietly .   rising up the sky  very slowly  was a great flaming ball .  and it was being pushed by a dung beetle bigger than worlds .       part iii      the book of the new son      the sun rose and  because this wasn   t the old kingdom out here  it was a mere ball of flaming gas .  the purple night of the high desert evaporated under its blowlamp glare .  lizards scuttled into cracks in the rocks .  you bastard settled himself down in the sparse shadow of what was left of the syphacia bushes  peered haughtily at the landscape  and began to chew cud and calculate square roots in base seven .   teppic and ptraci eventually found the shade of a limestone overhang  and sat glumly staring out at the waves of heat wobbling off the rocks .      i don   t understand     said ptraci .     have you looked everywhere .         it   s a country .  it can   t just bloody well fall through a hole in the ground .         where is it  then .     said ptraci evenly .   teppic growled .  the heat struck like a hammer  but he strode out over the rocks as though three hundred square miles could perhaps have been hiding under a pebble or behind a bush .   the fact was that the track dipped between the cliffs  but almost immediately rose again and continued across the dunes into what was quite clearly tsort .  he   d recognized a wind eroded sphinx that had been set up as a boundary marker  legend said it prowled the borders in times of dire national need  although legend wasn   t sure why .   he knew they had galloped into ephebe .  he should be looking across the fertile  pyramid speckled valley of the djel that lay between the two countries .   he   d spent an hour looking for it .   it was inexplicable .  it was uncanny .  it was also extremely embarrassing .   he shaded his eyes and stared around for the thousandth time at the silent  baking landscape .  and moved his head .  and saw djelibeybi .   it flashed across his vision in an instant .  he jerked his eyes back and saw it again  a brief flash of misty color that vanished as soon as he concentrated on it .   some minutes later ptraci peered out of the shade and saw him get down on his hands and knees .  when he started turning over rocks she decided it was time he should come back in out of the sun .   he shook her hand off his shoulder  and gestured impatiently .      i   ve found it .     he pulled a knife from his boot and started poking at the stones .      where .         here .      she laid a ringed hand on his forehead .      oh yes     she said .     i see .  yes .  good .  now i think you   d better come into the shade .         no  i mean it .  here .  look .      she hunkered down and stared at the rock  to humor him .      there   s a crack     she said  doubtfully .      look at it  will you .  you have to turn your head and sort of look out of the corner of your eye .     teppic   s dagger smacked into the crack  which was no more than a faint line on the rock .      well  it goes on a long way     said ptraci  staring along the burning pavement .      all the way from the second cataract to the delta     said teppic .     covering your eye with one hand helps .  please give it a try .  please .      she put one hesitant hand over her eye and squinted obediently at the rock .   eventually she said     it   s no good  i can   t   seeee        she stayed motionless for a moment and then flung herself sideways onto the rocks .  teppic stopped trying to hammer the knife into the crack and crawled over to her .      i was right on the edge .     she wailed .      you saw it .     he said hopefully .   she nodded and  with great care  got to her feet and backed away .      did your eyes feel as though they were being turned inside out .     said teppic .      yes     said ptraci coldly .     can i have my bangles  please .         what .         my bangles .  you put them in your pocket .  i want them  please .      teppic shrugged  and fished in his pouch .  the bangles were mostly copper  with a few bits of chipped enamel .  here and there the craftsman had tried  without much success  to do something interesting with twisted bits of wire and lumps of colored glass .  she took them and slipped them on .      do they have some occult significance .     he said .      what   s occult mean .     she said vaguely .      oh .  what do you need them for  then .         i told you .  i don   t feel properly dressed without them on .      teppic shrugged  and went back to rocking his knife in the crack .      why are you doing that .     she said .  he stopped and thought about it .      i don   t know     he said .     but you did see the valley  didn   t you .         yes .         well  then .         well what .      teppic rolled his eyes .     didn   t you think it was a bit  well  odd .  a whole country just more or less vanishing .  it   s something you don   t bloody well see every day  for gods    sake .         how should i know .  i   ve never been out of the valley before .  i don   t know what it   s supposed to look like from outside .  and don   t swear .      teppic shook his head .     i think i will go and lie down in the shade     he said .     what   s left of it     he added  for the brass light of the sun was burning away the shadows .  he staggered over to the rocks and stared at her .      the whole valley has just closed up     he managed at last .     all those people           i saw cooking fires     said ptraci  slumping down beside him .      it   s something to do with the pyramid     he said .     it looked very strange just before we left .  it   s magic  or geometry  or one of those things .  how do you think we can get back .         i don   t want to go back .  why should i want to go back .  it   s the crocodiles for me .  i   m not going back  not just for crocodiles .         um .  perhaps i could pardon you  or something     said teppic .      oh yes     said ptraci  looking at her nails .     you said you were the king  didn   t you .         i am the king .  that   s my kingdom over       teppic hesitated  not knowing in which direction to point his finger      somewhere .  i   m king of it .         you don   t look like the king     said ptraci .      why not .         he had a golden mask on .         that was me .         so you ordered me thrown to the crocodiles .         yes .  i mean  no .     teppic hesitated .     i mean  the king did .  i didn   t .  in a way .  anyway  i was the one who rescued you     he added gallantly .      there you are  then .  anyway  if you were the king  you   d be a god  too .  you aren   t acting very god like at the moment .         yes .  well .  er .     teppic hesitated again .  ptraci   s literal mindedness meant that innocent sentences had to be carefully examined before being sent out into the world .      i   m basically good at making the sun rise     he said .     i don   t know how  though .  and rivers .  you want any rivers flooding  i   m your man .  god  i mean .      he lapsed into silence as a thought struck him .      i wonder what   s happening in there without me .     he said .   ptraci stood up and set off down to the gorge .      where are you going .      she turned .     well  mr .  king or god or assassin  or whatever  can you make water .         what  here .         i mean to drink .  there may be a river hidden in that crack or there may not  but we can   t get at it  can we .  so we have to go somewhere where we can .  it   s so simple i should think even kings could understand it .      he hurried after her  down the scree to where you bastard was lying with his head and neck flat on the ground  flicking his ears in the heat and idly applying you vicious brute   s theory of transient integrals to a succession of promising cissoid numbers .  ptraci kicked him irritably .      do you know where there is water  then .     said teppic .      e    .  eleven miles     ptraci glared at him from kohl ringed eyes .     you mean you don   t know .  you were going to take me into the desert and you don   t know where the water is .         well  i rather expected i was going to be able to take some with me .         you didn   t even think about it .         listen  you can   t talk to me like that .  i   m a king .     teppic stopped .      you   re absolutely right     he said .     i never thought about it .  where i come from it rains nearly every day .  i   m sorry .      ptraci   s brows furrowed .     who reigns nearly every day .     she said .      no  i mean rain .  you know .  very thin water coming out of the sky .         what a silly idea .  where do you come from .      teppic looked miserable .     where i come from is ankh morpork .  where i started from is here .     he stared down the track .  from here  if you knew what you were looking for  you could just see a faint crack running across the rocks .  it climbed the cliffs on either side  a new vertical fault the thickness of a line that just happened to contain a complete river kingdom and       years of history .   he   d hated every minute of his time there .  and now it had shut him out .  and now  because he couldn   t  he wanted to go back .   he wandered down to it and put his hand over one eye .  if you jerked your head just right     it flashed past his vision briefly  and was gone .  he tried a few times more  and couldn   t see it again .   if i hacked the rocks away .  no  he thought  that   s silly .  it   s a line .  you can   t get into a line .  a line has no thickness .  well known fact of geometry .   he heard ptraci come up behind him  and the next moment her hands were on his neck .  for a second he wondered how she knew the catharti death grip  and then her fingers were gently massaging his muscles  stresses melting under their expert caress like fat under a hot knife .  he shivered as the tension relaxed .      that   s nice     he said .      we   re trained for it .  your tendons are knotted up like ping pong balls on a string     said ptraci .   teppic gratefully subsided onto one of the boulders that littered the base of the cliff and let the rhythm of her fingers unwind the problems of the night .      i don   t know what to do     he murmured .     that feels good .         it   s not all peeling grapes  being a handmaiden     said ptraci .     the first lesson we learn is  when the master has had a long hard day it is not the best time to suggest the congress of the fox and the persimmon .  who says you have to do anything .         i feel responsible .     teppic shifted position like a cat .      if you know where there is a dulcimer i could play you something soothing     said ptraci .     i   ve got as far as    goblins picnic    in book i .         i mean  a king shouldn   t let his kingdom just vanish like that .         all the other girls can do chords and everything     said ptraci wistfully  massaging his shoulders .     but the old king always said he   d rather hear me .  he said it used to cheer him up .         i mean  it   ll be called the lost kingdom     said teppic drowsily .     how will i feel then  i ask you .         he said he liked my singing  too .  everyone else said it sounded like a flock of vultures who   ve just found a dead donkey .         i mean  king of a lost kingdom .  it   d be dreadful .  i   ve got to get it back .      you bastard slowly turned his massive head to follow the flight of an errant blowfly  deep in his brain little columns of red numbers flickered  detailing vectors and speed and elevation .  the conversation of human beings seldom interested him  but it crossed his mind that the males and females always got along best when neither actually listened fully to what the other one was saying .  it was much simpler with camels .   teppic stared at the line in the rock .  geometry .  that was it .      we   ll go to ephebe     he said .     they know all about geometry and they have some very unsound ideas .  unsound ideas are what i could do with right now .         why do you carry all these knives and things .  i mean  really .         hmm .  sorry .         all these knives .  why .      teppic thought about it .     i suppose i don   t feel properly dressed without them     he said .      oh .      ptraci dutifully cast around for a new topic of conversation .  introducing topics of amusing discourse was also part of a handmaiden   s duties .  she   d never been particularly good at it .  the other girls had come up with an astonishing assortment  everything from the mating habits of crocodiles to speculation about life in the netherworld .  she   d found it heavy going after talking about the weather .      so     she said .     you   ve killed a lot of people  i expect .         mm .         as an assassin  i mean .  you get paid to kill people .  have you killed lots .  do you know you tense your back muscles a lot .         i don   t think i ought to talk about it     he said .      i ought to know .  if we   ve got to cross the desert together and everything .  more than a hundred .         good heavens  no .         well  less than fifty .      teppic rolled over .      look  even the most famous assassins never killed more than thirty people in all their lives     he said .      less than twenty  then .         yes .         less than ten .         i think     said teppic     it would be best to say a number between zero and ten .         just so long as i know .  these things are important .      they strolled back to you bastard .  but now it was teppic who seemed to have something on his mind .      all this senate       he said .      congress     corrected ptraci .      you   er   more than fifty people .         there   s a different name for that sort of woman     said ptraci  but without much rancor .      sorry .  less than ten .         let   s say     said ptraci     a number between zero and ten .      you bastard spat .  twenty feet away the blowfly was picked cleanly out of the air and glued to the rock behind it .      amazing how they do it  isn   t it     said teppic .     animal instinct  i suppose .      you bastard gave him a haughty glare from under his sweep the desert eyelashes and thought      let z   ei  .  cudcudcud then dz   ie i  d    izd  or d    dz iz       ptaclusp  still in his nightshirt  wandered aimlessly among the wreckage at the foot of the pyramid .   it was humming like a turbine .  ptaclusp didn   t know why  knew nothing about the vast expenditure of power that had twisted the dimensions by ninety degrees and was holding them there against terrible pressures  but at least the disturbing temporal changes seemed to have stopped .  there were fewer sons around than there used to be  in truth  he could have done with finding one or two .   first he found the capstone  which had shattered  its electrum sheathing peeling away .  in its descent from the pyramid it had hit the statue of hat the vulture headed god  bending it double and giving it an expression of mild surprise .   a faint groan sent him tugging at the wreckage of a tent .  he tore at the heavy canvas and unearthed iib  who blinked at him in the gray light .      it didn   t work  dad .     he moaned .     we   d almost got it up there  and then the whole thing just sort of twisted .      the builder lifted a spar off his son   s legs .      anything broken .     he said quietly .      just bruised  i think .     the young architect sat up  wincing  and craned to see around .      where   s two ay .     he said .     he was higher up than me  nearly on the top           i   ve found him     said ptaclusp .   architects are not known for their attention to subtle shades of meaning  but iib heard the lead in his father   s voice .      he   s not dead  is he .     he whispered .      i don   t think so .  i   m not sure .  he   s alive .  but .  he   s moving   he   s moving   well  you better come and see .  i think something quantum has happened to him .        you bastard plodded onward at about   .     meters per second  working out complex conjugate coordinates to stave off boredom while his huge  plate like feet crunched on the sand .   lack of fingers was another big spur to the development of camel intellect .  human mathematical development had always been held back by everyone   s instinctive tendency  when faced with something really complex in the way of triform polynomials or parametric differentials  to count fingers .  camels started from the word go by counting numbers .   deserts were a great help  too .  there aren   t many distractions .  as far as camels were concerned  the way to mighty intellectual development was to have nothing much to do and nothing to do it with .   he reached the crest of the dune  gazed with approval over the rolling sands ahead of him  and began to think in logarithms .      what   s ephebe like .     said ptraci .      i   ve never been there .  apparently it   s ruled by a tyrant .         i hope we don   t meet him  then .      teppic shook his head .     it   s not like that     he said .     they have a new tyrant every five years and they do something to him first .     he hesitated .     i think they ee lect him .         is that something like they do to tomcats and bulls and things .         er .         you know .  to make them stop fighting and be more peaceful .      teppic winced .     to be honest  i   m not sure     he said .     but i don   t think so .  they   ve got something they do it with  i think it   s called a mocracy  and it means everyone in the whole country can say who the new tyrant is .  one man  one       he paused .  the political history lesson seemed a very long while ago  and had introduced concepts never heard of in djelibeybi or in ankh morpork  for that matter .  he had a stab at it  anyway .     one man  one vet .         that   s for the eelecting  then .      he shrugged .  it might be  for all he knew .     the point is  though  that everyone can do it .  they   re very proud of it .  everyone has       he hesitated again  certain now that things were amiss      the vet .  except for women  of course .  and children .  and criminals .  and slaves .  and stupid people .  and people of foreign extraction .  and people disapproved of for  er  various reasons .  and lots of other people .  but everyone apart from them .  it   s a very enlightened civilization .      ptraci gave this some consideration .      and that   s a mocracy  is it .         they invented it in ephebe  you know     said teppic  feeling obscurely that he ought to defend it .      i bet they had trouble exporting it     said ptraci firmly .     the sun wasn   t just a ball of flaming dung pushed across the sky by a giant beetle .  it was also a boat .  it depended on how you looked at it .   the light was wrong .  it had a flat quality  like water left in a glass for weeks .  there was no joy to it .  it illuminated  but without life  like bright moonlight rather than the light of day .   but ptaclusp was more worried about his son .      do you know what   s wrong with him .     he said .   his other son bit his stylus miserably .  his hand was hurting .  he   d tried to touch his brother  and the crackling shock had taken the skin off his ringers .      i might     he ventured .      can you cure it .         i don   t think so .         what is it  then .         well  dad .  when we were up on the pyramid   well  when it couldn   t flare   you see  i   m sure it twisted around   time  you see  is just another dimension   um .      ptaclusp rolled his eyes .     none of that architect   s talk  boy     he said .     what   s wrong with him .         i think he   s dimensionally maladjusted  dad .  time and space has got a bit mixed up for him .  that   s why he   s moving sideways all the time .      ptaclusp iib gave his father a brave little smile .      he always used to move sideways     said ptaclusp .   his son sighed .     yes  dad     he said .     but that was just normal .  all accountants move like that .  now he   s moving sideways because that   s like  well  it   s like time to him .      ptaclusp frowned .  drifting gently sideways wasn   t iia   s only problem .  he was also flat .  not flat like a card  with a front  back and edge   but flat from any direction .      puts me exactly in mind of them people in the frescoes     he said .     where   s his depth  or whatever you call it .         i think that   s in time     said iib  helplessly .     ours  not his .      ptaclusp walked around his son  noting how the flatness followed him .  he scratched his chin .      so he can walk in time  can he .     he said slowly .      that may be possible  yes .         do you think we could persuade him to stroll back a few months and tell us not to build that bloody pyramid .         he can   t communicate  dad .         not much change there  then .     ptaclusp sat down on the rubble  his head in his hands .  it had come to this .  one son normal and stupid  one flat as a shadow .  and what sort of life could the poor flat kid have .  he   d go through life being used to open locks  clean the ice off windscreens  and sleeping cheaply in trouser presses in hotel bedrooms .   being able to get under doors and read books without opening them would not be much of a compensation .   iia drifted sideways  a flat cut out on the landscape .      can   t we do anything .     he said .     roll him up neatly  or something .      iib shrugged .     we could put something in the way .  that might be a good idea .  it would stop anything worse happening to him because it  er  wouldn   t have time to happen in .  i think .      they pushed the bent statue of hat the vulture headed god into the flat one   s path .  after a minute or two his gentle sideways drift brought him up against it .  there was a fat blue spark that melted part of the statue  but the movement stopped .      why the sparks .     said ptaclusp .      it   s a bit like flarelight  i think .      ptaclusp hadn   t got where he was today   no  he   d have to correct himself   hadn   t got to where he had been last night without eventually seeing the advantages in the unlikeliest situations .      he   ll save on clothing     he said slowly .     i mean  he can just paint it on .         i don   t think you   ve quite got the idea  dad     said iib wearily .  he sat down beside his father and stared across the river to the palace .      something going on over there     said ptaclusp .     do you think they   ve noticed the pyramid .         i shouldn   t be surprised .  it   s moved around ninety degrees  after all .      ptaclusp looked over his shoulder  and nodded slowly .      funny  that     he said .     bit of structural instability there .         dad  it   s a pyramid .  we should have flared it .  i told you .  the forces involved  well  it   s just too        a shadow fell across them .  they looked around .  they looked up .  they looked up a bit more .      oh  my     said ptaclusp .     it   s hat  the vulture headed god          ephebe lay beyond them  a classical poem of white marble lazing around its rock on a bay of brilliant blue        what   s that .     said ptraci  after studying it critically for some time .      it   s the sea     said teppic .     i told you  remember .  waves and things .         you said it was all green and rough .         sometimes it is .         hmm .     the tone of voice suggested that she disapproved of the sea but  before she could explain why  they heard the sound of voices raised in anger .  they were coming from behind a nearby sand dune .   there was a notice on the dune .   it said  in several languages  axiom testing station .   below it  in slightly smaller writing  it added  caution unresolved postulates .   as they read it  or at least as teppic read it and ptraci didn   t  there was a twang from behind the dune  followed by a click  followed by an arrow zipping overhead .  you bastard glanced up at it briefly and then turned his head and stared fixedly at a very small area of sand .   a second later the arrow thudded into it .   then he tested the weight on his feet and did a small calculation which revealed that two people had been subtracted from his back .  further summation indicated that they had been added to the dune .      what did you do that for .     said ptraci  spitting out sand .      someone fired at us .         i shouldn   t think so .  i mean  they didn   t know we were here  did they .  you needn   t have pulled me off like that .      teppic conceded this  rather reluctantly  and eased himself cautiously up the sliding surface of the dune .  the voices were arguing again      give in .         we simply haven   t got all the parameters right .         i know what we haven   t got all right .         what is that  pray .         we haven   t got anymore bloody tortoises .  that   s what we haven   t got .      teppic carefully poked his head over the top of the dune .  he saw a large cleared area  surrounded by complicated ranks of markers and flags .  there were one or two buildings in it  mostly consisting of cages  and several other intricate constructions he could not recognize .  in the middle of it all were two men   one small  fat and florid  the other tall and willowy and with an indefinable air of authority .  they were wearing sheets .  clustered around them  and not wearing very much at all  was a group of slaves .  one of them was holding a bow .   several of them were holding tortoises on sticks .  they looked a bit pathetic  like tortoise lollies .      anyway  it   s cruel     said the tall man .     poor little things .  they look so sad with their little legs waggling .         it   s logically impossible for the arrow to hit them .     the fat man threw up his hands .     it shouldn   t do it .  you must be giving me the wrong type of tortoise     he added accusingly .     we ought to try again with faster tortoises .         or slower arrows .         possibly  possibly .      teppic was aware of a faint scuffling by his chin .  there was a small tortoise scurrying past him .  it had several ricochet marks on its shell .      we   ll have one last try     said the fat man .  he turned to the slaves .     you lot   go and find that tortoise .      the little reptile gave teppic a look of mingled pleading and hope .  he stared at it  and then lifted it up carefully and tucked it behind a rock .   he slid back down the dune to ptraci .      there   s something really weird going on over there     he said .     they   re shooting tortoises .         why .         search me .  they seem to think the tortoise ought to be able to run away .         what  from an arrow .         like i said .  really weird .  you stay here .  i   ll whistle if it   s safe to follow me .         what will you do if it isn   t safe .         scream .      he climbed the dune again and  after brushing as much sand as possible off his clothing  stood up and waved his cap at the little crowd .  an arrow took it out of his hands .      oops .     said the fat man .     sorry .      he scurried across the trampled sand to where teppic was standing and staring at his stinging fingers .      just had it in my hand     he panted .     many apologies  didn   t realize it was loaded .  whatever will you think of me .      teppic took a deep breath .      xeno   s the name     gasped the fat man  before he could speak .     are you hurt .  we did put up warning signs  i   m sure .  did you come in over the desert .  you must be thirsty .  would you like a drink .  who are you .  you haven   t seen a tortoise up there  have you .  damned fast things  go like greased thunderbolts  there   s no stopping the little buggers .      teppic deflated again .      tortoises .     he said .     are we talking about those  you know  stones on legs .         that   s right  that   s right     said xeno .     take your eyes off them for a second  and vazoom .         vazoom .     said teppic .  he knew about tortoises .  there were tortoises in the old kingdom .  they could be called a lot of things   vegetarians  patient  thoughtful  even extremely diligent and persistent sex maniacs   but never  up until now  fast .  fast was a word particularly associated with tortoises because they were not it .      are you sure .     he said .      fastest animal on the face of the disc  your common tortoise     said xeno  but he had the grace to look shifty .     logically  that is     he added .   .   the tall man gave teppic a nod .      take no notice of him  boy     he said .     he   s just covering himself because of the accident last week .         the tortoise did beat the hare     said xeno sulkily .      the hare was dead  xeno     said the tall man patiently .     because you shot it .         i was aiming at the tortoise .  you know  trying to combine two experiments  cut down on expensive research time  make full use of available       xeno gestured with the bow  which now had another arrow in it .      excuse me     said teppic .     could you put it down a minute .  me and my friend have come a long way and it would be nice not to be shot at again .      these two seem harmless  he thought  and almost believed it .   he whistled .  on cue  ptraci came around the dune  leading you bastard .  teppic doubted the capability of her costume to hold any pockets whatsoever  but she seemed to have been able to repair her make up  re kohl her eyes and put up her hair .  she undulated toward the group like a snake in a skid  determined to hit the strangers with the full force of her personality .  she was also holding something in her other hand .      she   s found the tortoise .     said xeno .     well done .      the reptile shot back into its shell .  ptraci glared .  she didn   t have much in the world except herself  and didn   t like to be hailed as a mere holder of testudinoids .   the tall man sighed .     you know  xeno     he said     i can   t help thinking you   ve got the wrong end of the stick with this whole tortoise and arrow business .      the little man glared at him .      the trouble with you  ibid     he said     is that you think you   re the biggest bloody authority on everything .        the gods of the old kingdom were awakening .   belief is a force .  it   s a weak force  by comparison with gravity  when it comes to moving mountains  gravity wins every time .  but it still exists  and now that the old kingdom was enclosed upon itself  floating free of the rest of the universe  drifting away from the general consensus that is dignified by the name of reality  the power of belief was making itself felt .   for seven thousand years the people of djelibeybi had believed in their gods .   now their gods existed .  they had  as it were  the complete set .   and the people of the old kingdom were learning that  for example  vut the dog headed god of the evening looks a lot better painted on a pot than he does when all seventy feet of him  growling and stinking  is lurching down the street outside .   dios sat in the throne room  the gold mask of the king on his knees  staring out across the somber air .  the cluster of lesser priests around the door finally plucked up the courage to approach him  in the same general frame of mind as you would approach a growling lion .  no one is more worried by the actual physical manifestation of a god than his priests  it   s like having the auditors in unexpectedly .   only koomi stood a little aside from the others .  he was thinking hard .  strange and original thoughts were crowding along rarely trodden neural pathways  heading in unthinkable directions .  he wanted to see where they led .      o dios     murmured the high priest of ket  the ibis headed god of justice .     what is the king   s command .  the gods are striding the land  and they are fighting and breaking houses  o dios .  where is the king .  what would he have us do .         yea     said the high priest of scrab  the pusher of the ball of the sun .  he felt something more was expected of him .     and verily     he added     your lordship will have noticed that the sun is wobbling  because all the gods of the sun are fighting for it and       he shuffled his feet      the blessed scrab made a strategic withdrawal and has  er  made an unscheduled landing on the town of hort .  a number of buildings broke his fall .         and rightly so     said the high priest of thrrp  the charioteer of the sun .     for  as all know  my master is the true god of the        his words tailed off .   dios was trembling  his body rocking slowly back and forth .  his eyes stared at nothing .  his hands gripped the mask almost hard enough to leave fingerprints in the gold  and his lips soundlessly shaped the words of the ritual of the second hour  which had been said at this time for thousands of years .      i think it   s the shock     said one of the priests .     you know  he   s always been so set in his ways .      the others hastened to show that there was at least something they could advise on .      fetch him a glass of water .         put a paper bag over his head .         sacrifice a chicken under his nose .      there was a high pitched whistling noise  the distant crump of an explosion  and a long hissing .  a few tendrils of steam curled into the room .   the priests rushed to the balcony  leaving dios in his unnerving pool of trauma  and found that the crowds around the palace were staring at the sky .      it would appear     said the high priest of cephut  god of cutlery  who felt that he could take a more relaxed view of the immediate situation     that thrrp has fumbled it and has fallen to a surprise tackle from jeht  boatman of the solar orb .      there was a distant buzzing  as of several billion blue bottles taking off in a panic  and a huge dark shape passed over the palace .      but     said the high priest of cephut     here comes scrab again   yes  he   s gaining height   jeht hasn   t seen him yet  he   s progressing confidently toward the meridian   and here comes sessifet  goddess of the afternoon .  this is a surprise .  what a surprise this is .  a young goddess  yet to make her mark  but my word  what a lot of promise there  this is an astonishing bid  eunuchs and gentlemen  and   yes   scrab has fumbled it .  he   s fumbled it .         the shadows danced and spun on the stones of the balcony .         and   what   s this .  the elder gods are  there   s no other word for it  they   re cooperating against these brash newcomers .  but plucky young sessifet is hanging in there  she   s exploiting the weakness   she   s in .    and pulling away now  pulling away  gil and scrab appear to be fighting  she   s got a clear sky and  yes  yes   yes .    it   s noon .  it   s noon .  it   s noon .      silence .  the priest was aware that everyone was staring at him .   then someone said     why are you shouting into that bulrush .         sorry .  don   t know what came over me there .      the priestess of sarduk  goddess of caves  snorted at him .      suppose one of them had dropped it .     she snapped .      but   but       he swallowed .     it   s not possible  is it .  not really .  we all must have eaten something  or been out in the sun too long  or something .  because  i mean  everyone knows that the gods aren   t   i mean  the sun is a big flaming ball of gas  isn   t it  that goes around the whole world every day  and  and  and the gods   well  you know  there   s a very real need in people to believe  don   t get me wrong here        koomi  even with his head buzzing with thoughts of perfidy  was quicker on the uptake than his colleagues .      get him  lads .     he shouted .   four priests grabbed the luckless cutlery worshipper by his arms and legs and gave him a high speed run across the stones to the edge of the balcony  over the parapet and into the mud colored waters of the djel .   he surfaced  spluttering .      what did you go and do that for .     he demanded .     you all know i   m right .  none of you really        the waters of the djel opened a lazy jaw  and he vanished  just as the huge winged shape of scrab buzzed threateningly over the palace and whirred off toward the mountains .   koomi mopped his forehead .      bit of a close shave there     he said .  his colleagues nodded  staring at the fading ripples .  suddenly  djelibeybi was no place for honest doubt .  honest doubt could get you seriously picked up and your arms and legs torn off .      er     said one of them .     cephut   s going to be a bit upset  though  isn   t he .         all hail cephut     they chorused .  just in case .      don   t see why     grumbled an elderly priest at the back of the crowd .     bloody knife and fork artist .      they grabbed him  still protesting  and hurled him into the river .      all hail       they paused .     who was he high priest of  anyway .         bunu  the goat headed god of goats .  wasn   t he .         all hail bunu  probably     they chorused  as the sacred crocodiles homed in like submarines .   koomi raised his hands  imploring .  it is said that the hour brings forth the man .  he was the kind of man that is brought forth by devious and unpleasant hours  and underneath his bald head certain conclusions were beginning to unfold  like things imprisoned for years inside stones .  he wasn   t yet sure what they were  but they were broadly on the subject of gods  the new age  the need for a firm hand on the helm  and possibly the inserting of dios into the nearest crocodile .  the mere thought filled him with forbidden delight .      brethren .     he cried .      excuse me     said the priestess of sarduk .      and sistren           thank you .            let us rejoice .     the assembled priests stood in total silence .  this was a radical approach which had not hitherto occurred to them .  and koomi looked at their upturned faces and felt a thrill the like of which he had never experienced before .  they were frightened out of their wits  and they were expecting him   him   to tell them what to do .      yea .     he said .     and  indeed  verily  the hour of the gods              and goddesses              yes  and goddesses  is at hand .  er .      what next .  what  when you got right down to it  was he going to tell them to do .  and then he thought  it doesn   t matter .  provided i sound confident enough .  old dios always drove them  he never tried to lead them .  without him they   re wandering around like sheep .      and  brethren   and sistren  of course   we must ask ourselves  we must ask ourselves  we  er  yes .     his voice waxed again with new confidence .     yes  we must ask ourselves why the gods are at hand .  and without doubt it is because we have not been assiduous enough in our worship  we have  er  we have lusted after graven idols .      the priests exchanged glances .  had they .  how did you do it  actually .      and  yes  and what about sacrifices .  time was when a sacrifice was a sacrifice  not some messing around with a chicken and flowers .      this caused some coughing in the audience .      are we talking maidens here .     said one of the priests uncertainly .      ahem .         and inexperienced young men too  certainly     he said quickly .  sarduk was one of the older goddesses  whose female worshippers got up to no good in sacred groves  the thought of her wandering around the landscape somewhere  bloody to the elbows  made the eyes water .   koomi   s heart thumped .     well  why not .     he said .     things were better then  weren   t they .         but  er  i thought we stopped all that sort of thing .  population decline and so forth .      there was a monstrous splash out in the river .  tzut  the snake headed god of the upper djel  surfaced and regarded the assembled priesthood solemnly .  then fhez  the crocodile headed god of the lower djel  erupted beside him and made a spirited attempt at biting his head off .  the two submerged in a column of spray and a minor tidal wave which slopped over the balcony .      ah  but maybe the population declined because we stopped sacrificing virgins   of both sexes  of course     said koomi  hurriedly .     have you ever thought of it like that .      they thought of it .  then they thought of it again .      i don   t think the king would approve       said one of the priests cautiously .      the king .     shouted koomi .     where is the king .  show me the king .  ask dios where the king is .      there was a thud by his feet .  he looked down in horror as the gold mask bounced  and rolled toward the priests .  they scattered hurriedly  like skittles .   dios strode out into the light of the disputed sun  his face gray with fury .      the king is dead     he said .   koomi swayed under the sheer pressure of anger  but rallied magnificently .      then his successor       he began .      there is no successor     said dios .  he stared up at the sky .  few people can look directly at the sun  but under the venom of dios   s gaze the sun itself might have flinched and looked away .  dios   s eyes sighted down that fearsome nose like twin range finders .   to the air in general he said     coming here as if they own the place .  how dare they .      koomi   s mouth dropped open .  he started to protest  and a kilowatt stare silenced him .   koomi sought support from the crowd of priests  who were busily inspecting their nails or staring intently into the middle distance .  the message was clear .  he was on his own .  although  if by some chance he won the battle of wills  he   d be surrounded by people assuring him that they had been behind him all along .      anyway  they do own the place     he mumbled .      what .         they  er  they do own the place  dios     koomi repeated .  his temper gave out .     they   re the sodding gods  dios .         they   re our gods     dios hissed .     we   re not their people .  they   re my gods and they will learn to do as they are instructed .      koomi gave up the frontal assault .  you couldn   t outstare that sapphire stare  you couldn   t stand the war axe nose and  most of all  no man could be expected to dent the surface of dios   s terrifying righteousness .      but        he managed .   dios waved him into silence with a trembling hand .      they   ve no right .     he said .     i did not give any orders .  they have no right .         then what are you going to do .  said koomi .   dios   s hands opened and closed fitfully .  he felt like a royalist might feel   a good royalist  a royalist who cut out pictures of all the royals and stuck them in a scrapbook  a royalist who wouldn   t hear a word said about them  they did such a good job and they can   t answer back   if suddenly all the royals turned up in his living room and started rearranging the furniture .  he longed for the necropolis  and the cool silence among his old friends  and a quick sleep after which he   d be able to think so much more clearly     koomi   s heart leapt .  dios   s discomfort was a crack which  with due care and attention  could take a wedge .  but you couldn   t use a hammer .  head on  dios could outfight the world .   the old man was shaking again .     i do not presume to tell them how to run affairs in the hereunder     he said .     they shall not presume to instruct me in how to run my kingdom .      koomi salted this treasonable statement away for further study and patted him gently on the back .      you   re right  of course     he said .  dios   s eyes swiveled .      i am .     he said  suspiciously .      i   m sure that  as the king   s minister  you will find a way .  you have our full support  o dios .     koomi waved an uplifted hand at the priests  who chorused wholehearted agreement .  if you couldn   t depend on kings and gods  you could always rely on old dios .  there wasn   t one of them that wouldn   t prefer the uncertain wrath of the gods to a rebuke from dios .  dios terrified them in a very positive  human way that no supernatural entity ever could .  dios would sort it out .      and we take no heed to these mad rumors about the king   s disappearance .  they are undoubtedly wild exaggerations  with no foundation     said koomi .   the priests nodded while  in each mind  a tiny rumor uncurled the length of its tail .      what rumors .     said dios out of the corner of his mouth .      so enlighten us  master  as to the path we must now take     said koomi .   dios wavered .   he did not know what to do .  for him  this was a new experience .  this was change .   all he could think of  all that was pressing forward in his mind  were the words of the ritual of the third hour  which he had said at this time for   how long .  too long  too long .    and he should have gone to his rest long before  but the time had never been right  there was never anyone capable  they would have been lost without him  the kingdom would founder  he would be letting everyone down  and so he   d crossed the river   he swore every time that it was the last  but it never was  not when the chill fetched his limbs  and the decades had become   longer .  and now  when his kingdom needed him  the words of a ritual had scored themselves into the pathways of his brain and bewildered all attempts at thought .      er     he said .     you bastard chewed happily .  teppic had tethered him too near an olive tree  which was getting a terminal pruning .  sometimes the camel would stop  gaze up briefly at the seagulls that circled everywhere above ephebe city  and subject them to a short  deadly burst of olive stones .   he was turning over in his mind an interesting new concept in thau dimensional physics which unified time  space  magnetism  gravity and  for some reason  broccoli .  periodically he would make noises like distant quarry blasting  but which merely indicated that all stomachs were functioning perfectly .   ptraci sat under the tree  feeding the tortoise on vine leaves .   heat crackled off the white walls of the tavern but  teppic thought  how different it was from the old kingdom .  there even the heat was old  the air was musty and lifeless  it pressed like a vice  you felt it was made of boiled centuries .  here it was leavened by the breeze from the sea .  it was edged with salt crystals .  it carried exciting hints of wine  more than a hint in fact  because xeno was already on his second amphora .  this was the kind of place where things rolled up their sleeves and started .      but i still don   t understand about the tortoise     he said  with some difficulty .  he   d just taken his first mouthful of ephebian wine  and it had apparently varnished the back of his throat .         s quite simple     said xeno .     look  let   s say this olive stone is the arrow and this  and this       he cast around aimlessly      and this stunned seagull is the tortoise  right .  now  when you fire the arrow it goes from here to the seag   the tortoise  am i right .         i suppose so  but           but  by this time  the seagu   the tortoise has moved on a bit  hasn   t he .  am i right .         i suppose so     said teppic  helplessly .  xeno gave him a look of triumph .      so the arrow has to go a bit further  doesn   t it  to where the tortoise is now .  meanwhile the tortoise has flow   moved on  not much  i   ll grant you  but it doesn   t have to be much .  am i right .  so the arrow has a bit further to go  but the point is that by the time it gets to where the tortoise is now the tortoise isn   t there .  so  if the tortoise keeps moving  the arrow will never hit it .  it   ll keep getting closer and closer but never hit it .  qed .         are you right .     said teppic automatically .      no     said ibid coldly .     there   s a dozen tortoise kebabs to prove him wrong .  the trouble with my friend here is that he doesn   t know the difference between a postulate and a metaphor of human existence .  or a hole in the ground .         it didn   t hit it yesterday     snapped xeno .      yes  i was watching .  you hardly pulled the string back .  i saw you     said ibid .   they started to argue again .   teppic stared into his wine mug .  these men are philosophers  he thought .  they had told him so .  so their brains must be so big that they have room for ideas that no one else would consider for five seconds .  on the way to the tavern xeno had explained to him  for example  why it was logically impossible to fall out of a tree .   teppic had described the vanishing of the kingdom  but he hadn   t revealed his position in it .  he hadn   t a lot of experience of these matters  but he had a very clear feeling that kings who hadn   t got a kingdom anymore were not likely to be very popular in neighboring countries .  there had been one or two like that in ankh morpork   deposed royalty  who had fled their suddenly dangerous kingdoms for ankh   s hospitable bosom carrying nothing but the clothes they stood up in and a few wagonloads of jewels .  the city  of course  welcomed anyone   regardless of race  color  class or creed   who had spending money in incredible amounts  but nevertheless the inhumation of surplus monarchs was a regular source of work for the assassins    guild .  there was always someone back home who wanted to be certain that deposed monarchs stayed that way .  it was usually a case of heir today  gone tomorrow .      i think it got caught up in geometry     he said  hopefully .     i heard you were very good at geometry here     he added     and perhaps you could tell me how to get back .         geometry is not my forte     said ibid .     as you probably know .         sorry .         haven   t you read my principles of ideal government .         i   m afraid not .         or my discourse on historical inevitability .         no .      ibid looked crestfallen .     oh     he said .      ibid is a well known authority on everything     said xeno .     except for geometry .  and interior decorating .  and elementary logic .     ibid glared at him .      what about you  then .     said teppic .   xeno drained his mug .     i   m more into the destruct testing of axioms     he said .     the chap you need is pthagonal .  a very acute man with an angle .      he was interrupted by the clatter of hooves .  several horsemen galloped with reckless speed past the tavern and on up the winding  cobbled streets of the city .  they seemed very excited about something .   ibid picked a stunned seagull out of his wine cup and laid it on the table .  he was looking thoughtful .      if the old kingdom has really disappeared       he said .      it has     said teppic firmly .     it   s not something you can be mistaken about  really .         then that means our border is concurrent with that of tsort     said ibid ponderously .      pardon .     said teppic .      there   s nothing between us     explained the philosopher .     oh  dear .  that means we shall be forced to make war .         why .      ibid opened his mouth  stopped  and turned to xeno .      why does it mean we   ll be forced to make war .     he said .      historical imperative     said xeno .      ah  yes .  i knew it was something like that .  i am afraid it is inevitable .  it   s a shame  but there you are .      there was another clatter as another party of horsemen rounded the corner  heading downhill this time .  they wore the high plumed helmets of ephebian soldiery  and were shouting enthusiastically .   ibid settled himself more comfortably on the bench and folded his hands .      that   ll be the tyrant   s men     he said  as the troop galloped through the city gates and out onto the desert .     he   s sending them to check  you may depend upon it .      teppic knew about the enmity between ephebe and tsort  of course .  the old kingdom had profited mightily by it  by seeing that the merchants of both sides had somewhere discreet in which to trade with one another .  he drummed his fingers on the table .      you haven   t fought each other for thousands of years     he said .     you were tiny countries in those days .  it was just a scrap .  now you   re huge .  people could get hurt .  doesn   t that worry you .         it   s a matter of pride     said ibid  but his voice was tinged with uncertainty .     i don   t think there   s much choice .         it was that bloody wooden cow or whatever     said xeno .     they   ve never forgiven us for it .         if we don   t attack them  they   ll attack us first     said ibid .         s   right     said xeno .     so we   d better retaliate before they have a chance to strike .      the two philosophers stared uncomfortably at one another .      on the other hand     said ibid     war makes it very difficult to think straight .         there is that     xeno agreed .     especially for dead people .      there was an embarrassed silence  broken only by ptraci   s voice singing to the tortoise and the occasional squeak of stricken seagulls .      what day is it .     said ibid .      tuesday     said teppic .      i think     said ibid     that it might be a good idea if you came to the symposium .  we have one every tuesday     he added .     all the greatest minds in ephebe will be there .  all this needs thinking about .      he glanced at ptraci .      however     he said     your young woman cannot attend  naturally .  females are absolutely forbidden .  their brains overheat .        king teppicymon xxvii opened his eyes .  it   s bloody dark in here  he thought .   and he realized that he could hear his own heart beating  but muffled  and some way off .   and then he remembered .   he was alive .  he was alive again .  and  this time  he was in bits .   somehow  he   d assumed that you got assembled again once you got to the netherworld  like one of grinjer   s kits .   get a grip on yourself  man  he thought .   it   s up to you to pull yourself together .   right  he thought .  there were at least six jars .  so my eyes are in one of them .  getting the lid off would be favorite  so we can see what we   re at .   that   s going to involve arms and legs and fingers .   this is going to be really tricky .   he reached out  tentatively  with stiff joints  and located something heavy .  it felt as though it might give  so he moved his other arm into position  with a great deal of awkwardness  and pushed .   there was a distant thump  and a definite feeling of openness above him .  he sat up  creaking all the way .   the sides of the ceremonial casket still hemmed him in  but to his surprise he found that one slow arm movement brushed them out of the way like paper .  must be all the pickle and stuffing  he thought .  gives you a bit of weight .   he felt his way to the edge of the slab  lowered his heavy legs to the ground and  after a pause out of habit to wheeze a bit  took the first tottering lurch of the newly un dead .   it is astonishingly difficult to walk with legs full of straw when the brain doing the directing is in a pot ten feet away  but he made it as far as the wall and felt his way along it until a crash indicated that he   d reached the shelf of jars .  he fumbled the lids of the first one and dipped his hand gently inside .   it must be brains  he thought manically  because semolina doesn   t squidge like that .  i   ve collected my own thoughts  haha .   he tried one or two more jars until an explosion of daylight told him he   d found the one with his eyes in it .  he watched his own bandaged hand reach down  growing gigantic  and scoop them up carefully .   that seems to be the important bits  he thought .  the rest can wait until later .  maybe when i need to eat something  and so forth .   he turned around  and realized that he was not alone .  dil and gern were watching him .  to squeeze any further into the far corner of the room  they would have needed triangular backbones .      ah .  ho there  good people     said the king  aware that his voice was a little hollow .     i know so much about you  i   d like to shake you by the hand .     he looked down .     only they   re rather full at the moment     he added .      gkkk     said gern .      you couldn   t do a bit of reassembly  could you .     said the king  turning to dil .     your stitches seem to be holding up nicely  by the way .  well done  that man .      professional pride broke through the barrier of dil   s terror .      you   re alive .     he said .      that was the general idea  wasn   t it .     said the king .   dil nodded .  certainly it was .  he   d always believed it to be true .  he   d just never expected it ever actually to happen .  but it had  and the first words  well  nearly the first words that had been said were in praise of his needlework .  his chest swelled .  no one else in the guild had ever been congratulated on their work by a recipient .      there     he said to gern  whose shoulderblades were making a spirited attempt to dig their way through the wall .     hear what has been said to your master .      the king paused .  it was beginning to dawn on him that things weren   t quite right here .  of course the netherworld was like this world  only better  and no doubt there were plenty of servants and so forth .  but it seemed altogether far too much like this world .  he was pretty sure that dil and gern shouldn   t be in it yet .  anyway  he   d always understood that the common people had their own netherworld  where they would be more at ease and could mingle with their own kind and wouldn   t feel awkward and socially out of place .      i say     he said .     i may have missed a bit here .  you   re not dead  are you .      dil didn   t answer immediately .  some of the things he   d seen so far today had made him a bit uncertain on the subject .  in the end  though  he was forced to admit that he probably was alive .      then what   s happening .     said the king .      we don   t know  o king     said dil .     really we don   t .  it   s all come true  o font of waters .         what has .         everything .         everything .         the sun  o lord .  and the gods .  oh  the gods .  they   re everywhere  o master of heaven .         we came in through the back way     said gern  who had dropped to his knees .     forgive us  o lord of justice  who has come back to deliver his mighty wisdom and that .  i am sorry about me and glwenda  it was a moment of wossname  mad passion  we couldn   t control ourselves .  also  it was me        dil waved him into a devout silence .      excuse me     he said to the king   s mummy .     but could we have a word away from the lad .  man to           corpse .     said the king  trying to make it easy for him .     certainly .      they wandered over to the other side of the room .      the fact is  o gracious king of       dil began  in a conspiratorial whisper .      i think we can dispense with all that     said the king briskly .     the dead don   t stand on ceremony .     king    will be quite sufficient .         the fact is  then   king     said dil  experiencing a slight thrill at this equitable treatment     young gern thinks it   s all his fault .  i   ve told him over and over again that the gods wouldn   t go to all this trouble just because of one growing lad with urges  if you catch my drift .     he paused  and added carefully     they wouldn   t  would they .         shouldn   t think so for one minute     said the king briskly .     we   d never see the back of them  otherwise .         that   s what i told him     said dil  immensely relieved .     he   s a good boy  sir  it   s just that his mum is a bit funny about religion .  we   d never see the back of them  those were my very words .  i   d be very grateful if you could have a word with him  sir  you know  set his mind at rest           be happy to     said the king graciously .   dil sidled closer .      the fact is  sir  these gods  sir  they aren   t right .  we   ve been watching  sir .  at least  i have .  i climbed on the roof .  gern didn   t  he hid under the bench .  they   re not right  sir .         what   s wrong with them .         well  they   re here  sir .  that   s not right  is it .  i mean  not to be really here .  and they   re just striding around and fighting among themselves and shouting at people .     he looked both ways before continuing .     between you and me  sir     he said     they don   t seem too bright .      the king nodded .     what are the priests doing about this .     he said .      i saw them throwing one another in the river  sir .      the king nodded again .     that sounds about right     he said .     they   ve come to their senses at last .         you know what i think  sir .     said dil earnestly .     everything we believe is coming true .  and i heard something else  sir .  this morning  if it was this morning  you understand  because the sun   s all over the place  sir  and it   s not the right sort of sun  but this morning some of the soldiers tried to get out along the ephebe road  sir  and do you know what they found .         what did they find .         the road out  sir  leads in .     dil took a step backward the better to illustrate the seriousness of the revelations .     they got up into the rocks and then suddenly they were walking down the tsort road .  it all sort of curves back on itself .  we   re shut in  sir .  shut in with our gods .      and i   m shut in my body  thought the king .  everything we believe is true .  and what we believe isn   t what we think we believe .   i mean  we think we believe that the gods are wise and just and powerful  but what we really believe is that they are like our father after a long day .  and we think we believe the netherworld is a sort of paradise  but we really believe it   s right here and you go to it in your body and i   m in it and i   m never going to get away .  never  ever .      what   s my son got to say about all this .     he said .   dil coughed .  it was the ominous cough .  the spanish use an upside down question mark to tell you what you   re about to hear is a question  this was the kind of cough that tells you what you   re about to hear is a dirge .      don   t know how to tell you this  sir     he said .      out with it  man .         sir  they say he   s dead  sir .  they say he killed himself and ran away .         killed himself .         sorry  sir .         and ran away afterward .         on a camel  they say .         we lead an active afterlife in our family  don   t we .     observed the king dryly .      beg pardon  sir .         i mean  the two statements could be held to be mutually exclusive .      dil   s face became a well meaning blank .      that is to say  they can   t both be true     supplied the king  helpfully .      ahem     said dil .      yes  but i   m a special case     said the king testily .     in this kingdom we believe you live after death only if you   ve been mumm        he stopped .   it was too horrible to think about .  he thought about it  nevertheless  for some time .   then he said     we must do something about it .      dil said     your son  sir .         never mind about my son  he   s not dead  i   d know about it     snapped the king .     he can look after himself  he   s my son .  it   s my ancestors i   m worried about .         but they   re dead       dil began .   it has already been remarked that dil had a very poor imagination .  in a job like his a poor imagination was essential .  but his mind   s eye opened on a panorama of pyramids  stretching along the river  and his mind   s ear swooped and curved through solid doors that no thief could penetrate .   and it heard the scrabbling .   and it heard the hammering .   and it heard the muffled shouting .   the king put a bandaged arm over his trembling shoulders .      i know you   re a good man with a needle  dil     he said .     tell me   how are you with a sledgehammer .        copolymer  the greatest storyteller in the history of the world  sat back and beamed at the greatest minds in the world  assembled at the dining table .   teppic had added another iota to his store of new knowledge .     symposium    meant a knife and fork tea .      well     said copolymer  and launched into the story of the tsortean wars .      you see  what happened was  he   d taken her back home  and her father   this wasn   t the old king  this was the one before  the one with the wossname  he married some girl from over elharib way  she had a squint  what was her name now  began with a p .  or an l .  one of them letters  anyway .  her father owned an island out on the bay there  papylos i think it was .  no  i tell a lie  it was crinix .  anyway  the king  the other king  he raised an army and they   elenor  that was her name .  she had a squint  you know .  but quite attractive  they say .  when i say married  i trust i do not have to spell it out for you .  i mean  it was a bit unofficial .  er .  anyway  there was this wooden horse and after they   d got in   did i tell you about this horse .  it was a horse .  i   m pretty sure it was a horse .  or maybe it was a chicken .  forget my own name next .  it was wossname   s idea  the one with the limp .  yes .  the limp in his leg  i mean .  did i mention him .  there   d been this fight .  no  that was the other one  i think .  yes .  anyway  this wooden pig  damn clever idea  they made it out of thing .  tip of my tongue .  wood .  but that was later  you know .  the fight .  nearly forgot the fight .  yes .  damn good fight .  everyone banging on their shields and yelling .  wossname   s armor shone like shining armor .  fight and a half  that fight .  between thingy  not the one with the limp  the other one  wossname  had red hair .  you know .  tall fellow  talked with a lisp .  hold on  just remembered  he was from some other island .  not him .  the other one  with the limp .  didn   t want to go  he said he was mad .  of course  he was bloody mad  definitely .  i mean  a wooden cow .  like wossname said  the king  no  not that king  the other one  he saw the goat  he said     i fear the ephebians  especially when they   re mad enough to leave bloody great wooden livestock on the doorstep  talk about nerve  they must think we was born yesterday  set fire to it     and  of course  wossname had nipped in around the back and put everyone to the sword  talk about laugh .  did i say she had a squint .  they said she was pretty  but it takes all sorts .  yes .  anyway  that   s how it happened .  now  of course  wossname   i think he was called melycanus  had a limp   he wanted to go home  well  you would  they   d been there for years  he wasn   t getting any younger .  that   s why he dreamed up the thing about the wooden wossname .  yes .  i tell a lie  lavaelous was the one with the knee .  pretty good fight  that fight  take it from me .      he lapsed into self satisfied silence .      pretty good fight     he mumbled and  smiling faintly  dropped off to sleep .   teppic was aware that his own mouth was hanging open .  he shut it .  along the table several of the diners were wiping their eyes .      magic     said xeno .     sheer magic .  every word a tassel on the canopy of time .         it   s the way he remembers every tiny detail .  pinsharp     murmured ibid .   teppic looked down the length of the table  and then nudged xeno beside him .     who is everyone .     he said .      well  ibid you already know .  and copolymer .  over there  that   s iesope  the greatest teller of fables in the world .  and that   s antiphon  the greatest writer of comic plays in the world .         where is pthagonal .     said teppic .  xeno pointed to the far end of the table  where a glum looking  heavy drinking man was trying to determine the angle between two bread rolls .     i   ll introduce you to him afterward     he said .   teppic looked around at the bald heads and long white beards  which seemed to be a badge of office .  if you had a bald head and a long white beard  they seemed to indicate  whatever lay between them must be bursting with wisdom .  the only exception was antiphon  who looked as though he was built of pork .   they are great minds  he told himself .  these are men who are trying to work out how the world fits together  not by magic  not by religion  but just by inserting their brains in whatever crack they can find and trying to lever it apart .   ibid rapped on the table for silence .      the tyrant has called for war on tsort     he said .     now  let us consider the place of war in the ideal republic     he said .     we would require           excuse me  could you just pass me the celery .     said iesope .     thank you .            the ideal republic  as i was saying  based on the fundamental laws that govern           and the salt .  it   s just by your elbow .            the fundamental laws  that is  which govern all men .  now  it is without doubt true that war   could you stop that  please .         it   s celery     said iesope  crunching cheerfully .     you can   t help it with celery .      xeno peered suspiciously at what was on his fork .      here  this is squid     he said .     i didn   t ask for squid .  who ordered squid .            without doubt     repeated ibid  raising his voice     without doubt  i put it to you           i think this is the lamb couscous     said antiphon .      was yours the squid .         i asked for marida and dolmades .         i ordered the lamb .  just pass it along  will you .         i don   t remember anyone asking for all this garlic bread     said xeno .      look  some of us are trying to float a philosophical concept here     said ibid sarcastically .     don   t let us interrupt you  will you .      someone threw a breadstick at him .   teppic looked at what was on his fork .  seafood was unknown in the kingdom  and what was on his fork had too many valves and suckers to be reassuring .  he lifted a boiled vine leaf with extreme care  and was sure he saw something scuttle behind an olive .   ah .  something else to remember  then .  the ephebians made wine out of anything they could put in a bucket  and ate anything that couldn   t climb out of one .   he pushed the food around on his plate .  some of it pushed back .   and philosophers didn   t listen to one another .  and they don   t stick to the point .  this probably is mocracy at work .   a bread roll bounced past him .  oh  and they get overexcited .   he noticed a skinny little man sitting opposite him  chewing primly on some anonymous tentacle .  apart from pthagonal the geometrician  who was now gloomily calculating the radius of his plate  he was the only person not speaking his mind at the top of his voice .  sometimes he   d make little notes on a piece of parchment and slip it into his toga .   teppic leaned across .  further down the table iesope  encouraged by occasional olive stones and bread rolls  started a long fable about a fox  a turkey  a goose and a wolf  who had a wager to see who could stay longest underwater with heavy weights tied to their feet .      excuse me     said teppic  raising his voice above the din .     who are you .      the little man gave him a shy look .  he had extremely large ears .  in a certain light  he could have been mistaken for a very thin jug .      i   m endos     he said .      why aren   t you philosophizing .      endos sliced a strange mollusc .      i   m not a philosopher  actually     he said .      or a humorous playwright or something .     said teppic .      i   m afraid not .  i   m a listener .  endos the listener  i   m known as .         that   s fascinating     said teppic automatically .     what does that involve .         listening .         just listening .         that   s what they pay me for     said endos .     sometimes i nod .  or smile .  or nod and smile at the same time .  encouragingly  you know .  they like that .      teppic felt he was called upon to comment at this point .     gosh     he said .   endos gave him an encouraging nod  and a smile that suggested that of all the things endos could be doing in the world right at this minute there was nothing so basically riveting as listening to teppic .  it was something about his ears .  they appeared to be a vast aural black hole  begging to be filled up with words .  teppic felt an overpowering urge to tell him all about his life and hopes and dreams        i bet     he said     that they pay you an awful lot of money .      endos gave him a heartening smile .      have you listened to copolymer tell his story lots of times .      endos nodded and smiled  although there was a faint trace of pain right behind his eyes .      i expect     said teppic     that your ears develop protective rough surfaces after a while .      endos nodded .     do go on     he urged .   teppic glanced across at pthagonal  who was moodily drawing right angles in his taramasalata .      i   d love to stay and listen to you listening to me all day     he said .     but there   s a man over there i   d like to see .         that   s amazing     said endos  making a short note and turning his attention to a conversation further along the table .  a philosopher had averred that although truth was beauty  beauty was not necessarily truth  and a fight was breaking out .  endos listened carefully .    teppic wandered along the table to where pthagonal was sitting in unrelieved misery  and currently peering suspiciously over the crust of a pie .   teppic looked over his shoulder .      i think i saw something moving in there     he said .      ah     said the geometrician  taking the cork out of an amphora with his teeth .     the mysterious young man in black from the lost kingdom .         i was hoping you could help me find it again .     said teppic .     i heard that you have some very unusual ideas in ephebe .         it had to happen     said pthagonal .  he pulled a pair of dividers from the folds of his robe and measured the pie thoughtfully .     is it a constant  do you think .  it   s a depressing concept .         sorry .     said teppic .      the diameter divides into the circumference  you know .  it ought to be three times .  you   d think so  wouldn   t you .  but does it .  no .  three point one four one and lots of other figures .  there   s no end to the buggers .  do you know how pissed off that makes me .         i expect it makes you extremely pissed off     said teppic politely .      right .  it tells me that the creator used the wrong kind of circles .  it   s not even a proper number .  i mean  three point five  you could respect .  or three point three .  that   d look right .     he stared morosely at the pie .      excuse me  you said something about it had to happen .         what .     said pthagonal  from the depths of his gloom .     pie .     he added .      what had to happen .     teppic prompted .      you can   t mess with geometry  friend .  pyramids .  dangerous things .  asking for trouble .  i mean     pthagonal reached unsteadily for his wine cup     how long did they think they could go on building bigger and bigger pyramids for .  i mean  where did they think power comes from .  i mean     he hiccuped     you   ve been in that place  haven   t you .  ever noticed how slow it all seems to be .         oh  yes     said teppic flatly .      that   s because the time is sucked up  see .  pyramids .  so they have to flare it off .  flarelight  they call it .  they think it looks pretty .  it   s their time they   re burning off .         all i know is the air feels as though it   s been boiled in a sock     said teppic .     and nothing actually changes  even if it doesn   t stay the same .         right     said pthagonal .     the reason being  it   s past time .  they use up past time  over and over again .  the pyramids take all the new time .  and if you don   t let the pyramids flare  the power build up   ll       he paused .     i suppose     he went on     that it   d escape along a wossname  a fracture .  in space .         i was there before the kingdom  er  went     said teppic .     i thought i saw the big pyramid move .         there you are then .  it   s probably moved the dimensions around by ninety degrees     said pthagonal  with the assurance of the truly drunk .      you mean  so length is height and height is width .      pthagonal shook an unsteady finger .      nonono     he said .     so that length is height and height is breadth and breadth is width and width is       he burped      time .  s   nother dimessnon  see .  four of the bastards .  time   s one of them .  ninety thingys to the other three .  degrees is what i mean .  only  only  it can   t exist in this world like that  so the place had to sort of pop outside for a bit  see .  otherwise you   d have people getting older by walking sideways .     he looked sadly into the depths of his cup .     and every birthday you   d age another mile     he added .   teppic looked at him aghast .      that   s time and space for you     pthagonal went on .     you can twist them all over the place if you   re not careful .  three point one four one .  what sort of a number d   you call that .         it sounds horrible     said teppic .      damn right .  somewhere     pthagonal was beginning to sway on his bench     somewhere someone built a universe with a decent  respectable value of  of     he peered blankly at the table     of pie .  not some damn number that never comes to an end  what kind of           i meant  people getting older just by walking along .         i dunno  though .  you could have a stroll back to where you were eighteen .  or wander up and see what you are going to look like when you   re seventy .  traveling in width  though  that   d be the real trick .      pthagonal smiled vacantly and then  very slowly  keeled over into his dinner  some of which moved out of the way .    teppic became aware that the philosophic din around him had subsided a bit .  he stared along the line until he spotted ibid .      it won   t work     said ibid .     the tyrant won   t listen to us .  nor will the people .  anyway       he glanced at antiphon      we   re not all of one mind on the subject .         damn tsorteans need teaching a lesson     said antiphon sternly .     not room for two major powers on this continent .  damn bad sports  anyway  just because we stole their queen .  youthful high spirits  love will have its way        copolymer woke up .      you   ve got it wrong     he said mildly .     the great war  that was because they stole our queen .  what was her name now  face that launched a thousand camels  began with an a or a t or           did they .     shouted antiphon .     the bastards .         i   m reasonably certain     said copolymer .   teppic sagged  and turned to endos the listener .  he was still eating his dinner  with the air of one who is determined to preserve his digestion .      endos .      the listener laid his knife and fork carefully on either side of his plate .      yes .         they   re really all mad  aren   t they .     said teppic wearily .      that   s extremely interesting     said endos .     do go on .     he reached shyly into his toga and brought forth a scrap of parchment  which he pushed gently toward teppic .      what   s this .         my bill     said endos .     five minutes attentive listening .  most of my gentlemen have monthly accounts  but i understand you   ll be leaving in the morning .      teppic gave up .  he wandered away from the table and into the cold garden surrounding the citadel of ephebe .  white marble statues of ancient ephebians doing heroic things with no clothes on protruded through the greenery and  here and there  there were statues of ephebian gods .  it was hard to tell the difference .  teppic knew that dios had hard words to say about the ephebians for having gods that looked just like people .  if the gods looked just like everyone else  he used to say  how would people know how to treat them .   teppic had rather liked the idea .  according to legend the ephebians    gods were just like humans  except that they used their godhood to get up to things humans didn   t have the nerve to do .  a favorite trick of ephebian gods  he recalled  was turning into some animal in order to gain the favors of highly placed ephebian women .  and one of them had reputedly turned himself into a golden shower in pursuit of his intended .  all this raised interesting questions about everyday night life in sophisticated ephebe .   he found ptraci sitting on the grass under a poplar tree  feeding the tortoise .  he gave it a suspicious look  in case it was a god trying it on .  it did not look like a god .  if it was a god  it was putting on an incredibly good act .   she was feeding it a lettuce leaf .      dear little ptortoise     she said  and then looked up .     oh  it   s you     she said flatly .      you didn   t miss much     said teppic  sagging onto the grass .     they   re a bunch of maniacs .  when i left they were smashing the plates .         that   s ptraditional at the end of an ephebian meal     said ptraci .   teppic thought about this .     why not before .     he said .      and then they probably dance to the sound of the bourzuki     ptraci added .     i think it   s a sort of dog .      teppic sat with his head in his hands .      i must say you speak ephebian well     he said .      pthank you .         just a trace of an accent  though .         languages is part of the training     she said .     and my grandmother told me that a ptrace of foreign accent is more fascinating .         we learned the same thing     said teppic .     an assassin should always be slightly foreign  no matter where he is .  i   m good at that part     he added bitterly .   she began to massage his neck .      i went down to the harbor     she said .     there   s those things like big rafts  you know  camels of the sea           ships     said teppic .      and they go everywhere .  we could go anywhere we want .  the world is our pthing with pearls in it  if we like .      teppic told her about pthagonal   s theory .  she didn   t seem surprised .      like an old pond where no new water comes in     she observed .     so everyone goes around and around in the same old puddle .  all the ptime you live has been lived already .  it must be like other people   s bathwater .         i   m going to go back .      her fingers stopped their skilled kneading of his muscles .      we could go anywhere     she repeated .     we   ve got ptrades  we could sell that camel .  you could show me that ankh morpork place .  it sounds interesting .      teppic wondered what effect ankh morpork would have on the girl .  then he wondered what effect she would have on the city .  she was definitely   flowering .  back in the old kingdom she   d never apparently had any original thoughts beyond the choice of the next grape to peel  but since she was outside she seemed to have changed .  her jaw hadn   t changed  it was still quite small and  he had to admit  very pretty .  but somehow it was more noticeable .  she used to look at the ground when she spoke to him .  she still didn   t always look at him when she spoke to him  but now it was because she was thinking about something else .   he found he kept wanting to say  politely  without stressing it in any way  just as a very gentle reminder  that he was king .  but he had a feeling that she   d say she hadn   t heard  and would he please repeat it  and if she looked at him he   d never be able to say it twice .      you could go     he said .     you   d get on well .  i could give you a few names and addresses .         and what would you do .         i dread to think what   s going on back home     said teppic .     i ought to do something .         you can   t .  why ptry .  even if you didn   t want to be an assassin there   s lots of pthings you could do .  and you said the man said it   s not a place people could get into anymore .  i hate pyramids .         surely there   s people there you care about .      ptraci shrugged .     if they   re dead there   s nothing i can do about it     she said .     and if they   re alive  there   s nothing i can do about it .  so i shan   t .      teppic stared at her in a species of horrified admiration .  it was a beautiful summary of things as they were .  he just couldn   t bring himself to think that way .  his body had been away for seven years but his blood had been in the kingdom for a thousand times longer .  certainly he   d wanted to leave it behind  but that was the whole point .  it would have been there .  even if he   d avoided it for the rest of his life  it would have still been a sort of anchor .      i feel so wretched about it     he repeated .     i   m sorry .  that   s all there is to it .  even to go back for five minutes  just to say  well  that i   m not coming back .  that   d be enough .  it   s probably all my fault .         but there isn   t a way back .  you   ll just hang around sadly  like those deposed kings you ptold me about .  you know  with pthreadbare cloaks and always begging for their food in a high class way .  there   s nothing more useless than a king without a kingdom  you said .  just think about it .      they wandered through the sunset streets of the city  and toward the harbor .  all streets in the city led toward the harbor .   someone was just putting a torch to the lighthouse  which was one of the more than seven wonders of the world and had been built to a design by pthagonal using the golden rule and the five aesthetic principles .  unfortunately it had then been built in the wrong place because putting it in the right place would have spoiled the look of the harbor  but it was generally agreed by mariners to be a very beautiful lighthouse and something to look at while they were waiting to be towed off the rocks .   the harbor below it was thronged with ships .  teppic and ptraci picked their way past crates and bundles until they reached the long curved guard wall  harbor calm on one side  choppy with waves on the other .  above them the lighthouse flared and sparked .   those boats would be going to places he   d only ever heard of  he knew .  the ephebians were great traders .  he could go back to ankh and get his diploma  and then the world would indeed be the mollusc of his choice and he had any amount of knives to open it with .   ptraci put her hand in his .   and there   d be none of this marrying relatives business .  the months in djelibeybi already seemed like a dream  one of those circular dreams that you never quite seem able to shake off and which make insomnia an attractive prospect .  whereas here was a future  unrolling in front of him like a carpet .   what a chap needed at a time like this was a sign  some sort of book of instructions .  the trouble with life was that you didn   t get a chance to practice before doing it for real .  you only        good grief .  it   s teppic  isn   t it .      the voice was addressing him from ankle height .  a head appeared over the stone of the jetty  quickly followed by its body .  an extremely richly dressed body  one on which no expense had been spared in the way of gems  furs  silks and laces  provided that all of them  every single one  was black .   it was chidder .        what   s it doing now .     said ptaclusp .   his son poked his head cautiously over the ruins of a pillar and watched hat  the vulture headed god .      it   s sniffing around     he said .     i think it likes the statue .  honestly  dad  why did you have to go and buy a thing like that .         it was in a job lot     said ptaclusp .     anyway  i thought it would be a popular line .         with who .         well  he likes it .      ptaclusp iib risked another squint at the angular monstrosity that was still hopping around the ruins .      tell him he can have it if he goes away     he suggested .     tell him he can have it at cost .      ptaclusp winced .     at a discount     he said .     a special cut rate for our supernatural customers .      he stared up at the sky .  from their hiding place in the ruins of the construction camp  with the great pyramid still humming like a powerhouse behind them  they   d had an excellent view of the arrival of the gods .  at first he   d viewed them with a certain amount of equanimity .  gods would be good customers  they always wanted temples and statues  he could deal directly  cut out the middle man .   and then it had occurred to him that a god  when he was unhappy about the product  as it might be  maybe the plasterwork wasn   t exactly as per spec  or perhaps a corner of the temple was a bit low on account of unexpected quicksand  a god didn   t just come around demanding in a loud voice to see the manager .  no .  a god knew exactly where you were  and got to the point .  also  gods were notoriously bad payers .  so were humans  of course  but they didn   t actually expect you to die before they settled the account .   his gaze turned to his other son  a painted silhouette against the statue  his mouth a frozen o of astonishment  and ptaclusp reached a decision .      i   ve just about had it with pyramids     he said .     remind me  lad .  if we ever get out of here  no more pyramids .  we   ve got set in our ways .  time to branch out  i reckon .         that   s what i   ve been telling you for ages  dad .     said iib .     i   ve told you  a couple of decent aqueducts will make a tremendous           yes  yes  i remember     said ptaclusp .     yes .  aqueducts .  all those arches and things .  fine .  only i can   t remember where you said you have to put the coffin in .         dad .         don   t mind me  lad .  i think i   m going mad .      i couldn   t have seen a mummy and two men over there  carrying sledgehammers       it was  indeed  chidder .   and chidder had a boat .   teppic knew that further along the coast the seriph of al khali lived in the fabulous palace of the rhoxie  which was said to have been built in one night by a genie and was famed in myth and legend for its splendor .   the unnamed was the rhoxie afloat  but more so .  its designer had a gilt complex  and had tried every trick with gold paint  curly pillars and expensive drapes to make it look less like a ship and more like a boudoir that had collided with a highly suspicious type of theater .   in fact  you needed an assassin   s eyes for hidden detail to notice how innocently the gaudiness concealed the sleekness of the hull and the fact  even when you added the cabin space and the holds together  that there still seemed to be a lot of capacity unaccounted for .  the water around what ptraci called the pointed end was strangely rippled  but it would be totally ridiculous to suspect such an obvious merchantman of having a concealed ramming spike underwater  or that a mere five minutes    work with an ax would turn this wallowing alc  zar into something that could run away from nearly everything else afloat and make the few that could catch up seriously regret it .      very impressive     said teppic .      it   s all show  really     said chidder .      yes .  i can see that .         i mean  we   re poor traders .      teppic nodded .     the usual phrase is    poor but honest traders        he said .   chidder smiled a merchant   s smile .     oh  i think we   ll stick on    poor    at the moment .  how the hell are you  anyway .  last we heard you were going off to be king of some place no one   s ever heard of .  and who is this lovely young lady .         her na       teppic began .      ptraci     said ptraci .      she   s a han        teppic began .      she must surely be a royal princess     said chidder smoothly .     and it would give me the greatest pleasure if she  if indeed both of you  would dine with me tonight .  humble sailor   s fare  i   m afraid  but we muddle along  we muddle along .         not ephebian  is it .     said teppic .      ship   s biscuit  salt beef  that sort of thing     said chidder  without taking his eyes off ptraci .  they hadn   t left her since she came on board .   then he laughed .  it was the old familiar chidder laugh  not exactly without humor  but clearly well under the control of its owner   s higher brain centers .      what an astonishing coincidence     he said .     and us due to sail at dawn  too .  can i offer you a change of clothing .  you both look somewhat  er  travel stained .         rough sailor clothing  i expect     said teppic .     as befits a humble merchant  correct me if i   m wrong .      in fact teppic was shown to a small cabin as exquisitely and carefully furnished as a jeweled egg  where there was laid upon the bed as fine an assortment of clothing as could be found anywhere on the circle sea .  true  it all appeared secondhand  but carefully laundered and expertly stitched so that the sword cuts hardly showed at all .  he gazed thoughtfully at the hooks on the wall  and the faint patching on the wood which hinted that various things had once been hung there and hastily removed .   he stepped out into the narrow corridor  and met ptraci .  she   d chosen a red court dress such as had been the fashion in ankh morpork ten years previously  with puffed sleeves and vast concealed underpinnings and ruffs the size of millstones .   teppic learned something new  which was that attractive women dressed in a few strips of gauze and a few yards of silk can actually look far more desirable when fully clad from neck to ankle .  she gave an experimental twirl .      there are any amount of things like this in there     she said .     is this how women dress in ankh morpork .  it   s like wearing a house .  it doesn   t half make you sweaty .         look  about chidder     said teppic urgently .     i mean  he   s a good fellow and everything  but           he   s very kind  isn   t he     she agreed .      well .  yes .  he is     teppic admitted  hopelessly .     he   s an old friend .         that   s nice .      one of the crew materialized at the end of the corridor and bowed them into the state cabin  his air of old retainer ship marred only by the criss cross pattern of scars on his head and some tattoos that made the pictures in the shuttered palace look like illustrations in a diy shelving manual .  the things he could make them do by flexing his biceps could keep entire dockside taverns fascinated for hours  and he was not aware that the worst moment of his entire life was only a few minutes away .      this is all very pleasant     said chidder  pouring some wine .  he nodded at the tattooed man .     you may serve the soup  alfonz     he added .      look  chiddy  you   re not a pirate  are you .     said teppic  desperately .      is that what   s been worrying you .     chidder grinned his lazy grin .   it wasn   t everything that teppic had been worrying about  but it had been jockeying for top position .  he nodded .      no  we   re not .  we just prefer to  er  avoid paperwork wherever possible .  you know .  we don   t like people to have all the worry of having to know everything we do .         only there   s all the clothes           ah .  we get attacked by pirates a fair amount .  that   s why father had the unnamed built .  it always surprises them .  and the whole thing is morally sound .  we get their ship  their booty  and any prisoners they may have get rescued and given a ride home at competitive rates .         what do you do with the pirates .      chidder glanced at alfonz .      that depends on future employment prospects     he said .     father always says that a man down on his luck should be offered a helping hand .  on terms  that is .  how   s the king business .      teppic told him .  chidder listened intently  swilling the wine around in his glass .      so that   s it     he said at last .     we heard there was going to be a war .  that   s why we   re sailing tonight .         i don   t blame you     said teppic .      no  i mean to get the trade organized .  with both sides  naturally  because we   re strictly impartial .  the weapons produced on this continent are really quite shocking .  downright dangerous .  you should come with us  too .  you   re a very valuable person .         never felt more valueless than right now     said teppic despondently .   chidder looked at him in amazement .      but you   re a king .     he said .      well  yes  but           of a country which technically still exists  but isn   t actually reachable by mortal man .         sadly so .         and you can pass laws about  well  currency and taxation  yes .         i suppose so  but           and you don   t think you   re valuable .  good grief  tep  our accountants can probably think up fifty different ways to   well  my hands go damp just to think about it .  father will probably ask to move our head office there  for a start .         chidder  i explained .  you know it .  no one can get in     said teppic .      that doesn   t matter .         doesn   t matter .         no  because we   ll just make ankh our main branch office and pay our taxes in wherever the place is .  all we need is an official address in  i don   t know  the avenue of the pyramids or something .  take my tip and don   t give in on anything until father gives you a seat on the board .  you   re royal  anyway  that   s always impressive        chidder chattered on .  teppic felt his clothes growing hotter .   so this was it .  you lost your kingdom  and then it was worth more because it was a tax haven  and you took a seat on the board  whatever that was  and that made it all right .   ptraci defused the situation by grabbing alfonz   s arm as he was serving the pheasant .      the congress of the friendly dog and the two small biscuits .     she exclaimed  examining the intricate tattoo .     you hardly ever see that these days .  isn   t it well done .  you can even make out the yogurt .      alfonz froze  and then blushed .  watching the glow spread across the great scarred head was like watching sunrise over a mountain range .      what   s the one on your other arm .      alfonz  who looked as though his past jobs had included being a battering ram  murmured something and  very shyly  showed her his forearm .         s   not really suitable for ladies     he whispered .   ptraci brushed aside the wiry hair like a keen explorer  while chidder stared at her with his mouth hanging open .      oh  i know that one     she said dismissively .     that   s out of     days of pseudopolis .  it   s physically impossible .     she let go of the arm  and turned back to her meal .  after a moment she looked up at teppic and chidder .      don   t mind me     she said brightly .     do go on .         alfonz  please go and put a proper shirt on     said chidder  hoarsely .   alfonz backed away  staring at his arm .      er .  what was i  er  saying .     said chidder .     sorry .  lost the thread .  er .  have some more wine  tep .      ptraci didn   t just derail the train of thought  she ripped up the rails  burned the stations and melted the bridges for scrap .  and so the dinner trailed off into beef pie  fresh peaches  crystallized sea urchins and desultory small talk about the good old days at the guild .  they had been three months ago .  it seemed like a lifetime .  three months in the old kingdom was a lifetime .   after some time ptraci yawned and went to her cabin  leaving the two of them alone with a fresh bottle of wine .  chidder watched her go in awed silence .      are there many like her back at your place .     he said .      i don   t know     teppic admitted .     there could be .  usually they lie around the place peeling grapes or waving fans .         she   s amazing .  she   ll take them by storm in ankh  you know .  with a figure like that and a mind like       he hesitated .     is she    .  i mean  are you two    .         no     said teppic .      she   s very attractive .         yes     said teppic .      a sort of cross between a temple dancer and a band saw .      they took their glasses and went up on deck  where a few lights from the city paled against the brilliance of the stars .  the water was flat calm  almost oily .   teppic   s head was beginning to spin slowly .  the desert  the sun  two gloss coats of ephebian retsina on his stomach lining and a bottle of wine were getting together to beat up his synapses .      i mus    say     he managed  leaning on the rail     you   re doing all right for yourself .         it   s ok     said chidder     commerce is quite interesting .  building up markets  you know .  the cut and thrust of competition in the privateering sector .  you ought to come in with us  boy .  it   s where the future lies  my father says .  not with wizards and kings  but with enterprising people who can afford to hire them .  no offense intended  you understand .         we   re all that   s left     said teppic to his wine glass .     out of the whole kingdom .  me  her  and a camel that smells like an old carpet .  an ancient kingdom  lost .         good job it wasn   t a new one     said chidder .     at least people got some wear out of it .         you don   t know what it   s like     said teppic .     it   s like a whole great pyramid .  but upside down  you understand .  all that history  all those ancestors  all the people  all funnelling down to me .  right at the bottom .      he slumped onto a coil of rope as chidder passed the bottle back and said     it makes you think  doesn   t it .  there   s all these lost cities and kingdoms around .  like ee  in the great nef .  whole countries  just gone .  just out there somewhere .  maybe people started mucking about with geometry  what do you say .      teppic snored .   after some moments chidder swayed forward  dropped the empty bottle over the side   it went plunk  and for a few seconds a stream of bubbles disturbed the flat calm   and staggered off to bed .     teppic dreamed .   and in his dream he was standing on a high place  but unsteadily  because he was balancing on the shoulders of his father and mother  and below them he could make out his grandparents  and below them his ancestors stretching away and out in a vast  all right  a vast pyramid of humanity whose base was lost in clouds .   he could hear the murmur of shouted orders and instructions floating up to him .   if you do nothing  we shall never have been .      this is just a dream     he said  and stepped out of it into a palace where a small  dark man in a loincloth was sitting on a stone bench  eating figs .      of course it   s a dream     he said .     the world is the dream of the creator .  it   s all dreams  different kinds of dreams .  they   re supposed to tell you things .  like  don   t eat lobster last thing at night .  stuff like that .  have you had the one about the seven cows .         yes     said teppic  looking around .  he   d dreamed quite good architecture .     one of them was playing a trombone .         it was smoking a cigar in my day .  well known ancestral dream  that dream .         what does it mean .      the little man picked a seed from between his teeth .      search me     he said .     i   d give my right arm to find out .  i don   t think we   ve met  by the way .  i   m khuft .  i founded this kingdom .  you dream a good fig .         i   m dreaming you  too .         damn right .  i had a vocabulary of eight hundred words  do you think i   d really be talking like this .  if you   re expecting a bit of helpful ancestral advice  forget it .  this is a dream .  i can   t tell you anything you don   t know yourself .         you   re the founder .         that   s me .         i   thought you   d be different     said teppic .      how d   you mean .         well   on the statue        khuft waved a hand impatiently .      that   s just public relations     he said .     i mean  look at me .  do i look patriarchal .      teppic gave him a critical appraisal .     not in that loincloth     he admitted .     it   s a bit  well  ragged .         it   s got years of wear left in it     said khuft .      still  i expect it   s all you could grab when you were fleeing from persecution     said teppic  anxious to show an understanding nature .   khuft took another fig and gave him a lopsided look .     how   s that again .         you were being persecuted     said teppic .     that   s why you fled into the desert .         oh  yes .  you   re right .  damn right .  i was being persecuted for my beliefs .         that   s terrible     said teppic .   khuft spat .     damn right .  i believed people wouldn   t notice i   d sold them camels with plaster teeth until i was well out of town .      it took a little while for this to sink in  but it managed it with all the aplomb of a concrete block in a quicksand .      you   re a criminal .     said teppic .      well  criminal   s a dirty word  know what i mean .     said the little ancestor .     i   d prefer entrepreneur .  i was ahead of my time  that   s my trouble .         and you were running away .     said teppic weakly .      it wouldn   t     said khuft     have been a good idea to hang about .            and khuft the camel herder became lost in the desert  and there opened before him  as a gift from the gods  a valley flowing with milk and honey        quoted teppic  in a hollow voice .  he added     i used to think it must have been awfully sticky .         there i was  dying of thirst  all the camels kicking up a din  yelling for water  next minute   whoosh   a bloody great river valley  reed beds  hippos  the whole thing .  out of nowhere .  i nearly got knocked down in the stampede .         no .     said teppic .     it wasn   t like that .  the gods of the valley took pity on you and showed you the way in  didn   t they .     he shut up  surprised at the tones of pleading in his own voice .   khuft sneered .     oh  yes .  and i just happened to stumble across a hundred miles of river in the middle of the desert that everyone else had missed .  easy thing to miss  a hundred miles of river valley in the middle of a desert  isn   t it .  not that i was going to look a gift camel in the mouth  you understand  i went and brought my family and the rest of the lads in soon enough .  never looked back .         one minute it wasn   t there  the next minute it was .     said teppic .      right enough .  hard to believe  isn   t it .         no     said teppic .     no .  not really .      khuft poked him with a wrinkled finger .     i always reckoned it was the camels that did it     he said .     i always thought they sort of called it into place  like it was sort of potentially there but not quite  and it needed just that little bit of effort to make it real .  funny things  camels .         i know .         odder than gods .  something the matter .         sorry     said teppic     it   s just that this is all a bit of a shock .  i mean  i thought we were really royal .  i mean  we   re more royal than anyone .      khuft picked a fig seed from between two blackened stumps which  because they were in his mouth  probably had to be called his teeth .  then he spat .      that   s up to you     he said  and vanished .   teppic walked through the necropolis  the pyramids a saw edged skyline against the night .  the sky was the arched body of a woman  and the gods stood around the horizon .  they didn   t look like the gods that had been painted on the walls for thousands of years .  they looked worse .  they looked older than time .  after all  the gods hardly ever meddled in the affairs of men .  but other things were proverbial for it .      what can i do .  i   m only human     he said aloud .   someone said  not all of you .     teppic awoke  to the screaming of seagulls .   alfonz  who was wearing a long sleeved shirt and the expression of one who never means to take it off again  ever  was helping several other men unfurl one of unnamed   s sails .  he looked down at teppic in his bed of rope and gave him a nod .   they were moving .  teppic sat up  and saw the dock side of ephebe slipping silently away in the gray morning light .   he stood up unsteadily  groaned  clutched at his head  took a run and dived over the rail .     heme krona  owner of the camels r us livery stable  walked slowly around you bastard  humming .  he examined the camel   s knees .  he gave one of its feet an experimental kick .  in a swift movement that took you bastard completely by surprise he jerked open the beast   s mouth and examined his great yellow teeth  and then jumped away .   he took a plank of wood from a heap in the corner  dipped a brush in a pot of black paint  and after a moment   s thought carefully wrote  one owner .   after some further consideration he added  lo .  mileage .   he was just brushing in good runer when teppic staggered in and leaned  panting  against the doorframe .  pools of water formed around his feet .      i   ve come for my camel     he said .   krona sighed .      last night you said you   d be back in an hour     he said .     i   m going to have to charge you for a whole day   s livery  right .  plus i gave him a rub down and did his feet  the full service .  that   ll be five ceres  ok emir .         ah .     teppic patted his pocket .      look     he said .     i left home in a bit of a hurry  you see .  i don   t seem to have any cash on me .         fair enough  emir .     krona turned back to his board .     how do you spell years warenty .         i will definitely have the money sent to you     said teppic .   krona gave him the withering smile of one who has seen it all   asses with bodywork re haired  elephants with plaster tusks  camels with false humps glued on   and knows the festering depths of the human soul when it gets down to business .      pull the other one  rajah     he said .     it has got bells on .      teppic fumbled in his tunic .      i could give you this valuable knife     he said .   krona gave it a passing glance  and sniffed .      sorry  emir .  no can do .  no pay  no camel .         i could give it to you point first     said teppic desperately  knowing that the mere threat would get him expelled from the guild .  he was also aware that as a threat it wasn   t very good .  threats weren   t on the syllabus at the guild school .   whereas krona had  sitting on straw bales at the back of the stables  a couple of large men who were just beginning to take an interest in the proceedings .  they looked like alfonz   s older brothers .   every vehicle depot of any description anywhere in the multiverse has them .  they   re never exactly grooms or mechanics or customers or staff .  their function is always unclear .  they chew straws or smoke cigarettes in a surreptitious fashion .  if there are such things as newspapers around  they read them  or at least look at the pictures .   they started to watch teppic closely .  one of them picked up a couple of bricks and began to toss them up and down .      you   re a young lad  i can see that     said krona  kindly .     you   re just starting out in life  emir .  you don   t want trouble .     he stepped forward .   you bastard   s huge shaggy head turned to look at him .  in the depths of his brain columns of little numbers whirred upward again .      look  i   m sorry  but i   ve got to have my camel back     said teppic .     it   s life and death .      krona waved a hand at the two extraneous men .   you bastard kicked him .  you bastard had very concise ideas about people putting their hands in his mouth .  besides  he   d seen the bricks  and every camel knew what two bricks added up to .  it was a good kick  toes well spread  powerful and deceptively slow .  it picked krona up and delivered him neatly into a steaming heap of augean stable sweepings .   teppic ran  kicked away from the wall  grabbed you bastard   s dusty coat and landed heavily on his neck .      i   m very sorry     he said  to such of krona as was visible .     i really will have some money sent to you .      you bastard  at this point  was waltzing around and around in a circle .  krona   s companions stayed well back as feet like plates whirred through the air .   teppic leaned forward and hissed into one madly waving ear .      we   re going home     he said .     they had chosen the first pyramid at random .  the king peered at the cartouche on the door .         blessed is queen far re ptah        read dil dutifully        ruler of the skies  lord of the djel  master of              grandma pooney     said the king .     she   ll do .     he looked at their startled faces .     that   s what i used to call her when i was a little boy .  i couldn   t pronounce far re ptah  you see .  well  go on then .  stop gawking .  break the door down .      gern hefted the hammer uncertainly .      it   s a pyramid  master     he said  appealing to dil .     you   re not supposed to open them .         what do you suggest  lad .  we stick a tableknife in the slot and wiggle it about .     said the king .      do it  gern     said dil .     it will be all right .      gern shrugged  spat on his hands which were  in fact  quite damp enough with the sweat of terror  and swung .      again     said the king .   the great slab boomed as the hammer hit it  but it was granite  and held .  a few flakes of mortar floated down  and then the echoes came back  shunting back and forth along the dead avenues of the necropolis .      again .      gern   s biceps moved like turtles in grease .   this time there was an answering boom  such as might be caused by a heavy lid crashing to the ground  far away .   they stood in silence  listening to a slow shuffling noise from inside the pyramid .      shall i hit it again  sire .     said gern .  they both waved him into silence .   the shuffling grew closer .   then the stone moved .  it stuck once or twice  but nevertheless it moved  slowly  pivoting on one side so that a crack of dark shadow appeared .  dil could just make out a darker shape in the blackness .      yes .     it said .      it   s me  grandma     said the king .   the shadow stood motionless .      what  young pootle .     it said  suspiciously .   the king avoided dil   s face .      that   s right  grandma .  we   ve come to let you out .         who   re these men .     said the shadow petulantly .     i   ve got nothing  young man     she said to gern .     i don   t keep any money in the pyramid and you can put that weapon away  it doesn   t frighten me .         they   re servants  grandma     said the king .      have they got any identification .     muttered the old lady .      i   m identifying them  grandma .  we   ve come to let you out .         i was hammering hours     said the late queen  emerging into the sunlight .  she looked exactly like the king  except that the mummy wrappings were grayer and dusty .     i had to go and have a lie down  come the finish .  no one cares about you when you   re dead .  where   re we going .         to let the others out     said the king .      damn good idea .     the old queen lurched into step behind him .      so this is the netherworld  is it .     she said .     not much of an improvement .     she elbowed gern sharply .     you dead too  young man .         no  ma   am     said gern  in the shaky brave tones of someone on a tightrope over the chasms of madness .      it   s not worth it .  be told .         yes  ma   am .      the king shuffled across the ancient pavings to the next pyramid .      i know this one     said the queen .     it was here in my day .  king ashk ur men tep .  third empire .  what   s the hammer for  young man .         please  ma   am  i have to hammer on the door  ma   am     said gern .      you don   t have to knock .  he   s always in .         my assistant means to smash the seals  ma   am     said dil  anxious to please .      who   re you .     the queen demanded .      my name is dil  o queen .  master embalmer .         oh  you are  are you .  i   ve got some stitching wants seeing to .         it will be an honor and a privilege  o queen     said dil .      yes .  it will     she said  and turned creakily to gern .     hammer away  young man .     she said .   spurred by this  gern brought the hammer around in a long  fast arc .  it passed in front of dil   s nose making a noise like a partridge and smashed the seal into pieces .   what emerged  when the dust had settled  was not dressed in the height of fashion .  the bandages were brown and moldering and  dil noticed with professional concern  already beginning to go at the elbows .  when it spoke  it was like the opening of ancient caskets .      i woket up     it said .     and theyre was noe light .  is thys the netherworld .         it would appear not     said the queen .      thys is all .         hardly worth the trouble of dying  was it .     said the queen .   the ancient king nodded  but gently  as though he was afraid his head would fall off .      somethyng     he said     must be done .      he turned to look at the great pyramid  and pointed with what had once been an arm .      who slepes there .     he said .      it   s mine  actually     said teppicymon  lurching forward .     i don   t think we   ve met  i haven   t been interred as yet  my son built it for me .  it was against my better judgment  believe me .         it ys a dretful thyng     said the ancient king .     i felt its building .  even in the sleep of deathe i felt it .  it is big enough to interr the worlde .         i wanted to be buried at sea     said teppicymon .     i hate pyramids .         you do not     said ashk ur men tep .      excuse me  but i do     said the king  politely .      but you do not .  what you feel nowe is myld dislike .  when you have lain in one for a thousand yeares     said the ancient one     then you will begin to know the meaning of hate .      teppicymon shuddered .      the sea     he said .     that   s the place .  you just dissolve away .      they set off toward the next pyramid .  gern led the way  his face a picture  possibly one painted late at night by an artist who got his inspiration on prescription .  dil followed .  he held his chest high .  he   d always hoped to make his way in the world and here he was now  walking with kings .   well .  lurching with kings .     it was another nice day in the high desert .  it was always a nice day  if by nice you meant an air temperature like an oven and sand you could roast chestnuts on .   you bastard ran fast  mainly to keep his feet off the ground for as long as possible .  for a moment as they staggered up the hills outside the olive tree   d  field patchworked oasis around ephebe  teppic thought he saw the unnamed as a tiny speck on the azure sea .  but it might have been just a gleam on a wave .   then he was over the crest  into a world of yellow and umber .  for a while scrubby trees held on against the sand  but the sand won and marched triumphantly onward  dune after dune .   the desert was not only hot  it was quiet .  there were no birds  none of the susurration of organic creatures busily being alive .  at night there might have been the whine of insects  but they were deep under the sand against the scorch of day  and the yellow sky and yellow sand became an anechoic chamber in which you bastard   s breath sounded like a steam engine .   teppic had learned many things since he first went forth from the old kingdom  and he was about to learn one more .  all authorities agree that when crossing the scorching desert it is a good idea to wear a hat .   you bastard settled into the shambling trot that a prime racing camel can keep up for hours .   after a couple of miles teppic saw a column of dust behind the next dune .  eventually they came up behind the main body of the ephebian army  swinging along around half a dozen battle elephants  their helmet plumes waving in the oven breeze .  they cheered on general principles as teppic went past .   battle elephants .  teppic groaned .  tsort went in for battle elephants  too .  battle elephants were the fashion lately .  they weren   t much good for anything except trampling on their own troops when they inevitably panicked  so the military minds on both sides had responded by breeding bigger elephants .  elephants were impressive .   for some reason  many of these elephants were towing great carts full of timber .   he jogged onward as the sun wound higher and  and this was unusual  blue and purple dots began to pinwheel gently across the horizon .   another strange thing was happening .  the camel seemed to be trotting across the sky .  perhaps this had something to do with the ringing noise in his ears .   should he stop .  but then the camel might fall off     it was long past noon when you bastard staggered into the baking shade of the limestone outcrop which had once marked the edge of the valley  and collapsed very slowly into the sand .  teppic rolled off .   a detachment of ephebians were staring across the narrow space toward a very similar number of tsorteans on the other side .  occasionally  for the look of the thing  one of them waved a spear .   when teppic opened his eyes it was to see the fearsome bronze masks of several ephebian soldiers peering down at him .  their metal mouths were locked in sneers of terrible disdain .  their shining eyebrows were twisted in mortal anger .   one of them said     he   s coming round  sarge .      a metal face like the anger of the elements came closer  filling teppic   s vision .      we   ve been out without our hat  haven   t we  sonny boy     it said  in a cheery voice that echoed oddly inside the metal .     in a hurry to get to grips with the enemy  were we .      the sky wheeled around teppic  but a thought bobbed into the frying pan of his mind  seized control of his vocal chords and croaked     the camel .         you ought to be put away  treating it like that     said the sergeant  waggling a finger at him .     never seen one in such a state .         don   t let it have a drink .     teppic sat bolt upright  great gongs clanging and hot  heavy fireworks going off inside his skull .  the helmeted heads turned toward one another .      gods  he must have something really terrible against camels     said one of them .  teppic staggered upright and lurched across the sand to you bastard  who was trying to work out the complex equation which would allow him to get to his feet .  his tongue was hanging out  and he was not feeling well .   a camel in distress isn   t a shy creature .  it doesn   t hang around in bars  nursing a solitary drink .  it doesn   t phone up old friends and sob at them .  it doesn   t mope  or write long soulful poems about life and how dreadful it is when seen from a bed sitter .  it doesn   t know what angst is .   all a camel has got is a pair of industrial strength lungs and a voice like a herd of donkeys being chainsawed .   teppic advanced through the blaring .  you bastard reared his head and turned it this way and that  triangulating .  his eyes rolled madly as he did the camel trick of apparently looking at teppic with his nostrils .   he spat .   he tried to spit .   teppic grabbed his halter and pulled on it .      come on  you bastard     he said .     there   s water .  you can smell it .  all you have to do is work out how to get there .      he turned to the assembled soldiers .  they were staring at him with expressions of amazement  apart from those who hadn   t removed their helmets and who were staring at him with expressions of metallic ferocity .   teppic snatched a water skin from one of them  pulled out the stopper and tipped it onto the ground in front of the camel   s twitching nose .      there   s a river here     he hissed .     you know where it is  all you   ve got to do is go there .      the soldiers looked around nervously .  so did several tsorteans  who had wandered up to see what was going on .   you bastard got to his feet  knees trembling  and started to spin around in a circle .  teppic clung on .      let d equal    thought you bastard desperately .  let a . d equal    .  let not d equal           i need a stick .     shouted teppic  as he was whirled past the sergeant .     they never understand anything unless you hit them with a stick  it   s like punctuation to a camel .         is a sword any good .         no .      the sergeant hesitated  and then passed teppic his spear .   he grabbed it point end first  fought for balance  and then brought it smartly across the camel   s flank  raising a cloud of dust and hair .   you bastard stopped .  his ears turned like radar aerials .  he stared at the rock wall  rolling his eyes .  then  as teppic grabbed a handful of hair and pulled himself up  the camel started to trot .      think fractals           ere  you   re going to run straight       the sergeant began .   there was silence .  it went on for a long time .   the sergeant shifted uneasily .  then he looked across the rocks to the tsorteans  and caught the eye of their leader .  with the unspoken understanding that is shared by centurions and sergeant majors everywhere  they walked toward one another along the length of the rocks and stopped by the barely visible crack in the cliff .   the tsortean sergeant ran his hand over it .      you   d think there   d be some  you know  camel hairs or something     he said .      or blood     said the ephebian .      i reckon it   s one of them unexplainable phenomena .         oh .  that   s all right  then .      the two men stared at the stone for a while .      like a mirage     said the tsortean  helpfully .      one of them things  yes .         i thought i heard a seagull  too .         daft  isn   t it .  you don   t get them out here .      the tsortean coughed politely  and stared back at his men .  then he leaned closer .      the rest of your people will be along directly  i expect     he said .   the ephebian stepped a bit closer and when he spoke  it was out of the corner of his mouth while his eyes apparently remained fully occupied by looking at the rocks .      that   s right     he said .     and yours too  may i ask .         yes .  i expect we   ll have to massacre you if ours get here first .         likewise  i shouldn   t wonder .  still  can   t be helped .         one of those things  really     agreed the tsortean .   the other man nodded .     funny old world  when you come to think about it .         you   ve put your finger on it  all right .     the sergeant loosened his breastplate a bit  glad to be out of the sun .     rations ok on your side .     he said .      oh  you know .  mustn   t grumble .         like us  really .            cos if you do grumble  they get even worse .         just like ours .  here  you haven   t got any figs on your side  have you .  i could just do with a fig .         sorry .         just thought i   d ask .         got plenty of dates  if they   re any good to you .         we   re ok on dates  thanks .         sorry .      the two men stood awhile  lost in their own thoughts .  then the ephebian put on his helmet again  and the tsortean adjusted his belt .      right  then .         right  then .      they squared their shoulders  stuck out their chins  and marched away .  a moment later they turned about smartly and  exchanging the merest flicker of an embarrassed grin  headed back to their own sides .       part iv      the book of     things a boy can do      teppic had expected        what .   possibly the splat of flesh hitting rock .  possibly  although this was on the very edge of expectation  the sight of the old kingdom spread out below him .   he hadn   t expected chilly  damp mists .   it is now known to science that there are many more dimensions than the classical four .  scientists say that these don   t normally impinge on the world because the extra dimensions are very small and curve in on themselves  and that since reality is fractal most of it is tucked inside itself .  this means either that the universe is more full of wonders than we can hope to understand or  more probably  that scientists make things up as they go along .   but the multiverse is full of little dimensionettes  playstreets of creation where creatures of the imagination can romp without being knocked down by serious actuality .  sometimes  as they drift through the holes in reality  they impinge back on this universe  when they give rise to myths  legends and charges of being drunk and disorderly .   and it was into one of these that you bastard  by a trivial miscalculation  had trotted .   legend had got it nearly right .  the sphinx did lurk on the borders of the kingdom .  the legend just hadn   t been precise about what kind of borders it was talking about .   the sphinx is an unreal creature .  it exists solely because it has been imagined .  it is well known that in an infinite universe everything that can be imagined must exist somewhere  and since many of them are not things that ought to exist in a well ordered space time frame they get shoved into a side dimension .  this may go some way to explaining the sphinx   s chronic bad temper  although any creature created with the body of a lion  bosom of a woman and wings of an eagle has a serious identity crisis and doesn   t need much to make it angry .   so it had devised the riddle .   across various dimensions it had provided the sphinx with considerable entertainment and innumerable meals .   this was not known to teppic as he led you bastard through the swirling mists  but the bones he crunched underfoot gave him enough essential detail .   a lot of people had died here .  and it was reasonable to assume that the more recent ones had seen the remains of the earlier ones  and would therefore have proceeded stealthily .  and that hadn   t worked .   no sense in creeping along  then .  besides  some of the rocks that loomed out of the mists had a very distressing shape .  this one here  for example  looked exactly like        halt     said the sphinx .   there was no sound but the drip of the mist and the occasional sucking noise of you bastard trying to extract moisture from the air .      you   re a sphinx     said teppic .      the sphinx     corrected the sphinx .      gosh .  we   ve got any amount of statues to you at home .     teppic looked up  and then further up .     i thought you   d be smaller     he added .      cower  mortal     said the sphinx .     for thou art in the presence of the wise and the terrible .     it blinked .     any good  these statues .         they don   t do you justice     said teppic  truthfully .      do you really think so .  people often get the nose wrong     said the sphinx .     my right profile is best  i   m told  and       it dawned on the sphinx that it was sidetracking itself .  it coughed sternly .      before you can pass me  o mortal     it said     you must answer my riddle .         why .     said teppic .      what .     the sphinx blinked at him .  it hadn   t been designed for this sort of thing .      why .  why .  because .  er .  because  hang on  yes  because i will bite your head off if you don   t .  yes  i think that   s it .         right     said teppic .     let   s hear it  then .      the sphinx cleared its throat with a noise like an empty lorry reversing in a quarry .      what goes on four legs in the morning  two legs at noon  and three legs in the evening .     said the sphinx smugly .   teppic considered this .      that   s a tough one     he said  eventually .      the toughest     said the sphinx .      um .         you   ll never get it .         ah     said teppic .      could you take your clothes off while you   re thinking .  the threads play merry hell with my teeth .         there isn   t some kind of animal that regrows legs that have been           entirely the wrong track     said the sphinx  stretching its claws .      oh .         you haven   t got the faintest idea  have you .         i   m still thinking     said teppic .      you   ll never get it .         you   re right .     teppic stared at the claws .  this isn   t really a fighting animal  he told himself reassuringly  it   s definitely over endowed .  besides  its bosom will get in the way  even if its brain doesn   t .      the answer is     a man        said the sphinx .     now  don   t put up a fight  please  it releases unpleasant chemicals into the bloodstream .      teppic backed away from a slashing paw .     hold on  hold on     he said .     what do you mean  a man .         it   s easy     said the sphinx .     a baby crawls in the morning  stands on both legs at noon  and in the evening an old man walks with a stick .  good  isn   t it .      teppic bit his lip .     we   re talking about one day here .     he said doubtfully .   there was a long  embarrassing silence .      it   s a wossname  a figure of speech     said the sphinx irritably  making another lunge .      no  no  look  wait a minute     said teppic .     i   d like us to be very clear about this  right .  i mean  it   s only fair  right .         nothing wrong with the riddle     said the sphinx .     damn good riddle .  had that riddle for fifty years  sphinx and cub .     it thought about this .     chick     it corrected .      it   s a good riddle     teppic said soothingly .     very deep .  very moving .  the whole human condition in a nutshell .  but you   ve got to admit  this doesn   t all happen to one individual in one day  does it .         well .  no     the sphinx admitted .     but that is self evident from the context .  an element of dramatic analogy is present in all riddles     it added  with the air of one who had heard the phrase a long time ago and rather liked it  although not to the extent of failing to eat the originator .      yes  but    said teppic crouching down and brushing a clear space on the damp sand     is there internal consistency within the metaphor .  let   s say for example that the average life expectancy is seventy years  ok .         ok     said the sphinx  in the uncertain tones of someone who has let the salesman in and is now regretfully contemplating a future in which they are undoubtedly going to buy life insurance .      right .  good .  so noon would be age     am i right .  now considering that most children can toddle at a year or so  the four legs reference is really unsuitable  wouldn   t you agree .  i mean  most of the morning is spent on two legs .  according to your analogy       he paused and did a few calculations with a convenient thighbone       only about twenty minutes immediately after    .    hours  half an hour tops  is spent on four legs .  am i right .  be fair .         well       said the sphinx .      by the same token you wouldn   t be using a stick by six p . m .  because you   d be only  er         said teppic  scribbling furiously .     in fact you wouldn   t really be looking at any kind of walking aid until at least half past nine  i think .  that   s on the assumption that the entire lifespan takes place over one day which is  i believe i have already pointed out  ridiculous .  i   m sorry  it   s basically ok  but it doesn   t work .         well     said the sphinx  but irritably this time     i don   t see what i can do about it .  i haven   t got any more .  it   s the only one i   ve ever needed .         you just need to alter it a bit  that   s all .         how do you mean .         just make it a bit more realistic .         hmm .     the sphinx scratched its mane with a claw .      ok     it said doubtfully .     i suppose i could ask  what is it that walks on four legs           metaphorically speaking     said teppic .      four legs  metaphorically speaking     the sphinx agreed     for about           twenty minutes  i think we agreed .            ok  fine  twenty minutes in the morning  on two legs           but i think calling it    in the morning    is stretching it a bit     said teppic .     it   s just after midnight .  i mean  technically it   s the morning  but in a very real sense it   s still last night  what do you think .      a look of glazed panic crossed the sphinx   s face .      what do you think .     it managed .      let   s just see where we   ve got to  shall we .  what  metaphorically speaking  walks on four legs just after midnight  on two legs for most of the day              barring accidents     said the sphinx  pathetically eager to show that it was making a contribution .      fine  on two legs barring accidents  until at least supper time  when it walks with three legs           i   ve known people use two walking sticks     said the sphinx helpfully .      ok .  how about  when it continues to walk on two legs or with any prosthetic aids of its choice .     the sphinx gave this some consideration .     ye ess     it said gravely .     that seems to fit all eventualities .         well .     said teppic .     well what .     said the sphinx .      well  what   s the answer .      the sphinx gave him a stony look  and then showed its fangs .      oh no     it said .     you don   t catch me out like that .  you think i   m stupid .  you   ve got to tell me the answer .         oh  blow     said teppic .      thought you had me there  didn   t you .     said the sphinx .      sorry .         you thought you could get me all confused  did you .     the sphinx grinned .      it was worth a try     said teppic .      can   t blame you .  so what   s the answer  then .      teppic scratched his nose .      haven   t a clue     he said .     unless  and this is a shot in the dark  you understand  it   s  a man .      the sphinx glared at him .      you   ve been here before  haven   t you .     it said accusingly .      no .         then someone   s been talking  right .         who could have talked .  has anyone ever guessed the riddle .     said teppic .      no .         well  then .  they couldn   t have talked  could they .      the sphinx   s claws scrabbled irritably on its rock .      i suppose you   d better move along  then     it grumbled .      thank you     said teppic .      i   d be grateful if you didn   t tell anyone  please     added the sphinx  coldly .     i wouldn   t like to spoil it for other people .      teppic scrambled up a rock and onto you bastard .      don   t you worry about that     he said  spurring the camel onward .  he couldn   t help noticing the way the sphinx was moving its lips silently  as though trying to work something out .   you bastard had gone only twenty yards or so before an enraged bellow erupted behind him .  for once he forgot the etiquette that says a camel must be hit with a stick before it does anything .  all four feet hit the sand and pushed .   this time he got it right .     the priests were going irrational .   it wasn   t that the gods were disobeying them .  the gods were ignoring them .   the gods always had .  it took great skill to persuade a djelibeybi god to obey you  and the priests had to be fast on their toes .  for example  if you pushed a rock off a cliff  then a quick request to the gods that it should fall down was certain to be answered .  in the same way  the gods ensured that the sun set and the stars came out .  any petition to the gods to see to it that palm trees grew with their roots in the ground and their leaves on top was certain to be graciously accepted .  on the whole  any priest who cared about such things could ensure a high rate of success .   however  it was one thing for the gods to ignore you when they were far off and invisible  and quite another when they were strolling across the landscape .  it made you feel such a fool .      why don   t they listen .     said the high priest of teg  the horse headed god of agriculture .  he was in tears .  teg had last been seen sitting in a field  pulling up corn and giggling .   the other high priests were faring no better .  rituals hallowed by time had filled the air in the palace with sweet blue smoke and cooked enough assorted livestock to feed a famine  but the gods were settling in the old kingdom as if they owned it  and the people therein were no more than insects .   and the crowds were still outside .  religion had ruled in the old kingdom for the best part of seven thousand years .  behind the eyes of every priest present was a graphic image of what would happen if the people ever thought  for one moment  that it ruled no more .      and so  dios     said koomi     we turn to you .  what would you have us do now .      dios sat on the steps of the throne and stared gloomily at the floor .  the gods didn   t listen .  he knew that .  he knew that  of all people .  but it had never mattered before .  you just went through the motions and came up with an answer .  it was the ritual that was important  not the gods .  the gods were there to do the duties of a megaphone  because who else would people listen to .   while he fought to think clearly his hands went through the motions of the ritual of the seventh hour  guided by neural instructions as rigid and unchangeable as crystals .      you have tried everything .     he said .      everything that you advised  o dios     said koomi .  he waited until most of the priests were watching them and then  in a rather louder voice  continued     if the king was here  he would intercede for us .      he caught the eye of the priestess of sarduk .  he hadn   t discussed things with her  indeed  what was there to discuss .  but he had an inkling that there was some fellow  sorry  feeling there .  she didn   t like dios very much  but was less in awe of him than were the others .      i told you that the king is dead     said dios .      yes  we heard you .  yet there seems to be no body  o dios .  nevertheless  we believe what you tell us  for it is the great dios that speaks  and we pay no heed to malicious gossip .      the priests were silent .  malicious gossip  too .  and somebody had already mentioned rumors  hadn   t they .  definitely something amiss here .      it happened many times in the past     said the priestess  on cue .     when a kingdom was threatened or the river did not rise  the king went to intercede with the gods .  was sent to intercede with the gods .      the edge of satisfaction in her voice made it clear that it was a one way trip .   koomi shivered with delight and horror .  oh  yes .  those were the days .  some countries had experimented with the idea of the sacrificial king  long ago .  a few years of feasting and ruling  then chop   and make way for a new administration .      in a time of crisis  possibly any high born minister of state would suffice     she went on .   dios looked up  his face mirroring the agony of his tendons .      i see    he said .     and who would be high priest then .         the gods would choose     said koomi .      i daresay they would     said dios sourly .     i am in some doubt as to the wisdom of their choice .         the dead can speak to the gods in the netherworld     said the priestess .      but the gods are all here     said dios  fighting against the throbbing in his legs  which were insisting that  at this time  they should be walking along the central corridor en route to supervise the rite of the under sky .  his body cried out for the solace over the river .  and once over the river  never to return   but he   d always said that .      in the absence of the king the high priest performs his duties .  isn   t that right  dios .     said koomi .   it was .  it was written .  you couldn   t rewrite it  once it was written .  he   d written it .  long ago .   dios hung his head .  this was worse than plumbing  this was worse than anything .  and yet  and yet   to go across the river        very well  then     he said .     i have one final request .         yes .     koomi   s voice had timber now  it was already a high priest   s voice .      i wish to be interred in the       dios began  and was cut off by a murmur from those priests who could look out across the river .  all eyes turned to the distant  inky shore .   the legions of the kings of djelibeybi were on the march .     they lurched  but they covered the ground quickly .  there were platoons  battalions of them .  they didn   t need gern   s hammer anymore .      it   s the pickle     said the king  as they watched half a dozen ancestors mummyhandle a seal out of its socket .     it toughens you up .      some of the more ancient were getting over enthusiastic and attacking the pyramids themselves  actually managing to shift blocks higher than they were .  the king didn   t blame them .  how terrible to be dead  and know you were dead  and locked away in the darkness .   they   re never going to get me in one of those things  he vowed .   at last they came  like a tide  to yet another pyramid .  it was small  low  dark  half concealed in drifted sands  and the blocks were hardly even masonry  they were no more than roughly squared boulders .  it had clearly been built long before the kingdom got the hang of pyramids .  it was barely more than a pile .   hacked into the doorseal  angular and deep  were the hieroglyphs of the ur kingdom  khuft had me made .  the first .   several ancestors clustered around it .      oh  dear     said the king .     this might be going too far .         the first     whispered dil .     the first into the kingdom .  no one here before but hippos and crocodiles .  from inside that pyramids seventy centuries look out at us .  older than anything           yes  yes  all right     said teppicymon .     no need to get carried away .  he was a man  just like all of us .            and khuft the camel herder looked upon the valley          dil began .      after seven thousand yeares  he wyll be wantyng to look upon yt again     said ashk ur men tep bluntly .      even so     said the king .     it does seem a bit           the dead are equal     said ashk ur men tep .     you  younge manne .  calle hym forth .         who  me .     said gern .     but he was the fir           yes  we   ve been through all that     said teppicymon .     do it .  everyone   s getting impatient .  so is he  i expect .      gern rolled his eyes  and hefted the hammer .  just as it was about to hiss down on the seal dil darted forward  causing gern to dance wildly across the ground in a groin straining effort to avoid interring the hammer in his master   s head .      it   s open .     said dil .     look .  the seal just swings aside .         youe meane he iss oute .      teppicymon tottered forward and grabbed the door of the pyramid .  it moved quite easily .  then he examined the stone beneath it .  derelict and half covered though it was  someone had taken care to keep a pathway clear to the pyramid .  and the stone was quite worn away  as by the passage of many feet .   this was not  by the nature of things  the normal state of affairs for a pyramid .  the whole point was that once you were in  you were in .   the mummies examined the worn entrance and creaked at one another in surprise .  one of the very ancient ones  who was barely holding himself together  made a noise like deathwatch beetle finally conquering a rotten tree .      what   d he say .     said teppicymon .   the mummy of ashk ur men tep translated .     he saide yt ys spooky     he croaked .   the late king nodded .     i   m going in to have a look .  you two live ones  you come with me .      dil   s face fell .      oh  come on  man     snapped teppicymon  forcing the door back .     look  i   m not frightened .  show a bit of backbone .  everyone else is .         but we   ll need some light     protested dil .   the nearest mummies lurched back sharply as gern timidly took a tinderbox out of his pocket .      we   ll need something to burn     said dil .  the mummies shuffled further back  muttering .      there   s torches in here     said teppicymon  his voice slightly muffled .     and you can keep them away from me  lad .      it was a small pyramid  mazeless  without traps  just a stone passage leading upward .  tremulously  expecting at any moment to see unnamed terrors leap out at them  the embalmers followed the king into a small  square chamber that smelled of sand .  the roof was black with soot .   there was no sarcophagus within  no mummy case  no terror named or nameless .  the center of the floor was occupied by a raised block  with a blanket and a pillow on it .   neither of them looked particularly old .  it was almost disappointing .   gern craned to look around .      quite nice  really     he said .     comfy .         no     said dil .      hey  master king  look here     said gern  trotting over to one of the walls .     look .  someone   s been scratching things .  look  all little lines all over the wall .         and this wall     said the king     and the floor .  someone   s been counting .  every ten have been crossed through  you see .  someone   s been counting things .  lots of things .     he stood back .      what things .     said dil  looking behind him .      very strange     said the king .  he leaned forward .     you can barely make out the inscriptions underneath .         can you read it  king .     said gern  showing what dil considered to be unnecessary enthusiasm .      no .  it   s one of the really ancient dialects .  can   t make out a blessed hieroglyph     said teppicymon .     i shouldn   t think there   s a single person alive today who can read it .         that   s a shame     said gern .      true enough     said the king  and sighed .  they stood in gloomy silence .      so perhaps we could ask one of the dead ones .     said gern .      er .  gern     said dil  backing away .   the king slapped the apprentice on the back  pitching him forward .      damn clever idea .     he said .     we   ll just go and get one of the real early ancestors .  oh .     he sagged .     that   s no good .  no one will be able to understand them           gern .     said dil  his eyes growing wider .      no  it   s all right  king     said gern  enjoying the newfound freedom of thought     because  the reason being  everyone understands someone  all we have to do is sort them out .         bright lad .  bright lad     said the king .      gern .      they both looked at him in astonishment .      you all right  master .     said gern .     you   ve gone all white .         the t       stuttered dil  rigid with terror .      the what  master .         the t   look at the t           he ought to have a lie down     said the king .     i know his sort .  the artistic type .  highly strung .      dil took a deep breath .      look at the sodding torch  gern .     he shouted .   they looked .   without any fuss  turning its black ashes into dry straw  the torch was burning backward .     the old kingdom lay stretched out before teppic  and it was unreal .   he looked at you bastard  who had stuck his muzzle in a wayside spring and was making a noise like the last drop in the milkshake glass .   you bastard looked real enough .  there   s nothing like a camel for looking really solid .  but the landscape had an uncertain quality  as if it hadn   t quite made up its mind to be there or not .   except for the great pyramid .  it squatted in the middle distance as real as the pin that nails a butterfly to a board .  it was contriving to look extremely solid  as though it was sucking all the solidity out of the landscape into itself .   well  he was here .  wherever here was .   how did you kill a pyramid .   and what would happen if you did .   he was working on the hypothesis that everything would snap back into place .  into the old kingdom   s pool of recirculated time .   he watched the gods for a while  wondering what the hell they were  and how it didn   t seem to matter .  they looked no more real than the land over which they strode  about incomprehensible errands of their own .  the world was no more than a dream .  teppic felt incapable of surprise .  if seven fat cows had wandered by  he wouldn   t have given them a second glance .   he remounted you bastard and rode him  sloshing gently  down the road .  the fields on either side had a devastated look .   the sun was finally sinking  the gods of night and evening were prevailing over the daylight gods  but it had been a long struggle and  when you thought about all the things that would happen to it now   eaten by goddesses  carried on boats under the world  and so on   it was an odds on chance that it wouldn   t be seen again .   no one was visible as he rode into the stable yard .  you bastard padded sedately to his stall and pulled delicately at a wisp of hay .  he   d thought of something interesting about bivariant distributions .   teppic patted him on the flank  raising another cloud  and walked up the wide steps that led to the palace proper .  still there were no guards  no servants .  no living soul .   he slipped into his own palace like a thief in the day  and found his way to dil   s workshop .  it was empty  and looked as though a robber with very peculiar tastes had recently been at work in there .  the throne room smelled like a kitchen  and by the looks of it the cooks had fled in a hurry .   the gold mask of the kings of djelibeybi  slightly buckled out of shape  had rolled into a corner .  he picked it up and  on a suspicion  scratched it with one of his knives .  the gold peeled away  exposing a sliver gray gleam .   he   d suspected that .  there simply wasn   t that much gold around .  the mask felt as heavy as lead because  well  it was lead .  he wondered if it had ever been all gold  and which ancestor had done it  and how many pyramids it had paid for .  it was probably very symbolic of something or other .  perhaps not even symbolic of anything .  just symbolic  all by itself .   one of the sacred cats was hiding under the throne .  it flattened its ears and spat at teppic as he reached down to pat it .  that much hadn   t changed  at least .   still no people .  he padded across to the balcony .   and there the people were  a great silent mass  staring across the river in the fading  leaden light .  as teppic watched a flotilla of boats and ferries set out from the near bank .   we ought to have been building bridges  he thought .  but we said that would be shackling the river .   he dropped lightly over the balustrade onto the packed earth and walked down to the crowd .   and the full force of its belief scythed into him .   the people of djelibeybi might have had conflicting ideas about their gods  but their belief in their kings had been unswerving for thousands of years .  to teppic it was like walking into a vat of alcohol .  he felt it pouring into him until his fingertips crackled  rising up through his body until it gushed into his brain  bringing not omnipotence but the feeling of omnipotence  the very strong sensation that while he didn   t actually know everything  he would do soon and had done once .   it had been like this back in ankh  when the divinity had hooked him .  but that had been just a flicker .  now it had the solid power of real belief behind it .   he looked down at a rustling below him  and saw green shoots springing out of the dry sand around his feet .   bloody hell  he thought .  i really am a god .   this could be very embarrassing .   he shouldered his way through the press of people until he reached the riverbank and stood there in a thickening clump of corn .  as the crowd caught on  those nearest fell to their knees  and a circle of reverentially collapsing people spread out from teppic like ripples .   but i never wanted this .  i just wanted to help people live more happily  with plumbing .  i wanted something done about rundown inner city areas .  i just wanted to put them at their ease  and ask them how they enjoyed their lives .  i thought schools might be a good idea  so they wouldn   t fall down and worship someone just because he   s got green feet .   and i wanted to do something about the architecture     as the light drained from the sky like steel going cold the pyramid was somehow even bigger than before .  if you had to design something to give the very distinct impression of mass  the pyramid was it .  there was a crowd of figures around it  unidentifiable in the gray light .   teppic looked around the prostrate crowd until he saw someone in the uniform of the palace guard .      you  man  on your feet     he commanded .   the man gave him a look of dread  but did stagger sheepishly upright .      what   s going on here .         o king  who is the lord of           i don   t think we have time     said teppic .     i know who i am  i want to know what   s happening .         o king  we saw the dead walking .  the priests have gone to talk to them .         the dead walking .         yes  o king .         we   re talking about not alive people here  are we .         yes  o king .         oh .  well  thank you .  that was very succinct .  not informative  but succinct .  are there any boats around .         the priests took them all  o king .      teppic could see that this was true .  the jetties near the palace were usually thronged with boats  and now they were all empty .  as he stared at the water it grew two eyes and a long snout  to remind him that swimming the djel was as feasible as nailing fog to the wall .   he stared at the crowd .  every person was watching him expectantly  convinced that he would know what to do next .   he turned back to the river  extended his hands in front of him  pressed them together and then opened them gently .   there was a damp sucking noise  and the waters of the djel parted in front of him .  there was a sigh  from the crowd  but their astonishment was nothing to the surprise of a dozen or so crocodiles  who were left trying to swim in ten feet of air .   teppic ran down the bank and over the heavy mud  dodging to avoid the tails that slashed wildly at him as the reptiles dropped heavily onto the riverbed .   the djel loomed up as two khaki walls  so that he was running along a damp and shadowy alley .  here and there were fragments of bones  old shields  bits of spear  the ribs of boats .  he leapt and jinked around the debris of centuries .   ahead of him a big bull crocodile propelled itself dreamily out of the wall of water  flailed madly in mid air  and flopped into the ooze .  teppic trod heavily on its snout and plunged on .   behind him a few of the quicker citizens  seeing the dazed creatures below them  began to look for stones .  the crocodiles had been undisputed masters of the river since primordial times  but if it was possible to do a little catching up in the space of a few minutes  it was certainly worth a try .   the sound of the monsters of the river beginning the long journey to handbaghood broke out behind teppic as he sloshed up the far bank .     a line of ancestors stretched across the chamber  down the dark passageway  and out into the sand .  it was filled with whispers going in both directions  a dry sound  like the wind blowing through old paper .   dil lay on the sand  with gern flapping a cloth in his face .      wha    they doing .     he murmured .      reading the inscription     said gern .     you ought to see it  master .  the one doing the reading  he   s practically a           yes  yes  all right     said dil  struggling up .      he   s more than six thousand years old .  and his grandson   s listening to him  and telling his grandson  and he   s telling his gra           yes  yes  all              and khuft too said unto the first  what may we give unto you  who has taught us the right ways        said teppicymon   who was at the end of the line .        and the first spake  and this he spake  build for me a pyramid  that i may rest  and build it of these dimensions  that it be proper .  and thus it was done  and the name of the first was           but there was no name .  it was just a babble of raised voices  arguments  ancient cursewords  spreading along the line of desiccated ancestors like a spark along a powder trail .  until it reached teppicymon  who exploded .     the ephebian sergeant  quietly perspiring in the shade  saw what he had been half expecting and wholly dreading .  there was a column of dust on the opposite horizon .   the tsorteans    main force was getting there first .   he stood up  nodded professionally to his counterpart across the way  and looked at the double handful of men under his command .      i need a messenger to take  er  a message back to the city     he said .  a forest of hands shot up .  the sergeant sighed  and selected young autocue  who he knew was missing his mum .      run like the wind     he said .     although i expect you won   t need telling  will you .  and then   and then        he stood with his lips moving silently  while the sun scoured the rocks of the hot  narrow pass and a few insects buzzed in the scrub bushes .  his education hadn   t included a course in famous last words .   he raised his eyes in the direction of home .      go  tell the ephebians       he began .   the soldiers waited .      what .     said autocue after a while .     go and tell them what .      the sergeant relaxed  like air being let out of a balloon .      go and tell them  what kept you .     he said .  on the near horizon another column of dust was advancing .   this was more like it .  if there was going to be a massacre  then it ought to be shared by both sides .     the city of the dead lay before teppic .  after ankh morpork  which was almost its direct opposite  in ankh  even the bedding was alive  it was probably the biggest city on the disc  its streets were the finest  its architecture the most majestic and awe inspiring .   in population terms the necropolis outstripped the other cities of the old kingdom  but its people didn   t get out much and there was nothing to do on saturday nights .   until now .   now it thronged .   teppic watched from the top of a wind etched obelisk as the gray and brown  and here and there somewhat greenish  armies of the departed passed beneath him .  the kings had been democratic .  after the pyramids had been emptied gangs of them had turned their attention to the lesser tombs  and now the necropolis really did have its tradesmen  its nobles and even its artisans .  not that there was  by and large  any way of telling the difference .   they were  to a corpse  heading for the great pyramid .  it loomed like a carbuncle over the lesser  older buildings .  and they all seemed very angry about something .   teppic dropped lightly onto the wide flat roof of a mastaba  jogged to its far end  cleared the gap onto an ornamental sphinx   not without a moment   s worry  but this one seemed inert enough   and from there it was but the throw of a grapnel to one of the lower stories of a step pyramid .   the long light of the contentious sun lanced across the silent landscape as he leapt from monument to monument  zig zagging high above the shuffling army .   behind him shoots appeared briefly in the ancient stone  cracking it a little  and then withered and died .   this  said his blood as it tingled around his body  is what you trained for .  even mericet couldn   t mark you down for this .  speeding in the shadows above a silent city  running like a cat  finding handholds that would have perplexed a gecko   and  at the destination  a victim .   true  it was a billion tons of pyramid  and hitherto the largest client of an inhumation had been patricio  the    stone despot of quirm .   a monumental needle recording in bas relief the achievements of a king four thousand years ago  and which would have been more pertinent if the wind driven sand hadn   t long ago eroded his name  provided a handy ladder which needed only an expertly thrown grapnel from its top  lodging in the outstretched fingers of a forgotten monarch  to allow him a long  gentle arc onto the roof of a tomb .   running  climbing and swinging  hastily hammering crampons in the memorials of the dead  teppic went forth .     pinpoints of firelight among the limestone pricked out the lines of the opposing armies .  deep and stylized though the enmity was between the two empires  they both abided by the ancient tradition that warfare wasn   t undertaken at night  during harvest or when wet .  it was important enough to save up for special occasions .  going at it hammer and tongs just reduced the whole thing to a farce .   in the twilight on both sides of the line came the busy sound of advanced woodwork in progress .   it   s said that generals are always ready to fight the last war over again .  it had been thousands of years since the last war between tsort and ephebe  but generals have long memories and this time they were ready for it .   on both sides of the line  wooden horses were taking shape .        it   s gone     said ptaclusp iib  slithering back down the pile of rubble .      about time  too     said his father .     help me fold up your brother .  you   re sure it won   t hurt him .         well  if we do it carefully he can   t move in time  that is  width to us .  so if no time can pass for him  nothing can hurt him .      ptaclusp thought of the old days  when pyramid building had simply consisted of piling one block on another and all you needed to remember was that you put less on top as you went up .  and now it meant trying to put a crease in one of your sons .      right     he said doubtfully .     let   s be off  then .     he inched his way up the debris and poked his head over the top just as the vanguard of the dead came around the corner of the nearest minor pyramid .   his first thought was  this is it  they   re coming to complain .   he   d done his best .  it wasn   t always easy to build to a budget .  maybe not every lintel was exactly as per drawings  perhaps the quality of the internal plasterwork wasn   t always up to snuff  but     they can   t all be complaining .  not this many of them .   ptaclusp iib climbed up alongside him .  his mouth dropped open .      where are they all coming from .     he said .      you   re the expert .  you tell me .         are they dead .      ptaclusp scrutinized some of the approaching marchers .      if they   re not  some of them are awfully ill     he said .      let   s make a run for it .         where to .  up the pyramid .      the great pyramid loomed up behind them  its throbbing filling the air .  ptaclusp stared at it .      what   s going to happen tonight .     he said .      what .         well  is it going to   do whatever it did   again .      iib stared at him .     dunno .         can you find out .         only by waiting .  i   m not even sure what it   s done now .         are we going to like it .         i shouldn   t think so  dad .  oh  dear .         what   s up now .         look over there .      heading toward the marching dead  trailing behind koomi like a tail behind a comet  were the priests .     it was hot and dark inside the horse .  it was also very crowded .   they waited  sweating .   young autocue stuttered     what   ll happen now  sergeant .      the sergeant moved a foot tentatively .  the atmosphere would have induced claustrophobia in a sardine .      well  lad .  they   ll find us  see  and be so impressed they   ll drag us all the way back to their city  and then when it   s dark we   ll leap out and put them to the sword .  or put the sword to them .  one or the other .  and then we   ll sack the city  burn the walls and sow the ground with salt .  you remember  lad  i showed you on friday .         oh .      moisture dripped from a score of brows .  several of the men were trying to compose a letter home  dragging styli across wax that was close to melting .      and then what will happen  sergeant .         why  lad  then we   ll go home heroes .         oh .      the older soldiers sat stolidly looking at the wooden walls .  autocue shifted uneasily  still worried about something .      my mum said to come back with my shield or on it  sergeant     he said .      jolly good  lad .  that   s the spirit .         we will be all right  though .  won   t we  sergeant .      the sergeant stared into the fetid darkness .   after a while  someone started to play the harmonica .     ptaclusp half turned his head from the scene and a voice by his ear said     you   re the pyramid builder  aren   t you .      another figure had joined them in their bolt hole  one who was black clad and moved in a way that made a cat   s tread sound like a one man band .   ptaclusp nodded  unable to speak .  he had had enough shocks for one day .      well  switch it off .  switch it off now .      iib leaned over .      who   re you .     he said .      my name is teppic .         what  like the king .         yes .  just like the king .  now turn it off .         it   s a pyramid .  you can   t turn off pyramids .     said iib .      well  then  make it flare .         we tried that last night .     iib pointed to the shattered capstone .     unroll two ay  dad .      teppic regarded the flat brother .      it   s some sort of wall poster  is it .     he said eventually .   iib looked down .  teppic saw the movement  and looked down also  he was ankle deep in green sprouts .      sorry     he said .     i can   t seem to shake it off .         it can be dreadful     said iib frantically .     i know how it is  i had this verruca once  nothing would shift it .      teppic hunkered down by the cracked stone .      this thing     he said .     what   s the significance .  i mean  it   s coated with metal .  why .         there   s got to be a sharp point for the flare     said iib .      is that all .  this is gold  isn   t it .         it   s electrum .  gold and silver alloy .  the capstone has got to be made of electrum .      teppic peeled back the foil .      this isn   t all metal     he said mildly .      yes .  well     said ptaclusp .     we found  er  that foil works just as well .         couldn   t you use something cheaper .  like steel .      ptaclusp sneered .  it hadn   t been a good day  sanity was a distant memory  but there were certain facts he knew for a fact .      wouldn   t last for more than a year or two     he said .     what with the dew and so forth .  you   d lose the point .  wouldn   t last more than two or three hundred times .      teppic leaned his head against the pyramid .  it was cold  and it hummed .  he thought he could hear  under the throbbing  a faint rising tone .   the pyramid towered over him .  iib could have told him that this was because the walls sloped in at precisely      and an effect known as battering made the pyramid loom even higher than it really was .  he probably would have used words like perspective and virtual height as well .   the black marble was glassy smooth .  the masons had done well .  the cracks between each silky panel were hardly wide enough to insert a knife .  but wide enough  all the same .      how about once .     he said .     koomi chewed his fingernails distractedly .      fire     he said .     that   d stop them .  they   re very inflammable .  or water .  they   d probably dissolve .         some of them were destroying pyramids     said the high priest of juf  the cobra headed god of papyrus .      people always come back from the dead in such a bad temper     said another priest .   koomi watched the approaching army in mounting bewilderment .      where   s dios .     he said .   the old high priest was pushed to the front of the crowd .      what shall i say to them .     koomi demanded .   it would be wrong to say that dios smiled .  it wasn   t an action he often felt called upon to perform .  but his mouth creased at the edges and his eyes went half hooded .      you could tell them     he said     that new times demand new men .  you could tell them that it is time to make way for younger people with fresh ideas .  you could tell them that they are outmoded .  you could tell them all that .         they   ll kill me .         would they be that anxious for your eternal company  i wonder .         you   re still high priest .         why don   t you talk to them .     said dios .     don   t forget to tell them that they are to be dragged kicking and screaming into the century of the cobra .     he handed koomi the staff .     or whatever this century is called     he added .   koomi felt the eyes of the assembled brethren and sistren upon him .  he cleared his throat  adjusted his robe  and turned to face the mummies .   they were chanting something  one word  over and over again .  he couldn   t quite make it out  but it seemed to have worked them up into a rage .   he raised the staff  and the carved wooden snakes looked unusually alive in the flat light .   the gods of the disc   and here is meant the great consensus gods  who really do exist in dunmanifestin  their semi detached valhalla on the world   s impossibly high central mountain  where they pass the time observing the petty antics of mortal men and organizing petitions about how the influx of the ice giants has lowered property values in the celestial regions   the gods of disc have always been fascinated by humanity   s incredible ability to say exactly the wrong thing at the wrong time .   they   re not talking here of such easy errors as    it   s perfectly safe     or    the ones that growl a lot don   t bite     but of simple little sentences which are injected into difficult situations with the same general effect as a steel bar dropped into the bearings of a       rpm      megawatt steam turbine .   and connoisseurs of mankind   s tendency to put his pedal extremity where his tongue should be are agreed that when the judges    envelopes are opened then hoot koomi   s fine performance in    begone from this place  foul shades    will be a contender for all time bloody stupid greeting .   the front row of ancestors halted  and were pushed forward a little by the press of those behind .   king teppicymon xxvii  who by common consent among the other twenty six teppicymons was spokesman  lurched on alone and picked up the trembling koomi by his arms .      what did you say .     he said .   koomi   s eyes rolled .  his mouth opened and shut  but his voice wisely decided not to come out .   teppicymon pushed his bandaged face close to the priest   s pointed nose .      i remember you     he growled .     i   ve seen you oiling around the place .  a bad hat  if ever i saw one .  i remember thinking that .      he glared around at the others .      you   re all priests  aren   t you .  come to say sorry  have you .  where   s dios .      the ancestors pressed forward  muttering .  when you   ve been dead for hundreds of years  you   re not inclined to feel generous to those people who assured you that you were going to have a lovely time .  there was a scuffle in the middle of the crowd as king psam nut kha  who had spent five thousand years with nothing to look at but the inside of a lid  was restrained by younger colleagues .   teppicymon switched his attention back to koomi  who hadn   t gone anywhere .      foul shades  was it .     he said .      er     said koomi .      put him down .     dios gently took the staff from koomi   s unresisting fingers and said     i am dios  the high priest .  why are you here .      it was a perfectly calm and reasonable voice  with overtones of concerned but indubitable authority .  it was a tone of voice the pharaohs of djelibeybi had heard for thousands of years  a voice which had regulated the days  prescribed the rituals  cut the time into carefully turned segments  interpreted the ways of gods to men .  it was the sound of authority  which stirred antique memories among the ancestors and caused them to look embarrassed and shuffle their feet .   one of the younger pharaohs lurched forward .      you bastard     he croaked .     you laid us out and shut us away  one by one  and you went on .  people thought the name was passed on but it was always you .  how old are you  dios .      there was no sound .  no one moved .  a breeze stirred the dust a little .   dios sighed .      i did not mean to     he said .     there was so much to do .  there were never enough hours in the day .  truly  i did not realize what was happening .  i thought it was refreshing  nothing more  i suspected nothing .  i noted the passing of the rituals  not the years .         come from a long lived family  do you .     said teppicymon sarcastically .   dios stared at him  his lips moving .     family     he said at last  his voice softened from its normal bark .     family .  yes .  i must have had a family  mustn   t i .  but  you know  i can   t remember .  memory is the first thing that goes .  the pyramids don   t seem to preserve it  strangely .         this is dios  the footnote keeper of history .     said teppicymon .      ah .     the high priest smiled .     memory goes from the head .  but it is all around me .  every scroll and book .         that   s the history of the kingdom  man .         yes .  my memory .      the king relaxed a little .  sheer horrified fascination was unravelling the knot of fury .      how old are you .     he said .      i think   seven thousand years .  but sometimes it seems much longer .         really seven thousand years .         yes     said dios .      how could any man stand it .     said the king .   dios shrugged .      seven thousand years is just one day at a time     he said .   slowly  with the occasional wince  he got down on one knee and held up his staff in shaking hands .      o kings     he said     i have always existed only to serve .      there was a long  extremely embarrassed pause .      we will destroy the pyramids     said far re ptah  pushing forward .      you will destroy the kingdom     said dios .     i cannot allow it .         you cannot allow it .         yes .  what will we be without the pyramids .     said dios .      speaking for the dead     said far re ptah     we will be free .         but the kingdom will be just another small country     said dios  and to their horror the ancestors saw tears in his eyes .     all that we hold dear  you will cast adrift in time .  uncertain .  without guidance .  changeable .         then it can take its chances     said teppicymon .     stand aside  dios .      dios held up his staff .  the snake around it uncoiled and hissed at the king .      be still     said dios .   dark lightning crackled between the ancestors .  dios stared at the staff in astonishment  it had never done this before .  but seven thousand years of his priests had believed  in their hearts  that the staff of dios could rule this world and the next .   in the sudden silence there was the faint chink  high up  of a knife being wedged between two black marble slabs .     the pyramid pulsed under teppic  and the marble was as slippery as ice .  the inward slope wasn   t the help he had expected .   the thing  he told himself  is not to look up or down  but straight ahead  into the marble  parcelling the impossible height into manageable sections .  just like time .  that   s how we survive infinity   we kill it by breaking it up into small bits .   he was aware of shouts below him  and glanced briefly over his shoulder .  he was barely a third of the way up  but he could see the crowds across the river  a gray mass speckled with the pale blobs of upturned faces .  closer to  the pale army of the dead  facing the small gray group of priests  with dios in front of them .  there was some sort of argument going on .   the sun was on the horizon .   he reached up  located the next crack  found a handhold       dios spotted ptaclusp   s head peering over the debris  and sent a couple of priests to bring him back .  iib followed  his carefully folded brother under his arm .      what is the boy doing .     dios demanded .      o dios  he said he was going to flare off the pyramid     said ptaclusp .      how can he do that .         o lord  he says he is going to cap it off before the sun sets .         is it possible .     dios demanded  turning to the architect  iib hesitated .      it may be     he said .      and what will happen .  will we return to the world outside .         well  it depends on whether the dimensional effect ratchets  as it were  and is stable in each state  or if  on the contrary  the pyramid is acting as a piece of rubber under tension        his voice stuttered to a halt under the intensity of dios   s stare .      i don   t know     he admitted .      back to the world outside     said dios .     not our world .  our world is the valley .  ours is a world of order .  men need order .      he raised his staff .      that   s my son .     shouted teppicymon .     don   t you dare try anything .  that   s the king .      the ranks of ancestors swayed  but couldn   t break the spell .      er  dios     said koomi .   dios turned  his eyebrows raised .      you spoke .     he said .      er  if it is the king  er i   that is  we   think perhaps you should let him get on with it .  er  don   t you think that would be a really good idea .      dios   s staff kicked  and the priests felt the cold bands of restraint freeze their limbs .      i gave my life for the kingdom     said the high priest .     i gave it over and over again .  everything it is  i created .  i cannot fail it now .      and then he saw the gods .     teppic eased himself up another couple of feet and then gently reached down to pull a knife out of the marble .  it wasn   t going to work  though .  knife climbing was for those short and awkward passages  and frowned on anyway because it suggested you   d chosen a wrong route .  it wasn   t for this sort of thing  unless you had unlimited knives .   he glanced over his shoulder again as strange barred shadows flickered across the face of the pyramid .   from out of the sunset  where they had been engaged in their eternal squabbling  the gods were returning .   they staggered and lurched across the fields and reed beds  heading for the pyramid .  near brainless though they were  they understood what it was .  perhaps they even understood what teppic was trying to do .  their assorted animal faces made it hard to be certain  but it looked as though they were very angry .        are you going to control them  dios .     said the king .     are you going to tell them that the world should be changeless .      dios stared up at the creatures jostling one another as they waded the river .  there were too many teeth  too many lolling tongues .  the bits of them that were human were sloughing away .  a lion headed god of justice   put  dios recalled the name   was using its scales as a flail to beat one of the river gods .  chefet  the dog headed god of metalwork  was growling and attacking his fellows at random with his hammer  this was chefet  dios thought  the god that he had created to be an example to men in the art of wire and filigree and small beauty .   yet it had worked .  he   d taken a desert rabble and shown them all he could remember of the arts of civilization and the secrets of the pyramids .  he   d needed gods then .   the trouble with gods is that after enough people start believing in them  they begin to exist .  and what begins to exist isn   t what was originally intended .   chefet  chefet  thought dios .  maker of rings  weaver of metal .  now he   s out of our heads  and see how his nails grow into claws     this is not how i imagined him .      stop     he instructed .     i order you to stop .  you will obey me .  i made you .      they also lack gratitude .   king teppicymon felt the power around him weaken as dios turned all his attention to ecclesiastical matters .  he saw the tiny shape halfway up the wall of the pyramid  saw it falter .   the rest of the ancestors saw it  too  and as one corpse they knew what to do .  dios could wait .   this was family .     teppic heard the snap of the handle under his foot  slid a little  and hung by one hand .  he   d got another knife in above him but   no  no good .  he hadn   t got the reach .  for practical purposes his arms felt like short lengths of wet rope .  now  if he spread eagled himself as he slid  he might be able to slow enough     he looked down and saw the climbers coming toward him  in a tide that was tumbling upward .   the ancestors rose up the face of the pyramid silently  like creepers  each new row settling into position on the shoulders of the generation beneath  while the younger ones climbed on over them .  bony hands grabbed teppic as the wave of edificeers broke around him  and he was half pushed  half pulled up the sloping wall .  voices like the creak of sarcophagi filled his ears  moaning encouragement .      well done  boy     groaned a crumbling mummy  hauling him bodily onto its shoulder .     you remind me of me when i was alive .  to you  son .         got him     said the corpse above  lifting teppic easily on one outstretched arm .     that   s a fine family spirit  lad .  best wishes from your great great great great uncle  although i don   t suppose you remember me .  coming up .      other ancestors were climbing on past teppic as he rose from hand to hand .  ancient fingers with a grip like steel clutched at him  hoisting him onward .   the pyramid grew narrower .   down below  ptaclusp watched thoughtfully .      what a workforce     he said .     i mean  the ones at the bottom are supporting the whole weight .         dad     said iib .     i think we   d better run .  those gods are getting closer .         do you think we could employ them .     said ptaclusp  ignoring him .     they   re dead  they probably won   t want high wages  and           dad .            sort of self build           you said no more pyramids  dad .  never again  you said .  now come on .      teppic scrambled to the top of the pyramid  supported by the last two ancestors .  one of them was his father .      i don   t think you   ve met your great grandma     he said  indicating the shorter bandaged figure  who nodded gently at teppic .  he opened his mouth .      there   s no time     she said .     you   re doing fine .      he glanced at the sun which  old professional that it was  chose that moment to drop below the horizon .  the gods had crossed the river  their progress slowed only by their tendency to push and shove among themselves  and were lurching through the buildings of the necropolis .  several were clustered around the spot where dios had been .   the ancestors dropped away  sliding back down the pyramid as fast as they had climbed it  leaving teppic alone on a few square feet of rock .   a couple of stars came out .   he saw white shapes below as the ancestors hurried away on some private errand of their own  lurching at a surprising speed toward the broad band of the river .   the gods abandoned their interest in dios  this strange little human with the stick and the cracked voice .  the nearest god  a crocodile headed thing  jerked onto the plaza before the pyramid  squinted up at teppic  and reached out toward him .  teppic fumbled for a knife  wondering what sort was approriate for gods     and  along the djel  the pyramids began to flare their meager store of hoarded time .     priests and ancestors fled as the ground began to shake .  even the gods looked bewildered .   iib snatched his father   s arm and dragged him away .      come on .     he yelled into his ear .     we can   t be around here when it goes off .  otherwise you   ll be put to bed on a coathanger .      around them several other pyramids struck their flares  thin and reedy affairs that were barely visible in the afterglow .      dad .  i said we   ve got to go .      ptaclusp was dragged backward across the flagstones  still staring at the hulking outline of the great pyramid .      there   s someone still there  look     he said  and pointed to a figure alone on the plaza .   iib peered into the gloom .      it   s only dios  the high priest     he said .     i expect he   s got some plan in mind  best not to meddle in the affairs of priests  now will you come on .      the crocodile headed god turned its snout back and forth  trying to focus on teppic without the advantage of binocular vision .  this close  its body was slightly transparent  as though someone had sketched in all the lines and got bored before it was time to do the shading .  it trod on a small tomb  crushing it to powder .   a hand like a cluster of canoes with claws on hovered over teppic .  the pyramid trembled and the stone under his feet felt warm  but it resolutely forbore from any signs of wanting to flare .   the hand descended .  teppic sank on one knee and  out of desperation  raised the knife over his head in both hands .   the light glinted for a moment off the tip of the blade and then the great pyramid flared .   it did it in absolute silence to begin with  sending up a spire of eye torturing flame that turned the whole kingdom into a criss cross of black shadow and white light  a flame that might have turned any watchers not just into a pillar of salt but into a complete condiment set of their choice .  it exploded like an unwound dandelion  silent as starlight  searing as a supernova .   only after it had been bathing the necropolis in its impossible brilliance for several seconds did the sound come  and it was sound that winds itself up through the bones  creeps into every cell of the body  and tries with some success to turn them inside out .  it was too loud to be called noise .  there is sound so loud that it prevents itself from being heard  and this was that kind of sound .   eventually it condescended to drop out of the cosmic scale and became  simply  the loudest noise anyone hearing it had ever experienced .   the noise stopped  filling the air with the dark metallic clang of sudden silence .  the light went out  lancing the night with blue and purple afterimages .  it was not the silence and darkness of conclusion but of pause  like the moment of equilibrium when a thrown ball runs out of acceleration but has yet to have gravity drawn to its attention and  for a brief moment  thinks that the worst is over .   this time it was heralded by a shrill whistling out of the clear sky and a swirl in the air that became a glow  became a flame  became a flare that sizzled downward into the pyramid  punching into the mass of black marble .  fingers of lightning crackled out and grounded on the lesser tombs around it  so that serpents of white fire burned their way from pyramid to pyramid across the necropolis and the air filled with the stink of burning stone .   in the middle of the firestorm the great pyramid appeared to lift up a few inches  on a beam of incandescence  and turn through ninety degrees .  this was almost certainly the special type of optical illusion which can take place even though no one is actually looking at it .   and then  with deceptive slowness and considerable dignity  it exploded .   it was almost too crass a word .  what it did was this  it came apart ponderously into building sized chunks which drifted gently away from one another  flying serenely out and over the necropolis .  several of them struck other pyramids  badly damaging them in a lazy  unselfconscious way  and then bounded on in silence until they plowed to a halt behind a small mountain of rubble .   only then did the boom come .  it went on for quite a long time .     grey dust rolled over the kingdom .   ptaclusp dragged himself upright and groped ahead  gingerly  until he walked into someone .  he shuddered when he thought about the kind of people he   d seen walking around lately  but thought didn   t come easily because something appeared to have hit him on the head recently        is that you  lad .     he ventured .      is that you  dad .         yes     said ptaclusp .      it   s me  dad .         i   m glad it   s you  son .         can you see anything .         no .  it   s all mist and fog .         thank the gods for that  i thought it was me .         it is you  isn   t it .  you said .         yes  dad .         is your brother all right .         i   ve got him safe in my pocket  dad .         good .  so long as nothing   s happened to him .      they inched forward  clambering over lumps of masonry they could barely see .      something exploded  dad     said iib  slowly .     i think it was the pyramid .      ptaclusp rubbed the top of his head  where two tons of flying rock had come within a sixteenth of an inch of fitting him for one of his own pyramids .     it was that dodgy cement we bought from merco the ephebian  i expect           i think this was a bit worse than a moody lintel  dad     said iib .     in fact  i think it was a lot worse .         it looked a bit wossname  a bit on the sandy side           i think you should find somewhere to sit down  dad     said iib  as kindly as possible .     here   s two ay .  hang on to him .      he crept on alone  climbing over a slab of what felt very suspiciously like black marble .  what he wanted  he decided  was a priest .  they had to be useful for something  and this seemed the sort of time one might need one .  for solace  or possibly  he felt obscurely  to beat their head in with a rock .   what he found instead was someone on their hands and knees  coughing .  iib helped him   it was definitely a him  he   d been briefly afraid it might be an it and sat him on another lump of  yes  almost certainly marble .      are you a priest .     he said  fumbling in the rubble .      i   m dil .  chief embalmer     the figure muttered .      ptaclusp iib  paracosmic archi       iib began and then  suspecting that architects were not going to be too popular around here for a while  quickly corrected himself .     i   m an engineer     he said .     are you all right .         don   t know .  what happened .         i think the pyramid exploded     iib volunteered .      are we dead .         i shouldn   t think so .  you   re walking and talking  after all .      dil shivered .     that   s no guideline  take it from me .  what   s an engineer .         oh  a builder of aqueducts     said iib quickly .     they   re the coming thing  you know .      dil stood up  a little shakily .      i     he said     need a drink .  let   s find the river .      they found teppic first .   he was clinging to a small  truncated pyramid section that had made a moderate sized crater when it landed .      i know him     said iib .     he   s the lad who was on top of the pyramid .  that   s ridiculous  how could he survive that .         why   s there all corn sprouting out of it  too .     wondered dil .      i mean  perhaps there   s some kind of effect if you   re right in the center of the flare  or something     said iib  thinking aloud .     a sort of calm area or something  like in the middle of a whirlpool       he reached instinctively for his wax tablet  and then stopped himself .  man was never intended to understand things he meddled with .     is he dead .     he said .      don   t look at me     said dil  stepping back .  he   d been running through his mind the alternative occupations now open to him .  upholstery sounded attractive .  at least chairs didn   t get up and walk after you   d stuffed them .   iib bent over the body .      look what he   s got in his hand     he said  gently bending back the fingers .     it   s a piece of melted metal .  what   s he got that for .         teppic dreamed .   he saw seven fat cows and seven thin cows  and one of them was riding a bicycle .   he saw some camels  singing  and the song straightened out the wrinkles in reality .   he saw a finger write on the wall of a pyramid  going forth is easy .  going back requires  cont .  on next wall      he walked around the pyramid  where the finger continued  an effort of will  because it is much harder .  thank you .   teppic considered this  and it occurred to him that there was one thing left to do which he had not done .  he   d never known how to before  but now he could see that it was just numbers  arranged in a special way .  everything that was magical was just a way of describing the world in words it couldn   t ignore .   he gave a grunt of effort .   there was a brief moment of speed .   dil and iib looked around as long shafts of light sparkled through the mists and dust  turning the landscape into old gold .   and the sun came up .     the sergeant cautiously opened the hatch in the horse   s belly .  when the expected flurry of spears did not materialize he ordered autocue to let out the rope ladder  climbed down it  and looked across the chill morning desert .   the new recruit followed him down and stood  hopping from one sandal to another  on sand that was nearly freezing now and would be frying by lunchtime .      there     said the sergeant  pointing     see the tsortean lines  lad .         looks like a row of wooden horses to me  sergeant     said autocue .     the one on the end   s on rockers .         that   ll be the officers .  huh .  those tsorteans must think we   re simple .     the sergeant stamped some life into his legs  took a few breaths of fresh air  and walked back to the ladder .      come on  lad     he said .      why   ve we got to go back up there .      the sergeant paused  his foot on a rope rung .      use some common  laddie .  they   re not going to come and take our horses if they see us hanging around outside  are they .  stands to reason .         you sure they   re going to come  then .     said autocue .  the sergeant frowned at him .      look  soldier     he said     anyone bloody stupid enough to think we   re going to drag a lot of horses full of soldiers back to our city is certainly daft enough to drag ours all the way back to theirs .  qed .         qed  sarge .         it means get back up the bloody ladder  lad .      autocue saluted .     permission to be excused first  sarge .         excused what .         excused  sarge     said autocue  a shade desperately .     i mean  it   s a bit cramped in the horse  sarge  if you know what i mean .         you   re going to have to learn a bit of will power if you want to stay in the horse soldiers  boy .  you know that .         yes  sarge     said autocue miserably .      you   ve got one minute .         thanks  sarge .      when the hatch closed above him autocue sidled over to one of the horse   s massive legs and put it to a use for which it wasn   t originally intended .   and it was while he was staring vaguely ahead  lost in that zen like contemplation which occurs at moments like this  that there was a faint pop in the air and an entire river valley opened up in front of him .   it   s not the sort of thing that ought to happen to a thoughtful lad .  especially one who has to wash his own uniform .     a breeze from the sea blew into the kingdom  hinting at  no  positively roaring suggestions of salt  shellfish and sun soaked tidelines .  a few rather puzzled seabirds wheeled over the necropolis  where the wind scurried among the fallen masonry and covered with sand the memorials to ancient kings  and the birds said more with a simple bowel movement than ozymandias ever managed to say .   the wind had a cool  not unpleasant edge to it .  the people out repairing the damage caused by the gods felt an urge to turn their faces toward it  as fish in a pond turn toward an influx of clear  fresh water .   no one worked in the necropolis .  most of the pyramids had blown their upper levels clean off  and stood smoking gently like recently extinct volcanoes .  here and there slabs of black marble littered the landscape .  one of them had nearly decapitated a fine statue of hat  the vulture headed god .   the ancestors had vanished .  no one was volunteering to go and look for them .   around midday a ship came up the djel under full sail .  it was a deceptive ship .  it seemed to wallow like a fat and unprotected hippo  and it was only after watching it for some time that anyone would realize that it was also making remarkably fast progress .  it dropped anchor outside the palace .   after a while  it let down a dinghy .     teppic sat on the throne and watched the life of the    kingdom reassemble itself  like a smashed mirror that is put together again and reflects the same old light in new and unexpected ways .   no one was quite sure on what basis he was on the throne  but no one else was at all keen on occupying it and it was a relief to hear instructions issued in a clear  confident voice .  it is amazing what people will obey  if a clear and confident voice is used  and the kingdom was well used to a clear  confident voice .   besides  giving orders stopped him thinking about things .  like  for example  what would happen next .  but at least the gods had gone back to not existing again  which made it a whole lot easier to believe in them  and the grass didn   t seem to be growing under his feet anymore .   maybe i can put the kingdom together again  he thought .  but then what can i do with it .  if only we could find dios .  he always knew what to do  that was the main thing about him .   a guard pushed his way through the milling throng of priests and nobles .      excuse me  your sire     he said .     there   s a merchant to see you .  he says it   s urgent .         not now  man .  there   s representatives of the tsortean and ephebian armies coming to see me in an hour  and there   s a great deal that   s got to be done first .  i can   t go around seeing any salesmen who happen to be passing .  what   s he selling  anyway .         carpets  your sire .         carpets .      it was chidder  grinning like half a watermelon  followed by several of the crew .  he walked up the hall staring around at the frescoes and hangings .  because it was chidder  he was probably costing them out .  by the time he reached the throne he was drawing a double line under the total .      nice place     he said  wrapping up thousands of years of architectural accumulation in a mere two syllables .     you   ll never guess what happened  we just happened to be sailing along the coast and suddenly there was this river .  one minute cliffs  next minute river .  there   s a funny thing  i thought .  i bet old teppic   s up there somewhere .         where   s ptraci .         i knew you were complaining about the lack of the old home comforts  so we brought you this carpet .         i said  where   s ptraci .      the crew moved aside  leaving a grinning alfonz to cut the strings around the carpet and shake it out .   it uncurled swiftly across the floor in a flurry of dust balls and moths and  eventually  ptraci  who continued rolling until her head hit teppic   s boot .   he helped her to her feet and tried to pick bits of fluff out of her hair as she swayed backward and forward .  she ignored him and turned to chidder  red with breathlessness and fury .      i could have died in there .     she shouted .     lots of other things have  by the smell .  and the heat .         you said it worked for queen wossname  ram jam hurrah  or whoever     said chidder .     don   t blame me  at home a necklace or something is usually the thing .         i bet she had a decent carpet     snapped ptraci .     not something stuck in a bloody hold for six months .         you   re lucky we had one at all     said chidder mildly .     it was your idea .         huh     said ptraci .  she turned to teppic .     hallo     she said .     this was meant to be a startlingly original surprise .         it worked     said teppic fervently .     it really worked .        chidder lay on a daybed on the palace   s veranda  while three handmaidens took turns to peel grapes for him .  a pitcher of beer stood cooling in the shade .  he was grinning amiably .   on a blanket nearby alfonz lay on his stomach  feeling extremely awkward .  the mistress of the women had found out that  in addition to the tattoos on his forearms  his back was a veritable illustrated history of exotic practices  and had brought the girls out to be educated .  he winced occasionally as her pointer stabbed at items of particular interest  and stuffed his fingers firmly in his great  scarred ears to shut out the giggles .   at the far end of the veranda  given privacy by unspoken agreement  teppic sat with ptraci .  things were not going well .      everything changed     he said .     i   m not going to be king .         you are the king     she said .     you can   t change things .         i can .  i can abdicate .  it   s very simple .  if i   m not really the king  then i can go whenever i please .  if i am the king  then the king   s word is final and i can abdicate .  if we can change sex by decree  we can certainly change station .  they can find a relative to do the job .  i must have dozens .         the job .  anyway  you said there was only your auntie .      teppic frowned .  aunt cleph ptah re was not  on reflection  the kind of monarch a kingdom needed if it was going to make a fresh start .  she had a number of stoutly held views on a variety of subjects  but most of them involved the flaying alive of people she disapproved of .  this meant most people under the age of thirty five  to start with .      well  someone else  then     he said .     it shouldn   t be difficult  we   ve always seemed to have more nobles than really necessary .  we   ll just have to find one who has the dream about the cows .         oh  the one where there   s fat cows and thin cows .     said ptraci .      yes .  it   s sort of ancestral .         it   s a nuisance  i know that much .  one of them   s always grinning and playing a wimblehorn .         it looks like a trombone to me     said teppic .      it   s a ceremonial wimblehorn  if you look closely     she said .      well  i expect everyone sees it a bit differently .  i don   t think it matters .     he sighed  and watched the unnamed unloading .  it seemed to have more than the expected number of feather mattresses  and several of the people wandering bemusedly down the gangplank were holding toolboxes and lengths of pipe .      i think you   re going to find it difficult     said ptraci .     you can   t say    ah those who dream about cows please step forward .     it   d give the game away .         i can   t just hang around until someone happens to mention it  can i .  be reasonable     he snapped .     how many people are likely to say  hey  i had this funny dream about cows last night .  apart from you  i mean .      they stared at one another .        and she   s my sister .     said teppic .   the priests nodded .  it was left to koomi to put it into words .  he   d just spent ten minutes going through the files with the mistress of the women .      her mother was  er  your late father   s favorite     he said .     he took a great deal of interest in her upbringing  as you know  and  er  it would appear that   yes .  she may be your aunt  of course .  the concubines are never very good at paperwork .  but most likely your sister .      she looked at him with tear filled eyes .      that doesn   t make any difference  does it .     she whispered .   teppic stared at his feet .      yes     he said .     i think it does  really .     he looked up at her .     but you can be queen     he added .  he glared at the priests .     can   t she     he stated firmly .   the high priests looked at one another .  then they looked at ptraci  who stood alone  her shoulders shaking .  small  palace trained  used to taking orders   they looked at koomi .      she would be ideal     he said .  there was a murmur of suddenly confident agreement .      there you are then     said teppic  consolingly .   she glared at him .  he backed away .      so i   ll be off     he said     i don   t need to pack anything  it   s all right .         just like that .     she said .     is that all .  isn   t there anything you   re going to say .      he hesitated  halfway to the door .  you could stay  he told himself .  it wouldn   t work  though .  it   d end up a terrible mess  you   d probably end up splitting the kingdom between you .  just because fate throws you together doesn   t mean fate   s got it right .  anyway  you   ve been forth .      camels are more important than pyramids     he said slowly .     it   s something we should always remember .      he ran for it while she was looking for something to throw .     the sun reached the peak of noon without beetles  and koomi hovered by the throne like hat  the vulture headed god .      it will please your majesty to confirm my succession as high priest     he said .      what .     ptraci was sitting with her chin cupped in one hand .  she waved the other hand at him .     oh .  yes .  all right .  fine .         no trace has  alas  been found of dios .  we believe he was very close to the great pyramid when it   flared .      ptraci stared into space .     you carry on     she said .  koomi preened .      the formal coronation will take some time to arrange     he said  taking the golden mask .     however  your graciousness will be pleased to wear the mask of authority now  for there is much formal business to be concluded .      she looked at the mask .      i   m not wearing that     she said flatly .   koomi smiled .     your majesty will be pleased to wear the mask of authority     he said .      no     said ptraci .   koomi   s smile crazed a little around the edges as he attempted to get to grips with this new concept .  he was sure dios had never had this trouble .   he got over the problem by sidling around it .  sidling had stood him in good stead all his life  he wasn   t going to desert it now .  he put the mask down very carefully on a stool .      it is the first hour     he said .     your majesty will wish to conduct the ritual of the ibis  and then graciously grant an audience to the military commanders of the tsortean and ephebian armies .  both are seeking permission to cross the kingdom .  your majesty will forbid this .  at the second hour  there will        ptraci sat drumming her fingers on the arms of the throne .  then she took a deep breath .     i   m going to have a bath     she said .   koomi rocked back and forth a bit .      it is the first hour     he repeated  unable to think of anything else .     your majesty will wish to conduct           koomi .         yes  o noble queen .         shut up .            the ritual of the ibis       koomi moaned .      i   m sure you   re capable of doing it yourself .  you look like a man who does things himself  if ever i saw one     she added sourly .         the commanders of the tsortean           tell them     ptraci began  and then paused .     tell them     she repeated     that they may both cross .  not one or the other  you understand .  both .         but       koomi   s understanding managed at last to catch up with his ears      that means they   ll end up on opposite sides .         good .  and after that you can order some camels .  there   s a merchant in ephebe with a good stock .  check their teeth first .  oh  and then you can ask the captain of the unnamed to come and see me .  he was explaining to me what a    free port    is .         in your bath  o queen .     said koomi weakly .  he couldn   t help noticing  now  how her voice was changing with each sentence as the veneer of upbringing burned away under the blowlamp of heredity .      nothing wrong with that     she snapped .     and see about plumbing .  apparently pipes are the thing .         for the asses    milk .     said koomi  who was now totally lost in the desert .       shut up  koomi .         yes  o queen     said koomi  miserably .   he   d wanted changes .  it was just that he   d wanted things to stay the same  as well .     the sun dropped to the horizon  entirely unaided .  for some people  it was turning out to be quite a good day .   the reddened light lit up the three male members of the ptaclusp dynasty  as they pored over plans for        it   s called a bridge     said iib .      is that like an aqueduct .     said ptaclusp .      in reverse  sort of thing     said iib .     the water goes underneath  we go over the top .         oh .  the k   the queen won   t like that     said ptaclusp .     the royal family   s always been against chaining the holy river with dams and weirs and suchlike .      iib gave a triumphant grin .     she suggested it     he said .     and she graciously went onto say  could we see to it there   s places for people to stand and drop rocks on the crocodiles .         she said that .         large pointy rocks  she said .         my word     said ptaclusp .  he turned to his other son .      you sure you   re all right .     he said .      feeling fine  dad     said iia .      no       ptaclusp groped      headaches or anything .         never felt better     said iia .      only you haven   t asked about the cost     said ptaclusp .     i thought perhaps you were still feeling fl   ill .         the queen has been pleased to ask me to have a look at the royal finances     said iia .     she said priests can   t add up .     his recent experiences had left him with no ill effects other than a profitable tendency to think at right angles to everyone else  and he sat wreathed in smiles while his mind constructed tariff rates  docking fees and a complex system of value added tax which would shortly give the merchant venturers of ankh morpork a nasty shock .   ptaclusp thought about all the miles of the virgin djel  totally unbridged .  and there was plenty of dressed stone around now  millions of tons of the stuff .  and you never knew  perhaps on some of those bridges there   d be room for a statue or two .  he had the very thing .   he put his arms around his sons    shoulders .      lads     he said proudly .     it   s looking really quantum .        the setting sun also shone on dil and gern  although in this case it was by a roundabout route through the lightwell of the palace kitchens .  they   d ended up there for no very obvious reason .  it was just that it was so depressing in the embalming room  all alone .   the kitchen staff worked around them  recognizing the air of impenetrable gloom that surrounded the two embalmers .  it was never a very sociable job at the best of times and embalmers didn   t make friends easily .  anyway  there was a coronation feast to prepare .   they sat amid the bustle  observing the future over a jug of beer .      i expect     said gern     that glwenda can have a word with her dad .         that   s it  boy     said dil wearily .     there   s a future there .  people will always want garlic .         bloody boring stuff  garlic     said gern  with unusual ferocity .     and you don   t get to meet people .  that   s what i liked about our job .  always new faces .         no more pyramids     said dil  without rancor .     that   s what she said .  you   ve done a good job  master dil  she said  but i   m going to drag this country kicking and screaming into the century of the fruitbat .         cobra     said gern .      what .         it   s the century of the cobra .  not the fruitbat .         whatever     said dil irritably .  he stared miserably into his mug .  that was the trouble now  he reflected .  you had to start remembering what century it was .   he glared at a tray of canapes .  that was the thing these days .  everyone fiddling about     he picked up an olive and turned it over and over in his fingers .      can   t say i   d feel the same about the old job  mind     said gern  draining the jug     but i bet you were proud  master   dil  i mean .  you know  when all your stitching held up like that .      dil  his eyes not leaving the olive  reached dreamily down to his belt and grasped one of his smaller knives for intricate jobs .      i said  you must have felt very sorry it was all over     said gern .   dil swiveled around to get more light  and breathed heavily as he concentrated .      still  you   ll get over it     said gern .     the important thing is not to let it prey on your mind           put this stone somewhere     said dil .      sorry .         put this stone somewhere     said dil .   gern shrugged  and took it out of his fingers .      right     said dil  his voice suddenly vibrant with purpose .     now pass me a piece of red pepper          and the sun shone on the delta  that little infinity of reed beds and mud banks where the djel was laying down the silt of the continent .  wading birds bobbed for food in the green maze of stems  and billions of zig zag midges danced over the brackish water .  here at least time  had always passed  as the delta breathed twice daily the cold  fresh water of the tide .   it was coming in now  the foam crested cusp of it trickling between the reeds .   here and there soaked and ancient bandages unwound  wriggled for a while like incredibly old snakes and then  with the minimum of fuss  dissolved .     this is most irregular .   we   re sorry .  it   s not our fault .   how many of you are there .   more than        i   m afraid .   very well  then .  please form an orderly queue .     you bastard was regarding his empty hay rack .   it represented a sub array in the general cluster    hay     containing arbitrary values between zero and k .   it didn   t have any hay in it .  it might in fact have a negative value of hay in it  but to the hungry stomach the difference between no hay and minus hay was not of particular interest .   it didn   t matter how he worked it out  the answer was always the same .  it was an equation of classical simplicity .  it had a certain clean elegance which he was not  currently  in a position to admire .   you bastard felt ill used and hard done by .  there was nothing particularly unusual about this  however  since that is the normal state of mind for a camel .  he knelt patiently while teppic packed the saddlebags .      we   ll avoid ephebe     teppic said  ostensibly to the camel .     we   ll go up the end of the circle sea  perhaps to quirm or over the ramtops .  there   s all sorts of places .  maybe we   ll even look for a few of those cities  eh .  i expect you   d like that .      it   s a mistake trying to cheer up camels .  you may as well drop meringues into a black hole .   the door at the far end of the stable swung open .  it was a priest .  he looked rather flustered .  the priests had been doing a lot of unaccustomed running around today .      er     he began .     her majesty commands you not to leave the kingdom .      he coughed .   he said     is there a reply .      teppic considered .     no     he said     i don   t think so .         so i shall tell her that you will be attending on her presently  shall i .     said the priest hopefully .      no .         it   s all very well for you to say     said the priest sourly  and slunk off .   he was replaced a few minutes later by koomi  very red in the face .      her majesty requests that you do not leave the kingdom     he said .   teppic climbed onto you bastard   s back  and tapped the camel lightly with a prod .      she really means it     said koomi .      i   m sure she does .         she could have you thrown to the sacred crocodiles  you know .         i haven   t seen many of them around today .  how are they .     said teppic  and gave the camel another thump .   he rode out into the knife edged daylight and along the packed earth streets  which time had turned into a surface harder than stone .  they were thronged with people .  and every single person ignored him .   it was a marvelous feeling .   he rode gently along the road to the border and did not stop until he was up in the escarpment  the valley spreading out behind him .  a hot wind off the desert rattled the syphacia bushes as he tethered you bastard in the shade  climbed a little further up the rocks  and looked back .   the valley was old  so old that you could believe it had existed first and had watched the rest of the world form around it .  teppic lay with his head on his arms .   of course  it had made itself old .  it had been gently stripping itself of futures for thousands of years .  now change was hitting it like the ground hitting an egg .   dimensions were probably more complicated than people thought .  probably so was time .  probably so were people  although people could be more predictable .   he watched the column of dust rise outside the palace and work its way through the city  across the narrow patchwork of fields  disappear for a minute in a group of palm trees near the escarpment  and reappear at the foot of the slope .  long before he could see it he knew there   d be a chariot somewhere in the cloud of sand .   he slid back down the rocks and squatted patiently by the roadside .  the chariot rattled by eventually  halted some way on  turned awkwardly in the narrow space  and trundled back .      what will you do .     shouted ptraci  leaning over the rail .  teppic bowed .      and none of that     she snapped .      don   t you like being king .      she hesitated .     yes     she said .     i do           of course you do     said teppic .     it   s in the blood .  in the old days people would fight like tigers .  brothers against sisters  cousins against uncles .  dreadful .         but you don   t have to go .  i need you .         you   ve got advisers     said teppic mildly .      i didn   t mean that     she snapped .     anyway  there   s only koomi  and he   s no good .         you   re lucky .  i had dios  and he was good .  koomi will be much better  you can learn a lot by not listening to what he has to say .  you can go a long way with incompetent advisers .  besides  chidder will help  i   m sure .  he   s full of ideas .      she colored .     he advanced a few when we were on the ship .         there you are  then .  i knew the two of you would get along like a house on fire .     screams  flames  people running for safety        and you   re going back to be an assassin  are you .     she sneered .      i don   t think so .  i   ve inhumed a pyramid  a pantheon and the entire old kingdom .  it may be worth trying something else .  by the way  you haven   t been finding little green shoots springing up wherever you walk  have you .         no .  what a stupid idea .      teppic relaxed .  it really was all over  then .     don   t let the grass grow under your feet  that   s the important thing     he said .     and you haven   t seen any seagulls around .         there   s lots of them today  or didn   t you notice .         yes .  that   s good  i think .      you bastard watched them talk a little more  that peculiar trailing off  desultory kind of conversation that two people of opposite sexes engage in when they have something else on their minds .  it was much easier with camels  when the female merely had to check the male   s methodology .   then they kissed in a fairly chaste fashion  insofar as camels are any judge .  a decision was reached .   you bastard lost interest at this point  and decided to eat his lunch again .     in the beginning     it was peaceful in the valley .  the river  its banks as yet untamed  wandered languidly through thickets of rush and papyrus .  ibises waded in the shallows  in the deeps  hippos rose and sank slowly  like pickled eggs .   the only sound in the damp silence was the occasional plop of a fish or hiss of a crocodile .   dios lay in the mud for some time .  he wasn   t sure how he   d got there  or why half his robes were torn off and the other half scorched black .  he dimly recalled a loud noise and a sensation of extreme speed while  at the same time  he   d been standing still .  right at this moment  he didn   t want any answers .  answers implied questions  and questions never got anyone anywhere .  questions only spoiled things .  the mud was cool and soothing  and he didn   t need to know anything else for a while .   the sun went down .  various nocturnal prowlers wandered near to dios  and by some animal instinct decided that he certainly wasn   t going to be worth all the trouble that would accrue from biting his leg off .   the sun rose again .  herons honked .  mist unspooled between the pools  was burned up as the sky turned from blue to new bronze .   and time unrolled in glorious uneventfulness for dios until an alien noise took the silence and did the equivalent of cutting it into small pieces with a rusty breadknife .   it was a noise  in fact  like a donkey being chainsawed .  as sounds went  it was to melody what a boxful of dates is to high performance motocross .  nevertheless  as other voices joined it  similar but different  in a variety of fractured keys and broken tones  the overall effect was curiously attractive .  it had lure .  it had pull .  it had a strange suction .   the noise reached a plateau  one pure note made of a succession of discordances  and then  for just the fraction of a second  the voices split away  each along a vector     there was a stirring of the air  a flickering of the sun .   and a dozen camels appeared over the distant hills  skinny and dusty  running toward the water .  birds erupted from the reeds .  leftover saurians slid smoothly off the sandbanks .  within a minute the shore was a mass of churned mud as the knobbly kneed creatures jostled  nose deep in the water .   dios sat up  and saw his staff lying in the mud .  it was a little scorched  but still intact  and he noticed what somehow had never been apparent before .  before .  had there been a before .  there had certainly been a dream  something like a dream     each snake had its tail in its mouth .   down the slope after the camels  his ragged family trailing behind him  was a small brown figure waving a camel prod .  he looked hot and very bewildered .   he looked  in fact  like someone in need of good advice and careful guidance .   dios   s eyes turned back to the staff .  it meant something very important  he knew .  he couldn   t remember what  though .  all he could remember was that it was very heavy  yet at the same time hard to put down .  very hard to put down .  better not to pick it up  he thought .   perhaps just pick it up for a while  and go and explain about gods and why pyramids were so important .  and then he could put it down afterward  certainly .   sighing  pulling the remnants of his robes around him to give himself dignity  using the staff to steady himself  dios went forth .       about the author   terry

        lit .     child of the djel .            it was quite a big frog  however  and got into the air ducts and kept everyone awake for weeks .         it was said that life was cheap in ankh morpork .  this was  of course  completely wrong .  life was often very expensive  you could get death for free .         bloat is extracted from the deep sea blowfish  singularis minutia gigantica  which protects itself from enemies by inflating itself to many times its normal size .  if taken by humans the effect is to make every cell in the body instantaneously try to swell some       times .  this is invariably fatal  and very loud .         the gates of the assassins    guild were never shut .  this was said to be because death was open for business all the time  but it was really because the hinges had rusted centuries before and no one had got around to doing anything about it .         counterwise wine is made from grapes belonging to that class of flora   reannuals   that grow only in excessively high magic fields .  normal plants grow after the seeds have been planted   with reannuals it   s the other way round .  although reannual wine causes inebriation in the normal way  the action of the digestive system on its molecules causes an unusual reaction whose net effect is to thrust the ensuing hangover backward in time  to a point some hours before the wine is drunk .  hence the saying  have a hair of the dog that   s going to bite you .         when the thieves    guild declared a general strike in the year of the engaging sloth  the actual level of crime doubled .         one of the two   legends about the founding of ankh morpork relates that the two orphaned brothers who built the city were in fact found and suckled by a hippopotamus  lit .  orijeple  although some historians hold that this is a mistranslation of orejaple  a type of glass fronted drinks cabinet  .  eight heraldic hippos line the bridge  facing out to sea .  it is said that if danger ever threatens the city  they will run away .         the other legend  not normally recounted by citizens  is that at an even earlier time a group of wise men survived a flood sent by the gods by building a huge boat  and on this boat they took two of every type of animal then existing on the disc .  after some weeks the combined manure was beginning to weigh the boat low in the water so   the story runs   they tipped it over the side  and called it ankh morpork .         like many river valley cultures the kingdom has no truck with such trivia as summer  springtime and winter  and bases its calendar squarely on the great heartbeat of the djel  hence the three seasons .  seedtime  inundation and sog .  this is logical  straightforward and practical  and only disapproved of by barbershop quartets .            because you feel an idiot singing    in the good old inundation     that   s why .         lit .     dhar ret kar mon     or    clipping of the foot .     but some scholars say that it should be    dar rhet kare mhun     lit .     hot air paint stripper .            dunnikindiver  a builder and cleaner of cesspits .  a particularly busy profession in ankh morpork  where the water table is generally at ground level  and one which attracts considerable respect .  at least  everyone passes by on the other side of the street when a dunnikindiver walks by .         hoarse whispers are not suitable for a desert environment .         lit     i am going to be here again .            some translation is needed here .  if a foreign ambassador to the court of st .  james wore  out of a genuine desire to flatter  a bowler hat  a claymore  a civil war breastplate  saxon trousers and a jacobean haircut  he   d create pretty much the same impression .         younger assassins  who are usually very poor  have very clear ideas about the morality of wealth until they become older assassins  who are usually very rich  when they begin to take the view that injustice has its good points .         the carvers had to use quite a lot of imagination .  the late king had had many fine attributes  but doing mighty deeds wasn   t among them .  the score was  number of enemies ground as dust under his chariot wheels     .  number of thrones crushed beneath his sandaled feet     .  number of times world bestrode like colossus     .  on the other hand  reigns of terror     .  number of times own throne crushed beneath enemy sandals     .  faces of poor ground     .  expensive crusades embarked upon     .  his life had  basically  been a no score win .         never trust a species that grins all the time .  it   s up to something .         renowned as the greatest camel mathematician of all time  who invented a math of eight dimensional space while lying down with his nostrils closed in a violent sandstorm .         an effect achieved by distilling the testicles of a small tree dwelling species of bear with the vomit of a whale  and adding a handful of rose petals .  teppic probably would have felt no better for knowing this .         this is of course a loose translation  since ptaclusp did not know the words for    ice        windscreens    or    hotel bedrooms     interestingly  however  squiggle eagle eagle vase wavyline duck translates directly as    a press for barbarian leg coverings .            to everyone without such a logical frame of reference the fastest animal   on the disc is the extremely neurotic ambiguous puzuma  which moves so fast that it can actually achieve near light speed in the disc   s magical field .  this means that if you can see a puzuma  it isn   t there .  most male puzumas die young of acute ankle failure caused by running very fast after females which aren   t there and  of course  achieving suicidal mass in accordance with relativistic theory .  the rest of them die of heisenberg   s uncertainty principle  since it is impossible for them to know who they are and where they are at the same time  and the seesawing loss of concentration this engenders means that the puzuma only achieves a sense of identity when it is at rest   usually about fifty feet into the rubble of what remains of the mountain it just ran into at near light speed .  the puzuma is rumored to be about the size of a leopard with a rather unique black and white check coat  although those specimens discovered by the disc   s sages and philosophers have inclined them to declare that in its natural state the puzuma is flat  very thin  and dead .          the fastest insect is the  .     bookworm .  it evolved in magical libraries  where it is necessary to eat extremely quickly to avoid being affected by the thaumic radiations .  an adult  .     bookworm can eat through a shelf of books so fast that it ricochets off the wall .         the role of listeners has never been fully appreciated .  however  it is well known that most people don   t listen .  they use the time when someone else is speaking to think of what they   re going to say next .  true listeners have always been revered among oral cultures  and prized for their rarity value  bards and poets are ten a cow  but a good listener is hard to find  or at least hard to find twice .        he was wrong .  nature abhors dimensional abnormalities  and seals them neatly away so that they don   t upset people .  nature  in fact  abhors a lot of things  including vacuums  ships called the marie celeste  and the chuck keys for electric drills .        it was  therefore  colloquially known as the djinn palace .        you know .  the bit you can   t reach with the straw .        but not immediately  of course  because messages change in the telling and some ancestors were not capable of perfect enunciation and others were trying to be helpful and supplying what they thought were lost words .  the message received by teppicymon originally began     handcuffed to the bed  the aunt thirsted .           a less desiccated culture would have used the phrase    at sea .
