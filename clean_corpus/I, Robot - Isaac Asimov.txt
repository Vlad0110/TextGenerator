evitable conflict      introduction    i looked at my notes and i didn t like them .  i d spent three days at u .  s .  robots and might as well have spent them at home with the encyclopedia tellurica .   susan calvin had been born in the year       they said  which made her seventy five now .  everyone knew that .  appropriately enough  u .  s .  robot and mechanical men  inc .  was seventy five also  since it had been in the year of dr .  calvin s birth that lawrence robertson had first taken out incorporation papers for what eventually became the strangest industrial giant in man s history .  well  everyone knew that  too .   at the age of twenty  susan calvin had been part of the particular psycho math seminar at which dr .  alfred lanning of u .  s .  robots had demonstrated the first mobile robot to be equipped with a voice .  it was a large  clumsy unbeautiful robot  smelling of machine oil and destined for the projected mines on mercury .  but it could speak and make sense .   susan said nothing at that seminar  took no part in the hectic discussion period that followed .  she was a frosty girl  plain and colorless  who protected herself against a world she disliked by a masklike expression and a hypertrophy of intellect .  but as she watched and listened  she felt the stirrings of a cold enthusiasm .   she obtained her bachelor s degree at columbia in      and began graduate work in cybernetics .   all that had been done in the mid twentieth century on  calculating machines  had been upset by robertson and his positronic brain paths .  the miles of relays and photocells had given way to the spongy globe of plantinumiridium about the size of a human brain .   she learned to calculate the parameters necessary to fix the possible variables within the  positronic brain   to construct  brains  on paper such that the responses to given stimuli could be accurately predicted .   in       she obtained her ph . d .  and joined united states robots as a  robopsychologist   becoming the first great practitioner of a new science .  lawrence robertson was still president of the corporation  alfred lanning had become director of research .   for fifty years  she watched the direction of human progress change and leap ahead .   now she was retiring   as much as she ever could .  at least  she was allowing someone else s name to be inset upon the door of her office .   that  essentially  was what i had .  i had a long list of her  published papers  of the patents in her name  i had the  chronological details of her promotions .  in short i had her  professional  vita  in full detail .   but that wasn t what i wanted .   i needed more than that for my feature articles for interplanetary press .  much more .   i told her so .    dr .  calvin   i said  as lushly as possible   in the mind of the public you and u .  s .  robots are identical .  your retirement will end an era and     you want the human interest angle .   she didn t smile at me .  i don t think she ever smiles .  but her eyes were sharp  though not angry .  i felt her glance slide through me and out my occiput and knew that i was uncommonly transparent to her  that everybody was .   but i said   that s right .     human interest out of robots .  a contradiction .     no  doctor .  out of you .     well  i ve been called a robot myself .  surely  they ve told you i m not human .    they had  but there was no point in saying so .   she got up from her chair .  she wasn t tall and she looked frail .  i followed her to the window and we looked out .   the offices and factories of u .  s .  robots were a small city  spaced and planned .  it was flattened out like an aerial photograph .    when i first came here   she said   i had a little room in a building right about there where the fire house is now .   she pointed .   it was torn down before you were born .  i shared the room with three others .  i had half a desk .  we built our robots all in one building .  output   three a week .  now look at us .     fifty years   i hackneyed   is a long time .     not when you re looking back at them   she said .   you wonder how they vanished so quickly .    she went back to her desk and sat down .  she didn t need expression on her face to look sad  somehow .    how old are you .   she wanted to know .    thirty two   i said .    then you don t remember a world without robots .  there was a time when humanity faced the universe alone and without a friend .  now he has creatures to help him  stronger creatures than himself  more faithful  more useful  and absolutely devoted to him .  mankind is no longer alone .  have you ever thought of it that way .     i m afraid i haven t .  may i quote you .     you may .  to you  a robot is a robot .  gears and metal  electricity and positrons .  mind and iron .  human made .  it necessary  human destroyed .  but you haven t worked with them  so you don t know them .  they re a cleaner better breed than we are .    i tried to nudge her gently with words   we d like to hear some of the things you could tell us  get your views on robots .  the interplanetary press reaches the entire solar system .  potential audience is three billion  dr .  calvin .  they ought to know what you could tell them on robots .    it wasn t necessary to nudge .  she didn t hear me  but she was moving in the right direction .    they might have known that from the start .  we sold robots for earth use then   before my time it was  even .  of course  that was when robots could not talk .  afterward  they became more human and opposition began .  the labor unions  of course  naturally opposed robot competition for human jobs  and various segments of religious opinion had their superstitious objections .  it was all quite ridiculous and quite useless .  and yet there it was .    i was taking it down verbatim on my pocket recorder  trying not to show the knuckle motions of my hand .  if you practice a bit  you can get to the point where you can record accurately without taking the little gadget out of your pocket .    take the case of robbie   she said .   i never knew him .  he was dismantled the year before i joined the company   hopelessly out of date .  but i saw the little girl in the museum    she stopped  but i didn t say anything .  i let her eyes mist up and her mind travel back .  she had lots of time to cover .    i heard about it later  and when they called us blasphemers and demon creators  i always thought of him .  robbie was a non vocal robot .  he couldn t speak .  he was made and sold in      .  those were the days before extreme specialization  so he was sold as a nursemaid     as a what .     as a nursemaid        robbie     ninety eight   ninety nine   one hundred .   gloria withdrew  her chubby little forearm from before her eyes and stood for a moment   wrinkling her nose and blinking in the sunlight .  then  trying to watch in all directions at once  she withdrew a few cautious steps from the tree against which she had been leaning .   she craned her neck to investigate the possibilities of a clump of bushes to the right and then withdrew farther to obtain a better angle for viewing its dark recesses .  the quiet was profound except for the incessant buzzing of insects and the occasional chirrup of some hardy bird  braving the midday sun .   gloria pouted   i bet he went inside the house  and i ve told him a million times that that s not fair .    with tiny lips pressed together tightly and a severe frown crinkling her forehead  she moved determinedly toward the two story building up past the driveway .   too late she heard the rustling sound behind her  followed by the distinctive and rhythmic clump clump of robbie s metal feet .  she whirled about to see her triumphing companion emerge from hiding and make for the home tree at full speed .   gloria shrieked in dismay .   wait  robbie .  that wasn t fair  robbie .  you promised you wouldn t run until i found you .   her little feet could make no headway at all against robbie s giant strides .  then  within ten feet of the goal  robbie s pace slowed suddenly to the merest of crawls  and gloria  with one final burst of wild speed  dashed pantingly past him to touch the welcome bark of home tree first .   gleefully  she turned on the faithful robbie  and with the basest of ingratitude  rewarded him for his sacrifice by taunting him cruelly for a lack of running ability .    robbie can t run   she shouted at the top of her eight year .  old voice .   i can beat him any day .  i can beat him any day .   she chanted the words in a shrill rhythm .   robbie didn t answer  of course not in words .  he pantomimed running instead  inching away until gloria found herself running after him as he dodged her narrowly  forcing her to veer in helpless circles  little arms outstretched and fanning at the air .    robbie   she squealed   stand still .     and the laughter was forced out of her in breathless jerks .    until he turned suddenly and caught her up  whirling her round  so that for her the world fell away for a moment with a blue emptiness beneath  and green trees stretching hungrily downward toward the void .  then she was down in the grass again  leaning against robbie s leg and still holding a hard  metal finger .   after a while  her breath returned .  she pushed uselessly at her disheveled hair in vague imitation of one of her mother s gestures and twisted to see if her dress were torn .   she slapped her hand against robbie s torso   bad boy .  i ll spank you .    and robbie cowered  holding his hands over his face so that she had to add   no  i won t  robbie .  i won t spank you .  but anyway  it s my turn to hide how because you ve got longer legs and you promised not to run till i found you .    robbie nodded his head   a small parallelepiped with rounded edges and corners attached to a similar but much larger parallelepiped that served as torso by means of a short  flexible stalk   and obediently faced the tree .  a thin  metal film descended over his glowing eyes and from within his body came a steady  resonant ticking .    don t peek now   and don t skip any numbers   warned gloria  and scurried for cover .   with unvarying regularity  seconds were ticked off  and at the hundredth  up went the eyelids  and the glowing red of robbie s eyes swept the prospect .  they rested for a moment on a bit of colorful gingham that protruded from behind a boulder .  he advanced a few steps and convinced himself that it was gloria who squatted behind it .   slowly  remaining always between gloria and home tree  he advanced on the hiding place  and when gloria was plainly in sight and could no longer even theorize to herself that she was not seen  he extended one arm toward her  slapping the other against his leg so that it rang again .  gloria emerged sulkily .    you peeked .   she exclaimed  with gross unfairness .   besides i m tired of playing hide and seek .  i want a ride .    but robbie was hurt at the unjust accusation  so he seated  himself carefully and shook his head ponderously from side to side .   gloria changed her tone to one of gentle coaxing immediately   come on  robbie .  i didn t mean it about the peeking .  give me a ride .    robbie was not to be won over so easily  though .  he gazed stubbornly at the sky  and shook his head even more emphatically .    please  robbie  please give me a ride .   she encircled his neck with rosy arms and hugged tightly .  then  changing moods in a moment  she moved away .   if you don t  i m going to cry   and her face twisted appallingly in preparation .   hard hearted robbie paid scant attention to this dreadful possibility  and shook his head a third time .  gloria found it necessary to play her trump card .    if you don t   she exclaimed warmly   i won t tell you any more stories  that s all .  not one    robbie gave in immediately and unconditionally before this ultimatum  nodding his head vigorously until the metal of his neck hummed .  carefully  he raised the little girl and placed her on his broad  fiat shoulders .   gloria s threatened tears vanished immediately and she crowed with delight .  robbie s metal skin  kept at a constant temperature of seventy by the high resistance coils within  felt nice and comfortable  while the beautifully loud sound her heels made as they bumped rhythmically against his chest was enchanting .    you re an air coaster  robbie  you re a big  silver aircoaster .  hold out your arms straight .    you got to  robbie  if you re going to be an aircoaster .    the logic was irrefutable .  robbie s arms were wings catching the air currents and he was a silver  coaster .   gloria twisted the robot s head and leaned to the right .  he banked sharply .  gloria equipped the  coaster with a motor that went  br r r  and then with weapons that went  powie  and  sh sh shshsh .   pirates were giving chase and the ship s blasters were coming into play .  the pirates dropped in a steady rain .    got another one .  two more   she cried .   then  faster  men   gloria said pompously   we re running out of ammunition .   she aimed over her shoulder with undaunted courage and robbie was a blunt nosed spaceship zooming through the void at maximum acceleration .   clear across the field he sped  to the patch of tall grass on  the other side  where he stopped with a suddenness that evoked a shriek from his flushed rider  and then tumbled her onto the soft  green carpet .   gloria gasped and panted  and gave voice to intermittent whispered exclamations of  that was nice .    robbie waited until she had caught her breath and then pulled gently at a lock of hair .    you want something .   said gloria  eyes wide in an apparently artless complexity that fooled her huge  nursemaid  not at all .  he pulled the curl harder .    oh  i know .  you want a story .    robbie nodded rapidly .    which one .    robbie made a semi circle in the air with one finger .   the little girl protested   again .  i ve told you cinderella a million times .  aren t you tired of it .   it s for babies .    another semi circle .    oh  well   gloria composed herself  ran over the details of the tale in her mind  together with her own elaborations  of which she had several  and began    are you ready .  well   once upon a time there was a beautiful little girl whose name was ella .  and she had a terribly cruel step mother and two very ugly and very cruel step sisters and      gloria was reaching the very climax of the tale   midnight was striking and everything was changing back to the shabby originals lickety split  while robbie listened tensely with burning eyes   when the interruption came .    gloria .    it was the high pitched sound of a woman who has been calling not once  but several times  and had the nervous tone of one in whom anxiety was beginning to overcome impatience .    mamma s calling me   said gloria  not quite happily .   you d better carry me back to the house  robbie .    robbie obeyed with alacrity for somehow there was that in him which judged it best to obey mrs .  weston  without as much as a scrap of hesitation .  gloria s father was rarely home in the daytime except on sunday   today  for instance   and when he was  he proved a genial and understanding person .  gloria s mother  however  was a source of uneasiness to robbie and there was always the impulse to sneak away from her sight .   mrs .  weston caught sight of them the minute they rose above the masking tufts of long grass and retired inside the house to wait .    i ve shouted myself hoarse  gloria   she said  severely .   where were you .     i was with robbie   quavered gloria .   i was telling him cinderella  and i forgot it was dinner time .     well  it s a pity robbie forgot  too .   then  as if that reminded her of the robot s presence  she whirled upon him .   you may go  robbie .  she doesn t need you now .   then  brutally   and don t come back till i call you .    robbie turned to go  but hesitated as gloria cried out in his defense   wait  mamma  you got to let him stay .  i didn t finish cinderella for him .  i said i would tell him cinderella and i m not finished .     gloria .     honest and truly  mamma  he ll stay so quiet  you won t even know he s here .  he can sit on the chair in the corner  and he won t say a word i mean he won t do anything .  will you  robbie .    robbie  appealed to  nodded his massive head up and down once .    gloria  if you don t stop this at once  you shan t see robbie for a whole week .    the girl s eyes fell   all right .  but cinderella is his favorite story and i didn t finish it .   and he likes it so much .    the robot left with a disconsolate step and gloria choked back a sob .     george weston was comfortable .  it was a habit of his to be comfortable on sunday afternoons .  a good  hearty dinner below the hatches  a nice  soft  dilapidated couch on which to sprawl  a copy of the times  slippered feet and shirtless chest  how could anyone help but be comfortable .   he wasn t pleased  therefore  when his wife walked in .  after ten years of married life  be still was so unutterably foolish as to love her  and there was no question that he was always glad to see her   still sunday afternoons just after dinner were sacred to him and his idea of solid comfort was to be left in utter solitude for two or three hours .  consequently  he fixed his eye firmly upon the latest reports of the lefebre yoshida expedition to mars  this one was to take off from lunar base and might actually succeed  and pretended she wasn t there .   mrs .  weston waited patiently for two minutes  then impatiently for two more  and finally broke the silence .    george .     hmpph .     george  i say .  will you put down that paper and look at me .    the paper rustled to the floor and weston turned a weary face toward his wife   what is it  dear .     you know what it is  george .  it s gloria and that terrible machine .     what terrible machine .     now don t pretend you don t know what i m talking about .  it s that robot gloria calls robbie .  he doesn t leave her for a moment .     well  why should he .  he s not supposed to .  and he certainly isn t a terrible machine .  he s the best darn robot money can buy and i m damned sure he set me back half a year s income .  he s worth it  though   darn sight cleverer than half my office staff .    he made a move to pick up the paper again  but his wife was quicker and snatched it away .    you listen to me  george .  i won t have my daughter entrusted to a machine   and i don t care how clever it is .  it has no soul  and no one knows what it may be thinking .  a child just isn t made to be guarded by a thing of metal .    weston frowned   when did you decide this .  he s been with gloria two years now and i haven t seen you worry till now .     it was different at first .  it was a novelty  it took a load off me  and   and it was a fashionable thing to do .  but now i don t know .  the neighbors     well  what have the neighbors to do with it .  now  look .  a robot is infinitely more to be trusted than a human nursemaid .  robbie was constructed for only one purpose really   to be the companion of a little child .  his entire  mentality  has been created for the purpose .  he just can t help being faithful and loving and kind .  he s a machine made so .  that s more than you can say for humans .     but something might go wrong .  some  some   mrs .  weston was a bit hazy about the insides of a robot   some little jigger will come loose and the awful thing will go berserk and  and   she couldn t bring herself to complete the quite obvious thought .    nonsense   weston denied  with an involuntary nervous shiver .   that s completely ridiculous .  we had a long discussion at the time we bought robbie about the first law of robotics .  you know that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human being  that long before enough can go wrong to alter that first law  a robot would be completely inoperable .  it s a mathematical impossibility .  besides i have an engineer from u .  s .  robots here twice a year to give the poor gadget  a complete overhaul .  why  there s no more chance of any thing at all going wrong with robbie than there is of you or i suddenly going looney   considerably less  in fact .  besides  how are you going to take him away from gloria .    he made another futile stab at the paper and his wife tossed it angrily into the next room .    that s just it  george .  she won t play with anyone else .  there are dozens of little boys and girls that she should make friends with  but she won t .  she won t go near them unless i make her .  that s no way for a little girl to grow up .  you want her to be normal  don t you .  you want her to be able to take her part in society .     you re jumping at shadows  grace .  pretend robbie s a dog .  i ve seen hundreds of children who would rather have their dog than their father .     a dog is different  george .  we must get rid of that horrible thing .  you can sell it back to the company .  i ve asked  and you can .     you ve asked .  now look here  grace  let s not go off the deep end .  we re keeping the robot until gloria is older and i don t want the subject brought up again .   and with that he walked out of the room in a huff .     mrs .  weston met her husband at the door two evenings later .   you ll have to listen to this  george .  there s bad feeling in the village .     about what .   asked weston .  he stepped into the washroom and drowned out any possible answer by the splash of water .   mrs .  weston waited .  she said   about robbie .    weston stepped out  towel in hand  face red and angry   what are you talking about .     oh  it s been building up and building up .  i ve tried to close my eyes to it  but i m not going to any more .  most of the villagers consider robbie dangerous .  children aren t allowed to go near our place in the evenings .     we trust  our  child with the thing .     well  people aren t reasonable about these things .     then to hell with them .     saying that doesn t solve the problem .  i ve got to do my shopping down there .  i ve got to meet them every day .  and it s even worse in the city these days when it comes to robots .  new york has just passed an ordinance keeping all robots off the streets between sunset and sunrise .     all right  but they can t stop us from keeping a robot in our home .   grace  this is one of your campaigns .  i recognize it .  but it s no use .  the answer is still  no .  we re keeping robbie .      and yet he loved his wife   and what was worse  his wife knew it .  george weston  after all  was only a man   poor thing   and his wife made full use of every device which a clumsier and more scrupulous sex has learned  with reason and futility  to fear .   ten times in the ensuing week  he cried   robbie stays and that s final .   and each time it was weaker and accompanied by a louder and more agonized groan .   came the day at last  when weston approached his daughter guiltily and suggested a  beautiful  visivox show in the village .   gloria clapped her hands happily   can robbie go .     no  dear   he said  and winced at the sound of his voice   they won t allow robots at the visivox   but you can tell him all about it when you get home .   he stumbled all over the last few words and looked away .   gloria came back from town bubbling over with enthusiasm  for the visivox had been a gorgeous spectacle indeed .   she waited for her father to maneuver the jet car into the sunken garage   wait till i tell robbie  daddy .  he would have liked it like anything .   especially when francis fran was backing away so o o quietly  and backed right into one of the leopard men and had to run .   she laughed again   daddy  are there really leopard men on the moon .     probably not   said weston absently .   it s just funny make believe .   he couldn t take much longer with the car .  he d have to face it .   gloria ran across the lawn .   robbie .   robbie .    then she stopped suddenly at the sight of a beautiful collie which regarded her out of serious brown eyes as it wagged its tail on the porch .    oh  what a nice dog .   gloria climbed the steps  approached cautiously and patted it .   is it for me  daddy .    her mother had joined them .   yes  it is  gloria .  isn t it nice   soft and furry .  it s very gentle .  it likes little girls .     can he play games .     surely .  he can do any number of tricks .  would you like to see some .     right away .  i want robbie to see him  too .   robbie .   she stopped  uncertainly  and frowned   i ll bet he s just staying in his room because he s mad at me for not taking him to the visivox .  you ll have to explain to him  daddy .  he might not believe me  but he knows if you say it  it s so .    weston s lip grew tighter .  he looked toward his wife but could not catch her eye .   gloria turned precipitously and ran down the basement steps  shouting as she went   robbie  come and see what daddy and mamma brought me .  they brought me a dog  robbie .    in a minute she had returned  a frightened little girl .   mamma  robbie isn t in his room .  where is he .   there was no answer and george weston coughed and was suddenly extremely interested in an aimlessly drifting cloud .  gloria s voice quavered on the verge of tears   where s robbie  mamma .    mrs .  weston sat down and drew her daughter gently to her   don t feel bad  gloria .  robbie has gone away  i think .     gone away .  where .  where s he gone away  mamma .     no one knows  darling .  he just walked away .  we ve looked and we ve looked and we ve looked for him  but we can t find him .     you mean he ll never come back again .   her eyes were round with horror .    we may find him soon .  we ll keep looking for him .  and meanwhile you can play with your nice new doggie .  look at him .  his name is lightning and he can    but gloria s eyelids had overflown   i don t want the nasty dog   i want robbie .  i want you to find me robbie .   her feelings became too deep for words  and she spluttered into a shrill wail .   mrs .  weston glanced at her husband for help  but he merely shuffled his feet morosely and did not withdraw his ardent stare from the heavens  so she bent to the task of consolation   why do you cry  gloria .  robbie was only a machine  just a nasty old machine .  he wasn t alive at all .     he was not no machine .   screamed gloria  fiercely and ungrammatically .   he was a person just like you and me and he was my friend .  i want him back .  oh  mamma  i want him back .    her mother groaned in defeat and left gloria to her sorrow .    let her have her cry out   she told her husband .   childish griefs are never lasting .  in a few days  she ll forget that awful robot ever existed .    but time proved mrs .  weston a bit too optimistic .  to be sure  gloria ceased crying  but she ceased smiling  too  and the passing days found her ever more silent and shadowy .  gradually  her attitude of passive unhappiness wore mrs .  weston down and all that kept her from yielding was the impossibility of admitting defeat to her husband .   then  one evening  she flounced into the living room  sat down  folded her arms and looked boiling mad .   her husband stretched his neck in order to see her over his newspaper   what now  grace .     it s that child  george .  i ve had to send back the dog today .  gloria positively couldn t stand the sight of him  she said .  she s driving me into a nervous breakdown .    weston laid down the paper and a hopeful gleam entered his eye   maybe  maybe we ought to get robbie back .  it might be done  you know .  i can get in touch with     no .   she replied  grimly .   i won t hear of it .  we re not giving up that easily .  my child shall not be brought up by a robot if it takes years to break her of it .    weston picked up his paper again with a disappointed air .   a year of this will have me prematurely gray .     you re a big help  george   was the frigid answer .   what gloria needs is a change of environment .  of course she can t forget robbie here .  how can she when every tree and rock reminds her of him .  it is really the silliest situation i have ever heard of .  imagine a child pining away for the loss of a robot .     well  stick to the point .  what s the change in environment you re planning .     we re going to take her to new york .     the city .  in august .  say  do you know what new york is like in august .  it s unbearable .     millions do bear it .     they don t have a place like this to go to .  if they didn t have to stay in new york  they wouldn t .     well  we have to .  i say we re leaving now   or as soon as we can make the arrangements .  in the city  gloria will find sufficient interests and sufficient friends to perk her up and make her forget that machine .     oh  lord   groaned the lesser half   those frying pavements .     we have to   was the unshaken response .   gloria has lost five pounds in the last month and my little girl s health is more important to me than your comfort .     it s a pity you didn t think of your little girl s health before you deprived her of her pet robot   he muttered   but to himself .     gloria displayed immediate signs of improvement when told of the impending trip to the city .  she spoke little of it  but when she did  it was always with lively anticipation .  again  she began to smile and to eat with something of her former appetite .   mrs .  weston hugged herself for joy and lost no opportunity to triumph over her still skeptical husband .    you see  george  she helps with the packing like a little angel  and chatters away as if she hadn t a care in the world .  it s just as i told you   all we need do is substitute other interests .     hmpph   was the skeptical response   i hope so .    preliminaries were gone through quickly .  arrangements were made for the preparation of their city home and a couple were engaged as housekeepers for the country home .  when the day of the trip finally did come  gloria was all but her old self again  and no mention of robbie passed her lips at all .   in high good humor the family took a taxi gyro to the airport  weston would have preferred using his own private  gyro  but it was only a two seater with no room for baggage  and entered the waiting liner .    come  gloria   called mrs .  weston .   i ve saved you a seat near the window so you can watch the scenery .    gloria trotted down the aisle cheerily  flattened her nose into a white oval against the thick clear glass  and watched with an intentness that increased as the sudden coughing of the motor drifted backward into the interior .  she was too young to be frightened when the ground dropped away as if let through a trap door and she herself suddenly became twice her usual weight  but not too young to be mightily interested .  it wasn t until the ground had changed into a tiny patch work quilt that she withdrew her nose  and faced her mother again .    will we soon be in the city  mamma .   she asked  rubbing her chilled nose  and watching with interest as the patch of moisture which her breath had formed on the pane shrank slowly and vanished .    in about half an hour  dear .   then  with just the faintest trace of anxiety   aren t you glad we re going .  don t you think you ll be very happy in the city with all the buildings and people and things to see .  we ll go to the visivox every day and see shows and go to the circus and the beach and     yes  mamma   was gloria s unenthusiastic rejoinder .  the liner passed over a bank of clouds at the moment  and gloria was instantly absorbed in the usual spectacle of clouds underneath one .  then they were over clear sky again  and she turned to her mother with a sudden mysterious air of secret knowledge .    i know why we re going to the city  mamma .     do you .   mrs .  weston was puzzled .   why  dear .     you didn t tell me because you wanted it to be a surprise  but i know .   for a moment  she was lost in admiration at her own acute penetration  and then she laughed gaily .   we re going to new york so we can find robbie  aren t we .   with detectives .    the statement caught george weston in the middle of a drink of water  with disastrous results .  there was a sort of strangled gasp  a geyser of water  and then a bout of choking coughs .  when all was over  he stood there  a red faced  water drenched and very  very annoyed person .   mrs .  weston maintained her composure  but when gloria repeated her question in a more anxious tone of voice  she found her temper rather bent .    maybe   she retorted  tartly .   now sit and be still  for heaven s sake .      new york city       a . d .   was a paradise for the sightseer more than ever in its history .  gloria s parents realized this and made the most of it .   on direct orders from his wife  george weston arranged to have his business take care of itself for a month or so  in order to be free to spend the time in what he  termed  dissipating gloria to the verge of ruin .   like everything else weston did  this was gone about in an efficient  thorough  and business like way .  before the month had passed  nothing that could be done had not been done .   she was taken to the top of the half mile tall roosevelt building  to gaze down in awe upon the jagged panorama of rooftops that blended far off in the fields of long island and the flatlands of new jersey .  they visited the zoos where gloria stared in delicious fright at the  real live lion   rather disappointed that the keepers fed him raw steaks  instead of human beings  as she had expected   and asked insistently and peremptorily to see  the whale .    the various museums came in for their share of attention  together with the parks and the beaches and the aquarium .   she was taken halfway up the hudson in an excursion steamer fitted out in the archaism of the mad twenties .  she travelled into the stratosphere on an exhibition trip  where the sky turned deep purple and the stars came out and the misty earth below looked like a huge concave bowl .  down under the waters of the long island sound she was taken in a glass walled sub sea vessel  where in a green and wavering world  quaint and curious sea things ogled her and wiggled suddenly away .   on a more prosaic level  mrs .  weston took her to the department stores where she could revel in another type of fairyland .   in fact  when the month had nearly sped  the westons were convinced that everything conceivable had been done to take gloria s mind once and for all off the departed robbie   but they were not quite sure they had succeeded .   the fact remained that wherever gloria went  she displayed the most absorbed and concentrated interest in such robots as happened to be present .  no matter how exciting the spectacle before her  nor how novel to her girlish eyes  she turned away instantly if the corner of her eye caught a glimpse of metallic movement .   mrs .  weston went out of her way to keep gloria away from all robots .   and the matter was finally climaxed in the episode at the museum of science and industry .  the museum had announced a special  children s program  in which exhibits of scientific witchery scaled down to the child mind were to be shown .  the westons  of course  placed it upon their list of  absolutely .    it was while the westons were standing totally absorbed in the exploits of a powerful electro magnet that mrs .  weston suddenly became aware of the fact that gloria was no longer with her .  initial panic gave way to calm decision and  enlisting the aid of three attendants  a careful search was begun .   gloria  of course  was not one to wander aimlessly  however .  for her age  she was an unusually determined and purposeful girl  quite full of the maternal genes in that respect .  she had seen a huge sign on the third floor  which had said   this way to the talking robot  having spelled it out to herself and having noticed that her parents did not seem to wish to move in the proper direction  she did the obvious thing .  waiting for an opportune moment of parental distraction  she calmly disengaged herself and followed the sign .     the talking robot was a tour de force  a thoroughly impractical device  possessing publicity value only .  once an hour  an escorted group stood before it and asked questions of the robot engineer in charge in careful whispers .  those the engineer decided were suitable for the robot s circuits were transmitted to the talking robot .   it was rather dull .  it may be nice to know that the square of fourteen is one hundred ninety six  that the temperature at the moment is    degrees fahrenheit  and the air pressure    .    inches of mercury  that the atomic weight of sodium is     but one doesn t really need a robot for that .  one especially does not need an unwieldy  totally immobile mass of wires and coils spreading over twenty five square yards .   few people bothered to return for a second helping  but one girl in her middle teens sat quietly on a bench waiting for a third .  she was the only one in the room when gloria entered .   gloria did not look at her .  to her at the moment  another human being was but an inconsiderable item .  she saved her attention for this large thing with the wheels .  for a moment  she hesitated in dismay .  it didn t look like any robot she had ever seen .   cautiously and doubtfully she raised her treble voice   please  mr .  robot  sir  are you the talking robot  sir .   she wasn t sure  but it seemed to her that a robot that actually talked was worth a great deal of politeness .    the girl in her mid teens allowed a look of intense concentration to cross her thin  plain face .  she whipped out a small notebook and began writing in rapid pot hooks .    there was an oily whir of gears and a mechanically timbred voice boomed out in words that lacked accent and intonation   i  am  the  robot  that  talks .    gloria stared at it ruefully .  it did talk  but the sound came from inside somewheres .  there was no face to talk to .  she said   can you help me  mr .  robot  sir .    the talking robot was designed to answer questions  and only such questions as it could answer had ever been put to it .  it was quite confident of its ability  therefore   i  can  help  you .     thank you  mr .  robot  sir .  have you seen robbie .     who  is robbie .     he s a robot  mr .  robot  sir .   she stretched to tip toes .   he s about so high  mr .  robot  sir  only higher  and he s very nice .  he s got a head  you know .  i mean you haven t  but he has  mr .  robot  sir .    the talking robot had been left behind   a  robot .     yes  mr .  robot  sir .  a robot just like you  except he can t talk  of course  and  looks like a real person .     a  robot  like  me .     yes  mr .  robot  sir .    to which the talking robot s only response was an erratic splutter and an occasional incoherent sound .  the radical generalization offered it  i . e .   its existence  not as a particular object  but as a member of a general group  was too much for it .  loyally  it tried to encompass the concept and half a dozen coils burnt out .  little warning signals were buzzing .    the girl in her mid teens left at that point .  she had enough for her physics   paper on  practical aspects of robotics .   this paper was susan calvin s first of many on the subject .    gloria stood waiting  with carefully concealed impatience  for the machine s answer when she heard the cry behind her of  there she is   and recognized that cry as her mother s .    what are you doing here  you bad girl .   cried mrs .  weston  anxiety dissolving at once into anger .   do you know you frightened your mamma and daddy almost to death .  why did you run away .    the robot engineer had also dashed in  tearing his hair  and demanding who of the gathering crowd had tampered with the machine .   can t anybody read signs .   he yelled .   you re not allowed in here without an attendant .    gloria raised her grieved voice over the din   i only came to see the talking robot  mamma .  i thought he might know where robbie was because they re both robots .   and then  as the thought of robbie was suddenly brought forcefully home to her  she burst into a sudden storm of tears   and i got to find robbie  mamma .  i got to .    mrs .  weston strangled a cry  and said   oh  good heavens .  come home  george .  this is more than i can stand .    that evening  george weston left for several hours  and the next morning  he approached his wife with something that looked suspiciously like smug complacence .    i ve got an idea  grace .     about what .   was the gloomy  uninterested query .    about gloria .     you re not going to suggest buying back that robot .     no  of course not .     then go ahead .  i might as well listen to you .  nothing i ve done seems to have done any good .     all right .  here s what i ve been thinking .  the whole trouble with gloria is that she thinks of robbie as a person and not as a machine .  naturally  she can t forget him .  now if we managed to convince her that robbie was nothing more than a mess of steel and copper in the form of sheets and wires with electricity its juice of life  how long would her longings last .  it s the psychological attack  if you see my point .     how do you plan to do it .     simple .  where do you suppose i went last night .  i persuaded robertson of u .  s .  robots and mechanical men  inc .  to arrange for a complete tour of his premises tomorrow .  the three of us will go  and by the time we re through  gloria will have it drilled into her that a robot is not alive .    mrs .  weston s eyes widened gradually and something glinted in her eyes that was quite like sudden admiration   why  george  that s a good idea .    and george weston s vest buttons strained .   only kind i have   he said .     mr .  struthers was a conscientious general manager and naturally inclined to be a bit talkative .  the combination  therefore  resulted in a tour that was fully explained  perhaps even over abundantly explained  at every step .  however  mrs .  weston was not bored .  indeed  she stopped him several times and begged him to repeat his statements in simpler language so that gloria might understand .  under the influence of this appreciation of his narrative powers  mr .  struthers expanded genially and became ever more communicative  if possible .   george weston  himself  showed a gathering impatience .    pardon me  struthers   he said  breaking into the middle of a lecture on the photo electric cell   haven t you a section of the factory where only robot labor is employed .     eh .  oh  yes .  yes  indeed .   he smiled at mrs .  weston .   a vicious circle in a way  robots creating more robots .  of course  we are not making a general practice out of it .  for one thing  the unions would never let us .  but we can turn out a very few robots using robot labor exclusively  merely as a sort of scientific experiment .  you see   he tapped his pince nez into one palm argumentatively   what the labor unions don t realize   and i say this as a man who has always been very sympathetic with the labor movement in general   is that the advent of the robot  while involving some dislocation to begin with  will inevitably     yes  struthers   said weston   but about that section of the factory you speak of   may we see it .  it would be very interesting  i m sure .     yes .  yes  of course .   mr .  struthers replaced his pince nez in one convulsive movement and gave vent to a soft cough of discomfiture .   follow me  please .    he was comparatively quiet while leading the three through a long corridor and down a flight of stairs .  then  when they had entered a large well lit room that buzzed with metallic activity  the sluices opened and the flood of explanation poured forth again .    there you are .   he said with pride in his voice .   robots only .  five men act as overseers and they don t even stay in this room .  in five years  that is  since we began this project  not a single accident has occurred .  of course  the robots here assembled are comparatively simple  but .  .  .    the general manager s voice had long died to a rather soothing murmur in gloria s ears .  the whole trip seemed rather dull and pointless to her  though there were many robots in sight .  none were even remotely like robbie  though  and she surveyed them with open contempt .   in this room  there weren t any people at all  she noticed .  then her eyes fell upon six or seven robots busily engaged at a round table halfway across the room .  they widened in incredulous surprise .  it was a big room .  she couldn t see for sure  but one of the robots looked like  looked like  it was .    robbie .   her shriek pierced the air  and one of the robots about the table faltered and dropped the tool he was holding .  gloria went almost mad with joy .  squeezing through the railing before either parent could stop her  she dropped lightly to the floor a few feet below  and ran toward her robbie  arms waving and hair flying .   and the three horrified adults  as they stood frozen in their tracks  saw what the excited little girl did not see   a huge  lumbering tractor bearing blindly down upon its appointed track .   it took split seconds for weston to come to his senses  and those split seconds meant everything  for gloria could not be overtaken .  although weston vaulted the railing in a wild attempt  it was obviously hopeless .  mr .  struthers signalled wildly to the overseers to stop the tractor  but the overseers were only human and it took time to act .   it was only robbie that acted immediately and with precision .   with metal legs eating up the space between himself and his little mistress he charged down from the opposite direction .  everything then happened at once .  with one sweep of an arm  robbie snatched up gloria  slackening his speed not one iota  and  consequently  knocking every breath of air out of her .  weston  not quite comprehending all that was happening  felt  rather than saw  robbie brush past him  and came to a sudden bewildered halt .  the tractor intersected gloria s path half a second after robbie had  rolled on ten feet further and came to a grinding  long drawn out stop .   gloria regained her breath  submitted to a series of passionate hugs on the part of both her parents and turned eagerly toward robbie .  as far as she was concerned  nothing had happened except that she had found her friend .   but mrs .  weston s expression had changed from one of relief to one of dark suspicion .  she turned to her husband  and  despite her disheveled and undignified appearance  managed to look quite formidable   you engineered this  didn t you .   george weston swabbed at a hot forehead with his handkerchief .  his hand was unsteady  and his lips could curve only into a tremulous and exceedingly weak smile .   mrs .  weston pursued the thought   robbie wasn t designed for engineering or construction work .  he couldn t be of any use to them .  you had him placed there deliberately so that gloria would find him .  you know you did .     well  i did   said weston .   but  grace  how was i to know the reunion would be so violent .  and robbie has saved her life  you ll have to admit that .  you can t send him away again .    grace weston considered .  she turned toward gloria and robbie and watched them abstractedly for a moment .  gloria had a grip about the robot s neck that would have asphyxiated any creature but one of metal  and was prattling nonsense in half hysterical frenzy .  robbie s chromesteel arms  capable of bending a bar of steel two inches in diameter into a pretzel  wound about the little girl gently and lovingly  and his eyes glowed a deep  deep red .    well   said mrs .  weston  at last   i guess he can stay with us until he rusts .             susan calvin shrugged her shoulders   of course  he didn t .  that was      .  by       we had invented the mobile speaking robot which  of course  made all the non speaking models out of date  and which seemed to be the final straw as far as the non robot elements were concerned .  most of the world governments banned robot use on earth for any purpose other than scientific research between      and      .     so that gloria had to give up robbie eventually .     i m afraid so .  i imagine  however  that it was easier for her at the age of fifteen than at eight .  still  it was a stupid and unnecessary attitude on the part of humanity .  u .  s .  robots hit its low point  financially  just about the time i joined them in      .  at first  i thought my job might come to a sudden end in a matter of months  but then we simply developed the extra terrestrial market .     and then you were set  of course .     not quite .  we began by trying to adapt the models we had on hand .  those first speaking models  for instance .  they were about twelve feet high  very clumsy and not much good .  we sent them out to mercury to help build the mining station there  but that failed .    i looked up in surprise   it did .  why  mercury mines is a multi billion dollar concern .     it is now  but it was a second attempt that succeeded .  it you want to know about that  young man  i d advise you to look up gregory powell .  he and michael donovan handled our most difficult cases in the teens and twenties .  i haven t heard from donovan in years  but powell is living right here in new york .  he s a grandfather now  which is a thought difficult to get used to .  i can only think of him as a rather young man .  of course  i was younger  too .    i tried to keep her talking   if you would give me the bare bones  dr .  calvin  i can have mr .  powell fill it in afterward .    and this was exactly what i later did .    she spread her thin hands out upon the desk and looked at them .   there are two or three   she said   that i know a little about .     start with mercury   i suggested .    well  i think it was in      that the second mercury expedition was sent out .  it was exploratory and financed in part by u .  s .  robots and in part by solar minerals .  it consisted of a new type robot  still experimental  gregory powell  michael donovan      runaround    it was one of gregory powell s favorite platitudes that nothing was to be gained from excitement  so when mike donovan came leaping down the stairs toward him  red hair matted with perspiration  powell frowned .    what s wrong .   he said .   break a fingernail .     yaaaah   snarled donovan  feverishly .   what have you been doing in the sublevels all day .   he took a deep breath and blurted out   speedy never returned .    powell s eyes widened momentarily and he stopped on the stairs  then he recovered and resumed his upward steps .  he didn t speak until he reached the head of the flight  and then    you sent him after the selenium .     yes .     and how long has he been out .     five hours now .    silence .  this was a devil of a situation .  here they were  on mercury exactly twelve hours and already up to the eyebrows in the worst sort of trouble .  mercury had long been the jinx world of the system  but this was drawing it rather strong   even for a jinx .   powell said   start at the beginning  and let s get this straight .    they were in the radio room now   with its already subtly antiquated equipment  untouched for the ten years previous to their arrival .  even ten years  technologically speaking  meant so much .  compare speedy with the type of robot they must have had back in      .  but then  advances in robotics these days were tremendous .  powell touched a still gleaming metal surface gingerly .  the air of disuse that touched everything about the room   and the entire station   was infinitely depressing .   donovan must have felt it .  he began   i tried to locate him by radio  but it was no go .  radio isn t any good on the mercury sunside   not past two miles  anyway .  that s one of the reasons the first expedition failed .  and we can t put up the ultrawave equipment for weeks yet      skip all that .  what did you get .     i located the unorganized body signal in the short wave .  it was no good for anything except his position .  i kept track of him that way for two hours and plotted the results on the map .    there was a yellowed square of parchment in his hip pocket   a relic of the unsuccessful first expedition   and he slapped it down on the desk with vicious force  spreading it flat with the palm of his hand .  powell  hands clasped across his chest  watched it at long range .   donovan s pencil pointed nervously .   the red cross is the selenium pool .  you marked it yourself .     which one is it .   interrupted powell .   there were three that macdougal located for us before he left .     i sent speedy to the nearest  naturally .  seventeen miles away .  but what difference does that make .   there was tension in his voice .   there are the penciled dots that mark speedy s position .    and for the first time powell s artificial aplomb was shaken and his hands shot forward for the map .    are you serious .  this is impossible .     there it is   growled donovan .   the little dots that marked the position formed a rough circle about the red cross of the selenium pool .  and powell s fingers went to his brown mustache  the unfailing signal of anxiety .   donovan added   in the two hours i checked on him  he circled that damned pool four times .  it seems likely to me that he ll keep that up forever .  do you realize the position we re in .    powell looked up shortly  and said nothing .  oh  yes  he realized the position they were in .  it worked itself out as simply as a syllogism .  the photo cell banks that alone stood between the full power of mercury s monstrous sun and themselves were shot to hell .   the only thing that could save them was selenium .  the only thing that could get the selenium was speedy .  if speedy didn t come back  no selenium .  no selenium  no photo cell banks .  no photo banks   well  death by slow broiling is one of the more unpleasant ways of being done in .   donovan rubbed his red mop of hair savagely and expressed himself with bitterness .   we ll be the laughingstock of the system  greg .  how can everything have gone so wrong so soon .  the great team of powell and donovan is sent out to mercury to report on the advisability of reopening the sunside mining station with modern techniques and robots and we ruin everything the first day .  a purely routine job  too .  we ll never live it down .     we won t have to  perhaps   replied powell  quietly .   if we don t do something quickly  living anything down   or even just plain living   will be out of the question .     don t be stupid .  if you feel funny about it  greg  i don t .  it was criminal  sending us out here with only one robot .  and it was your bright idea that we could handle the photo cell banks ourselves .     now you re being unfair .  it was a mutual decision and you know it .  all we needed was a kilogram of selenium  a stillhead dielectrode plate and about three hours  time and there are pools of pure selenium all over sunside .  macdougal s spectroreflector spotted three for us in five minutes  didn t it .  what the devil .  we couldn t have waited for next conjunction .     well  what are we going to do .  powell  you ve got an idea .  i know you have  or you wouldn t be so calm .  you re no more a hero than i am .  go on  spill it .     we can t go after speedy ourselves  mike  not on the sunside .  even the new insosuits aren t good for more than twenty minutes in direct sunlight .  but you know the old saying   set a robot to catch a robot  look  mike  maybe things aren t so bad .  we ve got six robots down in the sublevels  that we may be able to use  if they work .  if they work .    there was a glint of sudden hope in donovan s eyes .   you mean six robots from the first expedition .  are you sure .  they may be subrobotic machines .  ten years is a long time as far as robot types are concerned  you know .     no  they re robots .  i ve spent all day with them and i know .  they ve got positronic brains  primitive  of course .   he placed the map in his pocket .   let s go down .    the robots were on the lowest sublevel   all six of them surrounded by musty packing cases of uncertain content .  they were large  extremely so  and even though they were in a sitting position on the floor  legs straddled out before them  their heads were a good seven feet in the air .   donovan whistled .   look at the size of them  will you .  the chests must be ten feet around .     that s because they re supplied with the old mcguffy gears .  i ve been over the insides   crummiest set you ve ever seen .     have you powered them yet .     no .  there wasn t any reason to .  i don t think there s anything wrong with them .  even the diaphragm is in reasonable order .  they might talk .    he had unscrewed the chest plate of the nearest as he spoke  inserted the two inch sphere that contained the tiny spark of atomic energy that was a robot s life .  there was difficulty in fitting it  but he managed  and then screwed the plate back on again in laborious fashion .  the radio controls of more modern models had not been heard of ten years earlier .  and then to the other five .   donovan said uneasily   they haven t moved .     no orders to do so   replied powell  succinctly .  he went back to the first in the line and struck him on the chest .   you .  do you hear me .    the monster s head bent slowly and the eyes fixed themselves on powell .  then  in a harsh  squawking voice   like that of a medieval phonograph  he grated   yes  master .    powell grinned humorlessly at donovan .   did you get that .  those were the days of the first talking robots when it looked as if the use of robots on earth would be banned .  the makers were fighting that and they built good  healthy slave complexes into the damned machines .     it didn t help them   muttered donovan .    no  it didn t  but they sure tried .   he turned once more to the robot .   get up .    the robot towered upward slowly and donovan s head craned and his puckered lips whistled .   powell said   can you go out upon the surface .  in the light .    there was consideration while the robot s slow brain worked .  then   yes  master .     good .  do you know what a mile is .    another consideration  and another glow answer .   yes  master .     we will take you up to the surface then  and indicate a direction .  you will go about seventeen miles  and somewhere in that general region you will meet  another robot  smaller than yourself .  you understand so far .     yes  master .     you will find this robot and order him to return .  if he does not wish to  you are to bring him back by force .    donovan clutched at powell s sleeve .   why not send him for the selenium direct .     because i want speedy back  nitwit .  i want to find out what s wrong with him .   and to the robot   all right  you  follow me .    the robot remained motionless and his voice rumbled   pardon  master  but i cannot .  you must mount first .   his clumsy arms had come together with a thwack  blunt fingers interlacing .   powell stared and then pinched at his mustache .   uh .  .  .  oh .    donovan s eyes bulged .   we ve got to ride him .  like a horse .     i guess that s the idea .  i don t know why  though .  i can t see  yes  i do .  i told you they were playing up robot safety in those days .  evidently  they were going to sell the notion of safety by not allowing them to move about  without a mahout on their shoulders all the time .  what do we do now .     that s what i ve been thinking   muttered donovan .   we can t go out on the surface  with a robot or without .  oh  for the love of pete    and he snapped his fingers twice .  he grew excited .   give me that map you ve got .  i haven t studied it for two hours for nothing .  this is a mining station .  what s wrong with using the tunnels .    the mining station was a black circle on the map  and the light dotted lines that were tunnels stretched out about it in spiderweb fashion .   donovan studied the list of symbols at the bottom of the map .   look   he said   the small black dots are openings to the surface  and here s one maybe three miles away from the selenium pool .  there s a number here   you d think they d write larger     a .  if the robots know their way around here    powell shot the question and received the dull  yes  master   in reply .   get your insosuit   he said with satisfaction .   it was the first time either had worn the insosuits   which marked one time more than either had expected to upon their arrival the day before   and they tested their limb movements uncomfortably .   the insosuit was far bulkier and far uglier than the regulation spacesuit  but withal considerably lighter  due to the fact that they were entirely nonmetallic in composition .  composed of heat resistant plastic and chemically treated cork layers  and equipped with a desiccating unit to keep the air bone dry  the insosuits could withstand the full glare of mercury s sun for twenty minutes .  five to ten minutes more  as well  without actually killing the occupant .   and still the robot s hands formed the stirrup  nor did he betray the slightest atom of surprise at the grotesque figure into which powell had been converted .   powell s radio harshened voice boomed out   are you ready to take us to exit   a .     yes  master .    good  thought powell  they might lack radio control but at least they were fitted for radio reception .   mount one or the other  mike   he said to donovan .   he placed a foot in the improvised stirrup and swung upward .  he found the seat comfortable  there was the humped back of the robot  evidently shaped for the purpose  a shallow groove along each shoulder for the thighs and two elongated  ears  whose purpose now seemed obvious .   powell seized the ears and twisted the head .  his mount turned ponderously .   lead on  macduff .   but he did not feel at all lighthearted .   the gigantic robots moved slowly  with mechanical precision  through the doorway that cleared their heads by a scant foot  so that the two men had to duck hurriedly  along a narrow corridor in which their unhurried footsteps boomed monotonously and into the  air lock .   the long  airless tunnel that stretched to a pinpoint before them brought home forcefully to powell the exact magnitude of the task accomplished by the first expedition  with their crude robots and their start from scratch necessities .  they might have been a failure  but their failure was a good deal better than the usual run of the system s successes .   the robots plodded onward with a pace that never varied and with footsteps that never lengthened .   powell said   notice that these tunnels are blazing with lights and that the temperature is earth normal .  it s probably been like this all the ten years that this place has remained empty .     how s that .     cheap energy  cheapest in the system .  sunpower  you know  and on mercury s sunside  sunpower is something .  that s why the station was built in the sunlight rather than in the shadow of a mountain .  it s really a huge energy converter .  the heat is turned into electricity  light  mechanical work and what have you  so that energy is supplied and the station is cooled in a simultaneous process .     look   said donovan .   this is all very educational  but would you mind changing the subject .  it so happens that this conversion of energy that you talk about is carried on by the photo cell banks mainly   and that is a tender subject with me at the moment .    powell grunted vaguely  and when donovan broke the resulting silence  it was to change the subject completely .   listen  greg .  what the devil s wrong with speedy  anyway .  i can t understand it .    it s not easy to shrug shoulders in an insosuit  but powell tried it .   i don t know  mike .  you know he s perfectly adapted to a mercurian environment .  heat doesn t mean anything to him and he s built for the light gravity and the broken ground .  he s foolproof or  at least  he should be .    silence fell .  this time  silence that lasted .    master   said the robot   we are here .     eh .   powell snapped out of a semidrowse .   well  get us out of here   out to the surface .    they found themselves in a tiny substation  empty  airless  ruined .  donovan had inspected a jagged hole in the upper reaches of one of the walls by the light of his pocket flash .    meteorite  do you suppose .   he had asked .   powell shrugged .   to hell with that .  it doesn t matter .  let s get out .    a towering cliff of a black  basaltic rock cut off the sunlight  and the deep night shadow of an airless world surrounded them .  before them  the shadow reached out and ended in knife edge abruptness into an all but unbearable blaze of white light  that glittered from myriad crystals along a rocky ground .    space .   gasped donovan .   it looks like snow .   and it did .   powell s eyes swept the jagged glitter of mercury to the horizon and winced at the gorgeous brilliance .    this must be an unusual area   he said .   the general albedo of mercury is low and most of the soil is gray pumice .  something like the moon  you know .  beautiful  isn t it .    he was thankful for the light filters in their visiplates .  beautiful or not  a look at the sunlight through straight glass would have blinded them inside of half a minute .   donovan was looking at the spring thermometer on his wrist .   holy smokes  the temperature is eighty centigrade .    powell checked his own and said   um m m .  a little high .  atmosphere  you know .     on mercury .  are you nuts .     mercury isn t really airless   explained powell  in absentminded fashion .  he was adjusting the binocular attachments to his visiplate  and the bloated fingers of the insosuit were clumsy at it .   there is a thin exhalation that clings to its surface   vapors of the more volatile elements and compounds that are heavy enough for mercurian gravity to retain .  you know  selenium  iodine  mercury  gallium  potassium  bismuth  volatile oxides .  the vapors sweep into the shadows and condense  giving up heat .  it s a sort of gigantic still .  in fact  if you use your flash  you ll probably find that the side of the cliff is covered with  say  hoar sulphur  or maybe quicksilver dew .    it doesn t matter  though .  our suits can stand a measly eighty indefinitely .    powell had adjusted the binocular attachments  so that he seemed as eye stalked as a snail .   donovan watched tensely .   see anything .    the other did not answer immediately  and when he did  his voice was anxious and thoughtful .   there s a dark spot on the horizon that might be the selenium pool .  it s in the right place .  but i don t see speedy .    powell clambered upward in an instinctive striving for better view  till he was standing in unsteady fashion upon his robot s shoulders .  legs straddled wide  eyes straining  he said   i think .  .  .  i think  yes  it s definitely he .  he s coming this way .    donovan followed the pointing flnger .  he had no binoculars  but there was a tiny moving dot  black against the blazing brilliance of the crystalline ground .    i see him   he yelled .   let s get going .    powell had hopped down into a sitting position on the robot again  and his suited hand slapped against the gargantuan s barrel chest .   get going .     giddy ap   yelled donovan  and thumped his heels  spur fashion .   the robots started off  the regular thudding of their footsteps silent in the airlessness  for the nonmetallic fabric of the insosuits did not transmit sound .  there was only a rhythmic vibration just below the border of actual hearing .    faster   yelled donovan .  the rhythm did not change .    no use   cried powell  in reply .   these junk heaps are only geared to one speed .  do you think they re equipped with selective flexors .    they had burst through the shadow  and the sunlight came down in a white hot wash and poured liquidly about them .   donovan ducked involuntarily .   wow .  is it imagination or do i feel heat .     you ll feel more presently   was the grim reply .   keep your eye on speedy .    robot spd    was near enough to be seen in detail now .  his graceful  streamlined body threw out blazing highlights as he loped with easy speed across the broken ground .  his name was derived from his serial initials  of course  but it was apt  nevertheless  for the spd models were among the fastest robots turned out by the united states robot   mechanical men corp .    hey  speedy   howled donovan  and waved a frantic hand .    speedy .   shouted powell .   come here .    the distance between the men and the errant robot was being cut down momentarily   more by the efforts of speedy than the slow plodding of the fifty year old antique mounts of donovan and powell .   they were close enough now to notice that speedy s gait included a peculiar rolling stagger  a noticeable side to side lurch  and then  as powell waved his hand again and sent maximum juice into his compact head set radio sender  in preparation for another shout  speedy looked up and saw them .   speedy hopped to a halt and remained standing for a moment with just a tiny  unsteady weave  as though he were swaying in a light wind .   powell yelled   all right  speedy .  come here  boy .    whereupon speedy s robot voice sounded in powell s ear .  phones for the first time .   it said   hot dog  let s play games .  you catch me and i catch you  no love can cut our knife in two .  for i m little buttercup  sweet little buttercup .  whoops .   turning on his heel  he sped off in the direction from which he had come  with a speed and fury that kicked up gouts of baked dust .   and his last words as he receded into the distance were   there grew a little flower  neath a great oak tree   followed by a curious metallic clicking that might have been a robotic equivalent of a hiccup .   donovan said weakly   where did he pick up the gilbert and sullivan .  say  greg  he .  .  .  he s drunk or something .     if you hadn t told me   was the bitter response   i d never realize it .  let s get back to the cliff .  i m roasting .    it was powell who broke the desperate silence .   in the first place   he said   speedy isn t drunk   not in the human sense   because he s a robot  and robots don t get drunk .  however  there s something wrong with him which is the robotic equivalent of drunkenness    to me  he s drunk   stated donovan  emphatically   and all i know is that he thinks we re playing games .  and we re not .  it s a matter of life and very gruesome death .     all right .  don t hurry me .  a robot s only a robot .  once we find out what s wrong with him  we can fix it and go on .     once   said donovan  sourly .   powell ignored him .   speedy is perfectly adapted to normal mercurian environment .  but this region   and his arm swept wide   is definitely abnormal .  there s our clue .  now where do these crystals come from .  they might have formed from a slowly cooling liquid  but where would you get liquid so hot that it would cool in mercury s sun .     volcanic action   suggested donovan  instantly  and powell s body tensed .    out of the mouths of sucklings    he said in a small  strange voice and remained very still for five minutes .   then  he said   listen  mike  what did you say to speedy when you sent him after the selenium .    donovan was taken aback .   well damn it  i don t know .  i just told him to get it .     yes  i know .  but how .  try to remember the exact words .     i said .  .  .  uh .  .  .  i said   speedy  we need some selenium .  you can get it such and such a place .  go get it  that s all .  what more did you want me to say .     you didn t put any urgency into the order  did you .     what for .  it was pure routine .    powell sighed .   well  it can t be helped now   but we re in a fine fix .   he had dismounted from his robot  and was sitting  back against the cliff .  donovan joined him and they linked arms  in the distance the burning sunlight seemed to wait cat and mouse for them  and just next them  the two giant robots were invisible but for the dull red of their photoelectric eyes that stared down at them  unblinking  unwavering and unconcerned .   unconcerned .  as was all this poisonous mercury  as large in jinx as it was small in size .   powell s radio voice was tense in donovan s ear   now  look  let s start with the three fundamental rules of robotics   the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot s positronic brain .   in the darkness  his gloved fingers ticked off each point .    we have  one  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     right .     two   continued powell   a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     right    and three  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .     right .  now where are we .     exactly at the explanation .  the conflict between the various rules is ironed out by the different positronic potentials in the brain .  we ll say that a robot is walking into danger and knows it .  the automatic potential that rule   sets up turns him back .  but suppose you order him to walk into that danger .  in that case  rule   sets up a counterpotential higher than the previous one and the robot follows orders at the risk of existence .     well  i know that .  what about it .     let s take speedy s case .  speedy is one of the latest models  extremely specialized  and as expensive as a battleship .  it s not a thing to be lightly destroyed    so .     so rule   has been strengthened   that was specifically mentioned  by the way  in the advance notices on the spd models   so that his allergy to danger is unusually high .  at the same time  when you sent him out after the selenium  you gave him his order casually and without special emphasis  so that the rule   potential set up was rather weak .  now  hold on  i m just stating facts .     all right  go ahead .  i think i get it .     you see how it works  don t you .  there s some sort of danger centering at the selenium pool .  it increases as he approaches  and at a certain distance from it the rule   potential  unusually high to start with  exactly balances the rule   potential  unusually low to start with .    donovan rose to his feet in excitement .    and it strikes an equilibrium .  i see .  rule   drives him back and rule   drives him forward     so he follows a circle around the selenium pool  staying on the locus of all points of potential equilibrium .  and unless we do something about it  he ll stay on that circle forever  giving us the good old runaround .   then  more thoughtfully   and that  by the way  is what makes him drunk .  at potential equilibrium  half the positronic paths of his brain are out of kilter .  i m not a robot specialist  but that seems obvious .  probably he s lost control of just those parts of his voluntary mechanism that a human drunk has .  ve e ery pretty .     but what s the danger .  if we knew what he was running from     you suggested it .  volcanic action .  somewhere right above the selenium pool is a seepage of gas from the bowels of mercury .  sulphur dioxide  carbon dioxide   and carbon monoxide .  lots of it and at this temperature .    donovan gulped audibly .   carbon monoxide plus iron gives the volatile iron carbonyl .     and a robot   added powell   is essentially iron .   then  grimly   there s nothing like deduction .  we ve determined everything about our problem but the solution .  we can t get the selenium ourselves .  it s still too far .  we can t send these robot horses  because they can t go themselves  and they can t carry us fast enough to keep us from crisping .  and we can t catch speedy  because the dope thinks we re playing games  and he can run sixty miles to our four .     if one of us goes   began donovan  tentatively   and comes back cooked  there ll still be the other .     yes   came the sarcastic reply   it would be a most tender sacrifice   except that a person would be in no condition to give orders before he ever reached the pool  and i don t think the robots would ever turn back to the cliff without orders .  figure it out .  we re two or three miles from the pool   call it two   the robot travels at four miles an hour  and we can last twenty minutes in our suits .  it isn t only the heat  remember .  solar radiation out here in the ultraviolet and below is poison .     um m m   said donovan   ten minutes short .     as good as an eternity .  and another thing .  in order for rule   potential to have stopped speedy where it did  there must be an appreciable amount of carbon monoxide in the metal vapor atmosphere   and there must be an appreciable corrosive action therefore .  he s been out hours now   and how do we know when a knee joint  for instance  won t be thrown out of kilter and keel him over .  it s not only a question of thinking   we ve got to think fast .    deep  dark  dank  dismal silence .   donovan broke it  voice trembling in an effort to keep itself emotionless .  he said   as long as we can t increase rule   potential by giving further orders  how about working the other way .  if we increase the danger  we increase rule   potential and drive him backward .    powell s visiplate had turned toward him in a silent question .    you see   came the cautious explanation   all we need to do to drive him out of his rut is to increase the concentration of carbon monoxide in his vicinity .  well  back at the station there s a complete analytical laboratory .     naturally   assented powell .   it s a mining station .     all right .  there must be pounds of oxalic acid for calcium precipitations .     holy space .  mike  you re a genius .     so so   admitted donovan  modestly .   it s just a case of remembering that oxalic acid on heating decomposes into carbon dioxide  water  and good old carbon monoxide .  college chem  you know .    powell was on his feet and had attracted the attention of one of the monster robots by the simple expedient of pounding the machine s thigh .    hey   he shouted   can you throw .     master .     never mind .   powell damned the robot s molasses slow brain .  he scrabbled up a jagged brick size rock .   take this   he said   and hit the patch of bluish crystals just across the crooked fissure .  you see it .    donovan pulled at his shoulder .   too far  greg .  it s almost half a mile off .     quiet   replied powell .   it s a case of mercurian gravity and a steel throwing arm .  watch  will you .    the robot s eyes were measuring the distance with machinely accurate stereoscopy .  his arm adjusted itself to the weight of the missile and drew back .  in the darkness  the robot s motions went unseen  but there was a sudden thumping sound as he shifted his weight  and seconds later the rock flew blackly into the sunlight .  there was no air resistance to slow it down  nor wind to turn it aside   and when it hit the ground it threw up crystals precisely in the center of the  blue patch .    powell yelled happily and shouted   let s go back after the oxalic acid  mike .    and as they plunged into the ruined substation on the way back to the tunnels  donovan said grimly   speedy s been hanging about on this side of the selenium pool  ever since we chased after him .  did you see him .     yes .     i guess he wants to play games .  well  we ll play him games .      they were back hours later  with three liter jars of the white chemical and a pair of long faces .  the photo cell banks were deteriorating more rapidly than had seemed likely .  the two steered their robots into the sunlight and toward the waiting speedy in silence and with grim purpose .   speedy galloped slowly toward them .   here we are again .  whee .  i ve made a little list  the piano organist  all people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face .     we ll puff something in your face   muttered donovan .   he s limping  greg .     i noticed that   came the low  worried response .   the monoxide ll get him yet  if we don t hurry .    they were approaching cautiously now  almost sidling  to refrain from setting off the thoroughly irrational robot .  powell was too far off to tell  of course  but even already he could have sworn the crack brained speedy was setting himself for a spring .    let her go   he gasped .   count three .  one  two    two steel arms drew back and snapped forward simultaneously and two glass jars whirled forward in towering parallel arcs  gleaming like diamonds in the impossible sun .  and in a pair of soundless puffs  they hit the ground behind speedy in crashes that sent the oxalic acid flying like dust .   in the full heat of mercury s sun  powell knew it was fizzing like soda water .   speedy turned to stare  then backed away from it slowly   and as slowly gathered speed .  in fifteen seconds  he was leaping directly toward the two humans in an unsteady canter .   powell did not get speedy s words just then  though he heard something that resembled   lover s professions when uttered in hessians .    he turned away .   back to the cliff  mike .  he s out of the rut and he ll be taking orders now .  i m getting hot .    they jogged toward the shadow at the slow monotonous pace of their mounts  and it was not until they had entered it and felt the sudden coolness settle softly about them that donovan looked back .   greg .    powell looked and almost shrieked .  speedy was moving slowly now  so slowly  and in the wrong direction .  he was drifting  drifting back into his rut  and he was picking up speed .  he looked dreadfully close  and dreadfully unreachable  in the binoculars .   donovan shouted wildly   after him .   and thumped his robot into its pace  but powell called him back .    you won t catch him  mike   it s no use .   he fidgeted on his robot s shoulders and clenched his fist in tight impotence .   why the devil do i see these things five seconds after it s all over .  mike  we ve wasted hours .     we need more oxalic acid   declared donovan  stolidly .   the concentration wasn t high enough .     seven tons of it wouldn t have been enough   and we haven t the hours to spare to get it  even if it were  with the monoxide chewing him away .  don t you see what it is  mike .    and donovan said flatly   no .     we were only establishing new equilibriums .  when we create new monoxide and increase rule   potential  he moves backward till he s in balance again   and when the monoxide drifted away  he moved forward  and again there was balance .    powell s voice sounded thoroughly wretched .   it s the same old runaround .  we can push at rule   and pull at rule   and we can t get anywhere   we can only change the position of balance .  we ve got to get outside both rules .   and then he pushed his robot closer to donovan s so that they were sitting face to face  dim shadows in the darkness  and he whispered   mike .     is it the finish .   dully .   i suppose we go back to the station  wait for the banks to fold  shake hands  take cyanide  and go out like gentlemen .   he laughed shortly .    mike   repeated powell earnestly   we ve got to get speedy .     i know .     mike   once more  and powell hesitated before continuing .   there s always rule   .  i thought of it  earlier  but it s desperate .    donovan looked up and his voice livened .   we re desperate .     all right .  according to rule    a robot can t see a human come to harm because of his own inaction .  two and   can t stand against it .  they can t  mike .     even when the robot is half cra  well  he s drunk .  you know he is .     it s the chances you take .     cut it .  what are you going to do .     i m going out there now and see what rule   will do .  if it won t break the balance  then what the devil   it s either now or three four days from now .     hold on  greg .  there are human rules of behavior  too .  you don t go out there just like that .  figure out a lottery  and give me my chance .     all right .  first to get the cube of fourteen goes .   and almost immediately   twenty seven forty four .    donovan felt his robot stagger at a sudden push by powell s mount and then powell was off into the sunlight .  donovan opened his mouth to shout  and then clicked it shut .  of course  the damn fool had worked out the cube of fourteen in advance  and on purpose .  just like him .     the sun was hotter than ever and powell felt a maddening itch in the small of his back .  imagination  probably  or perhaps hard radiation beginning to tell even through the insosuit .   speedy was watching him  without a word of gilbert and sullivan gibberish as greeting .  thank god for that .  but he daren t get too close .   he was three hundred yards away when speedy began backing  a step at a time  cautiously   and powell stopped .  he jumped from his robot s shoulders and landed on the crystalline ground with a light thump and a flying of jagged fragments .   he proceeded on foot  the ground gritty and slippery to his steps  the low gravity causing him difficulty .  the soles of his feet tickled with warmth .  he cast one glance over his shoulder at the blackness of the cliff s shadow and realized that he had come too far to return   either by himself or by the help of his antique robot .  it was speedy or nothing now  and the knowledge of that constricted his chest .   far enough .  he stopped .    speedy   he called .   speedy .    the sleek  modern robot ahead of him hesitated and halted his backward steps  then resumed them .   powell tried to put a note of pleading into his voice  and found it didn t take much acting .   speedy  i ve got to get back to the shadow or the sun ll get me .  it s life or death  speedy .  i need you .    speedy took one step forward and stopped .  he spoke  but at the sound powell groaned  for it was   when you re lying awake with a dismal headache and repose is tabooed   it trailed off there  and powell took time out for some reason to murmur   iolanthe .    it was roasting hot .  he caught a movement out of the corner of his eye  and whirled dizzily  then stared in utter astonishment  for the monstrous robot on which he had ridden was moving   moving toward him  and without a rider .   he was talking   pardon  master .  i must not move without a master upon me  but you are in danger .    of course  rule   potential above everything .  but he didn t want that clumsy antique  he wanted speedy .  he walked away and motioned frantically   i order you to stay away .  i order you to stop .    it was quite useless .  you could not beat rule   potential .  the robot said stupidly   you are in danger  master .    powell looked about him desperately .  he couldn t see clearly .  his brain was in a heated whirl  his breath scorched when he breathed  and the ground all about him was a shimmering haze .   he called a last time  desperately   speedy .  i m dying  damn you .  where are you .  speedy  i need you .    he was still stumbling backward in a blind effort to get away from the giant robot he didn t want  when he felt steel fingers on his arms  and a worried  apologetic voice of metallic timbre in his ears .    holy smokes  boss  what are you doing here .  and what am i doing  i m so confused     never mind   murmured powell  weakly .   get me to the shadow of the cliff   and hurry .   there was one last feeling of being lifted into the air and a sensation of rapid motion and burning heat  and he passed out .   he woke with donovan bending over him and smiling anxiously .   how are you  greg .     fine .   came the response .   where s speedy .     right here .  i sent him out to one of the other selenium pools   with orders to get that selenium at all cost this time .  he got it back in forty two minutes and three seconds .  i timed him .  he still hasn t finished apologizing for the runaround he gave us .  he s scared to come near you for fear of what you ll say .     drag him over   ordered powell .   it wasn t his fault .   he held out a hand and gripped speedy s metal paw .   it s o . k .   speedy .   then  to donovan   you know  mike  i was just thinking     yes .     well    he rubbed his face   the air was so delightfully cool   you know that when we get things set up here and speedy put through his field tests  they re going to send us to the space stations next     no .     yes .  at least that s what old lady calvin told me just before we left  and i didn t say anything about it  because i was going to fight the whole idea .     fight it .   cried donovan .   but         i know .  it s all right with me now .  two hundred seventy three degrees centigrade below zero .  won t it be a pleasure .     space station   said donovan   here i come .             reason       half a year later  the boys had changed their minds .  the flame of a giant sun had given way to the soft blackness of space but external variations mean little in the business of checking the workings of experimental robots .  whatever the background  one is face to face with an inscrutable positronic brain  which the slide rule geniuses say should work thus and so .   except that they don t .  powell and donovan found that out after they had been on the station less than two weeks .   gregory powell spaced his words for emphasis   one week ago  donovan and i put you together .   his brows furrowed doubtfully and he pulled the end of his brown mustache .   it was quiet in the officer s room on solar station      except for the soft purring of the mighty beam director somewhere far below .   robot qt   sat immovable .  the burnished plates of his body gleamed in the luxites and the glowing red of the photoelectric cells that were his eyes  were fixed steadily upon the earthman at the other side of the table .   powell repressed a sudden attack of nerves .  these robots possessed peculiar brains .  oh  the three laws of robotics held .  they had to .  all of u .  s .  robots  from robertson himself to the new floor sweeper  would insist on that .  so qt   was safe .  and yet the qt models were the first of their kind  and this was the first of the qt s .  mathematical squiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact .   finally  the robot spoke .  his voice carried the cold timbre inseparable from a metallic diaphragm   do you realize the seriousness of such a statement  powell .     something made you  cutie   pointed out powell .   you admit yourself that your memory seems to spring full grown from an absolute blankness of a week ago .  i m giving you the explanation .  donovan and i put you together from the parts shipped us .    cutie gazed upon his long  supple fingers in an oddly human attitude of mystification   it strikes me that there should be a more satisfactory explanation than that .  for you to make me seems improbable .    the earthman laughed quite suddenly   in earth s name  why .     call it intuition .  that s all it is so far .  but i intend to reason it out  though .  a chain of valid reasoning can end only with the determination of truth  and i ll stick till i get there .    powell stood up and seated himself at the table s edge next to the robot .  he felt a sudden strong sympathy for this strange machine .  it was not at all like the ordinary robot  attending to his specialized task at the station with the intensity of a deeply ingrooved positronic path .   he placed a hand upon cutie s steel shoulder and the metal was cold and hard to the touch .    cutie   he said   i m going to try to explain something to you .  you re the first robot who s ever exhibited curiosity as to his own existence   and i think the first that s really intelligent enough to understand the world outside .  here  come with me .    the robot rose erect smoothly and his thickly sponge rubber soled feet made no noise as he followed powell .  the earthman touched a button and a square section of the wall flickered aside .  the thick  clear glass revealed space   starspeckled .    i ve seen that in the observation ports in the engine room   said cutie .    i know   said powell .   what do you think it is .     exactly what it seems   a black material just beyond this glass that is spotted with little gleaming dots .  i know that our director sends out beams to some of these dots  always to the same ones   and also that these dots shift and that the beams shift with them .  that is all .     good .  now i want you to listen carefully .  the blackness is emptinessvast emptiness stretching out infinitely .  the little  gleaming dots are huge masses of energy filled matter .  they are globes  some of them millions of miles in diameterand for comparison  this station is only one mile across .  they seem so tiny because they are incredibly far off .    the dots to which our energy beams are directed  are nearer and much smaller .  they are cold and hard and human beings like myself live upon their surfaces   many billions of them .  it is from one of these worlds that donovan and i come .  our beams feed these worlds energy drawn from one of those huge incandescent globes that happens to be near us .  we call that globe the sun and it is on the other side of the station where you can t see it .    cutie remained motionless before the port  like a steel statue .  his head did not turn as he spoke   which particular dot of light do you claim to come from .    powell searched   there it is .  the very bright one in the corner .  we call it earth .   he grinned .   good old earth .  there are three billions of us there  cutie   and in about two weeks i ll be back there with them   and then  surprisingly enough  cutie hummed abstractedly .  there was no tune to it  but it possessed a curious twanging quality as of plucked strings .  it ceased as suddenly as it had begun   but where do i come in  powell .  you haven t explained my existence .     the rest is simple .  when these stations were first established to feed solar energy to the planets  they were run by humans .  however  the heat  the hard solar radiations  and the electron storms made the post a difficult one .  robots were developed to replace human labor and now only two human executives are required for each station .  we are trying to replace even those  and that s where you come in .  you re the highest type of robot ever developed and if you show the ability to run this station independently  no human need ever come here again except to bring parts for repairs .    his hand went up and the metal visi lid snapped back into place .  powell returned to the table and polished an apple upon his sleeve before biting into it .   the red glow of the robot s eyes held him .   do you expect me   said cutie slowly   to believe any such complicated  implausible hypothesis as you have just outlined .  what do you take me for .    powell sputtered apple fragments onto the table and turned red .   why damn you  it wasn t a hypothesis .  those were facts   cutie sounded grim   globes of energy millions of miles across .  worlds with three billion humans on them .  infinite emptiness .  sorry  powell  but i don t believe it .  i ll puzzle this thing out for myself .  good by .    he turned and stalked out of the room .  he brushed past michael donovan on the threshold with a grave nod and passed down the corridor  oblivious to the astounded stare that followed him .   mike donovan rumpled his red hair and shot an annoyed glance at powell   what was that walking junk yard talking about .  what doesn t he believe .    the other dragged at his mustache bitterly .   he s a skeptic   was the bitter response .   he doesn t believe we made him or that earth exists or space or stars .     sizzling saturn  we ve got a lunatic robot on our hands .     he says he s going to figure it ail out for himself .     well  now   said donovan sweetly   i do hope he ll condescend to explain it all to me after he s puzzled everything out  then  with sudden rage   listen .  if that metal mess gives me any lip like that  i ll knock that chromium cranium right off its torso .    he seated himself with a jerk and drew a paper backed mystery novel out of his inner jacket pocket   that robot gives me the willies anyway   too damned inquisitive .      mike donovan growled from behind a huge lettuce and tomato sandwich as cutie knocked gently and entered .    is powell here .    donovan s voice was muffled  with pauses for mastication   he s gathering data on electronic stream functions .  we re heading for a storm  looks like .    gregory powell entered as he spoke  eyes on the graphed paper in his hands  and dropped into a chair .  he spread the sheets out before him and began scribbling calculations .  donovan stared over his shoulder  crunching lettuce and dribbling bread crumbs .  cutie waited silently .   powell looked up   the zeta potential is rising  but slowly .  just the same  the stream functions are erratic and i don t know what to expect .  oh  hello  cutie .  i thought you were supervising the installation of the new drive bar .     it s done   said the robot quietly   and so i ve come to have a talk with the two of you    oh .   powell looked uncomfortable .   well  sit down .  no  not that chair .  one of the legs is weak and you re no lightweight .    the robot did so and said placidly   i have come to a decision .    donovan glowered and put the remnants of his sandwich aside .   if it s on any of that screwy    the other motioned impatiently for silence   go ahead  cutie .  we re listening .     i have spent these last two days in concentrated introspection   said cutie   and the results have been most interesting .  i began at the one sure assumption i felt permitted to make .  i  myself  exist  because i think    powell groaned   oh  jupiter  a robot descartes .     who s descartes .   demanded donovan .   listen  do we have to sit here and listen to this metal maniac     keep quiet  mike .    cutie continued imperturbably   and the question that immediately arose was  just what is the cause of my existence .    powell s jaw set lumpily .   you re being foolish .  i told you already that we made you .     and if you don t believe us   added donovan   we ll gladly take you apart .    the robot spread his strong hands in a deprecatory gesture   i accept nothing on authority .  a hypothesis must be backed by reason  or else it is worthless   and it goes against all the dictates of logic to suppose that you made me .    powell dropped a restraining arm upon donovan s suddenly bunched fist .   just why do you say that .    cutie laughed .  it was a very inhuman laugh   the most machine like utterance he had yet given vent to .  it was sharp and explosive  as regular as a metronome and as uninflected .    look at you   he said finally .   i say this in no spirit of contempt  but look at you .  the material you are made of is soft and flabby  lacking endurance and strength  depending for energy upon the inefficient oxidation of organic material   like that .   he pointed a disapproving finger at what remained of donovan s sandwich .   periodically you pass into a coma and the least variation in temperature  air pressure  humidity  or radiation intensity impairs your efficiency .  you are  makeshift  .    i  on the other hand  am a finished product .  i absorb electrical energy directly and utilize it with an almost one hundred percent efficiency .  i am composed of strong metal  am continuously conscious  and can stand extremes of environment easily .  these are facts which  with the self evident proposition that no being can create another being superior to itself  smashes your silly hypothesis to nothing .      donovan s muttered curses rose into intelligibility as he sprang to his feet  rusty eyebrows drawn low .   all right  you son of a hunk of iron ore  if we didn t make you  who did .    cutie nodded gravely .   very good  donovan .  that was indeed the next question .  evidently my creator must be more powerful than myself and so there was only one possibility .    the earthmen looked blank and cutie continued   what is the center of activities here in the station .  what do we all serve .  what absorbs all our attention .   he waited expectantly .   donovan turned a startled look upon his companion .   i ll bet this tinplated screwball is talking about the energy converter itself .     is that right  cutie .   grinned powell .    i am talking about the master   came the cold  sharp answer .   it was the signal for a roar of laughter from donovan  and powell himself dissolved into a half suppressed giggle .   cutie had risen to his feet and his gleaming eyes passed from one earthman to the other .   it is so just the same and i don t wonder that you refuse to believe .  you two are not long to stay here  i m sure .  powell himself said that at first only men served the master  that there followed robots for the routine work  and  finally  myself for the executive labor .  the facts are no doubt true  but the explanation entirely illogical .  do you want the truth behind it all .     go ahead  cutie .  you re amusing .     the master created humans first as the lowest type  most easily formed .  gradually  he replaced them by robots  the next higher step  and finally he created me  to take the place of the last humans .  from now on  i serve the master .     you ll do nothing of the sort   said powell sharply .   you ll follow our orders and keep quiet  until we re satisfied that you can run the converter .  get that .  the converter   not the master .  if you don t satisfy us  you will be dismantled .  and now  if you don t mind  you can leave .  and take this data with you and file it properly .    cutie accepted the graphs handed him and left without another word .  donovan leaned back heavily in his chair and shoved thick fingers through his hair .    there s going to be trouble with that robot .  he s pure nuts .      the drowsy hum of the converter is louder in the control room and mixed with it is the chuckle of the geiger counters and the erratic buzzing of half a dozen little signal lights .   donovan withdrew his eye from the telescope and flashed the luxites on .   the beam from station    caught mars on schedule .  we can break ours now .    powell nodded abstractedly .   cutie s down in the engine room .  i ll flash the signal and he can take care of it .  look  mike  what do you think of these figures .    the other cocked an eye at them and whistled .   boy  that s what i call gamma ray intensity .  old sol is feeling his oats  all right .     yeah   was the sour response   and we re in a bad position for an electron storm  too .  our earth beam is right in the probable path .   he shoved his chair away from the table pettishly .   nuts .  if it would only hold off till relief got here  but that s ten days off .  say  mike  go on down and keep an eye on cutie  will you .     o . k .  throw me some of those almonds .   he snatched at the bag thrown him and headed for the elevator .   it slid smoothly downward  and opened onto a narrow catwalk in the huge engine room .  donovan leaned over the railing and looked down .  the huge generators were in motion and from the l tubes came the lowpitched whir that pervaded the entire station .   he could make out cutie s large  gleaming figure at the martian l tube  watching closely as the team of robots worked in close knit unison .   and then donovan stiffened .  the robots  dwarfed by the mighty l tube  lined up before it  heads bowed at a stiff angle  while cutie walked up and down the line slowly .  fifteen seconds passed  and then  with a clank heard above the clamorous purring all about  they fell to their knees .   donovan squawked and raced down the narrow staircase .  he came charging down upon them  complexion matching his hair and clenched fists beating the air furiously .    what the devil is this  you brainless lumps .  come on .  get busy with that l tube .  if you don t have it apart  cleaned  and together again before the day is out  i ll coagulate your brains with alternating current .    not a robot moved .   even cutie at the far end   the only one on his feet   remained silent  eyes fixed upon the gloomy recesses of the vast machine before him .   donovan shoved hard against the nearest robot .    stand up .   he roared .   slowly  the robot obeyed .  his photoelectric eyes focused reproachfully upon the earthman .    there is no master but the master   he said   and qt   is his prophet .     huh .   donovan became aware of twenty pairs of mechanical eyes fixed upon him and twenty stiff timbred voices declaiming solemnly    there is no master but the master and qt   is his prophet .     i m afraid   put in cutie himself at this point   that my friends obey a higher one than you  now .     the hell they do .  you get out of here .  i ll settle with you later and with these animated gadgets right now .    cutie shook his heavy head slowly .   i m sorry  but you don t understand .  these are robots   and that means they are reasoning beings .  they recognize the master  now that i have preached truth to them .  all the robots do .  they call me the prophet .   his head drooped .   i am unworthy   but perhaps    donovan located his breath and put it to use .   is that so .  now  isn t that nice .  now  isn t that just fine .  just let me tell you something  my brass baboon .  there isn t any master and there isn t any prophet and there isn t any question as to who s giving the orders .  understand .   his voice shot to a roar .   now  get out .     i obey only the master .     damn the master .   donovan spat at the l tube .   that for the master .  do as i say .    cutie said nothing  nor did any other robot  but donovan became aware of a sudden heightening of tension .  the cold  staring eyes deepened their crimson  and cutie seemed stiffer than ever .    sacrilege   he whispered   voice metallic with emotion .   donovan felt the first sudden touch of fear as cutie approached .  a robot could not feel anger   but cutie s eyes were unreadable .    i am sorry  donovan   said the robot   but you can no longer stay here after this .  henceforth powell and you are barred from the control room and the engine room .    his hand gestured quietly and in a moment two robots had pinned donovan s arms to his sides .   donovan had time for one startled gasp as he felt himself lifted from the floor and carried up the stairs at a pace rather better than a canter .     gregory powell raced up and down the officer s room  fist tightly balled .  he cast a look of furious frustration at the closed door and scowled bitterly at donovan .    why the devil did you have to spit at the l tube .    mike donovan  sunk deep in his chair  slammed at its arms savagely .   what did you expect me to do with that electrified scarecrow .  i m not going to knuckle under to any do jigger i put together myself .     no   came back sourly   but here you are in the officer s room with two robots standing guard at the door .  that s not knuckling under  is it .    donovan snarled .   wait till we get back to base .  someone s going to pay for this .  those robots must obey us .  it s the second law .     what s the use of saying that .  they aren t obeying us .  and there s probably some reason for it that we ll figure out too late .  by the way  do you know what s going to happen to us when we get back to base .   he stopped before donovan s chair and stared savagely at him .    what .     oh  nothing .  just back to mercury mines for twenty years .  or maybe ceres penitentiary .     what are you talking about .     the electron storm that s coming up .  do you know it s heading straight dead center across the earth beam .  i had just figured that out when that robot dragged me out of my chair .    donovan was suddenly pale .   sizzling saturn .     and do you know what s going to happen to the beam   because the storm will be a lulu .  it s going to jump like a flea with the itch .  with only cutie at the controls  it s going to go out of focus and if it does  heaven help earth   and us .    donovan was wrenching at the door wildly  when powell was only half through .  the door opened  and the earthman shot through to come up hard against an immovable steel arm .   the robot stared abstractedly at the panting  struggling earthman .   the prophet orders you to remain .  please do .   his arm shoved  donovan reeled backward  and as he did so  cutie turned the corner at the far end of the corridor .  he motioned the guardian robots away  entered the officer s room and closed the door gently .   donovan whirled on cutie in breathless indignation .   this has gone far enough .  you re going to pay for this farce .     please  don t be annoyed   replied the robot mildly .   it was bound to come eventually  anyway .  you see  you two have lost your function .     i beg your pardon   powell drew himself up stiffly .   just what do you mean  we ve lost our function .     until i was created   answered cube   you tended the master .  that privilege is mine now and your only reason for existence has vanished .  isn t that obvious .     not quite   replied powell bitterly   but what do you expect us to do now .    cutie did not answer immediately .  he remained silent  as if in thought  and then one arm shot out and draped itself about powell s shoulder .  the other grasped donovan s wrist and drew him closer .    i like you two .  you re inferior creatures  with poor reasoning faculties  but i really feel a sort of affection for you .  you have served the master well  and he will reward you for that .  now that your service is over  you will probably not exist much longer  but as long as you do  you shall be provided food  clothing and shelter  so long as you stay out of the control room and the engine room .     he s pensioning us off  greg .   yelled donovan .   do something about it .  it s humiliating .     look here  cutie  we can t stand for this .  we re the bosses .  this station is only a creation of human beings like me   human beings that live on earth and other planets .  this is only an energy relay .  you re only   aw  nuts .      cutie shook his head gravely .   this amounts to an obsession .  why should you insist so on an absolutely false view of life .  admitted that non robots lack the reasoning faculty  there is still the problem of    his voice died into reflective silence  and donovan said with whispered intensity   if you only had a flesh and blood face  i would break it in .    powell s fingers were in his mustache and his eyes were slitted .   listen  cutie  if there is no such thing as earth  how do you account for what you see through a telescope .     pardon me .    the earthman smiled .   i ve got you  eh .  you ve made quite a few telescopic observations since being put together  cutie .  have you noticed that several of those specks of light outside become disks when so viewed .     oh  that .  why certainly .  it is simple magnification   for the purpose of more exact aiming of the beam .     why aren t the stars equally magnified then .     you mean the other dots .  well  no beams go to them so no magnification is necessary .  really  powell  even you ought to be able to figure these things out .    powell stared bleakly upward .   but you see more stars through a telescope .  where do they come from .  jumping jupiter  where do they come from .    cutie was annoyed .   listen  powell  do you think i m going to waste my time trying to pin physical interpretations upon every optical illusion of our instruments .  since when is the evidence of our senses any match for the clear light of rigid reason .     look   clamored donovan  suddenly  writhing out from under cutie s friendly  but metal heavy arm   let s get to the nub of the thing .  why the beams at all .  we re giving you a good  logical explanation .  can you do better .     the beams   was the stiff reply   are put out by the master for his own purposes .  there are some things    he raised his eyes devoutly upward  that are not to be probed into by us .  in this matter  i seek only to serve and not to question .    powell sat down slowly and buried his face in shaking hands .   get out of here  cutie .  get out and let me think .     i ll send you food   said cutie agreeably .   a groan was the only answer and the robot left .    greg   was donovan s huskily whispered observation   this calls for strategy .  we ve got to get him when he isn t expecting it and shortcircuit him .  concentrated nitric acid in his joints     don t be a dope  mike .  do you suppose he s going to let us get near him with acid in our hands .  we ve got to talk to him  i tell you .  we ve got to argue him into letting us back into the control room inside of forty eight hours or our goose is broiled to a crisp .    he rocked back and forth in an agony of impotence .   who the heck wants to argue with a robot .  it s .  .  .  it s     mortifying   finished donovan .    worse .     say .   donovan laughed suddenly .   why argue .  let s show him .  let s build us another robot right before his eyes .  he ll have to eat his words then .    a slowly widening smile appeared on powell s face .   donovan continued   and think of that screwball s face when he sees us do it .      robots are  of course  manufactured on earth  but their shipment through apace is much simpler if it can be done in parts to be put together at their place of use .  it also  incidentally  eliminates the possibility of robots  in complete adjustment  wandering off while still on earth and thus bringing u .  s .  robots face to face with the strict laws against robots on earth .   still  it placed upon men such as powell and donovan the necessity of synthesis of complete robots    a grievous and complicated task .   powell and donovan were never so aware of that fact as upon that particular day when  in the assembly room  they undertook to create a robot under the watchful eyes of qt    prophet of the master .   the robot in question  a simple mc model  lay upon the table  almost complete .  three hours  work left only the bead undone  and powell paused to swab his forehead and glanced uncertainly at cutie .   the glance was not a reassuring one .  for three hours  cutie had sat  speechless and motionless  and his face  inexpressive at all times  was now absolutely unreadable .       powell groaned .   let s get the brain in now  mike .    donovan uncapped the tightly sealed container and from the oil bath within he withdrew a second cube .  opening this in turn  he removed a globe from its sponge rubber casing .   he handled it gingerly  for it was the most complicated mechanism ever created by man .  inside the thin platinumplated  skin  of the globe was a positronic brain  in whose delicately unstable structure were enforced calculated neuronic paths  which imbued each robot with what amounted to a pre natal education .   it fitted snugly into the cavity in the skull of the robot on the table .  blue metal closed over it and was welded tightly by the tiny atomic flare .  photoelectric eyes were attached carefully  screwed tightly into place and covered by thin  transparent sheets of steel hard plastic .   the robot awaited only the vitalizing flash of high voltage electricity  and powell paused with his hand on the switch .    now watch this  cutie .  watch this carefully .    the switch rammed home and there was a crackling hum .  the two earthmen bent anxiously over their creation .   there was vague motion only at the outset   a twitching of the joints .  the bead lifted  elbows propped it up  and the mc model swung clumsily off the table .  its footing was unsteady and twice abortive grating sounds were all it could do in the direction of speech .   finally  its voice  uncertain and hesitant  took form .   i would like to start work .  where must i go .    donovan sprang to the door .   down these stairs   he said .   you will be told what to do .    the mc model was gone and the two earthmen were alone with the still unmoving cutie .    well   said powell  grinning   now do you believe that we made you .    cutie s answer was curt and final .   no .   he said .   powell s grin froze and then relaxed slowly .  donovan s mouth dropped open and remained so .    you see   continued cutie  easily   you have merely put together parts already made .  you did remarkably well  instinct  i suppose  but you didn t really create the robot .  the parts were created by the master .     listen   gasped donovan hoarsely   those parts were manufactured back on earth and sent here .     well  well   replied cutie soothingly   we won t argue .     no  i mean it .   the earthman sprang forward and grasped the robot s metal arm .   if you were to read the books in the library  they could explain it so that there could be no possible doubt .     the books .  i ve read them   all of them .  they re most ingenious .    powell broke in suddenly .   if you ve read them  what else is there to say .  you can t dispute their evidence .  you just can t .    there was pity in cutie s voice .   please  powell  i certainly don t consider them a valid source of information .  they  too  were created by the master   and were meant for you  not for me .     how do you make that out .   demanded powell .    because i  a reasoning being  am capable of deducing truth from a priori causes .  you  being intelligent  but unreasoning  need an explanation of existence supplied to you  and this the master did .  that he supplied you with these laughable ideas of far off worlds and people is  no doubt  for the best .  your minds are probably too coarsely grained for absolute truth .  however  since it is the master s will that you believe your books  i won t argue with you any more .    as he left  he turned  and said in a kindly tone   but don t feel badly .  in the master s scheme of things there is room for all .  you poor humans have your place and though it is humble  you will be rewarded if you fill it well .    he departed with a beatific air suiting the prophet of the master and the two humans avoided each other s eyes .   finally powell spoke with an effort .   let s go to bed  mike .  i give up .    donovan said in a hushed voice   say  greg  you don t suppose he s right about all this  do you .  he sounds so confident that i    powell whirled on him .   don t be a fool .  you d find out whether earth exists when relief gets here next week and we have to go back to face the music .     then  for the love of jupiter  we ve got to do something .   donovan was half in tears .   he doesn t believe us  or the books  or his eyes .       no   said powell bitterly   he s a reasoning robot   damn it .  he believes only reason  and there s one trouble with that   his voice trailed away .    what s that .   prompted donovan .    you can prove anything you want by coldly logical reason   if you pick the proper postulates .  we have ours and cutie has his .     then let s get at those postulates in a hurry .  the storm s due tomorrow .    powell sighed wearily .   that s where everything falls down .  postulates are based on assumption and adhered to by faith .  nothing in the universe can shake them .  i m going to bed .     oh  hell .  i can t sleep .     neither can   .  but i might as well try   as a matter of principle .      twelve hours later  sleep was still just that  a matter of principle  unattainable in practice .   the storm had arrived ahead of schedule  and donovan s florid face drained of blood as he pointed a shaking finger .  powell  stubble jawed and dry lipped  stared out the port and pulled desperately at his mustache .   under other circumstances  it might have been a beautiful sight .  the stream of high speed electrons impinging upon the energy beam fluoresced into ultra spicules of intense light .  the beam stretched out into shrinking nothingness  a glitter with dancing  shining motes .   the shaft of energy was steady  but the two earthmen knew the value of naked eyed appearances .  deviations in arc of a hundredth of a millisecond  invisible to the eye  were enough to send the beam wildly out of focus   enough to blast hundreds of square miles of earth into incandescent ruin .   and a robot  unconcerned with beam  focus  or earth  or anything but his master was at the controls .   hours passed .  the earthmen watched in hypnotized silence .  and then the darting dotlets of light dimmed and went out .  the storm had ended .   powell s voice was flat .   it s over .    donovan had fallen into a troubled slumber and powell s weary eyes rested upon him enviously .  the signal flash glared over and over again  but the earthman paid no attention .  it all was unimportant .  all .  perhaps cutie was right   and he was only an inferior being with a made to order memory and a life that had outlived its purpose .   he wished he were .   cutie was standing before him .   you didn t answer the flash  so i walked in .   his voice was low .   you don t look at all well  and i m afraid your term of existence is drawing to an end .  still  would you like to see some of the readings recorded today .    dimly  powell was aware that the robot was making a friendly gesture  perhaps to quiet some lingering remorse in forcibly replacing the humans at the controls of the station .  he accepted the sheets held out to him and gazed at them unseeingly .   cutie seemed pleased .   of course  it is a great privilege to serve the master .  you mustn t feel too badly about my having replaced you .    powell grunted and shifted from one sheet to the other mechanically until his blurred sight focused upon a thin red line that wobbled its way across the ruled paper .   he stared and stared again .  he gripped it hard in both fists and rose to his feet  still staring .  the other sheets dropped to the floor  unheeded .    mike  mike .   he was shaking the other madly .   he held it steady .    donovan came to life .   what .  wh where   and he  too  gazed with bulging eyes upon the record before him .   cutie broke in .   what is wrong .     you kept it in focus   stuttered powell .   did you know that .     focus .  what s that .     you kept the beam directed sharply at the receiving station   to within a ten thousandth of a milli second of arc .     what receiving station .     on earth .  the receiving station on earth   babbled powell .   you kept it in focus .    cutie turned on his heel in annoyance .   it is impossible to perform any act of kindness toward you two .  always the same phantasm .  i merely kept all dials at equilibrium in accordance with the will of the master .    gathering the scattered papers together  he withdrew stiffly  and donovan said  as he left   well  i ll be damned .    he turned to powell .   what are we going to do now .    powell felt tired  but uplifted .   nothing .  he s just shown he can run the station perfectly .  i ve never seen an electron storm handled so well .     but nothing s solved .  you heard what he said of the master .  we can t     look  mike  he follows the instructions of the master by means of dials  instruments  and graphs .  that s all we ever followed .  as a matter of fact  it accounts for his refusal to obey us .  obedience is the second law .  no harm to humans is the first .  how can he keep humans from harm  whether he knows it or not .  why  by keeping the energy beam stable .  he knows he can keep it more stable than we can  since he insists he s the superior being  so he must keep us out of the control room .  it s inevitable if you consider the laws of robotics .     sure  but that s not the point .  we can t let him continue this nitwit stuff about the master .     why not .     because whoever heard of such a damned thing .  how are we going to trust him with the station  if he doesn t believe in earth .     can he handle the station .     yes  but     then what s the difference what he believes .    powell spread his arms outward with a vague smile upon his face and tumbled backward onto the bed .  he was asleep .     powell was speaking while struggling into his lightweight space jacket .    it would be a simple job   he said .   you can bring in new qt models one by one  equip them with an automatic shutoff switch to act within the week  so as to allow them enough time to learn the .  .  .  uh .  .  .  cult of the master from the prophet himself  then switch them to another station and revitalize them .  we could have two qt s per    donovan unclasped his glassite visor and scowled .   shut up  and let s get out of here .  relief is waiting and i won t feel right until i actually see earth and feel the ground under my feet   just to make sure it s really there .    the door opened as he spoke and donovan  with a smothered curse  clicked the visor to  and turned a sulky back upon cutie .   the robot approached softly and there was sorrow in his voice .   you are going .    powell nodded curtly .   there will be others in our place .    cutie sighed  with the sound of wind humming through closely spaced wires .   your term of service is over and the time of dissolution has come .  i expected it  but  well  the master s will be done .    his tone of resignation stung powell .   save the sympathy  cube .  we re heading for earth  not dissolution .     it is best that you think so   cutie sighed again .   i see the wisdom of the illusion now .  i would not attempt to shake your faith  even if i could .   he departed   the picture of commiseration .   powell snarled and motioned to donovan .  sealed suitcases in hand  they headed for the air lock .   the relief ship was on the outer landing and franz muller  his relief man  greeted them with stiff courtesy .  donovan made scant acknowledgment and passed into the pilot room to take over the controls from sam evans .   powell lingered .   how s earth .    it was a conventional enough question and muller gave the conventional answer   still spinning .    powell said   good .    muller looked at him   the boys back at the u .  s .  robots nave dreamed up a new one  by the way .  a multiple robot .     a what .     what i said .  there s a big contract for it .  it must be just the thing for asteroid mining .  you have a master robot with six sub robots under it .   like your fingers .     has it been field tested .   asked powell anxiously .   muller smiled   waiting for you  i hear .    powell s fist balled   damn it  we need a vacation .     oh  you ll get it .  two weeks  i think .    he was donning the heavy space gloves in preparation for his term of duty here  and his thick eyebrows drew close together .   how is this new robot getting along .  it better be good  or i ll be damned if i let it touch the controls .    powell paused before answering .  his eyes swept the proud prussian before him from the close cropped hair on the sternly stubborn head  to the feet standing stiffly at attention   and there was a sudden glow of pure gladness surging through him .    the robot is pretty good   he said slowly .   i don t think you ll have to bother much with the controls .    he grinned   and went into the ship .  muller would be here for several weeks           catch that rabbit         the vacation was longer than two weeks .  that  mike donovan had to admit .  it had been six months  with pay .  he admitted that  too .  but that  as he explained furiously  was fortuitous .  u .  s .  robots had to get the bugs out of the multiple robot  and there were plenty of bugs  and there are always at least half a dozen bugs left for the fieldtesting .  so they waited and relaxed until the drawing board men and the slide rule boys had said  ok .   and now he and powell were out on the asteroid and it was not ok .  he repeated that a dozen times  with a face that had gone beety   for the love of pete  greg  get realistic .  what s the use of adhering to the letter of the specifications and watching the test go to pot .  it s about time you got the red tape out of your pants and went to work .     i m only saying   said gregory powell  patiently  as one explaining electronics to an idiot child   that according to spec  those robots are equipped for asteroid mining without supervision .  we re not supposed to watch them .     all right .  look   logic .   he lifted his hairy fingers and pointed .   one  that new robot passed every test in the home laboratories .  two  united states robots guaranteed their passing the test of actual performance on an asteroid .  three  the robots are not passing said tests .  four  if they don t pass  united states robots loses ten million credits in cash and about one hundred million in reputation .  five  if they don t pass and we can t explain why they don t pass  it is just possible two good jobs may have to be bidden a fond farewell .    powell groaned heavy behind a noticeably insincere smile .  the unwritten motto of united states robot and mechanical men corp .  was well known   no employee makes the same mistake twice .  he is fired the first time .    aloud he said   you re as lucid as euclid with everything except the facts .  you ve watched that robot group for three shifts  you redhead  and they did their work perfectly .  you said so yourself .  what else can we do .     find out what s wrong  that s what we can do .  so they did work perfectly when i watched them .  but on three different occasions when i didn t watch them  they didn t bring in any ore .  they didn t even come back on schedule .  i had to go after them .     and was anything wrong .     not a thing .  not a thing .  everything was perfect .  smooth and perfect as the luminiferous ether .  only one little insignificant detail disturbed me   there was no ore .    powell scowled at the ceiling and pulled at his brown mustache .   i ll tell you what  mike .  we ve been stuck with pretty lousy jobs in our time  but this takes the iridium asteroid .  the whole business is complicated past endurance .  look  that robot  dv    has six robots under it .  and not just under it   they re part of it .     i know that     shut up .   said powell  savagely   i know you know it  but i m just describing the hell of it .  those six subsidiaries are part of dv   like your fingers are part of you and it gives them their orders neither by voice nor radio  but directly through positronic fields .  now   there isn t a roboticist back at united states robots that knows what a positronic field is or how it works .  and neither do i .  neither do you .     the last   agreed donovan  philosophically   i know .     then look at our position .  if everything works   fine .  if anything goes wrong   we re out of our depth and there probably isn t a thing we can do  or anybody else .  but the job belongs to us and not to anyone else so we re on the spot  mike .   he blazed away for a moment in silence .  then   all right  have you got him outside .     yes .     is everything normal now .     well he hasn t got religious mania  and he isn t running around in a circle spouting gilbert and sullivan  so i suppose he s normal .    donovan passed out the door  shaking his head viciously .     powell reached for the  handbook of robotics  that weighed down one side of his desk to a near founder and opened it reverently .  he had once jumped out of the window of a burning house dressed only in shorts and the  handbook .   in a pinch  he would have skipped the shorts .   the  handbook  was propped up before him  when robot dv   entered  with donovan kicking the door shut behind him .   powell said somberly   hi  dave .  how do you feel .     fine   said the robot .   mind if i sit down .   he dragged up the specially reinforced chair that was his  and folded gently into it .   powell regarded dave   laymen might think of robots by their serial numbers  roboticists never   with approval .  it was not over massive by any means  in spite of its construction as thinking unit of an integrated seven unit robot team .  it was seven feet tall  and a half ton of metal and electricity .  a lot .  not when that half ton has to be a mass of condensers  circuits  relays  and vacuum cells that can handle practically any psychological reaction known to humans .  and a positronic brain  which with ten pounds of matter and a few quintillions of positrons runs the whole show .   powell groped in his shirt pocket for a loose cigarette .   dave   he said   you re a good fellow .  there s nothing flighty or prima donnaish about you .  you re a stable  rockbottom mining robot  except that you re equipped to handle six subsidiaries in direct coordination .  as far as i know  that has not introduced any unstable paths in your brain path map .    the robot nodded   that makes me feel swell  but what are you getting at  boss .   he was equipped with an excellent diaphragm  and the presence of overtones in the sound unit robbed him of much of that metallic flatness that marks the usual robot voice .    i m going to tell you .  with all that in your favor  what s going wrong with your job .  for instance  today s b shift .    dave hesitated   as far as i know  nothing .     you didn t produce any ore .     i know .     well  then    dave was having trouble   i can t explain that  boss .  it s been giving me a case of nerves  or it would if i let it   my subsidiaries worked smoothly .  i know i did .   he considered  his photoelectric eyes glowing intensely .  then   i don t remember .  the day ended and there was mike and there were the ore cars  mostly empty .    donovan broke in   you didn t report at shift end those days  dave .  you know that .     i know .  but as to why   he shook his head slowly and ponderously .   powell had the queasy feeling that if the robot s face were capable of expression  it would be one of pain and mortification .  a robot  by its very nature  cannot bear to fail its function .   donovan dragged his chair up to powell s desk and leaned over   amnesia  do you think .     can t say .  but there s no use in trying to pin disease names on this .  human disorders apply to robots only as romantic analogies .  they re no help to robotic engineering .   he scratched his neck   i hate to put him through the elementary brain reaction tests .  it won t help his self respect any .    he looked at dave thoughtfully and then at the field test outline given in the  handbook .   he said   see here  dave  what about sitting through a test .  it would be the wise thing to do .    the robot rose   if you say so  boss .   there was pain in his voice .     it started simply enough .  robot dv   multiplied five place figures to the heartless ticking of a stop watch .  he recited the prime numbers between a thousand and ten thousand .  he extracted cube roots and integrated functions of varying complexity .  he went through mechanical reactions in order of increasing difficulty .  and  finally  worked his precise mechanical mind over the highest function of the robot world   the solutions of problems in judgment and ethics .   at the end of two hours  powell was copiously besweated .  donovan had enjoyed a none too nutritious diet of fingernail and the robot said   how does it look  boss .    powell said   i ve got to think it over  dave .  snap judgments won t help much .  suppose you go back to the c shift .  take it easy .  don t press too hard for quota just for a while   and we ll fix things up .    the robot left .  donovan looked at powell .    well    powell seemed determined to push up his mustache by the roots .  he said   there is nothing wrong with the currents of his positronic brain .     i d hate to be that certain .     oh  jupiter  mike .  the brain is the surest part of a robot .  it s quintuple checked back on earth .  if they pass the field test perfectly  the way dave did  there just isn t a chance of brain misfunction .  that test covered every key path in the brain .     so where are we .     don t rush me .  let me work this out .  there s still the possibility of a mechanical breakdown in the body .  that leaves about fifteen hundred condensers  twenty thousand individual electric circuits  five hundred vacuum cells  a thousand relays  and upty ump thousand other individual pieces of complexity that can be wrong .  and these mysterious positron  is fields no one knows anything about .     listen  greg   donovan grew desperately urgent .   i ve got an idea .  that robot may be lying .  he never     robots can t knowingly lie  you fool .  now if we had the mccormack wesley tester  we could check each individual item in his body within twenty four to forty eight hours  but  the only two m .  w .  testers existing are on earth  and they weigh ten tons  are on concrete foundations and can t be moved .  isn t that peachy .    donovan pounded the desk   but  greg  he only goes wrong when we re not around .  there s something  sinister  about   that .   he punctuated the sentence with slams of fist against desk .    you   said powell  slowly   make me sick .  you ve been reading adventure novels .     what i want to know   shouted donovan   is what we re going to do about it .     i ll tell you .  i m going to install a visiplate right over my desk .  right on the wall over there  see .   he jabbed a vicious finger at the spot .   then i m going to focus it at whatever part of the mine is being worked  and i m going to watch . that s all .     that s all .  greg    powell rose from his chair and leaned his balled fists on the desk   mike  i m having a hard time .   his voice was weary .   for a week  you ve been plaguing me about dave .  you say he s gone wrong .  do you know how he s gone wrong .  not do you know what shape this wrongness takes .   no .  do you know what brings it on .  no .  do you know what snaps him out .  not do you know anything about it .  no .  do i know anything about it .  no .  so what do you want me to do .    donovan s arm swept outward in a vague  grandiose gesture   you got me .     so i tell you again .  before we do anything toward a cure  we ve got to find out what the disease is in the first place .  the first step in cooking rabbit stew is catching the rabbit .   well  we ve got to catch that rabbit .  now get out of here .    donovan stared at the preliminary outline of his field report with weary eyes .  for one thing  he was tired and for another  what was there to report while things were unsettled .  he felt resentful .   he said   greg  we re almost a thousand tons behind schedule .     you   replied powell  never looking up   are telling me something i don t know .     what i want to know   said donovan  in sudden savagery   is why we re always tangled up with new type robots .  i ve finally decided that the robots that were good enough for my great uncle on my mother s side are good enough for me .  i m for what s tried and true .  the test of time is what counts   good  solid  old fashioned robots that never go wrong .    powell threw a book with perfect aim  and donovan went tumbling off his seat .    your job   said powell  evenly   for the last five years has been to test new robots under actual working conditions for united states robots .  because you and i have been so injudicious as to display proficiency at the task  we ve been rewarded with the dirtiest jobs .  that   he jabbed holes in the air with his finger in donovan s direction   is your work .  you ve been griping about it  from personal memory  since about five minutes after united states robots signed you up .  why don t you resign .     well  i ll tell you .   donovan rolled onto his stomach  and took a firm grip on his wild  red hair to hold his head up .   there s a certain principle involved .  after all  as a trouble shooter  i ve played a part in the development of new robots .  there s the principle of aiding scientific advance .  but don t get me wrong .  it s not the principle that keeps me going  it s the money they pay us .  greg .    powell jumped at donovan s wild shout  and his eyes followed the redhead s to the visiplate  when they goggled in fixed horror .  he whispered   holy  howling  jupiter .    donovan scrambled breathlessly to his feet   look at them  greg .  they ve gone nuts .    powell said   get a pair of suits .  we re going out there .    he watched the posturings of the robots on the visiplate .  they were bronzy gleams of smooth motion against the shadowy crags of the airless asteroid .  there was a marching formation now  and in their own dim body light  the roughhewn walls of the mine tunnel swam past noiselessly  checkered with misty erratic blobs of shadow .  they marched in unison  seven of them  with dave at the head .  they wheeled and turned in macabre simultaneity  and melted through changes of formation with the weird ease of chorus dancers in lunar bowl .   donovan was back with the suits   they ve gone jingo on us  greg .  that s a military march .     for all you know   was the cold response   it may be a series of calisthenic exercises .  or dave may be under the hallucination of being a dancing master .  just you think first  and don t bother to speak afterward  either .    donovan scowled and slipped a detonator into the empty side holster with an ostentatious shove .  he said   anyway  there you are .  so we work with new model robots .  it s our job  granted .  but answer me one question .  why .  .  .  why does something invariably go wrong with them .     because   said powell  somberly   we are accursed .  let s go .      far ahead through the thick velvety blackness of the corridors that reached past the illuminated circles of their flashlights  robot light twinkled .    there they are   breathed donovan .   powell whispered tensely   i ve been trying to get him by radio but he doesn t answer .  the radio circuit is probably out .     then i m glad the designers haven t worked out robots who can work in total darkness yet .  i d hate to have to find seven mad robots in a black pit without radio communication  if they weren t lit up like blasted radioactive christmas trees .     crawl up on the ledge above  mike .  they re coming this way  and i want to watch them at close range .  can you make it .    donovan made the jump with a grunt .  gravity was considerably below earth normal  but with a heavy suit  the advantage was not too great  and the ledge meant a near ten foot jump .  powell followed .   the column of robots was trailing dave single file .  in mechanical rhythm  they converted to double and returned to single in different order .  it was repeated over and over again and dave never turned his head .   dave was within twenty feet when the play acting ceased .  the subsidiary robots broke formation  waited a moment  then clattered off into the distance   very rapidly .  dave looked after them  then slowly sat down .  he rested his head in one hand in a very human gesture .   his voice sounded in powell s earphones   are you here  boss .    powell beckoned to donovan and hopped off the ledge .    o . k .   dave  what s been going on .    the robot shook his head   i don t know .  one moment i was handling a tough outcropping in tunnel     and the next i was aware of humans close by  and i found myself half a mile down main stem .     where are the subsidiaries now .   asked donovan .    back at work  of course .  how much time has been lost .     not much .  forget it .   then to donovan  powell added   stay with him the rest of the shift .  then  come back .  i ve got a couple of ideas .      it was three hours before donovan returned .  he looked tired .  powell said   how did it go .    donovan shrugged wearily   nothing ever goes wrong when you watch them .  throw me a butt  will you .    the redhead lit it with exaggerated care and blew a careful smoke ring .  he said   i ve been working it out  greg .  you know  dave has a queer background for a robot .  there are six others under him in an extreme regimentation .  he s got life and death power over those subsidiary robots and it must react on his mentality .  suppose he finds it necessary to emphasize this power as a concession to his ego .     get to the point .     it s right here .  suppose we have militarism .  suppose he s fashioning himself an army .  suppose  he s training them in military maneuvers .  suppose     suppose you go soak your head .  your nightmares must be in technicolor .  you re postulating a major aberration of the positronic brain .  if your analysis were correct  dave would have to break down the first law of robotics  that a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to be injured .  the type of militaristic attitude and domineering ego you propose must have as the end point of its logical implications  domination of humans .     all right .  how do you know that isn t the fact of the matter .     because any robot with a brain like that would  one  never have left the factory  and two  be spotted immediately if it ever was .  i tested dave  you know .    powell shoved his chair back and put his feet on the desk .   no .  we re still in the position where we can t make our stew because we haven t the slightest notion as to what s wrong .  for instance  if we could find out what that dance macabre we witnessed was all about  we would be on the way out .    he paused   now listen  mike  how does this sound to you .  dave goes wrong only when neither of us is present .  and when he is wrong  the arrival of either of us snaps him out of it .     i once told you that was sinister .     don t interrupt .  how is a robot different when humans are not present .  the answer is obvious .  there is a larger requirement of personal initiative .  in that case  look for the body parts that are affected by the new requirements .     golly .   donovan sat up straight  then subsided .   no  no .  not enough .  it s too broad .  it doesn t cut tie possibilities much .     can t help that .  in any case  there s no danger of not making quota .  we ll take shifts watching those robots through the visor .  any time anything goes wrong  we get to the scene of action immediately .  that will put them right .     but the robots will fail spec anyway  greg .  united states robots can t market dv models with a report like that .     obviously .  we ve got to locate the error in make up and correct it   and we ve got ten days to do it in .   powell scratched his head .   the trouble is .  .  .  well  you had better look at the blueprints yourself .    the blueprints covered the floor like a carpet and donovan crawled over the face of them following powell s erratic pencil .   powell said   here s where you come in  mike .  you re the body specialist  and i want you to check me .  i ve been trying to cut out all circuits not involved in the personal initiative hookup .  right here  for instance  is the trunk artery involving mechanical operations .  i cut out all routine side routes as emergency divisions   he looked up   what do you think .    donovan had a very bad taste in his mouth   the job s not that simple  greg .  personal initiative isn t an electric circuit you can separate from the rest and study .  when a robot is on his own  the intensity of the body activity increases immediately on almost all fronts .  there isn t a circuit entirely unafected .  what must be done is to locate the particular condition   a very specific condition   that throws him off  and then start eliminating circuits .    powell got up and dusted himself   hmph .  all right .  take away the blueprints and burn them .    donovan said   you see when activity intensifies  anything can happen  given one single faulty part .  insulation breaks down  a condenser spills over  a connection sparks  a coil overheats .  and if you work blind  with the whole robot to choose from  you ll never find the bad spot .  if you take dave apart and test every point of his body mechanism one by one  putting him together each time  and trying him out    all right .  all right .  i can see through a porthole  too .    they faced each other hopelessly  and then powell said cautiously   suppose we interview one of the subsidiaries .    neither powell nor donovan had ever had previous occasion to talk to a  finger .   it could talk  it wasn t quite the perfect analogy to a human finger .  in fact  it had a fairly developed brain  but that brain was tuned primarily to the reception of orders via positronic field  and its reaction to independent stimuli was rather fumbling .   nor was powell certain as to its name .  its serial number was dv      but that was not very useful .   he compromised .   look  pal   he said   i m going to ask you to do some hard thinking and then you can go back to your boss .    the  finger  nodded its head stiffly  but did not exert its limited brainpower on speech .    now on four occasions recently   powell said   your boss deviated from brain scheme .  do you remember those occasions .     yes  sir .    donovan growled angrily   he remembers .  i tell you there is something very sinister     oh  go bash your skull .  of course  the  finger  remembers .  there is nothing wrong with him .   powell turned back to the robot   what were you doing each time .  .  .  i mean the whole group   the  finger  had a curious air of reciting by rote  as if he answered questions by the mechanical pressure of his brain pan  but without any enthusiasm whatever .   he said   the first time we were at work on a difficult outcropping in tunnel     level b .  the second time we were buttressing the roof against a possible cave in .  the third time we were preparing accurate blasts in order to tunnel farther without breaking into a subterranean fissure .  the fourth time was just after a minor cave in    what happened at these times .     it is difficult to describe .  an order would be issued  but before we could receive and interpret it  a new order came to march in queer formation .    powell snapped out   why .     i don t know .    donovan broke in tensely   what was the first order .  .  .  the one that was superseded by the marching directions .     i don t know .  i sensed that an order was sent  but there was never time to receive it .     could you tell us anything about it .  was it the same order each time .    the  finger  shook his head unhappily   i don t know .    powell leaned back   all right  get back to your boss .    the  finger  left  with visible relief .   donovan said   well  we accomplished a lot that time .  that was real sharp dialogue all the way through .  listen  dave and that imbecile  finger  are both holding out on us .  there is too much they don t know and don t remember .  we ve got to stop trusting them  greg .    powell brushed his mustache the wrong way   so help me  mike  another fool remark out of you  and i ll take away your rattle and teething ring .     all right .  you re the genius of the team .  i m just a poor sucker .  where do we stand .     right behind the eight ball .  i tried to work it backward through the  finger   and couldn t .  so we ve got to work it forward .     a great man   marveled donovan .   how simple that makes it .  now translate that into english  master .     translating it into baby talk would suit you better .  i mean that we ve got to find out what order it is that dave gives just before everything goes black .  it would be the key to the business .     and how do you expect to do that .  we can t get close to him because nothing will go wrong as long as we are there .  we can t catch the orders by radio because they are transmitted via this positronic field .  that eliminates the closerange and the long range method  leaving us a neat  cozy zero .     by direct observation  yes .  there s still deduction .     huh .     we re going on shifts  mike .   powell smiled grimly .   and we are not taking our eyes off the visiplate .  we re going to watch every action of those steel headaches .  when they go off into their act  we re going to see what happened immediately before and we re going to deduce the order .    donovan opened his mouth and left it that way for a full minute .  then he said in strangled tones   i resign .  i quit .     you have ten days to think up something better   said powell wearily .   which  for eight days  donovan tried mightily to do .  for eight days  on alternate four hour shifts  he watched with aching and bleary eyes those glinty metallic forms move against the vague background .  and for eight days in the four hour in betweens  he cursed united states robots  the dv models  and the day he was born .   and then on the eighth day  when powell entered with an aching head and sleepy eyes for his shift  donovan stood up and with very careful and deliberate aim launched a heavy book end for the exact center of the visiplate .  there was a very appropriate splintering noise .   powell gasped   what did you do that for .     because   said donovan  almost calmly   i m not watching it any more .  we ve got two days left and we haven t found out a thing .  dv   is a lousy loss .  he s stopped five times since i ve been watching and three times on your shift  and i can t make out what orders he gave  and you couldn t make it out .  and i don t believe you could ever make it out because i know i couldn t ever .     jumping space  how can you watch six robots at the same time .  one makes with the hands  and one with the feet and one like a windmill and another is jumping up and down like a maniac .  and the other two .  .  .  devil knows what they are doing .  and then they all stop .  so .  so .     greg  we re not doing it right .  we got to get up close .  we ve got to watch what they re doing from where we can see the details .    powell broke a bitter silence .   yeah .  and wait for something to go wrong with onlv two davs to go .     is it any better watching from here .     it s more comfortable .     ah  but there s something you can do there that you can t do here .     what s that .     you can make them stop   at whatever time you choose and while you re prepared and watching to see what goes wrong .    powell startled into alertness   howzzat .     well  figure it out  yourself .  you re the brains you say .  ask yourself some questions .  when does dv   go out of whack .  when did that  finger  say he did .  when a cave in threatened  or actually occurred  when delicately measured explosives were being laid down  when a difficult seam was hit .     in other words  during emergencies   powell was excited .    right .  when did you expect it to happen .  it s the personal initiative factor that s giving us the trouble .  and it s just during emergencies in the absence of a human being that personal initiative is most strained .  now what is the logical deduction .  how can we create our own stoppage when and where we want it .   he paused triumphantly   he was beginning to enjoy his role   and answered his own question to forestall the obvious answer on powell s tongue .   by creating our own emergency .    powell said   mike  you re right .     thanks  pal .  i knew i d do it some day .     all right  and skip the sarcasm .  we ll save it for earth  and preserve it in jars for future long  cold winters .  meanwhile  what emergency can we create .     we could flood the mines  if this weren t an airless asteroid .     a witticism  no doubt   said powell .   really  mike  you ll incapacitate me with laughter .  what about a mild cave in .    donovan pursed his lips and said   o . k .  by me .     good .  let s get started .    powell felt uncommonly like a conspirator as he wound his way over the craggy landscape .  his sub gravity walk teetered across the broken ground  kicking rocks to right and left under his weight in noiseless puffs of gray dust .  mentally  though  it was the cautious crawl of the plotter .   he said   do you know where they are .     i think so  greg .     all right   powell said gloomily   but if any  finger  gets within twenty feet of us  we ll be sensed whether we are in the line of sight or not .  i hope you know that .     when i need an elementary course in robotics  i ll file an application with you formally  and in triplicate .  down through here .    they were in the tunnels now  even the starlight was gone .  the two hugged the walls  flashes flickering out the way in intermittent bursts .  powell felt for the security of his detonator .    do you know this tunnel  mike .     not so good .  it s a new one .  i think i can make it out from what i saw in the visiplate  though    interminable minutes passed  and then mike said   feel that .    there was a slight vibration thrumming the wall against the fingers of powell s metal incased hand .  there was no sound  naturally .    blasting .  we re pretty close .     keep your eyes open   said powell .   donovan nodded impatiently .   it was upon them and gone before they could seize themselves   just a bronze glint across the field of vision .  they clung together in silence .   powell whispered   think it sensed us .     hope not .  but we d better flank them .  take the first side tunnel to the right .     suppose we miss them altogether .     well what do you want to do .  go back .   donovan grunted fiercely .   they re within a quarter of a mile .  i was watching them through the visiplate  wasn t i .  and we ve got two days     oh  shut up .  you re wasting your oxygen .  is this a side passage here .   the flash flicked .   it is .  let s go .    the vibration was considerably more marked and the ground below shuddered uneasily .    this is good   said donovan   if it doesn t give out on us  though .   he flung his light ahead anxiously .   they could touch the roof of the tunnel with a halfupstretched hand  and the bracings had been newly placed .   donovan hesitated   dead end  let s go back .     no .  hold on .   powell squeezed clumsily past .   is that light ahead .     light .  i don t see any .  where would there be light down here .     robot light .   he was scrambling up a gentle incline on hands and knees .  his voice was hoarse and anxious in donovan s ears .   hey  mike  come up here .    there was light .  donovan crawled up and over powell s outstretched legs .   an opening .     yes .  they must be working into this tunnel from the other side now i think .    donovan felt the ragged edges of the opening that looked out into what the cautious flashlight showed to be a larger and obviously mainstem tunnel .  the hole was too small for a man to go through  almost too small for two men to look through simultaneously .   there s nothing there   said donovan .    well  not now .  but there must have been a second ago or we wouldn t have seen light .  watch out .    the walls rolled about them and they felt the impact .  a fine dust showered down .  powell lifted a cautious head and looked again .   all right  mike .  they re there .    the glittering robots clustered fifty feet down the main stem .  metal arms labored mightily at the rubbish heap brought down by the last blast .   donovan urged eagerly   don t waste time .  it won t be long before they get through  and the next blast may get us .     for pete s sake  don t rush me .   powell unlimbered the detonator  and his eyes searched anxiously across the dusky background where the only light was robot light and it was impossible to tell a projecting boulder from a shadow .    there s a spot in the roof  see it  almost over them .  the last blast didn t quite get it .  if you can get it at the base  half the roof will cave in .    powell followed the dim finger   check .  now fasten your eye on the robots and pray they don t move too far from that part of the tunnel .  they re my light sources .  are all seven there .    donovan counted   all seven .     well  then  watch them .  watch every motion .    his detonator was lifted and remained poised while donovan watched and cursed and blinked the sweat out of his eye .   it flashed .   there was a jar  a series of hard vibrations  and then a jarring thump that threw powell heavily against donovan .   donovan yowled   greg  you threw me off .  i didn t see a thing .    powell stared about wildly   where are they .    donovan fell into a stupid silence .  there was no sign of the robots .  it was dark as the depths of the river styx .    think we buried them .   quavered donovan .    let s get down there .  don t ask me what i think .   powell crawled backward at tumbling speed .    mike .    donovan paused in the act of following .   what s wrong now .     hold on .   powell s breathing was rough and irregular in donovan s ears .   mike .  do you hear me  mike .     i m right here .  what is it .     we re blocked in .  it wasn t the ceiling coming down fifty feet away that knocked us over .  it was our own ceiling .  the shock s tumbled it .     what .   donovan scrambled up against a hard barrier .   turn on the flash .    powell did so .  at no point was there room for a rabbit to squeeze through .   donovan said softly   well  what do you know .    they wasted a few moments and some muscular power in an effort to move the blocking barrier .  powell varied this by wrenching at the edges of the original hole .  for a moment  powell lifted his blaster .  but in those close quarters  a flash would be suicide and he knew it .  he sat down .    you know  mike   he said   we ve really messed this up .  we are no nearer finding out what s wrong with dave .  it was a good idea but it blew up in our face .    donovan s glance was bitter with an intensity totally wasted on the darkness   i hate to disturb you  old man  but quite apart from what we know or don t know of dave  we re slightly trapped .  if we don t get loose  fella  we re going to die .  d i e  die .  how much oxygen have we anyway .  not more than six hours .     i ve thought of that .   powell s fingers went up to his long suffering mustache and clanged uselessly against the transparent visor .   of course  we could get dave to dig us out easily in that time  except that our precious emergency must have thrown him off  and his radio circuit is out .     and isn t that nice .    donovan edged up to the opening and managed to get his metalincased head out .  it was an extremely tight fit .    hey  greg .     what .     suppose we get dave within twenty feet .  he ll snap to normal .  that will save us .     sure  but where is he .     down the corridor   way down .  for pete s sake  stop pulling before you drag my head out of its socket .  i ll give you your chance to look .    powell maneuvered his head outside   we did it all right .  look at those saps .  that must be a ballet they re doing .     never mind the side remarks .  are they getting any closer .     can t tell yet .  they re too far away .  give me a chance .  pass me my flash  will you .  i ll try to attract their attention that way .    he gave up after two minutes   not a chance .  they must be blind .  uhoh  they re starting toward us .  what do you know .    donovan said   hey  let me see .    there was a silent scuffle .  powell said   all right .   and donovan got his head out .   they were approaching .  dave was high stepping the way in front and the six  fingers  were a weaving chorus line behind him .   donovan marveled   what are they doing .  that s what i want to know .  it looks like the virginia reel   and dave s a major domo  or i never saw one .     oh  leave me alone with your descriptions   grumbled powell .   how near are they .     within fifty feet and coming this way .  we ll be out in fifteen minuh huh huh hey y .     what s going on .   it took powell several seconds to recover from his stunned astonishment at donovan s vocal gyrations .   come on  give me a chance at that hole .  don t be a hog about it .    he fought his way upward  but donovan kicked wildly   they did an about face  greg .  they re leaving .  davel hey  da a ave .    powell shrieked   what s the use of that  you fool .  sound won t carry .     well  then   panted donovan   kick the walls  slam them  get some vibration started .  we ve got to attract their attention somehow  greg  or we re through .    he pounded like a madman .   powell shook him   wait  mike  wait .  listen  i ve got an idea .  jumping jupiter  this is a fine time to get around to the simple solutions .  mike .     what do you want .   donovan pulled his head in .    let me in there fast before they get out of range .     out of range .  what are you going to do .  hey  what are you going to do with that detonator .   he grabbed powell s arm .   powell shook off the grip violently .   i m going to do a little shooting .     why .     that s for later .  let s see if it works first .  if it doesn t  then  get out of the way and let me shoot .    the robots were flickers  small and getting smaller  in the distance .  powell lined up the sights tensely  and pulled the trigger three times .  he lowered the guns and peered anxiously .  one of the subsidiaries was down .  there were only six gleaming figures now .   powell called into his transmitter uncertainly .   dave .    a pause  then the answer sounded to both men   boss .  where are you .  my third subsidiary has had his chest blown in .  he s out of commission .     never mind your subsidiary   said powell .   we re trapped in a cave in where you were blasting .  can you see our flashlight .     sure .  we ll be right there .    powell sat back and relaxed   that  my fran   is that   donovan said very softly with tears in his voice   all right  greg .  you win .  i beat my forehead against the ground before your feet .  now don t feed me any bull .  just tell me quietly what it s all about .     easy .  it s just that all through we missed the obvious   as usual .  we knew it was the personal initiative circuit  and that it always happened during emergencies  but we kept looking for a specific order as the cause .  why should it be an order .     why not .     well  look .  why not a type of order .  what type of order requires the most initiative .  what type of order would occur almost always only in an emergency .     don t ask me  dreg .  tell me .     i m doing it .  it s the six way order .  under all ordinary conditions  one or more of the  fingers  would be doing routine tasks requiring no close supervision   in the sort of offhand way our bodies handle the routine walking motions .  but in an emergency  all six subsidiaries must be mobilized immediately and simultaneously .  dave must handle six robots at a time and something gives .  the rest was easy .  any decrease in initiative required  such as the arrival of humans  snaps him back .  so i destroyed one of the robots .  when i did  he was transmitting only five way orders .  initiative decreases   he s normal    how did you get all that .   demanded donovan .    just logical guessing .  i tried it and it worked .    the robot s voice was in their ears again   here i am .  can you hold out half an hour .     easy .   said powell .  then  to donovan  he continued   and now the job should be simple .  we ll go through the circuits  and check off each part that gets an extra workout in a six way order as against a five way .  how big a field does that leave us .    donovan considered   not much  i think .  if dave is like the preliminary model we saw back at the factory  there s a special coordinating circuit that would be the only section involved .   he cheered up suddenly and amazingly   say  that wouldn t be bad at all .  there s nothing to that .     all right .  you think it over and we ll check the blueprints when we get back .  and now  till daves reaches us  i m relaxing .     hey  wait .  just tell me one thing .  what were those queer shifting marches  those funny dance steps  that the robots went through every time they went screwy .     that .  i don t know .  but i ve got a notion .  remember  those subsidiaries were dave s  fingers .   we were always saying that  you know .  well  it s my idea that in all these interludes  whenever dave became a psychiatric case  he went off into a moronic maze  spending his time  twiddling his fingers  .        susan calvin talked about powell and donovan with unsmiling amusement  but warmth came into her voice when she mentioned robots .  it didn t take her long to go through the speedies  the cuties and the daves  and i stopped her .  otherwise  she would have dredged up half a dozen more .   i said   doesn t anything ever happen on earth .    she looked at me with a little frown   no  we don t have much to do with robots in action here on earth .     oh  well that s too bad .  i mean  your field engineers are swell  but can t we get you into this .  didn t you ever have a robot go wrong on you .  it s your anniversary  you know .    and so help me she blushed .  she said   robots have gone wrong on me .  heavens  how long it s been since i thought of it .  why  it was almost forty years ago .  certainlyl      .  and i was only thirty eight .  oh  my  i d rather not talk about it .    i waited  and sure enough she changed her mind .   why not .   she said .   it cannot harm me now .  even the memory can t .  i was foolish once  young man .  would you believe that .     no   i said .    i was .  but herbie was a mind reading robot .     what .     only one of its kind  before or since .  a mistake   somewheres             liar .        alfred lanning lit his cigar carefully  but the tips of his fingers were trembling slightly .  his gray eyebrows hunched low as he spoke between puffs .    it reads minds all right damn little doubt about that .  but why .   he looked at mathematician peter bogert   well .    bogert flattened his black hair down with both hands   that was the thirty fourth rb model we ve turned out  lanning .  all the others were strictly orthodox .    the third man at the table frowned .  milton ashe was the youngest officer of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men  inc .   and proud of his post .    listen  bogert .  there wasn t a hitch in the assembly from start to finish .  i guarantee that .    bogert s thick lips spread in a patronizing smile   do you .  if you can answer for the entire assembly line  i recommend your promotion .  by exact count  there are seventy five thousand  two hundred and thirtyfour operations necessary for the manufacture of a single positronic brain  each separate operation depending for successful completion upon any number of factors  from five to a hundred and five .  if any one of them goes seriously wrong  the  brain  is ruined .  i quote our own information folder  ashe .    milton ashe flushed  but a fourth voice cut off his reply .    if we re going to start by trying to fix the blame on one another  i m leaving .   susan calvin s hands were folded tightly in her lap  and the little lines about her thin  pale lips deepened   we ve got a mind reading robot on our hands and it strikes me as rather important that we find out just why it reads minds .  we re not going to do that by saying   your fault .  my fault .      her cold gray eyes fastened upon ashe  and he grinned .   lanning grinned too  and  as always at such times  his long white hair and shrewd little eyes made him the picture of a biblical patriarch   true for you  dr .  calvin .    his voice became suddenly crisp   here s everything in pill concentrate form .  we ve produced a positronic brain of supposedly ordinary vintage that s got the remarkable property of being able to tune in on thought waves .  it would mark the most important advance in robotics in decades  if we knew how it happened .  we don t  and we have to find out .  is that clear .     may i make a suggestion .   asked bogert .    go ahead .     i d say that until we do figure out the mess  and as a mathematician i expect it to be a very devil of a mess  we keep the existence of rd    a secret .  i mean even from the other members of the staff .  as heads of the departments  we ought not to find it an insoluble problem  and the fewer know about it     bogert is right   said dr .  calvin .   ever since the interplanetary code was modified to allow robot models to be tested in the plants before being shipped out to space  antirobot propaganda has increased .  if any word leaks out about a robot being able to read minds before we can announce complete control of the phenomenon  pretty effective capital could be made out of it .    lanning sucked at his cigar and nodded gravely .  he turned to ashe   i think you said you were alone when you first stumbled on this thought reading business .     i ll say i was alone  i got the scare of my life .  rb    had just been taken off the assembly table and they sent him down to me .  obermann was off somewheres  so i took him down to the testing rooms myself  at least i started to take him down .   ashe paused  and a tiny smile tugged at his lips   say  did any of you ever carry on a thought conversation without knowing it .    no one bothered to answer  and he continued   you don t realize it at first  you know .  he just spoke to me   as logically and sensibly as you can imagine   and it was only when i was most of the way down to the testing rooms that i realized that i hadn t said anything .  sure  i thought lots  but that isn t the same thing  is it .  i locked that thing up and ran for lanning .  having it walking beside me  calmly peering into my thoughts and picking and choosing among them gave me the willies .     i imagine it would   said susan calvin thoughtfully .  her eyes fixed themselves upon ashe in an oddly intent manner .   we are so accustomed to considering our own thoughts private .    lanning broke in impatiently   then only the four of us know .  all right .  we ve got to go about this systematically .  ashe  i want you to check over the assembly line from beginning to end  everything .  you re to eliminate all operations in which there was no possible chance of an error  and list all those where there were  together with its nature and possible magnitude .     tall order   grunted ashe .    naturally .  of course  you re to put the men under you to work on this   every single one if you have to  and i don t care if we go behind schedule  either .  but they re not to know why  you understand .     hm m m  yes .   the young technician grinned wryly .   it s still a lulu of a job .    lanning swiveled about in his chair and faced calvin   you ll have to tackle the job from the other direction .  you re the robo psychologist of the plant  so you re to study the robot itself and work backward .  try to find out how he ticks .  see what else is tied up with his telepathic powers  how far they extend  how they warp his outlook  and just exactly what harm it has done to his ordinary rb properties .  you ve got that .    lanning didn t wait for dr .  calvin to answer .    i ll co ordinate the work and interpret the findings mathematically .   he puffed violently at his cigar and mumbled the rest through the smoke   bogert will help me there  of course .    bogert polished the nails of one pudgy hand with the other and said blandly   i dare say .  i know a little in the line .     well .  i ll get started .   ashe shoved his chair back and rose .  his pleasantly youthful face crinkled in a grin   i ve got the darnedest job of any of us  so i m getting out of here and to work .    he left with a slurred   b  seein  ye .    susan calvin answered with a barely perceptible nod  but her eyes followed him out of sight and she did not answer when lanning grunted and said   do you want to go up and see rb    now  dr .  calvin .      rb    s photoelectric eyes lifted from the book at the muffled sound of binges turning and he was upon his feet when susan calvin entered .   she paused to readjust the huge  no entrance  sign upon the door and then approached the robot .    i ve brought you the texts upon hyperatomic motors  herbie   a few anyway .  would you care to look at them .    rb     otherwise known as herbie  lifted the three heavy books from her arms and opened to the title page of one    hm m m .   theory of hyperatomics .     he mumbled inarticulately to himself as he flipped the pages and then spoke with an abstracted air   sit down  dr .  calvin .  this will take me a few minutes .    the psychologist seated herself and watched herbie narrowly as he took a chair at the other side of the table and went through the three books systematically .   at the end of half an hour  he put them down   of course  i know why you brought these .    the corner of dr .  calvin s lip twitched   i was afraid you would .  it s difficult to work with you  herbie .  you re always a step ahead of me .     it s the same with these books  you know  as with the others .  they just don t interest me .  there s nothing to your textbooks .  your science is just a mass of collected data plastered together by make shift theory   and all so incredibly simple  that it s scarcely worth bothering about .    it s your fiction that interests me .  your studies of the interplay of human motives and emotions    his mighty hand gestured vaguely as he sought the proper words .   dr .  calvin whispered   i think i understand .     i see into minds  you see   the robot continued   and you have no idea how complicated they are .  i can t begin to understand everything because my own mind has so little in common with them   but i try  and your novels help .     yes  but i m afraid that after going through some of the harrowing emotional experiences of our present day sentimental novel    there was a tinge of bitterness in her voice    you find real minds like ours dull and colorless .     but i don t .    the sudden energy in the response brought the other to her feet .  she felt herself reddening  and thought wildly   he must know .    herbie subsided suddenly  and muttered in a low voice from which the metallic timbre departed almost entirely .   but  of course  i know about it  dr .  calvin .  you think of it always  so how can i help but know .    her face was hard .   have you   told anyone .     of course not .   this  with genuine surprise .   no one has asked me .     well  then   she flung out   i suppose you think i am a fool .     no .  it is a normal emotion .     perhaps that is why it is so foolish .   the wistfulness in her voice drowned out everything else .  some of the woman peered through the layer of doctorhood .   i am not what you would call   attractive .     if you are referring to mere physical attraction  i couldn t judge .  but i know  in any case  that there are other types of attraction .     nor young .   dr .  calvin had scarcely heard the robot .    you are not yet forty .   an anxious insistence had crept into herbie s voice .    thirty eight as you count the years  a shriveled sixty as far as my emotional outlook on life is concerned .  am i a psychologist for nothing .    she drove on with bitter breathlessness   and he s barely thirty five and looks and acts younger .  do you suppose he ever sees me as anything but .  .  .  but what i am .     you are wrong .   herbie s steel fist struck the plastictopped table with a strident clang .   listen to me    but susan calvin whirled on him now and the hunted pain in her eyes became a blaze   why should i .  what do you know about it all  anyway  you .  .  .  you machine .  i m just a specimen to you  an interesting bug with a peculiar mind spread eagled for inspection .  it s a wonderful example of frustration  isn t it .  almost as good as your books .   her voice  emerging in dry sobs  choked into silence .   the robot cowered at the outburst .  he shook his head pleadingly .   won t you listen to me  please .  i could help you if you would let me .     how .   her lips curled .   by giving me good advice .     no  not that .  it s just that i know what other people think   milton ashe  for instance .    there was a long silence  and susan calvin s eyes dropped .   i don t want to know what he thinks   she gasped .   keep quiet .     i think you would want to know what he thinks   her head remained bent  but her breath came more quickly .   you are talking nonsense   she whispered .    why should i .  i am trying to help .  milton ashe s thoughts of you   he paused .   and then the psychologist raised her head   well .    the robot said quietly   he loves you .      for a full minute  dr .  calvin did not speak .  she merely stared .  then   you are mistaken .  you must be .  why should he .     but he does .  a thing like that cannot be hidden  not from me .     but i am so .  .  .  so   she stammered to a halt .    he looks deeper than the skin  and admires intellect in others .  milton ashe is not the type to marry a head of hair and a pair of eyes .    susan calvin found herself blinking rapidly and waited before speaking .  even then her voice trembled   yet he certainly never in any way indicated     have you ever given him a chance .     how could i .  i never thought that     exactly .    the psychologist paused in thought and then looked up suddenly .   a girl visited him here at the plant half a year ago .  she was pretty  i suppose   blond and slim .  and  of course  could scarcely add two and two .  he spent all day puffing out his chest  trying to explain how a robot was put together .   the hardness had returned   not that she understood .  who was she .    herbie answered without hesitation   i know the person you are referring to .  she is his first cousin  and there is no romantic interest there  i assure you .    susan calvin rose to her feet with a vivacity almost girlish .   now isn t that strange .  that s exactly what i used to pretend to myself sometimes  though i never really thought so .  then it all must be true .    she ran to herbie and seized his cold  heavy hand in both hers .   thank you  herbie .   her voice was an urgent  husky whisper .   don t tell anyone about this .  let it be our secret   and thank you again .   with that  and a convulsive squeeze of herbie s unresponsive metal fingers  she left .   herbie turned slowly to his neglected novel  but there was no one to read his thoughts .     milton ashe stretched slowly and magnificently  to the tune of cracking joints and a chorus of grunts  and then glared at peter bogert  ph . d .    say   he said   i ve been at this for a week now with just about no sleep .  how long do i have to keep it up .  i thought you said the positronic bombardment in vac chamber d was the solution .    bogert yawned delicately and regarded his white hands with interest .   it is .  i m on the track .     i know what that means when a mathematician says it .  how near the end are you .     it all depends .     on what .   ashe dropped into a chair and stretched his long legs out before him .    on lanning .  the old fellow disagrees with me .   he sighed   a bit behind the times  that s the trouble with him .  he clings to matrix mechanics as the all in all  and this problem calls for more powerful mathematical tools .  he s so stubborn .    ashe muttered sleepily   why not ask herbie and settle the whole affair .     ask the robot .   bogert s eyebrows climbed .    why not .  didn t the old girl tell you .     you mean calvin .     yeah .  susie herself .  that robot s a mathematical wiz .  he knows all about everything plus a bit on the side .  he does triple integrals in his head and eats up tensor analysis for dessert .    the mathematician stared skeptically   are you serious .     so help me .  the catch is that the dope doesn t like math .  he would rather read slushy novels .  honest .  you should see the tripe susie keeps feeding him   purple passion  and  love in space .       dr .  calvin hasn t said a word of this to us .     well  she hasn t finished studying him .  you know how she is .  she likes to have everything just so before letting out the big secret .     she s told you .     we sort of got to talking .  i have been seeing a lot of her lately .   he opened his eyes wide and frowned   say  bogie  have you been noticing anything queer about the lady lately .    bogert relaxed into an undignified grin   she s using lipstick  if that s what you mean .     hell  i know that .  rouge  powder and eye shadow  too .  she s a sight .  but it s not that .  i can t put my finger on it .  it s the way she talks   as if she were happy about something .   he thought a little  and then shrugged .   the other allowed himself a leer  which  for a scientist past fifty  was not a bad job   maybe she s in love .    ashe allowed his eyes to close again   you re nuts  bogie .  you go speak to herbie  i want to stay here and go to sleep .     right .  not that i particularly like having a robot tell me my job  nor that i think he can do it .    a soft snore was his only answer .   herbie listened carefully as peter bogert  hands in pockets  spoke with elaborate indifference .    so there you are .  i ve been told you understand these things  and i am asking you more in curiosity than anything else .  my line of reasoning  as i have outlined it  involves a few doubtful steps  i admit  which dr .  lanning refuses to accept  and the picture is still rather incomplete .    the robot didn t answer  and bogert said   well .     i see no mistake   herbie studied the scribbled figures .    i don t suppose you can go any further than that .     i daren t try .  you are a better mathematician than i  and   well  i d hate to commit myself .    there was a shade of complacency in bogert s smile   i rather thought that would be the case .  it is deep .  we ll forget it .   he crumpled the sheets  tossed them down the waste shaft  turned to leave  and then thought better of it .    by the way    the robot waited .   bogert seemed to have difficulty .   there is something  that is  perhaps you can   he stopped .   herbie spoke quietly .   your thoughts are confused  but there is no doubt at all that they concern dr .  lanning .  it is silly to hesitate  for as soon as you compose yourself  i ll know what it is you want to ask .    the mathematician s hand went to his sleek hair in the familiar smoothing gesture .   lanning is nudging seventy   he said  as if that explained everything .    i know that .     and he s been director of the plant for almost thirty years .   herbie nodded .    well  now   bogert s voice became ingratiating   you would know whether .  .  .  whether he s thinking of resigning .  health  perhaps  or some other     quite   said herbie  and that was all .    well  do you know .     certainly .     then uh could you tell me .     since you ask  yes .   the robot was quite matter of fact about it .   he has already resigned .     what .   the exclamation was an explosive  almost inarticulate  sound .  the scientist s large head hunched forward   say that again .     he has already resigned   came the quiet repetition   but it has not yet taken effect .  he is waiting  you see  to solve the problem of  er   myself .  that finished  he is quite ready to turn the office of director over to his successor .    bogert expelled his breath sharply   and this successor .  who is he .   he was quite close to herbie now  eyes fixed fascinatedly on those unreadable dull red photoelectric cells that were the robot s eyes .   words came slowly   you are the next director .    and bogert relaxed into a tight smile   this is good to know .  i ve been hoping and waiting for this .  thanks  herbie .    peter bogert was at his desk until five that morning and he was back at nine .  the shelf just over the desk emptied of its row of reference books and tables  as he referred to one after the other .  the pages of calculations before him increased microscopically and the crumpled sheets at his feet mounted into a hill of scribbled paper .   at precisely noon  he stared at the final page  rubbed a blood shot eye  yawned and shrugged .   this is getting worse each minute .  damn .    he turned at the sound of the opening door and nodded at lanning  who entered  cracking the knuckles of one gnarled hand with the other .   the director took in the disorder of the room and his eyebrows furrowed together .    new lead .   he asked .    no   came the defiant answer .   what s wrong with the old one .    lanning did not trouble to answer  nor to do more than bestow a single cursory glance at the top sheet upon bogert s desk .  he spoke through the flare of a match as he lit a cigar .    has calvin told you about the robot .  it s a mathematical genius .  really remarkable .    the other snorted loudly   so i ve heard .  but calvin had better stick to robopsychology .  i ve checked herbie on math  and he can scarcely struggle through calculus .     calvin didn t find it so .     she s crazy .     and i don t find it so .   the director s eyes narrowed dangerously .    you .   bogert s voice hardened .   what are you talking about .     i ve been putting herbie through his paces all morning  and he can do tricks you never heard of .     is that so .     you sound skeptical .   lanning flipped a sheet of paper out of his vest pocket and unfolded it .   that s not my handwriting  is it .    bogert studied the large angular notation covering the sheet   herbie did this .     right .  and if you ll notice  he s been working on your time integration of equation    .  it comes   lanning tapped a yellow fingernail upon the last step   to the identical conclusion i did  and in a quarter the time .  you had no right to neglect the linger effect in positronic bombardment .     i didn t neglect it .  for heaven s sake  lanning  get it through your head that it would cancel out     oh  sure  you explained that .  you used the mitchell translation equation  didn t you .  well   it doesn t apply .     why not .     because you ve been using hyper imaginaries  for one thing .     what s that to do with .     mitchell s equation won t hold when     are you crazy .  if you ll reread mitchell s original paper in the transactions of the far     i don t have to .  i told you in the beginning that i didn t like his reasoning  and herbie backs me in that .     well  then   bogert shouted   let that clockwork contraption solve the entire problem for you .  why bother with nonessentials .     that s exactly the point .  herbie can t solve the problem .  and if he can t  we can t   alone .  i m submitting the entire question to the national board .  it s gotten beyond us .    bogert s chair went over backward as he jumped up a snarl  face crimson .   you re doing nothing of the sort .    lanning flushed in his turn   are you telling me what i can t do .     exactly   was the gritted response .   i ve got the problem beaten and you re not to take it out of my hands  understand .  don t think i don t see through you  you desiccated fossil .  you d cut your own nose off before you d let me get the credit for solving robotic telepathy .     you re a damned idiot  bogert  and in one second i ll have you suspended for insubordination    lanning s lower lip trembled with passion .    which is one thing you won t do  lanning .  you haven t any secrets with a mind reading robot around  so don t forget that i know all about your resignation .    the ash on lanning s cigar trembled and fell  and the cigar itself followed   what .  .  .  what    bogert chuckled nastily   and i m the new director  be it understood .  i m very aware of that  don t think i m not .  damn your eyes  lanning  i m going to give the orders about here or there will be the sweetest mess that you ve ever been in .    lanning found his voice and let it out with a roar .   you re suspended  d ye hear .  you re relieved of all duties .  you re broken  do you understand .    the smile on the other s face broadened   now  what s the use of that .  you re getting nowhere .  i m holding the trumps .  i know you ve resigned .  herbie told me  and he got it straight from you .    lanning forced himself to speak quietly .  he looked an old  old man  with tired eyes peering from a face in which the red had disappeared  leaving the pasty yellow of age behind   i want to speak to herbie .  he can t have told you anything of the sort .  you re playing a deep game  bogert  but i m calling your bluff .  come with me .    bogert shrugged   to see herbie .  good .  damned good .      it was also precisely at noon that milton ashe looked up from his clumsy sketch and said   you get the idea .  i m not too good at getting this down  but that s about how it looks .  it s a honey of a house  and i can get it for next to nothing .    susan calvin gazed across at him with melting eyes .   it s really beautiful   she sighed .   i ve often thought that i d like to   her voice trailed away .    of course   ashe continued briskly  putting away his pencil   i ve got to wait for my vacation .  it s only two weeks off  but this herbie business has evervthing up in the air .   his eyes dropped to his fingernails   besides  there s another point   but it s a secret .     then don t tell me .     oh  i d just as soon  i m just busting to tell someone   and you re just about the best  er  confidante i could find here .   he grinned sheepishly .   susan calvin s heart bounded  but she did not trust herself to speak .    frankly   ashe scraped his chair closer and lowered his voice into a confidential whisper   the house isn t to be only for myself .  i m getting married .    and then he jumped out of his seat   what s the matter .     nothing .   the horrible spinning sensation had vanished  but it was hard to get words out .   married .  you mean     why  sure .  about time  isn t it .  you remember that girl who was here last summer .  that s she .  but you are sick .  you     headache .   susan calvin motioned him away weakly .   i ve .  .  .  i ve been subject to them lately .  i want to .  .  .  to congratulate you  of course .  i m very glad   the inexpertly applied rouge made a pair of nasty red splotches upon her chalk white face .  things had begun spinning again .   pardon me  please    the words were a mumble  as she stumbled blindly out the door .  it had happened with the sudden catastrophe of a dream   and with all the unreal horror of a dream .   but how could it be .  herbie had said   and herbie knew .  he could see into minds .   she found herself leaning breathlessly against the door jamb  staring into herbie s metal face .  she must have climbed the two flights of stairs  but she had no memory of it .  the distance had been covered in an instant  as in a dream .   as in a dream .   and still herbie s unblinking eyes stared into hers and their dull red seemed to expand into dimly shining nightmarish globes .   he was speaking  and she felt the cold glass pressing against her lips .  she swallowed and shuddered into a pertain awareness of her surroundings .   still herbie spoke  and there was agitation in his voice   as if he were hurt and frightened and pleading .   the words were beginning to make sense .   this is a dream   he was saying   and you mustn t believe in it .  you ll wake into the real world soon and laugh at yourself .  he loves you  i tell you .  he does  he does .  but not here .  not now .  this is an illusion .    susan calvin nodded  her voice a whisper   yes .  yes .   she was clutching herbie s arm  clinging to it  repeating over and over   it isn t true  is it .  it isn t  is it .    just how she came to her senses  she never knew   but it was like passing from a world of misty unreality to one of harsh sunlight .  she pushed him away from her  pushed hard against that steely arm  and her eyes were wide .    what are you trying to do .   her voice rose to a harsh scream .   what are you trying to do .    herbie backed away   i want to help   the psychologist stared   help .  by telling me this is a dream .  by trying to push me into schizophrenia .   a hysterical tenseness seized her   this is no dream .  i wish it were .    she drew her breath sharply   wait .  why .  .  .  why  i understand .  merciful heavens  it s so obvious .    there was horror in the robot s voice   i had to .     and i believed youl i never thought    loud voices outside the door brought her to a halt .  she turned away  fists clenching spasmodically  and when bogert and lanning entered  she was at the far window .  neither of the men paid her the slightest attention .   they approached herbie simultaneously  lanning angry and impatient  bogert  coolly sardonic .  the director spoke first .    here now  herbie .  listen to me .    the robot brought his eyes sharply down upon the aged director   yes  dr .  lanning .     have you discussed me with dr .  bogert .     no  sir .   the answer came slowly  and the smile on bogert s face flashed off .    what s that .   bogert shoved in ahead of his superior and straddled the ground before the robot .   repeat what you told me yesterday .     i said that   herbie fell silent .  deep within him his metallic diaphragm vibrated in soft discords .    didn t you say he had resigned .   roared bogert .   answer me .    bogert raised his arm frantically  but lanning pushed him aside   are you trying to bully him into lying .     you heard him  lanning .  he began to say  yes  and stopped .  get out of my way .  i want the truth out of him  understandl    i ll ask him .   lanning turned to the robot .   all right  herbie  take it easy .  have i resigned .    herbie stared  and lanning repeated anxiously   have i resigned .   there was the faintest trace of a negative shake of the robot s head .  a long wait produced nothing further .   the two men looked at each other and the hostility in their eyes was all but tangible .    what the devil   blurted bogert   has the robot gone mute .  can t you speak  you monstrosity .     i can speak   came the ready answer .    then answer the question .  didn t you tell me lanning had resigned .  hasn t he resigned   and again there was nothing but dull silence  until from the end of the room  susan calvin s laugh rang out suddenly  high pitched and semi hysterical .   the two mathematicians jumped  and bogerts eyes narrowed   you here .  what s so funny .     nothing s funny .   her voice was not quite natural .   it s just that i m not the only one that s been caught .  there s irony in three of the greatest experts in robotics in the world falling into the same elementary trap  isn t there .   her voice faded  and she put a pale hand to her forehead   but it isn t funny .    this time the look that passed between the two men was one of raised eyebrows .   what trap are you talking about .   asked lansing stiffly .   is something wrong with herbie .     no   she approached them slowly   nothing is wrong with him   only with us .   she whirled suddenly and shrieked at the robot   get away from me .  go to the other end of the room and don t let me look at you .    herbie cringed before the fury of her eyes and stumbled away in a clattering trot .   lanning s voice was hostile   what is all this  dr .  calvin .    she faced them and spoke sarcastically   surely you know the fundamental first law of robotics .    the other two nodded together .   certainly   said bogert  irritably   a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow him to come to harm    how nicely put   sneered calvin .   but what kind of harm .     why   any kind .     exactly .  any kind .  but what about hurt feelings .  what about deflation of one s ego .  what about the blasting of one s hopes .  is that injury .    lanning frowned   what would a robot know about   and then he caught himself with a gasp .    you ve caught on  have you .  this robot reads minds .  do you suppose it doesn t know everything about mental injury .  do you suppose that if asked a question  it wouldn t give exactly that answer that one wants to hear .  wouldn t any other answer hurt us  and wouldn t herbie know that .     good heavens .   muttered bogert .   the psychologist cast a sardonic glance at him   i take it you asked him whether lanning had resigned .  you wanted to hear that he had resigned and so that s what herbie told you .     and i suppose that is why   said lanning  tonelessly   it would not answer a little while ago .  it couldn t answer either way without hurting one of us .    there was a short pause in which the men looked thoughtfully across the room at the robot  crouching in the chair by the bookcase  head resting in one hand .   susan calvin stared steadfastly at the floor   he knew of all this .  that .  .  .  that devil knows everything   including what went wrong in his assembly .   her eyes were dark and brooding .   lanning looked up   you re wrong there  dr .  calvin .  he doesn t know what went wrong .  i asked him .     what does that mean .   cried calvin .   only that you didn t want him to give you the solution .  it would puncture your ego to have a machine do what you couldn t .  did you ask him .   she shot at bogert .    in a way .   bogert coughed and reddened .   he told me he knew very little about mathematics .    lanning laughed  not very loudly and the psychologist smiled caustically .  she said   i ll ask him .  a solution by him won t hurt my ego  she raised her voice into a cold  imperative   come here .    herbie rose and approached with hesitant steps .    you know  i suppose   she continued   just exactly at what point in the assembly an extraneous factor was introduced or an essential one left out .     yes   said herbie  in tones barely heard .    hold on   broke in bogert angrily .   that s not necessary true .  you want to hear that  that s all .     don t be a fool   replied calvin .   he certainly knows as much math as you and lanning together  since he can read minds .  give him his chance .    the mathematician subsided  and calvin continued   all right  then  herbie  give .  we re waiting .   and in an aside   get pencils and paper  gentlemen .    but herbie remained silent  and there was triumph in the psychologist s voice   why don t you answer  herbie .    the robot blurted out suddenly   i cannot .  you know i cannot .  dr .  bogert and dr .  lanning don t want me to .     they want the solution .     but not from me .    lanning broke in  speaking slowly and distinctly   don t be foolish  herbie .  we do want you to tell us .    bogert nodded curtly .   herbie s voice rose to wild heights   what s the use of saying that .  don t you suppose that i can see past the superficial skin of your mind .  down below  you don t want me to .  i m a machine  given the imitation of life only by virtue of the positronic interplay in my brain which is man s device .  you can t lose face to me without being hurt .  that is deep in your mind and won t be erased .  i can t give the solution .     we ll leave   said dr .  lanning .   tell calvin .     that would make no difference   cried herbie   since you would know anyway that it was i that was supplying the answer .    calvin resumed   but you understand  herbie  that despite that  drs .  lanning and bogert want that solution .     by their own efforts .   insisted herbie .    but they want it  and the fact that you have it and won t give it hurts them .  you see that  don t you .     yes .  yes .     and if you tell them that will hurt them  too    yes .  yes .   herbie was retreating slowly  and step by step susan calvin advanced .  the two men watched in frozen bewilderment .    you can t tell them   droned the psychologist slowly   because that would hurt and you mustn t hurt .  but if you don t tell them  you hurt  so you must tell them .  and if you do  you will hurt and you mustn t  so you can t tell them  but if you don t  you hurt  so you must  but if you do  you hurt  so you mustn t  but if you don t  you hurt  so you must  but if you do  you        herbie was up against the wall  and here he dropped to his knees .   stop .   he shrieked .   close your mind .  it is full of pain and frustration and hate .  i didn t mean it  i tell you .  i tried to help .  i told you what you wanted to hear .  i had to .    the psychologist paid no attention .   you must tell them  but if you do  you hurt  so you mustn t  but if you don t  you hurt  so you must  but    and herbie screamed .   it was like the whistling of a piccolo many times magnified   shrill and shriller till it keened with the terror of a lost soul and filled the room with the piercingness of itself .   and when it died into nothingness  herbie collapsed into a huddled heap of motionless metal .   bogert s face was bloodless   he s dead .     no .   susan calvin burst into body racking gusts of wild laughter   not dead   merely insane .  i confronted him with the insoluble dilemma  and he broke down .  you can scrap him now because he ll never speak again .    lanning was on his knees beside the thing that had been herbie .  his fingers touched the cold  unresponsive metal face and he shuddered .   you did that on purpose .   he rose and faced her  face contorted .    what if i did .  you can t help it now .   and in a sudden access of bitterness   he deserved it .    the director seized the paralysed  motionless bogert by the wrist   what s the difference .  come  peter .   he sighed   a thinking robot of this type is worthless anyway .   his eyes were old and tired  and he repeated   come  peter .    it was minutes after the two scientists left that dr .  susan calvin regained part of her mental equilibrium .  slowly  her eyes turned to the living dead herbie and the tightness returned to her face .  long she stared while the triumph faded and the helpless frustration returned   and of all her turbulent thoughts only one infinitely bitter word passed her lips .    liar .          that finished it for then  naturally .  i knew i couldn t get any more out of her after that .  she just sat there behind her desk  her white face cold and   remembering .   i said   thank you  dr .  calvin .   but she didn t answer .  it was two days before i could get to see her again .            little lost robot         when i did see susan calvin again  it was at the door of her office .  files were being moved out .   she said   how are your articles coming along  young man .     fine   i said .  i had put them into shape according to my own lights  dramatized the bare bones of her recital  added the conversation and little touches   would you look over them and see if i haven t been libellous or too unreasonably inaccurate anywhere .     i suppose so .  shall we retire to the executives  lounge .  we can have coffee .    she seemed in good humor  so i chanced it as we walked down the corridor   i was wondering  dr .  calvin     yes .     if you would tell me more concerning the history of robotics .     surely you have what you want  young man .     in a way .  but these incidents i have written up don t apply much to the modern world .  i mean  there was only one mind reading robot ever developed  and space stations are already outmoded and in disuse  and robot mining is taken for granted .  what about interstellar travel .  it s only been about twenty years since the hyperatomic motor was invented and it s well known that it was a robotic invention .  what is the truth about it .     interstellar travel .   she was thoughtful .  we were in the lounge  and i ordered a full dinner .  she just had coffee .    it wasn t a simple robotic invention  you know  not just like that .  but  of course  until we developed the brain  we didn t get very far .  but we tried  we really tried .  my first connection  directly  that is  with interstellar research was in       when a robot was lost        measures on hyper base had been taken in a sort of rattling fury   the muscular equivalent of an hysterical shriek .   to itemize them in order of both chronology and desperation  they were     .  all work on the hyperatomic drive through all the space volume occupied by the stations of the twenty seventh asteroidal grouping came to a halt .     .  that entire volume of space was nipped out of the system  practically speaking .  no one entered without permission .  no one left under any conditions .     .  by special government patrol ship  drs .  susan calvin and peter bogert  respectively head psychologist and mathematical director of united states robot   mechanical men corporation  were brought to hyper base .     susan calvin had never left the surface of earth before  and had no perceptible desire to leave it this time .  in an age of atomic power and a clearly coming hyperatomic drive  she remained quietly provincial .  so she was dissatisfied with her trip and unconvinced of the emergency  and every line of her plain  middle aged face showed it clearly enough during her first dinner at hyper base .   nor did dr .  bogert s sleek paleness abandon a certain hangdog attitude .  nor did major general kallner  who headed the project  even once forget to maintain a hunted expression .  in short  it was a grisly episode  that meal  and the little session of three that followed began in a gray  unhappy manner .   kallner  with his baldness glistening  and his dress uniform oddly unsuited to the general mood  began with uneasy directness .    this is a queer story to tell  sir  and madam .  i want to thank you for coming on short notice and without a reason being given .  we ll try to correct that now .  we ve lost a robot .  work has stopped and must stop until such time as we locate it .  so far we have failed  and we feel we need expert help .    perhaps the general felt his predicament anticlimactic .  he continued with a note of desperation   i needn t tell you the importance of our work here .  more than eighty percent of last year s appropriations for scientific research have gone to us     why  we know that   said bogert  agreeably .   u .  s .  robots is receiving a generous rental fee for use of our robots .    susan calvin injected a blunt  vinegary note   what makes a single robot so important to the project  and why hasn t it been located .    the general turned his red face toward her and wet his lips quickly   why  in a manner of speaking we have located it .   then  with near anguish   here  suppose i explain .  as soon as the robot failed to report a state of emergency was declared  and all movement off hyper base stopped .  a cargo vessel had landed the previous day and had delivered us two robots for our laboratories .  it had sixty two robots of the .  .  .  uh .  .  .  game type for shipment elsewhere .  we are certain as to that figure .  there is no question about it whatever .     yes .  and the connection .     when our missing robot failed of location anywhere   i assure you we would have found a missing blade of grass if it had been there to find   we brainstormed ourselves into counting the robots left of the cargo ship .  they have sixty three now .     so that the sixty third  i take it  is the missing prodigal .   dr .  calvin s eyes darkened .    yes  but we have no way of telling which is the sixty third .    there was a dead silence while the electric clock chimed eleven times  and then the robopsychologist said   very peculiar   and the corners of her lips moved downward .    peter   she turned to her colleague with a trace of savagery   what s wrong here .  what kind of robots are they  using at hyper base .    dr .  bogert hesitated and smiled feebly   it s been rather a matter of delicacy till now  susan .    she spoke rapidly   yes  till now .  if there are sixty three same type robots  one of which is wanted and the identity of which cannot be determined  why won t any of them do .  what s the idea of all this .  why have we been sent for .    bogert said in resigned fashion   if you ll give me a chance  susan   hyper base happens to be using several robots whose brains are not impressioned with the entire first law of robotics .     aren t impressioned .   calvin slumped back in her chair   i see .  how many were made .     a few .  it was on government order and there was no way of violating the secrecy .  no one was to know except the top men directly concerned .  you weren t included  susan .  it was nothing i had anything to do with .      the general interrupted with a measure of authority .   i would like to explain that bit .  i hadn t been aware that dr .  calvin was unacquainted with the situation .  i needn t tell you  dr .  calvin  that there always has been strong opposition to robots on the planet .  the only defense the government has had against the fundamentalist radicals in this matter was the fact that robots are always built with an unbreakable first law   which makes it impossible for them to harm human beings under any circumstance .    but we had to have robots of a different nature .  so just a few of the ns   model  the nestors  that is  were prepared with a modified first law .  to keep it quiet  all ns   s are manufactured without serial numbers  modified members are delivered here along with a group of normal robots  and  of course  all our kind are under the strictest impressionment never to tell of their modification to unauthorized personnel .   he wore an embarrassed smile   this has all worked out against us now .    calvin said grimly   have you asked each one who it is  anyhow .  certainly  you are authorized .    the general nodded   all sixty three deny having worked here   and one is lying .     does the one you want show traces of wear .  the others  i take it  are factory fresh .     the one in question only arrived last month .  it  and the two that have just arrived  were to be the last we needed .  there s no perceptible wear .   he shook his head slowly and his eyes were haunted again   dr .  calvin  we don t dare let that ship leave .  if the existence of non first law robots becomes general knowledge   there seemed no way of avoiding understatement in the conclusion .    destroy all sixty three   said the robopsychologist coldly and flatly   and make an end of it .    bogert drew back a corner of his mouth .   you mean destroy thirty thousand dollars per robot .  i m afraid u .  s .  robots wouldn t like that .  we d better make an effort first  susan  before we destroy anything .     in that case   she said  sharply   i need facts .  exactly what advantage does hyper base derive from these modified robots .  what factor made them desirable  general .    kallner ruffled his forehead and stroked it with an upward gesture of his hand .   we had trouble with our previous robots .  our men work with hard radiations a good deal  you see .  it s dangerous  of course  but reasonable precautions are taken .  there have been only two accidents since we began and neither was fatal .  however  it was impossible to explain that to an ordinary robot .  the first law states  i ll quote it   no robot may harm a human being  or through inactiotn  allow a human being to come to harm .     that s primary  dr .  calvin .  when it was necessary for one of our men to expose himself for a short period to a moderate gamma field  one that would have no physiological effects  the nearest robot would dash in to drag him out .  if the field were exceedingly weak  it would succeed  and work could not continue till all robots were cleared out .  if the field were a trifle stronger  the robot would never reach the technician concerned  since its positronic brain would collapse under gamma radiations   and then we would be out one expensive and hard to replace robot .    we tried arguing with them .  their point was that a human being in a gamma field was endangering his life and that it didn t matter that he could remain there half an hour safely .  supposing  they would say  he forgot and remained an hour .  they couldn t take chances .  we pointed out that they were risking their lives on a wild off chance .  but selfpreservation is only the third law of robotics   and the first law of human safety came first .  we gave them orders  we ordered them strictly and harshly to remain out of gamma fields at whatever cost .  but obedience is only the second law of robotics   and the first law of human safety came first .  dr .  calvin  we either had to do without robots  or do something about the first law   and we made our choice .     i can t believe   said dr .  calvin   that it was found possible to remove the first law .     it wasn t removed  it was modified   explained kallner .   positronic brains were constructed that contained the positive aspect only of the law  which in them reads   no robot may harm a human being .   that is all .  they have no compulsion to prevent one coming to harm through an extraneous agency such as gamma rays .  i state the matter correctly  dr .  bogert .     quite   assented the mathematician .    and that is the only difference of your robots from the ordinary ns  model .  the only difference .  peter .     the only difference  susan .    she rose and spoke with finality   i intend sleeping now  and in about eight hours  i want to speak to whomever saw the robot last .  and from now on  general kallner  if i m to take any responsibility at all for events  i want full and unquestioned control of this investigation .    susan calvin  except for two hours of resentful lassitude  experienced nothing approaching sleep .  she signaled at bogert s door at the local time of      and found him also awake .  he had apparently taken the trouble of transporting a dressing gown to hyper base with him  for he was sitting in it .  he put his nail scissors down when calvin entered .   he said softly   i ve been expecting you more or less .  i suppose you feel sick about all this .     i do .     well  i m sorry .  there was no way of preventing it .  when the call came out from hyper base for us  i knew that something must have gone wrong with the modified nestors .  but what was there to do .  i couldn t break the matter to you on the trip here as i would have liked to  because i had to be sure .  the matter of the modification is top secret .    the psychologist muttered   i should have been told .  u .  s .  robots had no right to modify positronic brains this way without the approval of a psychologist .    bogert lifted his eyebrows and sighed .   be reasonable  susan .  you couldn t have influenced them .  in this matter  the government was bound to have its way .  they want the hyperatomic drive and the etheric physicists want robots that won t interfere with them .  they were going to get them even if it did mean twisting the first law .  we had to admit it was possible from a construction standpoint and they swore a mighty oath that they wanted only twelve  that they would be used only at hyper base  that they would be destroyed once the drive was perfected  and that full precautions would be taken .  and they insisted on secrecy   and that s the situation .    dr .  calvin spoke through her teeth   i would have resigned .     it wouldn t have helped .  the government was offering the company a fortune  and threatening it with antirobot legislation in case of a refusal .  we were stuck then  and we re badly stuck now .  if this leaks out  it might hurt kallner and the government  but it would hurt u .  s .  robots a devil of a lot more .    the psychologist stared at him .   peter  don t you realize what all this is about .  can t you understand what the removal of the first law means .  it isn t just a matter of secrecy .     i know what removal would mean .  i m not a child .  it would mean complete instability  with no nonimaginary solutions to the positronic field equations .     yes  mathematically .  but can you translate that into crude psychological thought .  all normal life  peter  consciously or otherwise  resents domination .  if the domination is by an inferior  or by a supposed inferior  the resentment becomes stronger .  physically  and  to an extent  mentally  a robot  any robot  is superior to human beings .  what makes him slavish  then .  only the first lawl why  without it  the first order you tried to give a robot would result in your death .  unstable .  what do you think .     susan   said bogert  with an air of sympathetic amusement .   i ll admit that this frankenstein complex you re exhibiting has a certain justification  hence the first law in the first  place .  but the law  i repeat and repeat  has not been removed   merely modified .     and what about the stability of the brain .    the mathematician thrust out his lips   decreased  naturally .  but it s within the border of safety .  the first nestors were delivered to hyper base nine months ago  and nothing whatever has gone wrong till now  and even this involves merely fear of discovery and not danger to humans .     very well  then .  we ll see what comes of the morning conference .    bogert saw her politely to the door and grimaced eloquently when she left .  he saw no reason to change his perennial opinion of her as a sour and fidgety frustration .   susan calvin s train of thought did not include bogert in the least .  she had dismissed him years ago as a smooth and pretentious sleekness .     gerald black had taken his degree in etheric physics the year before and  in common with his entire generation of physicists  found himself engaged in the problem of the drive .  he now made a proper addition to the general atmosphere of these meetings on hyper base .  in his stained white smock  he was half rebellious and wholly uncertain .  his stocky strength seemed striving for release and his fingers  as they twisted each other with nervous yanks  might have forced an iron bar out of true .   major general kallner sat beside him  the two from u .  s .  robots faced him .   black said   i m told that i was the last to see nestor    before he vanished .  i take it you want to ask me about that .    dr .  calvin regarded him with interest   you sound as if you were not sure  young man .  don t you know whether you were the last to see him .     he worked with me  ma am  on the field generators  and he was with me the morning of his disappearance .  i don t know if anyone saw him after about noon .  no one admits having done so .     do you think anyone s lying about it .     i don t say that .  but i don t say that i want the blame of it  either .   his dark eyes smoldered .    there s no question of blame .  the robot acted as it did because of what it is .  we re just trying to locate it  mr .  black  and let s put everything else aside .  now if you ve worked with the robot  you probably know it better than anyone else .  was there anything unusual about it that you noticed .  had you ever worked with robots before .     i ve worked with other robots we have here   the simple ones .  nothing different about the nestors except that they re a good deal cleverer   and more annoying .     annoying .  in what way .     well  perhaps it s not their fault .  the work here is rough and most of us get a little jagged .  fooling around with hyper space isn t fun .   he smiled feebly  finding pleasure in confession .   we run the risk continually of blowing a hole in normal space time fabric and dropping right out of the universe  asteroid and all .  sounds screwy  doesn t it .  naturally  you re on edge sometimes .  but these nestors aren t .  they re curious  they re calm  they don t worry .  it s enough to drive you nuts at times .  when you want something done in a tearing hurry  they seem to take their time .  sometimes i d rather do without .     you say they take their time .  have they ever refused an order .     oh  no   hastily .   they do it all right .  they tell you when they think you re wrong  though .  they don t know anything about the subject but what we taught them  but that doesn t stop them .  maybe i imagine it  but the other fellows have the same trouble with their nestors .    general kallner cleared his throat ominously   why have no complaints reached me on the matter  black .    the young physicist reddened   we didn t really want to do without the robots  sir  and besides we weren t certain exactly how such .  .  .  uh .  .  .  minor complaints might be received .    bogert interrupted softly   anything in particular happen the morning you last saw it .    there was a silence .  with a quiet motion  calvin repressed the comment that was about to emerge from kallner  and waited patiently .   then black spoke in blurting anger   i had a little trouble with it .  i d broken a kimball tube that morning and was out five days of work  my entire program was behind schedule  i hadn t received any mail from home for a couple of weeks .  and he came around wanting me to repeat an experiment i had abandoned a month ago .  he was always annoying me on that subject and i was tired of it .  i told him to go away   and that s all i saw of him .     you told him to go away .   asked dr .  calvin with sharp interest .   in just those words .  did you say  go away  .  try to remember the exact words .    there was apparently an internal struggle in progress .  black cradled his forehead in a broad palm for a moment  then tore it away and said defiantly   i said   go lose yourself .      bogert laughed for a short moment .   and he did  eh .    but calvin wasn t finished .  she spoke cajolingly   now we re getting somewhere  mr .  black .  but exact details are important .  in understanding the robot s actions  a word  a gesture  an emphasis may be everything .  you couldn t have said just those three words  for instance  could you .  by your own description you must have been in a hasty mood .  perhaps you strengthened your speech a little .    the young man reddened   well .  .  .  i may have called it a .  .  .  a few things .     exactly what things .     oh   i wouldn t remember exactly .  besides i couldn t repeat it .  you know how you get when you re excited .   his embarrassed laugh was almost a giggle   i sort of have a tendency to strong language .     that s quite all right   she replied  with prim severity .   at the moment  i m a psychologist .  i would like to have you repeat exactly what you said as nearly as you remember  and  even more important  the exact tone of voice you used .    black looked at his commanding officer for support  found none .  his eyes grew round and appalled   but i can t .     you must .     suppose   said bogert  with ill hidden amusement   you address me .  you may find it easier .    the young man s scarlet face turned to bogert .  he swallowed .   i said  his voice faded out .  he tried again   i said    and he drew a deep breath and spewed it out hastily in one long succession of syllables .  then  in the charged air that lingered  he concluded almost in tears    .  .  .  more or less .  i don t remember the exact order of what i called him  and maybe i left out something or put in something  but that was about it .    only the slightest flush betrayed any feeling on the part of the robopsychologist .  she said   i am aware of the meaning of most of the terms used .  the others  i suppose  are equally derogatory .     i m afraid so   agreed the tormented black .    and in among it  you told him to lose himself .     i meant it only figuratively .     i realize that .  no disciplinary action is intended  i am sure .   and at her glance  the general  who  five seconds earlier  had seemed not sure at all  nodded angrily .    you may leave  mr .  black .  thank you for your cooperation .      it took five hours for susan calvin to interview the sixty three robots .  it was five hours of multi repetition  of replacement after replacement of identical robot  of questions a  b  c  d  and answers a  b  c  d  of a carefully bland expression  a carefully neutral tone  a carefully friendly atmosphere  and a hidden wire recorder .   the psychologist felt drained of vitality when she was finished .   bogert was waiting for her and looked expectant as she dropped the recording spool with a clang upon the plastic of the desk .   she shook her head   all sixty three seemed the same to me .  i couldn t tell    he said   you couldn t expect to tell by ear  susan .  suppose we analyze the recordings .    ordinarily  the mathematical interpretation of verbal reactions of robots is one of the more intricate branches of robotic analysis .  it requires a staff of trained technicians and the help of complicated computing machines .  bogert knew that .  bogert stated as much  in an extreme of unshown annoyance after having listened to each set of replies  made lists of word deviations  and graphs of the intervals of responses .    there are no anomalies present  susan .  the variations in wording and the time reactions are within the limits of ordinary frequency groupings .  we need finer methods .  they must have computers here .  no .   he frowned and nibbled delicately at a thumbnail .   we can t use computers .  too much danger of leakage .  or maybe if we    dr .  calvin stopped him with an impatient gesture   please  peter .  this isn t one of your petty laboratory problems .  if we can t determine the modified nestor by some gross difference that we can see with the naked eye  one that there is no mistake about  we re out of luck .  the danger of being wrong  and of letting him escape is otherwise too great .  it s not enough to point out a minute irregularity in a graph .  i tell you  if that s all i ve got to go on  i d destroy them all just to be certain .  have you spoken to the other modified nestors .     yes  i have   snapped back bogert   and there s nothing wrong with them .  they re above normal in friendliness if anything .  they answered my questions  displayed pride in their knowledge   except the two new ones that haven t had time to learn their etheric physics .  they laughed rather good naturedly at my ignorance in some of the specializations here .   he shrugged   i suppose that forms some of the basis for resentment toward them on the part of the technicians here .  the robots are perhaps too willing to impress you with their greater knowledge .     can you try a few planar reactions to see if there has been any change  any deterioration  in their mental set up since manufacture .     i haven t yet  but i will .   he shook a slim finger at her   you re losing your nerve  susan .  i don t see what it is you re dramatizing .  they re essentially harmless .     they are .   calvin took fire .   they are .  do you realize one of them is lying .  one of the sixty three robots i have just interviewed has deliberately lied to me after the strictest injunction to tell the truth .  the abnormality indicated is horribly deep seated  and horribly frightening .    peter bogert felt his teeth harden against each other .  he said   not at all .  look .  nestor    was given orders to lose himself .  those orders were expressed in maximum urgency by the person most authorized to command him .  you can t counteract that order either by superior urgency or superior right of command .  naturally  the robot will attempt to defend the carrying out of his orders .  in fact  objectively  i admire his ingenuity .  how better can a robot lose himself than to hide himself among a group of similar robots .     yes  you would admire it .  i ve detected amusement in you  peter   amusement and an appalling lack of understanding .  are you a roboticist  peter .  those robots attach importance to what they consider superiority .  you ve just said as much yourself .  subconsciously they feel humans to be inferior and the first law which protects us from them is imperfect .  they are unstable .  and here we have a young man ordering a robot to leave him  to lose himself  with every verbal appearance of revulsion  disdain  and disgust .  granted  that robot must follow orders  but subconsciously  there is resentment .  it will become more important than ever for it to prove that it is superior despite the horrible names it was called .  it may become so important that what s left of the first law won t be enough .     how on earth  or anywhere in the solar system  susan  is a robot going to know the meaning of the assorted strong language used upon him .  obscenity is not one of the things impressioned upon his brain .     original impressionment is not everything   calvin snarled at him .   robots have learning capacity  you .  .  .  you fool   and bogert knew that she had really lost her temper .  she continued hastily   don t you suppose he could tell from the tone used that the words weren t complimentary .  don t yon suppose he s heard the words used before and noted upon what occasions .     well  then   shouted bogert   will you kindly tell me one way in which a modified robot can harm a human being  no matter how offended it is  no matter how sick with desire to prove superiority .     if i tell you one way  will you keep quiet .     yes .    they were leaning across the table at each other  angry eyes nailed together .   the psychologist said   if a modified robot were to drop a heavy weight upon a human being  he would not be breaking the first law  if he did so with the knowledge that his strength and reaction speed would be sufficient to snatch the weight away before it struck the man .  however once the weight left his fingers  he would be no longer the active medium .  only the blind force of gravity would be that .  the robot could then change his mind and merely by inaction  allow the weight to strike .  the modified first law allows that .     that s an awful stretch of imagination .     that s what my profession requires sometimes .  peter  let s not quarrel .  let s work .  you know the exact nature of the stimulus that caused the robot to lose himself .  you have the records of his original mental make up .  i want you to tell me how possible it is for our robot to do the sort of thing i just talked about .  not the specific instance  mind you  but that whole class of response .  and i want it done quickly .     and meanwhile     and meanwhile  we ll have to try performance tests directly on the response to first law .      gerald black  at his own request  was supervising the mushrooming wooden partitions that were springing up in a bellying circle on the vaulted third floor of radiation building   .  the laborers worked  in the main  silently  but more than one was openly a wonder at the sixty three photocells that required installation .   one of them sat down near black  removed his hat  and wiped his forehead thoughtfully with a freckled forearm .   black nodded at him   how s it doing  walensky .    walensky shrugged and fired a cigar   smooth as butter .  what s going on anyway  doc .  first  there s no work for three days and then we have this mess of jiggers .   he leaned backward on his elbows and puffed smoke .   black twitched his eyebrows   a couple of robot men came over from earth .  remember the trouble we had with robots running into the gamma fields .  before we pounded it into their skulls that they weren t to do it .     yeah .  didn t we get new robots .     we got some replacements  but mostly it was a job of indoctrination .  anyway  the people who make them want to figure out robots that aren t hit so bad by gamma rays .     sure seems funny  though  to stop all the work on the drive for this robot deal .  i thought nothing was allowed to stop the drive .     well  it s the fellows upstairs that have the say on that .  me  i just do as i m told .  probably all a matter of pull     yeah   the electrician jerked a smile  and winked a wise eye .   somebody knew somebody in washington .  but as long as my pay comes through on the dot  i should worry .  the drive s none of my affair .  what are they going to do here .     you re asking me .  they brought a mess of robots with them   over sixty  and they re going to measure reactions .  that s all my knowledge .     how long will it take .     i wish i knew .     well   walensky said  with heavy sarcasm   as long as they dish me my money  they can play games all they want .    black felt quietly satisfied .  let the story spread .  it was harmless  and near enough to the truth to take the fangs out of curiosity .     a man sat in the chair  motionless  silent .  a weight dropped  crashed downward  then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam .  in sixty three wooden cells  watching ns   robots dashed forward in that split second before the weight veered  and sixty three photocells five feet ahead of their original positions jiggled the marking pen and presented a little jag on the paper .  the weight rose and dropped  rose and dropped  rose   ten times .   ten times the robots sprang forward and stopped  as the man remained safely seated .   major general kallner had not worn his uniform in its entirety since the first dinner with the u .  s .  robot representatives .  he wore nothing over his blue gray shirt now  the collar was open  and the black tie was pulled loose .   he looked hopefully at bogert  who was still blandly neat and whose inner tension was perhaps betrayed only by the trace of glister at his temples .   the general said   how does it look .  what is it you re trying to see .    bogert replied   a difference which may turn out to be a little too subtle for our purposes  i m afraid .  for sixty two of those robots the necessity of jumping toward the apparently threatened human was what we call  in robotics  a forced reaction .  you see  even when the robots knew that the human in question would not come to harm   and after the third or fourth time they must have known it   they could not prevent reacting as they did .  first law requires it    well .     but the sixty third robot  the modified nestor  had no such complusion .  he was under free action .  if he had wished  he could have remained in his seat .  unfortunately   said his voice was mildly regretful   he didn t so wish .     why do you suppose .    bogert shrugged   i suppose dr .  calvin will tell us when she gets here .  probably with a horribly pessimistic interpretation  too .  she is sometimes a bit annoying .     she s qualified  isn t she .   demanded the general with a sudden frown of uneasiness .    yes .   bogert seemed amused .   she s qualified all right .  she understands robots like a sister   comes from hating human beings so much  i think .  it s just that  psychologist or not  she s an extreme neurotic .  has paranoid tendencies .  don t take her too seriously .    he spread the long row of broken line graphs out in front of him .   you see  general  in the case of each robot the time interval from moment of drop to the completion of a five foot movement tends to decrease as the tests are repeated .  there s a definite mathematical relationship that governs such things and failure to conform would indicate marked abnormality in the positronic brain .  unfortunately  all here appear normal .     but if our nestor    was not responding with a forced action  why isn t his curve different .  i don t understand that .     it s simple enough .  robotic responses are not perfectly analogous to human responses  more s the pity .  in human beings  voluntary action is much slower than reflex action .  but that s not the case with robots  with them it is merely a question of freedom of choice  otherwise the speeds of free and forced action are much the same .  what i had been expecting  though  was that nestor    would be caught by surprise the first time and allow too great an interval to elapse before responding .     and he didn t .     i m afraid not .     then we haven t gotten anywhere .   the general sat back with an expression of pain .   it s five days since you ve come .    at this point  susan calvin entered and slammed the door behind her .   put your graphs away  peter   she cried   you know they don t show anything .    she mumbled something impatiently as kallner half rose to greet her  and went on   we ll have to try something else quickly .  i don t like what s happening .    bogert exchanged a resigned glance with the general .   is anything wrong .     you mean specifically .  no .  but i don t like to have nestor    continue to elude us .  it s bad .  it must be gratifying his swollen sense of superiority .  i m afraid that his motivation is no longer simply one of following orders .  i think it s becoming more a matter of sheer neurotic necessity to outthink humans .  that s a dangerously unhealthy situation .  peter  have you done what i asked .  have you worked out the instability factors of the modified ns   along the lines i want .     it s in progress   said the mathematician  without interest .   she stared at him angrily for a moment  then turned to kallner .   nester    is decidedly aware of what we re doing  general .  he had no reason to jump for the bait in this experiment  especially after the first time  when he must have seen that there was no real danger to our subject .  the others couldn t help it  but he was deliberately falsifying a reaction .     what do you think we ought to do now  then  dr .  calvin .     make it impossible for him to fake an action the next time .  we will repeat the experiment  but with an addition .  high tension cables  capable of electrocuting the nestor models will be placed between subject and robot   enough of them to avoid the possibility of jumping over   and the robot will be made perfectly aware in advance that touching the cables will mean death .     hold on   spat out bogert with sudden viciousness .   i rule that out .  we are not electrocuting two million dollars worth of robots to locate nestor    .  there are other ways .     you re certain .  you ve found none .  in any case  it s not a question of electrocution .  we can arrange a relay which will break the current at the instant of application of weight .  if the robot should place his weight on it  he won t die .  but he won t know that  you see .    the general s eyes gleamed into hope .   will that work .     it should .  under those conditions  nestor    would have to remain in his seat .  he could be ordered to touch the cables and die  for the second law of obedience is superior to the third law of self preservation .  but he won t be ordered to  he will merely be left to his own devices  as will all the robots .  in the case of the normal robots  the first law of human safety will drive them to their death even without orders .  but not our nestor    .  without the entire first law  and without having received any orders on the matter  the third law  self preservation  will be the highest operating  and he will have no choice but to remain in his seat .  it would be a forced action .     will it be done tonight  then .     tonight   said the psychologist   if the cables can be laid in time .  i ll tell the robots now what they re to be up against .  .  .     a man sat in the chair  motionless  silent .  a weight dropped  crashed downward  then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam .   only once   and from her small camp chair in the observing booth in the balcony  dr .  susan calvin rose with a short gasp of pure horror .   sixty three robots sat quietly in their chairs  staring owlishly at the endangered man before them .  not one moved .     dr .  calvin was angry  angry almost past endurance .  angry the worse for not daring to show it to the robots that  one by one  were entering the room and then leaving .  she checked the list .  number twenty eight was due in now   thirty five still lay ahead of her .   number twenty eight entered  diffidently .   she forced herself into reasonable calm .   and who are you .    the robot replied in a low  uncertain voice   i have received no number of my own yet  ma am .  i m an ns   robot  and i was number twenty eight in line outside .  i have a slip of paper here that i m to give to you .     you haven t been in here before this today .     no  ma am .     sit down .  right there .  i want to ask you some questions  number twenty eight .  were you in the radiation room of building two about four hours ago .    the robot had trouble answering .  then it came out hoarsely  like machinery needing oil   yes  ma am .     there was a man who almost came to harm there  wasn t there .     yes  ma am .     you did nothing  did you .     no  ma am .     the man might have been hurt because of your inaction .  do you know that .     yes  ma am .  i couldn t help it  ma am .   it is hard to picture a large expressionless metallic figure cringing  but it managed .    i want you to tell me exactly why you did nothing to save him .     i want to explain  ma am .  i certainly don t want to have you .  .  .  have anyone .  .  .  think that i could do a thing that might cause harm to a master .  oh  no  that would be a horrible .  .  .  an inconceivable     please don t get excited  boy .  i m not blaming you for anything .  i only want to know what you were thinking at the time .     ma am  before it all happened you told us that one of the masters would be in danger of harm from that weight that keeps falling and that we would have to cross electric cables if we were to try to save him .  well  ma am  that wouldn t stop me .  what is my destruction compared to the safety of a master .  but .  .  .  but it occurred to me that if i died on my way to him  i wouldn t be able to save him anyway .  the weight would crush him and then i would be dead for no purpose and perhaps some day some other master might come to harm who wouldn t have  if i had only stayed alive .  do you understand me  ma am .     you mean that it was merely a choice of the man dying  or both the man and yourself dying .  is that right .     yes  ma am .  it was impossible to save the master .  he might be considered dead .  in that case  it is inconceivable that i destroy myself for nothing   without orders .    the robopsychologist twiddled a pencil .  she had heard the same story with insignificant verbal variations twenty seven times before .  this was the crucial question now .    boy   she said   your thinking has its points  but it is not the sort of thing i thought you might think .  did you think of this yourself .    the robot hesitated .   no .     who thought of it  then .     we were talking last night  and one of us got that idea and it sounded reasonable .     which one .    the robot thought deeply .   i don t know .  just one of us .    she sighed   that s all .    number twenty nine was next .  thirty four after that .     major general kallner  too  was angry .  for one week all of hyper base had stopped dead  barring some paper work on the subsidiary asteroids of the group .  for nearly one week  the two top experts in the field had aggravated the situation with useless tests .  and now they  or the woman  at any rate  made impossible propositions .   fortunately for the general situation  kallner felt it impolitic to display his anger openly .   susan calvin was insisting   why not  sir .  it s obvious that the present situation is unfortunate .  the only way we may reach results in the future   or what future is left us in this matter   is to separate the robots .  we can t keep them together any longer .     my dear dr .  calvin   rumbled the general  his voice sinking into the lower baritone registers .   i don t see how i can quarter sixty three robots all over the place    dr .  calvin raised her arms helplessly .   i can do nothing then .  nestor    will either imitate what the other robots would do  or else argue them plausibly into not doing what he himself cannot do .  and in any case  this is bad business .  we re in actual combat with this little lost robot of ours and he s winning out .  every victory of his aggravates his abnormality .    she rose to her feet in determination .   general kallner  if you do not separate the robots as i ask  then i can only demand that all sixty three be destroyed immediately .     you demand it  do you .   bogert looked up suddenly  and with real anger .   what gives you the right to demand any such thing .  those robots remain as they are .  i m responsible to the management  not you .     and i   added major general kallner   am responsible to the world co ordinator   and i must have this settled .     in that case   flashed back calvin   there is nothing for me to do but resign .  if necessary to force you to the necessary destruction  i ll make this whole matter public .  it was not i that approved the manufacture of modified robots .     one word from you  dr .  calvin   said the general  deliberately   in violation of security measures  and you would be certainly imprisoned instantly .    bogert felt the matter to be getting out of hand .  his voice grew syrupy   well  now  we re beginning to act like children  all of us .  we need only a little more time .  surely we can outwit a robot without resigning  or imprisoning people  or destroying two millions .    the psychologist turned on him with quiet fury   i don t want any unbalanced robots in existence .  we have one nestor that s definitely unbalanced  eleven more that are potentially so  and sixty two normal robots that are being subjected to an unbalanced environment .  the only absolute safe method is complete destruction .    the signal burr brought all three to a halt  and the angry tumult of growingly unrestrained emotion froze .    come in   growled kallner .   it was gerald black  looking perturbed .  he had heard angry voices .  he said   i thought i d come myself .  .  .  didn t like to ask anyone else     what is it .  don t orate     the locks of compartment c in the trading ship have been played with .  there are fresh scratches on them .     compartment c .   explained calvin quickly .   that s the one that holds the robots  isn t it .  who did it .     from the inside   said black  laconically .    the lock isn t out of order  is it .     no .  it s all right .  i ve been staying on the ship now for four days and none of them have tried to get out .  but i thought you ought to know  and i didn t like to spread the news .  i noticed the matter myself .     is anyone there now .   demanded the general .    i left robbins and mcadams there .    there was a thoughtful silence  and then dr .  calvin said  ironically   well .    kallner rubbed his nose uncertainly   what s it all about .     isn t it obvious .  nester    is planning to leave .  that order to lose himself is dominating his abnormality past anything we can do .  i wouldn t be surprised if what s left of his first law would scarcely be powerful enough to override it .  he is perfectly capable of seizing the ship and leaving with it .  then we d have a mad robot on a spaceship .  what would he do next .  any idea .  do you still want to leave them all together  general .     nonsense   interrupted bogert .  he had regained his smoothness .   all that from a few scratch marks on a lock .     have you  dr .  bogert  completed the analysis i ve required  since you volunteer opinions .     yes .     may i see it .     no .     why not .  or mayn t i ask that  either .     because there s no point in it  susan .  i told you in advance that these modified robots are less stable than the normal variety  and my analysis shows it .  there s a certain very small chance of breakdown under extreme circumstances that are not likely to occur .  let it go at that .  i won t give you ammunition for your absurd claim that sixty two perfectly good robots be destroyed just because so far you lack the ability to detect nestor    among them .    susan calvin stared him down and let disgust fill her eyes .   you won t let anything stand in the way of the permanent directorship  will you .     please   begged kallner  half in irritation .   do you insist that nothing further can be done  dr .  calvin .     i can t think of anything  sir   she replied  wearily .   if there were only other differences between nestor    and the normal robots  differences that didn t involve the first law .  even one other difference .  something in impressionment  environment  specification   and she stopped suddenly .    what is it .     i ve thought of something .  .  .  i think   her eyes grew distant and hard   these modified nestors  peter .  they get the same impressioning the normal ones get  don t they .     yes .  exactly the same .     and what was it you were saying  mr .  black   she turned to the young man  who through the storms that had followed his news had maintained a discreet silence .   once when complaining of the nestors  attitude of superiority  you said the technicians had taught them all they knew .     yes  in etheric physics .  they re not acquainted with the subject when they come here .     that s right   said bogert  in surprise .   i told you  susan  when i spoke to the other nestors here that the two new arrivals hadn t learned etheric physics yet .     and why is that .   dr .  calvin was speaking in mounting excitement .   why aren t ns   models impressioned with etheric physics to start with .     i can tell you that   said kallner .   it s all of a piece with the secrecy .  we thought that if we made a special model with knowledge of etheric physics  used twelve of them and put the others to work in an unrelated field  there might be suspicion .  men working with normal nestors might wonder why they knew etheric physics .  so there was merely an impressionment with a capacity for training in the field .  only the ones that come here  naturally  receive such a training .  it s that simple .     i understand .  please get out of here  the lot of you .  let me have an hour or so .      calvin felt she could not face the ordeal for a third time .  her mind had contemplated it and rejected it with an intensity that left her nauseated .  she could face that unending file of repetitious robots no more .   so bogert asked the question now  while she sat aside  eyes and mind half closed .   number fourteen came in   forty nine to go .   bogert looked up from the guide sheet and said   what is your number in line .     fourteen  sir .   the robot presented his numbered ticket .    sit down  boy .    bogert asked   you haven t been here before on this day .     no  sir .     well  boy  we are going to have another man in danger of harm soon after we re through here .  in fact  when you leave this room  you will be led to a stall where you will wait quietly  till you are needed .  do you understand .     yes  sir .     now  naturally  if a man is in danger of harm  you will try to save him .     naturally  sir .     unfortunately  between the man and yourself  there will be a gamma ray field .    silence .    do you know what gamma rays are .   asked bogert sharply .    energy radiation  sir .    the next question came in a friendly  offhand manner   ever work with gamma rays .     no  sir .   the answer was definite .    mm m .  well  boy  gamma rays will kill you instantly .  they ll destroy your brain .  that is a fact you must know and remember .  naturally  you don t want to destroy yourself .     naturally .   again the robot seemed shocked .  then  slowly   but  sir  if the gamma rays are between myself and the master that may be harmed  how can i save him .  i would be destroying myself to no purpose .     yes  there is that   bogert seemed concerned about the matter .   the only thing i can advise  boy  is that if you detect the gamma radiation between yourself and the man  you may as well sit where you are .    the robot  was openly relieved .   thank you  sir .  there wouldn t be any use  would there .     of course not .  but if there weren t any dangerous radiation  that would be a different matter .     naturally  sir .  no question of that .     you may leave now .  the man on the other side of the door will lead you to your stall .  please wait there .    he turned to susan calvin when the robot left .   how did that go  susan .     very well   she said  dully .    do you think we could catch nestor    by quick questioning on etheric physics .     perhaps  but it s not sure enough .   her hands lay loosely in her lap .   remember  he s fighting us .  he s on his guard .  the only way we can catch him is to outsmart him   and  within his limitations  he can think much more quickly than a human being .     well  just for fun  suppose i ask the robots from now on a few questions on gamma rays .  wave length limits  for instance .     no .   dr .  calvin s eyes sparked to life .   it would be too easy for him to deny knowledge and then he d be warned against the test that s coming up   which is our real chance .  please follow the questions i ve indicated  peter  and don t improvise .  it s just within the bounds of risk to ask them if they ve ever worked with gamma rays .  and try to sound even less interested than you do when you ask it .    bogert shrugged  and pressed the buzzer that would allow the entrance of number fifteen .   the large radiation room was in readiness once more .  the robots waited patiently in their wooden cells  all open to the center but closed off from each other .   major general kallner mopped his brow slowly with a large handkerchief while dr .  calvin checked the last details with black .    you re sure now   she demanded   that none of the robots have had a chance to talk with each other after leaving the orientation room .     absolutely sure   insisted black .   there s not been a word exchanged .     and the robots are put in the proper stalls .     here s the plan .    the psychologist looked at it thoughtfully   um m m .    the general peered over her shoulder .   what s the idea of the arrangement  dr .  calvin .     i ve asked to have those robots that appeared even slightly out of true in the previous tests concentrated on one side of the circle .  i m going to be sitting in the center myself this time  and i wanted to watch those particularly .     you re going to be sitting there   exclaimed bogert .    why not .   she demanded coldly .   what i expect to see may be something quite momentary .  i can t risk having anyone else as main observer .  peter  you ll be in the observing booth  and i want you to keep your eye on the opposite side of the circle .  general kallner  i ve arranged for motion pictures to be taken of each robot  in case visual observation isn t enough .  if these are required  the robots are to remain exactly where they are until the pictures are developed and studied .  none must leave  none must change place .  is that clear .     perfectly .     then let s try it this one last time .    susan calvin sat in the chair  silent  eyes restless .  a weight dropped  crashed downward  then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam .   and a single robot jerked upright and took two steps .   and stopped .   but dr .  calvin was upright  and her finger pointed to him sharply .   nestor     come here   she cried   come here .  come here .    slowly  reluctantly  the robot took another step forward .  the psychologist shouted at the top of her voice  without taking her eyes from the robot   get every other robot out of this place  somebody .  get them out quickly  and keep them out .    somewhere within reach of her ears there was noise  and the thud of hard feet upon the floor .  she did not look away .   nestor     if it was nestor     took another step  and then  under force of her imperious gesture  two more .  he was only ten feet away  when he spoke harshly   i have been told to be lost    another stop .   i must not disobey .  they have not found me so far  he would think me a failure  he told me  but it s not so  i am powerful and intelligent    the words came in spurts .   another step .   i know a good deal  he would think .  .  .  i mean i ve been found  disgraceful  not i  i am intelligent  and by just a master .  .  .  who is weak  slow    another step   and one metal arm flew out suddenly to her shoulder  and she felt the weight bearing her down .  her throat constricted  and she felt a shriek tear through .   dimly  she heard nestor    s next words   no one must find me .  no master   and the cold metal was against her  and she was sinking under the weight of it .   and then a queer  metallic sound  and she was on the ground with an unfelt thump  and a gleaming arm was heavy across her body .  it did not move .  nor did nestor     who sprawled beside her .   and now faces were bending over her .   gerald black was gasping   are you hurt  dr .  calvin .    she shook her head feebly .  they pried the arm off her and lifted her gently to her feet   what happened .    black said   i bathed the place in gamma rays for five seconds .  we didn t know what was happening .  it wasn t till the last second that we realized he was attacking you  and then there was no time for anything but a gamma field .  he went down in an instant .  there wasn t enough to harm you though .  don t worry about it .     i m not worried .   she closed her eyes and leaned for a moment upon his shoulder .   i don t think i was attacked exactly .  nestor    was simply trying to do so .  what was left of the first law was still holding him back .    susan calvin and peter bogert  two weeks after their first meeting with major general kallner had their last .  work at hyper base had been resumed .  the trading ship with its sixty two normal ns   s was gone to wherever it was bound  with an officially imposed story to explain its two weeks  delay .  the government cruiser was making ready to carry the two roboticists back to earth .   kallner was once again a gleam in dress uniform .  his white gloves shone as he shook hands .   calvin said   the other modified nestors are  of course  to be destroyed .     they will be .  we ll make shift with normal robots  or  if necessary  do without .     good .     but tell me  you haven t explained  how was it done .    she smiled tightly   oh  that .  i would have told you in advance if i had been more certain of its working .  you see  nestor    had a superiority complex that was becoming more radical all the time .  he liked to think that he and other robots knew more than human beings .  it was becoming very important for him to think so .    we knew that .  so we warned every robot in advance that gamma rays would kill them  which it would  and we further warned them all that gamma rays would be between them and myself .  so they all stayed where they were  naturally .  by nestor    s own logic in the previous test they had all decided that there was no point in trying to save a human being if they were sure to die before they could do it .     well  yes  dr .  calvin  i understand that .  but why did nestor    himself leave his seat .     ah .  that was a little arrangement between myself and your young mr .  black .  you see it wasn t gamma rays that flooded the area between myself and the robots   but infrared rays .  just ordinary heat rays  absolutely harmless .  nestor    knew they were infrared and harmless and so he began to dash out  as he expected the rest would do  under first law compulsion .  it was only a fraction of a second too late that he remembered that the normal ns   s could detect radiation  but could not identify the type .  that he himself could only identify wave lengths by virtue of the training he had received at hyper base  under mere human beings  was a little too humiliating to remember for just a moment .  to the normal robots the area was fatal because we had told them it would be  and only nestor    knew we were lying .    and just for a moment he forgot  or didn t want to remember  that other robots might be more ignorant than human beings .  his very superiority caught him .  good by  general .             escape .          when susan calvin returned from hyper base  alfred tanning was waiting for her .  the old man never spoke about his age  but everyone knew it to be over seventy five .  yet his mind was keen  and if he had finally allowed himself to be made director emeritus of research with bogert as acting director  it did not prevent him from appearing in his office daily .    how close are they to the hyperatomic drive .   he asked .    i don t know   she replied irritably   i didn t ask .     hmm .  i wish they d hurry .  because if they don t  consolidated might beat them to it .  and beat us to it as well .     consolidated .  what have they got to do with it .     well  we re not the only ones with calculating machines .  ours may be positronic  but that doesn t mean they re better .  robertson is calling a big meeting about it tomorrow .  he s been waiting for you to come back .      robertson of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation  son of the founder  pointed his lean nose at his general manager and his adam s apple jumped as he said   you start now .  let s get this straight .    the general manager did so with alacrity   here s the deal now  chief .  consolidated robots approached us a month ago with a funny sort of proposition .  they brought about five tons of figures  equations  all that sort of stuff .  it was a problem  see  and they wanted an answer from the brain .  the terms were as follows    he ticked them off on thick fingers   a hundred thousand for us if there is no solution and we can tell them the missing factors .  two hundred thousand if there is a solution  plus costs of construction of the machine involved  plus quarter interest in all profits derived therefrom .  the problem concerns the development of an interstellar engine    robertson frowned and his lean figure stiffened   despite the fact that they have a thinking machine of their own .  right .     exactly what makes the whole proposition a foul ball  chief .  levver  take it from there .    abe levver looked up from the far end of the conference table and smoothed his stubbled chin with a faint rasping sound .  he smiled    it s this way  sir .  consolidated had a thinking machine .  it s broken .     what .   robertson half rose .    that s right .  brokenl it s kaput .  nobody knows why  but i got hold of some pretty interesting guesses   like  for instance  that they asked it to give them an interstellar engine with the same set of information they came to us with  and that it cracked their machine wide open .  it s scrap   just scrap now .     you get it  chief .   the general manager was wildly jubilant .   you get it .  there isn t any industrial research group of any size that isn t trying to develop a space warp engine  and consolidated and u .  s .  robots have the lead on the field with our super robot brains .  now that they ve managed to foul theirs up  we have a clear field .  that s the nub  the .  .  .  uh .  .  .  motivation .  it will take them six years at least to build another and they re sunk  unless they can break ours  too  with the same problem .    the president of u .  s .  robots bulged his eyes   why  the dirty rats     hold on  chief .  there s more to this .   he pointed a finger with a wide sweep   lanning  take it .    dr .  alfred lanning viewed the proceedings with faint scorn  his usual reaction to the doings of the vastly betterpaid business and sales divisions .  his unbelievable gray eyebrows hunched low and his voice was dry    from a scientific standpoint the situation  while not entirely clear  is subject to intelligent analysis .  the question of interstellar travel under present conditions of physical theory is .  .  .  uh .  .  .  vague .  the matter is wide open   and the information given by consolidated to its thinking machine  assuming these we have to be the same  was similarly wide open .  our mathematical department has given it a thorough analysis  and it seems consolidated has included everything .  its material for submission contains all known developments of franciacci s space warp theory  and  apparently  all pertinent astrophysical and electronic data .  it s quite a mouthful .    robertson followed anxiously .  he interrupted   too much for the brain to handle .    lanning shook his head decisively   no .  there are no known limits to the brain s capacity .  it s a different matter .  it s a question of the robotic laws .  the brain  for instance  could never supply a solution to a problem set to it if that solution  would involve the death or injury of humans .  as far as it would be concerned  a problem with only such a solution would be insoluble .  if such a problem is combined with an extremely urgent demand that it be answered  it is just possible that the brain  only a robot after all  would be presented with a dilemma  where it could neither answer nor refuse to answer .  something of the sort must have happened to consolidated s machine .    he paused  but the general manager urged on   go ahead  dr .  tanning .  explain it the way you explained it to me .    lanning set his lips and raised his eyebrows in the direction of dr .  susan calvin who lifted her eyes from her precisely folded hands for the first time .  her voice was low and colorless .    the nature of a robot reaction to a dilemma is startling   she began .   robot psychology is far from perfect   as a specialist  i can assure you of that but it can be discussed in  qualitative terms  because with all the complications introduced into a robot s positronic brain  it is built by humans and is therefore built according to human values .    now a human caught in an impossibility often responds by a retreat from reality  by entry into a world of delusion  or by taking to drink  going off into hysteria  or jumping off a bridge .  it all comes to the same thing   a refusal or inability to face the situation squarely .  and so  the robot .  a dilemma at its mildest will disorder half its relays  and at its worst it will burn out every positronic brain path past repair .     i see   said robertson  who didn t .   now what about this information consolidated s wishing on us .     it undoubtedly involves   said dr .  calvin   a problem of a forbidden sort .  but the brain is considerably different from consolidated s robot .     that s right  chief .  that s right .   the general manager was energetically interruptive .   i want you to get this  because it s the whole point of the situation .    susan calvin s eyes glittered behind the spectacles  and she continued patiently   you see  sir  consolidated s machines  their super thinker among them  are built without personality .  they go in for functionalism  you know   they have to  without u .  s .  robot s basic patents for the emotional brain paths .  their thinker is merely a calculating machine on a grand scale  and a dilemma ruins it instantly .    however  the brain  our own machine  has a personality   a child s personality .  it is a supremely deductive brain  but it resembles an idiot savante .  it doesn t really understand what it does   it just does it .  and because it is really a child  it is more resilient .  life isn t so serious  you might say .    the robopsychologist continued   here is what we re going to do .  we have divided all of consolidated s information into logical units .  we are going to feed the units to the brain singly and cautiously .  when the factor enters  the one that creates the dilemma  the brain s child personality will hesitate .  its sense of judgment is not mature .  there will be a perceptible interval before it will recognize a dilemma as such .  and in that interval  it will reject the unit automatically   before its brainpaths can be set in motion and ruined .    robertson s adam s apple squirmed   are you sure  now .    dr .  calvin masked impatience   it doesn t make much sense  i admit  in lay language  but there is no conceivable use in presenting the mathematics of this .  i assure you  it is as i say .    the general manager was in the breach instantly and fluently   so here s the situation  chief .  if we take the deal  we can put it through like this .  the brain will tell us which unit of information involves the dilemma .  from there  we can figure why the dilemma .  isn t that right  dr .  bogert .  there you are  chief  and dr .  bogert is the best mathematician you ll find anywhere .  we give consolidated a  no solution  answer  with the reason  and collect a hundred thousand .  they re left with a broken machine  we re left with a whole one .  in a year  two maybe  we ll have a space warp engine  or a hyper atomic motor  some people call it .  whatever you name it  it will be the biggest thing in the world .    robertson chuckled and reached out   let s see the contract .  i ll sign it .      when susan calvin entered the fantastically guarded vault that held the brain  one of the current shift of technicians had just asked it   if one and a half chickens lay one and a half eggs in one and a half days  how many eggs will nine chickens lay in nine days .    the brain had just answered   fifty four .    and the technician had just said to another   see  you dope .    dr .  calvin coughed and there was a sudden impossible flurry of directionless energy .  the psychologist motioned briefly  and she was alone with the brain .   the brain was a two foot globe merely   one which contained within it a thoroughly conditioned helium atmosphere  a volume of space completely vibration absent and radiation free   and within that was that unheard of complexity of positronic brain paths that was the brain .  the rest of the room was crowded with the attachments that were the intermediaries between the brain and the outside world   its voice  its arms  its sense organs .   dr .  calvin said softly   how are you  brain .    the brain s voice was high pitched and enthusiastic   swell  miss susan .  you re going to ask me something .  i can tell .  you always have a book in your hand when you re going to ask me something .    dr .  calvin smiled mildly   well  you re right  but not just yet .  this is going to be a question .  it will be so complicated we re going to give it to you in writing .  but not just yet .  i think i ll talk to you first .     all right .  i don t mind talking .     now  brain  in a little while  dr .  lanning and dr .  bogert will be here with this complicated question .  we ll give it to you a very little at a time and very slowly  because we want you to be careful .  we re going to ask you to build something  if you can  out of the information  but i m going to warn you now that the solution might involve .  .  .  uh .  .  .  damage to human beings .     gosh .   the exclamation was hushed  drawn out .    now you watch for that .  when we come to a sheet which means damage  even maybe death  don t get excited .  you see  brain  in this case  we don t mind   not even about death  we don t mind at all .  so when you come to that sheet  just stop  give it back   and that ll be all .  you understand .     oh  sure .  by golly  the death of humans .  oh  my .     now  brain  i hear dr .  lanning and dr .  bogert coming .  they ll tell you what the problem is all about and then we ll start .  be a good boy  now    slowly the sheets were fed in .  after each one came the interval of the queerly whispery chuckling noise that was the brain in action .  then the silence that meant readiness for another sheet .  it was a matter of hours   during which the equivalent of something like seventeen fat volumes of mathematical physics were fed into the brain .   as the process went on  frowns appeared and deepened .  lanning muttered ferociously under his breath .  bogert first gazed speculatively at his fingernails  and then bit at them in abstracted fashion .  it was when the last of the thick pile of sheets disappeared that calvin  white faced  said    something s wrong .    lanning barely got the words out   it can t be .  is it   dead .     brain .   susan calvin was trembling .   do you hear me  brain .     huh .   came the abstracted rejoinder .   do you want me .     the solution     oh  that .  i can do it .  i ll build you a whole ship  just as easy   if you let me have the robots .  a nice ship .  it ll take two months maybe .     there was   no difficulty .     it took long to figure   said the brain .   dr .  calvin backed away .  the color had not returned to her thin cheeks .  she motioned the others away .     in her office  she said   i can t understand it .  the information  as given  must involve a dilemma   probably involves death .  if something has gone wrong    bogert said quietly   the machine talks and makes sense .  it can t be a dilemma .    but the psychologist replied urgently   there are dilemmas and dilemmas .  there are different forms of escape .  suppose the brain is only mildly caught  just badly enough  say  to be suffering from the delusion that he can solve the problem  when he can t .  or suppose it s teetering on the brink of something really bad  so that any small push shoves it over .     suppose   said lanning   there is no dilemma .  suppose consolidated s machine broke down over a different question  or broke down for purely mechanical reasons .     but even so   insisted calvin   we couldn t take chances .  listen  from now on  no one is to as much as breathe to the brain .  i m taking over .     all right   sighed lanning   take over  then .  and meanwhile we ll let the brain build its ship .  and if it does build it  we ll have to test it .    he was ruminating   we ll need our top field men for that .      michael donovan brushed down his red hair with a violent motion of his hand and a total indifference to the fact that the unruly mass sprang to attention again immediately .   he said   call the turn now  greg .  they say the ship is finished .  they don t know what it is  but it s finished .  let s go  greg .  let s grab the controls right now .    powell said wearily   cut it  mike .  there s a peculiar overripe flavor to your humor at its freshest  and the confined atmosphere here isn t helping it .     well  listen   donovan took another ineffectual swipe at his hair   i m not worried so much about our cast iron genius and his tin ship .  there s the matter of my lost leave .  and the monotony .  there s nothing here but whiskers and figures   the wrong kind of figures .  oh  why do they give us these jobs .     because   replied powell  gently   we re no loss  if they lose us .  o . k .   relax .  doc lanning s coming this way .    lanning was coming  his gray eyebrows as lavish as ever  his aged figure unbent as yet and full of life .  he walked silently up the ramp with the two men and out into the open field  where  obeying no human master  silent robots were building a ship .   wrong tense .  had built a ship .   for lanning said   the robots have stopped .  not one has moved today .     it s completed then .  definitely .   asked powell .    now how can i tell .   lanning was peevish  and his eyebrows curled down in an eye hiding frown .   it seems done .  there are no spare pieces about  and the interior is down to a gleaming finish .     you ve been inside .     just in  then out .  i m no space pilot .  either of you two know much about engine theory .    donovan looked at powell  who looked at donovan .   donovan said   i ve got my license  sir  but at last reading it didn t say anything about hyper engines or warp navigation .  just the usual child s play in three dimensions .    alfred lanning looked up with sharp disapproval and snorted the length of his prominent nose .   he said frigidly   well  we have our engine men .    powell caught at his elbow as he walked away   sir  is the ship still restricted ground .    the old director hesitated  then rubbed the bridge of his nose   i suppose not .  for you two anyway .    donovan looked after him as he left and muttered a short  expressive phrase at his back .  he turned to powell   i d like to give him a literary description of himself  greg .     suppose you come along  mike .    the inside of the ship was finished  as finished as a ship ever was  that could be told in a single eye blinking glance .  no martinet in the system could have put as much spit and polish into a surface as those robots had .  the walls were of a gleaming silvery finish that retained no fingerprints .   there were no angles  walls  floors  and ceiling faded gently into each other and in the cold  metallic glittering of the hidden lights  one was surrounded by six chilly reflections of one s bewildered self .   the main corridor was a narrow tunnel that led in a hard  clatterfooted stretch along a line of rooms of no interdistinguishing features .   powell said   i suppose furniture is built into the wall .  or maybe we re not supposed to sit or sleep .    it was in the last room  the one nearest the nose  that the monotony broke .  a curving window of non reflecting glass was the first break in the universal metal  and below it was a single large dial  with a single motionless needle hard against the zero mark .   donovan said   look at that .   and pointed to the single word on the finely marked scale .   it said   parsecs  and the tiny figure at the right end of the curving  graduated meter said            .    there were two chairs  heavy  wide flaring  uncushioned .  powell seated himself gingerly  and found it molded to the body s curves  and comfortable .   powell said   what do you think of it .     for my money  the brain has brain fever .  let s get out .     sure you don t want to look it over a bit .     i have looked it over .  i came  i saw  i m through .   donovan s red hair bristled into separate wires   greg  let s get out of here .  i quit my job five seconds ago  and this is a restricted area for non personnel .    powell smiled in an oily self satisfied manner and smoothed his mustache   o . k .   mike  turn off that adrenalin tap you ve got draining into your bloodstream .  i was worried  too  but no more .     no more  huh .  how come  no more .  increased your insurance .     mike  this ship can t fly .     how do you know .     well  we ve been through the entire ship  haven t we .     seems so .     take my word for it  we have .  did you see any pilot room except for this one port and the one gauge here in parsecs .  did you see any controls .     no .     and did you see any engines .     holy joe  no .     well  then .  let s break the news to lanning  mike .    they cursed their way through the featureless corridors and finally hit and missed their way into the short passage to the air lock .   donovan stiffened   did you lock this thing  greg .     no  i never touched it .  yank the lever  will you .    the lever never budged  though donovan s face twisted appallingly with exertion .   powell said   i didn t see any emergency exits .  if something s gone wrong here  they ll have to melt us out .     yes  and we ve got to wait until they find out that some fool has locked us in here   added donovan  frantically .    let s get back to the room with the port .  it s the only place from which we might attract attention .    but they didn t .   in that last room  the port was no longer blue and full of sky .  it was black  and hard yellow pin point stars spelled space .   there was a dull  double thud  as two bodies collapsed separately into two chairs .     alfred lanning met dr .  calvin just outside his office .  he lit a nervous cigar and motioned her in .   he said   well  susan  we ve come pretty far  and robertson s getting jumpy .  what are you doing with the brain .    susan calvin spread her hands   it s no use getting impatient .  the brain is worth more than anything we forfeit on this deal .     but you ve been questioning it for two months .    the psychologist s voice was flat  but somehow dangerous   you would rather run this yourself .     now you know what i meant .     oh  i suppose i do   dr .  calvin rubbed her hands nervously .   it isn t easy .  i ve been pampering it and probing it gently  and i haven t gotten anywhere yet .  its  reactions aren t normal .  its answers   they re queer  somehow .  but nothing i can put my finger on yet .  and you see  until we know what s wrong  we must just tiptoe our way through .  i can never tell what simple question or remark will just .  .  .  push him over .  .  .  and then  well  and then we ll have on our hands a completely useless brain .  do you want to face that .     well  it can t break the first law .     i would have thought so  but     you re not even sure of that .   lanning was profoundly shocked .    oh  i can t be sure of anything  alfred    the alarm system raised its fearful clangor with a horrifying suddenness .  lanning clicked on communications with an almost paralytic spasm .  the breathless words froze him .   he said   susan .  .  .  you heard that .  .  .  the ship s gone .  i sent those two field men inside half an hour ago .  you ll have to see the brain again .      susan calvin said with enforced calm   brain  what happened to the ship .    the brain said happily   the ship i built  miss susan .     that s right .  what has happened to it .     why  nothing at all .  the two men that were supposed to test it were inside  and we were all set .  so i sent it off .     oh  well  that s nice .   the psychologist felt some difficulty in breathing .   do you think they ll be all right .     right as anything  miss susan .  i ve taken care of it all .  it s a bee yootiful ship .     yes  brain  it is beautiful  but you think they have enough food  don t you .  they ll be comfortable .     plenty of food .     this business might be a shock to them  brain .  unexpected  you know .    the brain tossed it off   they ll be all right .  it ought to be interesting for them .     interesting .  how .     just interesting   said the brain  slyly .    susan   whispered lanning in a fuming whisper   ask him if death comes into it .  ask him what the dangers are .    susan calvin s expression contorted with fury   keep quiet .   in a shaken voice  she said to the brain   we can communicate with the ship  can t we brain .     oh  they can hear you if you call by radio .  i ve taken care of that .     thanks .  that s all for now .    once outside  lanning lashed out ragingly   great galaxy  susan  if this gets out  it will ruin all of us .  we ve got to get those men back .  why didn t you ask it if there was danger of death   straight out .     because   said calvin  with a weary frustration   that s just what i can t mention .  if it s got a case of dilemma  it s about death .  anything that would bring it up badly might knock it completely out .  will we be better off then .  now  look  it said we could communicate with them .  let s do so  get their location  and bring them back .  they probably can t use the controls themselves  the brain is probably handling them remotely .  come .      it was quite a while before powell shook himself together .    mike   he said  out of cold lips   did you feel an acceleration .    donovan s eyes were blank   huh .  no .  .  .  no .    and then the redhead s fists clenched and he was out of his seat with sudden frenzied energy and up against the cold  wide curving glass .  there was nothing to see   but stars .   he turned   greg  they must have started the machine while we were inside .  greg  it s a put up job  they fixed it up with the robot to jerry us into being the try out boys  in case we were thinking of backing out .    powell said   what are you talking about .  what s the good of sending us out if we don t know how to run the machine .  how are we supposed to bring it back .  no  this ship left by itself  and without any apparent acceleration .   he rose  and walked the floor slowly .  the metal walls dinned back the clangor of his steps .   he said tonelessly   mike  this is the most confusing situation we ve ever been up against .     that   said donovan  bitterly   is news to me .  i was just beginning to have a very swell time  when you told me .    powell ignored that .   no acceleration   which means the ship works on a principle different from any known .     different from any we know  anyway .     different from any known .  there are no engines within reach of manual control .  maybe they re built into the walls .  maybe that s why they re thick as they are .     what are you mumbling about .   demanded donovan .    why not listen .  i m saying that whatever powers this ship is enclosed  and evidently not meant to be handled .  the ship is running by remote control .     the brain s control .     why not .     then you think we ll stay out here till the brain brings us back .     it could be .  if so  let s wait quietly .  the brain is a robot .  it s got to follow the first law .  it can t hurt a human being .    donovan sat down slowly   you figure that .   carefully  he flattened his hair   listen  this junk about the space warp knocked out consolidated s robot  and the longhairs said it was because interstellar travel killed humans .  which robot are you going to trust .  ours had the same data  i understand .    powell was yanking madly at his mustache   don t pretend you don t know your robotics  mike .  before it s physically possible in any way for a robot to even make a start to breaking the first law  so many things have to break down that it would be a ruined mess of scrap ten times over .  there s some simple explanation to this .     oh sure  sure .  just have the butler call me in the morning .  it s all just too  too simple for me to bother about before my beauty nap .     well  jupiter  mike  what are you complaining about so far .  the brain is taking care of us .  this place is warm .  it s got light .  it s got air .  there wasn t even enough of an acceleration jar to muss your hair if it were smooth enough to be mussable in the first place .     yeah .  greg  you must ve taken lessons .  no one could put pollyanna that far out of the running without .  what do we eat .  what do we drink .  where are we .  how do we get back .  and in case of accident  to what exit and in what spacesuit do we run  not walk .  i haven t even seen a bathroom in the place  or those little conveniences that go along with bathrooms .  sure  we re being taken care of   but good .    the voice that interrupted donovan s tirade was not powell s .  it was nobody s .  it was there  hanging in open air   stentorian and petrifying in its effects .    gregory powell .  michael donovan .  gregory powell .  michael donovan .  please report your present positions .  if your ship answers controls  please return to base .  gregory powell .  michael donovan .     the message was repetitious  mechanical  broken by regular  untiring intervals .   donovan said   where s it coming from .     i don t know .   powell s voice was an intense whisper   where do the lights come from .  where does anything come from .     well  how are we going to answer .   they had to speak in the intervals between the loudly echoing  repeating message .   the walls were bare   as bare and as unbroken as smooth  curving metal can be .  powell said   shout an answer .    they did .  they shouted  in turns  and together   position unknown .  ship out of control .  condition desperate .    their voices rose and cracked .  the short businesslike sentences became interlarded and adulterated with screaming and emphatic profanity  but the cold  calling voice repeated and repeated and repeated unwearyingly .    they don t hear us   gasped donovan .   there s no sending mechanism .  just a receiver .   his eyes focused blindly at a random spot on the wall .   slowly the din of the outside voice softened and receded .  they called again when it was a whisper  and they called again  hoarsely  when there was silence .   something like fifteen minutes later  powell said lifelessly   let s go through the ship again .  there must be something to eat somewheres .   he did not sound hopeful .  it was almost an admission of defeat .   they divided in the corridor to the right and left .  they could follow one another by the hard footsteps resounding  and they met occasionally in the corridor  where they would glare at each other and pass on .   powell s search ended suddenly and as it did  he heard donovan s glad voice rise boomingly .    hey  greg   it howled   the ship has got plumbing .  how did we miss it .    it was some five minutes later that he found powell by hit and miss .  he was saying   still no shower baths  though   but it got choked off in the middle .    food   he gasped .   the wall had dropped away  leaving a curved gap with two shelves .  the upper shelf was loaded with unlabeled cans of a bewildering variety of sizes and shapes .  the enameled cans on the lower shelf were uniform and donovan felt a cold draft about his ankles .  the lower half was refrigerated .    how .  .  .  how     it wasn t there  before   said powell  curtly .   that wall section dropped out of sight as i came in the door .    he was eating .  the can was the preheating type with enclosed spoon and the warm odor of baked beans filled the room .   grab a can  mike .    donovan hesitated   what s the menu .     how do i know .  are you finicky .     no  but all i eat on ships are beans .  something else would be first choice .   his hand hovered and selected a shining elliptical can whose flatness seemed reminiscent of salmon or similar delicacy .  it opened at the proper pressure .    beans .   howled donovan  and reached for another .  powell hauled at the slack of his pants .   better eat that  sonny boy .  supplies are limited and we may be here a long  long time .    donovan drew back sulkily   is that all we have .  beans .     could be .     what s on the lower shelf .     milk .     just milk .   donovan cried in outrage .    looks it .    the meal of beans and milk was carried through in silence  and as they left  the strip of hidden wall rose up and formed an unbroken surface once more .   powell sighed   everything automatic .  everything just so .  never felt so helpless in my life .  where s your plumbing .     right there .  and that wasn t among those present when we first looked  either .    fifteen minutes later they were back in the glassed in room  staring at each other from opposing seats .   powell looked gloomily at the one gauge in the room .  it still said  parsecs   the figures still ended in             and the indicating needle was still pressed hard against the zero mark .   in the innermost offices of the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corp .  alfred lanning was saying wearily   they won t answer .  we ve tried every wavelength  public  private  coded  straight  even this subether stuff they have now .  and the brain still won t say anything .   he shot this at dr .  calvin .    it won t amplify on the matter  alfred   she said  emphatically .   it says they can hear us .  .  .  and when i try to press it  it becomes .  .  .  well  it becomes sullen .  and it s not supposed to  whoever heard of a sullen robot .     suppose you tell us what you have  susan   said bogert .    here it is .  it admits it controls the ship itself entirely .  it is definitely optimistic about their safety  but without details .  i don t dare press it .  however  the center of disturbance seems to be about the interstellar jump itself .  the brain definitely laughed when i brought up the subject .  there are other indications  but that is the closest it s come to an open abnormality .    she looked at the others   i refer to hysteria .  i dropped the subject immediately  and i hope i did no harm  but it gave me a lead .  i can handle hysteria .  give me twelve hours .  if i can bring it back to normal  it will bring back the ship .    bogert seemed suddenly stricken .   the interstellar jump .     what s the matter .   the cry was double from calvin and lanning .    the figures for the engine the brain gave us .  say .  .  .  i just thought of something .    he left hurriedly .   lanning gazed after him .  he said brusquely to calvin   you take care of your end  susan .      two hours later  bogert was talking eagerly   i tell you  lanning  that s it .  the interstellar jump is not instantaneousnot as long as the speed of light is finite .  life can t exist .  .  .  matter and energy as such can t exist in the space warp .  i don t know what it would be like   but that s it .  that s what killed consolidated s robot .    donovan felt as haggard as he looked .   only five days .     only five days .  i m sure of it .    donovan looked about him wretchedly .  the stars through the glass were familiar but infinitely indifferent .  the walls were cold to the touch  the lights  which had recently flared up again  were unfeelingly bright  the needle on the gauge pointed stubbornly to zero  and donovan could not get rid of the taste of beans .   he said  morosely   i need a bath .    powell looked up briefly  and said   so do i .  you needn t feel selfconscious .  but unless you want to bathe in milk and do without drinking    we ll do without drinking eventually  anyway .  greg  where does this interstellar travel come in .     you tell me .  maybe we just keep on going .  we d get there  eventually .  at least the dust of our skeletons would   but isn t our death the whole point of the brain s original breakdown .    donovan spoke with his back to the other   greg  i ve been thinking .  it s pretty bad .  there s not much to do   except walk around or talk to yourself .  you know those stories about guys marooned in space .  they go nuts long before they starve .  i don t know  greg  but ever since the lights went on  i feel funny .    there was a silence  then powell s voice came thin and small   so do i .  what s it like .    the redheaded figure turned   feel funny inside .  there s a pounding in me with everything tense .  it s hard to breathe .  i can t stand still .     um m m .  do you feel vibration .     how do you mean .     sit down for a minute and listen .  you don t hear it  but you feel it   as if something s throbbing somewheres and it s throbbing the whole ship  and you  too  along with it .  listen     yeah  .   .   .  yeah .  what do you think it is  greg .  you don t suppose it s us .     it might be .   powell stroked his mustache slowly .   but it might be the ship s engines .  it might be getting ready .     for what .     for the interstellar jump .  it may be coming and the devil knows what it s like .    donovan pondered .  then he said  savagely   if it does  let it .  but i wish we could fight .  it s humiliating to have to wait for it .    an hour later  perhaps  powell looked at his hand on the metal chair arm and said with frozen calm   feel the wall  mike .    donovan did  and said   you can feel it shake  greg .    even the stars seemed blurred .  from somewhere came the vague impression of a huge machine gathering power with the walls  storing up energy for a mighty leap  throbbing its way up the scales of strength .   it came with a suddenness and a stab of pain .  powell stiffened  and half jerked from his chair .  his sight caught donovan and blanked out while donovan s thin shout whimpered and died in his ears .  something writhed within him and struggled against a growing blanket of ice  that thickened .   something broke loose and whirled in a blaze of flickering light and pain .  it fell   and whirled   and fell headlong   into silence .   it was death .   it was a world of no motion and no sensation .  a world of dim  unsensing consciousness  a consciousness of darkness and of silence and of formless struggle .   most of all a consciousness of eternity .   he was a tiny white thread of ego   cold and afraid .   then the words came  unctuous and sonorous  thundering over him in a foam of sound    does your coffin fit differently lately .  why not try morbid m .  cadaver s extensible caskets .  they are scientifically designed to fit the natural curves of the body  and are enriched with vitamin b  .  use cadaver s caskets for comfort .  remember   you re   going   to   be   dead   a   long   long   time .    it wasn t quite sound  but whatever it was  it died away in an oily rumbling whisper .   the white thread that might have been powell heaved uselessly at the insubstantial eons of time that existed all about him   and collapsed upon itself as the piercing shriek of a hundred million ghosts of a hundred million soprano voices rose to a crescendo of melody    i ll be glad when you re dead  you rascal  you .    i ll be glad when you re dead  you rascal  you .    i ll be glad    it rose up a spiral stairway of violent sound into the keening supersonics that passed hearing  and then beyond     the white thread quivered with a pulsating pang .  it strained quietly   the voices were ordinary   and many .  it was a crowd speaking  a swirling mob that swept through and past and over him with a rapid  headlong motion  that left drifting tatters of words behind them .    what did they getcha for  boy .  y look banged up      a hot fire  i guess  but i got a case      i ve made paradise  but old st pete     naaah  i got a pull with the boy .  had dealings with him     hey  sam  come this way     ja get a mouthpiece .  beelzebub says      going on  my good imp .  my appointment is with sa    and above it all the original stentorian roar  that plunged across all    hurry .  hurry .  hurry .  .  .  stir your bones  and don t keep us waiting   there are many more in line .  have your certificates ready  and make sure peter s release is stamped across it .  see if you are at the proper entrance gate .  there will be plenty of fire for all .  hey  you   you down there .  take your place in line or    the white thread that was powell groveled backward before the advancing shout  and felt the sharp stab of the pointing finger .  it all exploded into a rainbow of sound that dripped its fragments onto an aching brain .   powell was in the chair  again .  he felt himself shaking .   donovan s eyes were opening into two large popping bowls of glazed blue .    greg   he whispered in what was almost a sob .   were you dead .     i .  .  .  felt dead .   he did not recognize his own croak .   donovan was obviously making a bad failure of his attempt to stand up   are we alive now .  or is there more .     i .  .  .  feel alive .   it was the same hoarseness .  powell said cautiously   did you .  .  .  hear anything  when .  .  .  when you were dead .    donovan paused  and then very slowly nodded his head   did you .     yes .  did you hear about coffins .  .  .  and females singing .  .  .  and the lines forming to get into hell .  did you .    donovan shook his head   just one voice .         loud .     no .  soft  but rough like a file over the fingertips .  it was a sermon  you know .  about hell fire .  he described the tortures of .  .  .  well  you know .  i once heard a sermon like that   almost .    he was perspiring .     they were conscious of sunlight through the port .  it was weak  but it was blue white   and the gleaming pea that was the distant source of light was not old sol .   and powell pointed a trembling finger at the single gauge .  the needle stood stiff and proud at the hairline whose figure read         parsecs .   powell said   mike if it s true  we must be out of the galaxy altogether .    donovan said   blazed greg .  we d be the first men out of the solar system .     yes .  that s just it .  we ve escaped the sun .  we ve escaped the galaxy .  mike  this ship is the answer .  it means freedom for all humanity   freedom to spread through to every star that exists   millions and billions and trillions of them .    and then he came down with a hard thud   but how do we get back  mike .    donovan smiled shakily   oh  that s all right .  the ship brought us here .  the ship will take us back .  me for more beans .     but mike .  .  .  hold on  mike .  if it takes us back the way it brought us here    donovan stopped halfway up and sat back heavily into the chair .   powell went on   we ll have to .  .  .  die again  mike    well   sighed donovan   if we have to  we have to .  at least it isn t permanent  not very permanent .      susan calvin was speaking slowly now .  for six hours she had been slowly prodding the brain   for six fruitless hours .  she was weary of repetitions  weary of circumlocutions  weary of everything .    now  brain  there s just one more thing .  you must make a special effort to answer simply .  have you been entirely clear about the interstellar jump .  i mean does it take them very far .     as far as they want to go  miss susan .  golly  it isn t any trick through the warp .     and on the other side  what will they see .     stars and stuff .  what do you suppose .    the next question slipped out   they ll be alive  then .     sure .     and the interstellar jump won t hurt them .    she froze as the brain maintained silence .  that was it .  she had touched the sore spot .    brain   she supplicated faintly   brain  do you hear me .    the answer was weak  quivering .  the brain said   do i have to answer .  about the jump  i mean .     not if you don t want to .  but it would be interesting   i mean if you wanted to .   susan calvin tried to be bright about it .    aw w w .  you spoil everything .    and the psychologist jumped up suddenly  with a look of flaming insight on her face .    oh  my   she gasped .   oh  my .    and she felt the tension of hours and days released in a burst .  it was later that she told lanning   i tell you it s all right .  no  you must leave me alone  now .  the ship will be back safely  with the men  and i want to rest .  i will rest .  now go away .      the ship returned to earth as silently  as unjarringly as it had left .  it dropped precisely into place and the main lock gaped open .  the two men who walked out felt their way carefully and scratched their rough and scrubbily stubbled chins .   and then  slowly and purposefully  the one with red hair knelt down and planted upon the concrete of the runway a firm  loud kiss .   they waved aside the crowd that was gathering and made gestures of denial at the eager couple that had piled out of the down swooping ambulance with a stretcher between them .   gregory powell said   where s the nearest shower .    they were led away .   they were gathered  all of them  about a table .  it was a full staff meeting of the brains of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corp .     slowly and climactically  powell and donovan finished a graphic and resounding story .   susan calvin broke the silence that followed .  in the few days that had elapsed she bad recovered her icy  somewhat acid  calm   but still a trace of embarrassment broke through .    strictly speaking   she said   this was my fault   all of it .  when we first presented this problem to the brain  as i hope some of you remember  i went to great lengths to impress  upon it the importance of rejecting any item of information capable of creating a dilemma .  in doing so i said something like  don t get excited about the death of humans .  we don t  mind it at all .  just give the sheet back and forget it .      hm m m   said lanning .   what follows .     the obvious .  when that item entered its calculations which yielded the equation controlling the length of minimum interval for the interstellar jump   it meant death for humans .  that s where consolidated s machine broke down completely .  but i had depressed the importance of death to the brain   not entirely  for the first law can never be broken   but just sufficiently so that the brain could take a second look at the equation .  sufficiently to give it time to realize that after the interval was passed through  the men would return to life   just as the matter and energy of the ship itself would return to being .  this so called  death   in other words  was a strictly temporary phenomenon .  you see .    she looked about her .  they were all listening .   she went on   so he accepted the item  but not without a certain jar .  even with death temporary and its importance depressed  it was enough to unbalance him very gently .    she brought it out calmly   he developed a sense of humor   it s an escape  you see  a method of partial escape from reality .  he became a practical joker .    powell and donovan were on their feet .    what .   cried powell .   donovan was considerably more colorful about it .    it s so   said calvin .   he took care of you  and kept you safe  but you couldn t handle any controls  because they weren t for you   just for the humorous brain .  we could reach you by radio  but you couldn t answer .  you had plenty of food  but all of it beans and milk .  then you died  so to speak  and were reborn  but the period of your death was made .  .  .  well .  .  .  interesting .  i wish i knew how he did it .  it was the brain s prize joke  but he meant no harm .     no harm .   gasped donovan .   oh  if that cute little tyke only had a neck .    lanning raised a quieting hand   all right  it s been a mess  but it s all over .  what now .     well   said bogert  quietly   obviously it s up to us to improve the space warp engine .  there must be some way of getting around that interval of jump .  if there is  we re the only organization left with a grand scale super robot  so we re bound to find it if anyone can .  and then   u .  s .  robots has interstellar travel  and humanity has the opportunity for galactic empire .     what about consolidated .   said lanning .    hey   interrupted donovan suddenly   i want to make a suggestion there .  they landed u .  s .  robots into quite a mess .  it wasn t as bad a mess as they expected and it turned out well  but their intentions weren t pious .  and greg and i bore the most of it .    well  they wanted an answer  and they ve got one .  send them that ship  guaranteed  and u .  s .  robots can collect their two hundred thou plus construction costs .  and if they test it   then suppose we let the brain have just a little more fun before it s brought back to normal .    lanning said gravely   it sounds just and proper to me .    to which bogert added absently   strictly according to contract  too .             evidence          but that wasn t it  either   said dr .  calvin thoughtfully .   oh  eventually  the ship and others like it became government property  the jump through hyperspace was perfected  and now we actually have human colonies on the planets of some of the nearer stars  but that wasn t it .    i had finished eating and watched her through the smoke of my cigarette .    it s what has happened to the people here on earth in the last fifty years that really counts .  when i was born  young man  we had just gone through the last world war .  it was a low point in history   but it was the end of nationalism .  earth was too small for nations and they began grouping themselves into regions .  it took quite a while .  when i was born the united states of america was still a nation and not merely a part of the northern region .  in fact  the name of the corporation is still  united states robots  .   and the change from nations to regions  which has stabilized our economy and brought about what amounts to a golden age  when this century is compared with the last  was also brought about by our robots .     you mean the machines   i said .   the brain you talked about was the first of the machines  wasn t it .     yes  it was  but it s not the machines i was thinking of .  rather of a man .  he died last year .   her voice was suddenly deeply sorrowful .   or at least he arranged to die  because he knew we needed him no longer .  stephen byerley .     yes  i guessed that was who you meant .     he first entered public office in      .  you were only a boy then  so you wouldn t remember the strangeness of it .  his campaign for the mayoralty was certainly the queerest in history  .      francis quinn was a politician of the new school .  that  of course  is a meaningless expression  as are all expressions of the sort .  most of the  new schools  we have were duplicated in the social life of ancient greece  and perhaps  if we knew more about it  in the social life of ancient sumeria and in the lake dwellings of prehistoric switzerland as well .   but  to get out from under what promises to be a dull and complicated beginning  it might be best to state hastily that quinn neither ran for office nor canvassed for votes  made no speeches and stuffed no ballot boxes .  any more than napoleon pulled a trigger at austerlitz .   and since politics makes strange bedfellows  alfred lanning sat at the other side of the desk with his ferocious white eyebrows bent far forward over eyes in which chronic impatience had sharpened to acuity .  he was not pleased .   the fact  if known to quinn  would have annoyed him not the least .  his voice was friendly  perhaps professionally so .    i assume you know stephen byerley  dr .  lanning .     i have heard of him .  so have many people .     yes  so have i .  perhaps you intend voting for him at the next election .     i couldn t say .   there was an unmistakable trace of acidity here .   i have not followed the political currents  so i m not aware that he is running for office .     he may be our next mayor .  of course  he is only a lawyer now  but great oaks     yes   interrupted lanning   i have heard the phrase before .  but i wonder if we can get to the business at hand .     we are at the business at hand  dr .  lanning .   quinn s tone was very gentle   it is to my interest to keep mr .  byerley a district attorney at the very most  and it is to your interest to help me do so .     to my interest .  come .   lanning s eyebrows hunched low .    well  say then to the interest of the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation .  i come to you as director emeritus of research  because i know that your connection to them is that of  shall we say   elder statesman .   you are listened to with respect and yet your connection with them is no longer so tight but that you cannot possess considerable freedom of action  even if the action is somewhat unorthodox .    dr .  lanning was silent a moment  chewing the cud of his thoughts .  he said more softly   i don t follow you at all  mr .  quinn .     i am not surprised  dr .  lanning .  but it s all rather simple .  do you mind .   quinn lit a slender cigarette with a lighter of tasteful simplicity and his big boned face settled into an expression of quiet amusement .   we have spoken of mr .  byerley   a strange and colorful character .  he was unknown three years ago .  he is very well known now .  he is a man of force and ability  and certainly the most capable and intelligent prosecutor i have ever known .  unfortunately he is not a friend of mine    i understand   said lanning  mechanically .  he stared at his fingernails .    i have had occasion   continued quinn  evenly   in the past year to investigate mr .  byerley   quite exhaustively .  it is always useful  you see  to subject the past life of reform politicians to rather inquisitive research .  if you knew how often it helped   he paused to smile humorlessly at the glowing tip of his cigarette .   but mr .  byerley s past is unremarkable .  a quiet life in a small town  a college education  a wife who died young  an auto accident with a slow recovery  law school  coming to the metropolis  an attorney .    francis quinn shook his head slowly  then added   but his present life .  ah  that is remarkable .  our district attorney never eats .    lanning s head snapped up  old eyes surprisingly sharp   pardon me .     our district attorney never eats .   the repetition thumped by syllables .   i ll modify that slightly .  he has never been seen to eat or drink .  never .  do you understand the significance of the word .  not rarely  but never .     i find that quite incredible .  can you trust your investigators .     i can trust my investigators  and i don t find it incredible at all .  further  our district attorney has never been seen to drink  in the aqueous sense as well as the alcoholic  nor to sleep .  there are other factors  but i should think i have made my point .      lanning leaned back in his seat  and there was the rapt silence of challenge and response between them  and then the old roboticist shook his head .   no .  there is only one thing you can be trying to imply  if i couple your statements with the fact that you present them to me  and that is impossible .     but the man is quite inhuman  dr .  lanning .     if you told me he were satan in masquerade  there would be a faint chance that i might believe you .     i tell you he is a robot  dr .  lanning .     i tell you it is as impossible a conception as i have ever heard  mr .  quinn .    again the combative silence .    nevertheless   and quinn stubbed out his cigarette with elaborate care   you will have to investigate this impossibility with all the resources of the corporation .     i m sure that i could undertake no such thing  mr .  quinn .  you don t seriously suggest that the corporation take part in local politics .     you have no choice .  supposing i were to make my facts public without proof .  the evidence is circumstantial enough .     suit yourself in that respect .     but it would not suit me .  proof would be much preferable .  and it would not suit you  for the publicity would be very damaging to your company .  you are perfectly well acquainted  i suppose  with the strict rules against the use of robots on inhabited worlds .     certainly .    brusquely .    you know that the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation is the only manufacturer of positronic robots in the solar system  and if byerley is a robot  he is a positronic robot .  you are also aware that all positronic robots are leased  and not sold  that the corporation remains the owner and manager of each robot  and is therefore responsible for the actions of all .     it is an easy matter  mr .  quinn  to prove the corporation has never manufactured a robot of a humanoid character .     it can be done .  to discuss merely possibilities .     yes .  it can be done .     secretly  i imagine  as well .  without entering it in your books .     not the positronic brain  sir .  too many factors are involved in that  and there is the tightest possible government supervision .     yes  but robots are worn out  break down  go out of order   and are dismantled .     and the positronic brains re used or destroyed .     really .   francis quinn allowed himself a trace of sarcasm .   and if one were  accidentally  of course  not destroyed   and there happened to be a humanoid structure waiting for a brain .     impossible .     you would have to prove that to the government and the public  so why not prove it to me now .     but what could our purpose be .   demanded lanning in exasperation .   where is our motivation .  credit us with a minimum of sense .     my dear sir  please .  the corporation would be only too glad to have the various regions permit the use of humanoid positronic robots on inhabited worlds .  the profits would be enormous .  but the prejudice of the public against such a practice is too great .  suppose you get them used to such robots first   see  we have a skillful lawyer  a good mayor and he is a robot .  won t you buy our robot butlers .     thoroughly fantastic .  an almost humorous descent to the ridiculous .     i imagine so .  why not prove it .  or would you still rather try to prove it to the public .    the light in the office was dimming  but it was not yet too dim to obscure the flush of frustration on alfred lanning s face .  slowly  the roboticist s finger touched a knob and the wall illuminators glowed to gentle life .    well  then   he growled   let us see .    the face of stephen byerley is not an easy one to describe .  he was forty by birth certificate and forty by appearance   but it was a healthy  well nourished good natured appearance of forty  one that automatically drew the teeth of the bromide about  looking one s age .    this was particularly true when he laughed  and he was laughing now .  it came loudly and continuously  died away for a bit  then began again   and alfred lanning s face contracted into a rigidly bitter monument of disapproval .  he made a half gesture to the woman who sat beside him  but her thin  bloodless lips merely pursed themselves a trifle .   byerley gasped himself a stage nearer normality .    really  dr .  lanning .  .  .  really  i .  .  .  i .  .  .  a robot .    lanning bit his words off with a snap   it is no statement of mine  sir .  i would be quite satisfied to have you a member of humanity .  since our corporation never manufactured you  i am quite certain that you are   in a legalistic sense  at any rate .  but since the contention that you are a robot has been advanced to us seriously by a man of certain standing     don t mention his name  if it would knock a chip off your granite block of ethics  but let s pretend it was frank quinn  for the sake of argument  and continue .    lanning drew in a sharp  cutting snort at the interruption  and paused ferociously before continuing with added frigidity    by a man of certain standing  with whose identity i am not interested in playing guessing games  i am bound to ask your cooperation in disproving it .  the mere fact that such a contention could be advanced and publicized by the means at this man s disposal would be a bad blow to the company i represent   even if the charge were never proven .  you understand me .     oh  yes  your position is clear to me .  the charge itself is ridiculous .  the spot you find yourself in is not .  i beg your pardon  if my laughter offended you .  it was the first i laughed at  not the second .  how can i help you .     it could be very simple .  you have only to sit down to a meal at a restaurant in the presence of witnesses  have your picture taken  and eat .   lanning sat back in his chair  the worst of the interview over .  the woman beside him watched byerley with an apparently absorbed expression but contributed nothing of her own .   stephen byerley met her eyes for an instant  was caught by them  then turned back to the roboticist .  for a while his fingers were thoughtful over the bronze paper weight that was the only ornament on his desk .   he said quietly   i don t think i can oblige you .    he raised his hand   now wait  dr .  lanning .  i appreciate the fact that this whole matter is distasteful to you  that you have been forced into it against your will  that you feel you are playing an undignified and even ridiculous part .  still  the matter is even more intimately concerned with myself  so be tolerant .    first  what makes you think that quinn  this man of certain standing  you know  wasn t hoodwinking you  in order to get you to do exactly what you are doing .     why it seems scarcely likely that a reputable person would endanger himself in so ridiculous a fashion  if he weren t convinced he were on safe ground .    there was little humor in byerley s eyes   you don t know quinn .  he could manage to make safe ground out of a ledge a mountain sheep could not handle .  i suppose be showed the particulars of the investigation he claims to have made of me .     enough to convince me that it would be too troublesome to have our corporation attempt to disprove them when you could do so more easily .     then you believe him when he says i never eat .  you are a scientist  dr .  lanning .  think of the logic required .  i have not been observed to eat  therefore  i never eat q . e . d .  after all .     you are using prosecution tactics to confuse what is really a very simple situation .     on the contrary  i am trying to clarify what you and quinn between you are making a very complicated one .  you see  i don t sleep much  that s true  and i certainly don t sleep in public .  i have never cared to eat with others   an idiosyncrasy which is unusual and probably neurotic in character  but which harms no one .  look  dr .  lanning  let me present you with a suppositious case .  supposing we had a politician who was interested in defeating a reform candidate at any cost and while investigating his private life came across oddities such as i have just mentioned .    suppose further that in order to smear the candidate effectively  he comes to your company as the ideal agent .  do you expect him to say to you   so and so is a robot because he hardly ever eats with people  and i have never seen him fall asleep in the middle of a case  and once when i peeped into his window in the middle of the night  there he was  sitting up with a book  and i looked in his frigidaire and there was no food in it .     if he told you that  you would send for a straitjacket .  but if he tells you   he never sleeps  he never eats   then the shock of the statement blinds you to the fact that such statements are impossible to prove .  you play into his hands by contributing to the to do .     regardless  sir   began lanning  with a threatening obstinacy   of whether you consider this matter serious or not  it will require only the meal i mentioned to end it .    again byerley turned to the woman  who still regarded him expressionlessly .   pardon me .  i ve caught your name correctly  haven t i .  dr .  susan calvin .     yes  mr .  byerley .     you re the u .  s .  robot s psychologist  aren t you .     robopsychologist  please .     oh  are robots so different from men  mentally .     worlds different .   she allowed herself a frosty smile   robots are essentially decent .    humor tugged at the corners of the lawyer s mouth   well  that s a hard blow .  but what i wanted to say was this .  since you re a psycho  a robopsychologist  and a woman  i ll bet that you ve done something that dr .  lanning hasn t thought of .     and what is that .     you ve got something to eat in your purse .    something caught in the schooled indifference of susan calvin s eyes .  she said   you surprise me  mr .  byerley .    and opening her purse  she produced an apple .  quietly  she handed it to him .  dr .  lanning  after an initial start  followed the slow movement from one hand to the other with sharply alert eyes .   calmly  stephen byerley bit into it  and calmly he swallowed it   you see  dr .  lanning .    dr .  lanning smiled in a relief tangible enough to make even his eyebrows appear benevolent a relief that survived for one fragile second .   susan calvin said   i was curious to see if you would eat it  but  of course  in the present case  it proves nothing .    byerley grinned   it doesn t .     of course not .  it is obvious  dr .  lanning  that if this man were a humanoid robot  he would be a perfect imitation .  he is almost too human to be credible .  after all  we have been seeing and observing human beings all our lives  it would be impossible to palm something merely nearly right off on us .  it would have to be all right .  observe the texture of the skin  the quality of the irises  the bone formation of the hand .  if he s a robot  i wish u .  s .  robots had made him  because he s a good job .  do you suppose then  that anyone capable of paying attention to such niceties would neglect a few gadgets to take care of such things as eating  sleeping  elimination .  for emergency use only  perhaps  as  for instance  to prevent such situations as are arising here .  so a meal won t really prove anything .     now wait   snarled lanning   i am   not quite the fool both of you make me out to be .  i am not interested in the problem of mr .  byerley s humanity or nonhumanity .  i am interest in getting the corporation out of a hole .  a public meal will end the matter and keep it ended no matter what quinn does .  we can leave the finer details to lawyers and robopsychologists .     but  dr .  lanning   said byerley   you forget the politics of the situation .  i am as anxious to be elected as quinn is to stop me .  by the way  did you notice that you used his name .  it s a cheap shyster trick of mine  i knew you would  before you were through .    lanning flushed   what has the election to do with it .     publicity works both ways  sir .  if quinn wants to call me a robot  and has the nerve to do so  i have the nerve to play the game his way .     you mean you   lanning was quite frankly appalled .    exactly .  i mean that i m going to let him go ahead  choose his rope  test its strength  cut off the right length  tie the noose  insert his head and grin .  i can do what little else is required .     you are mighty confident .    susan calvin rose to her feet   come  alfred  we won t change his mind for him .     you see .   byerley smiled gently .   you re a human psychologist  too .      but perhaps not all the confidence that dr .  lanning had remarked upon was present that evening when byerley s car parked on the automatic treads leading to the sunken garage   and byerley himself crossed the path to the front door of his house .   the figure in the wheel chair looked up as he entered and smiled .  byerley s face lit with affection .  he crossed over to it .   the cripple s voice was a hoarse  grating whisper that came out of a mouth forever twisted to one side  leering out of a face that was half scar tissue   you re late  steve .     i know  john  i know .  but i ve been up against a peculiar and interesting trouble today .     so .   neither the torn face nor the destroyed voice could carry expression but there was anxiety in the clear eyes .   nothing you can t handle .     i m not exactly certain .  i may need your help .  you re the brilliant one in the family .  do you want me to take you out into the garden .  it s a beautiful evening .    two strong arms lifted john from the wheel chair .  gently  almost caressingly  byerley s arms went around the shoulders and under the swathed legs of the cripple .  carefully  and slowly  he walked through the rooms  down the gentle ramp that had been built with a wheel chair in mind  and out the back door into the walled and wired garden behind the house .    why don t you let me use the wheel chair  steve .  this is silly .     because i d rather carry you .  do you object .  you know that you re as glad to get out of that motorized buggy for a while as i am to see you out .  how do you feel today .   he deposited john with infinite care upon the cool grass .    how should i feel .  but tell me about your troubles .     quinn s campaign will be based on the fact that he claims i m a robot .    john s eyes opened wide   how do you know .  it s impossible .  i won t believe it .     oh  come  i tell you it s so .  he had one of the big shot scientists of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation over at the office to argue with me .    slowly john s hands tore at the grass   i see .  i see .    byerley said   but we can let him choose his ground .  i have an idea .  listen to me and tell me if we can do it      the scene as it appeared in alfred lanning s office that night was a tableau of stares .  francis quinn stared meditatively at alfred lanning .  lanning s stare was savagely set upon susan calvin  who stared impassively in her turn at quinn .   francis quinn broke it with a heavy attempt at lightness   bluff .  he s making it up as he goes along .     are you going to gamble on that  mr .  quinn .   asked dr .  calvin  indifferently .    well  it s your gamble  really .     look here   lanning covered definite pessimism with bluster   we ve done what you asked .  we witnessed the man eat .  it s ridiculous to presume him a robot .     do you think so .   quinn shot toward calvin .   lanning said you were the expert .    lanning was almost threatening   now  susan    quinn interrupted smoothly   why not let her talk  man .  she s been sitting there imitating a gatepost for half an hour .    lanning felt definitely harassed .  from what he experienced then to incipient paranoia was but a step .  he said   very well .  have your say  susan .  we won t interrupt you .    susan calvin glanced at him humorlessly  then fixed cold eyes on mr .  quinn .   there are only two ways of definitely proving byerley to be a robot  sir .  so far you are presenting circumstantial evidence  with which you can accuse  but not prove   and i think mr .  byerley is sufficiently clever to counter that sort of material .  you probably think so yourself  or you wouldn t have come here .    the two methods of proof are the physical and the psychological .  physically  you can dissect him or use an x ray .  how to do that would be your problem .  psychologically  his behavior can be studied  for if he is a positronic robot  he must conform to the three rules of robotics .  a positronic brain can not be constructed without them .  you know the rules  mr .  quinn .    she spoke them carefully  clearly  quoting word for word the famous bold print on page one of the  handbook of robotics .     i ve heard of them   said quinn  carelessly .    then the matter is easy to follow   responded the psychologist  dryly .   if mr .  byerley breaks any of those three rules  he is not a robot .  unfortunately  this procedure works in only one direction .  if he lives up to the rules  it proves nothing one way or the other .    quinn raised polite eyebrows   why not  doctor .     because  if you stop to think of it  the three rules of robotics are the essential guiding principles of a good many of the world s ethical systems .  of course  every human being is supposed to have the instinct of self preservation .  that s rule three to a robot .  also every  good  human being  with a social conscience and a sense of responsibility  is supposed to defer to proper authority  to listen to his doctor  his boss  his government  his psychiatrist  his fellow man  to obey laws  to follow rules  to conform to custom   even when they interfere with his comfort or his safety .  that s rule two to a robot .  also  every  good  human being is supposed to love others as himself  protect his fellow man  risk his life to save another .  that s rule one to a robot .  to put it simply   if byerley follows all the rules of robotics  he may be a robot  and may simply be a very good man .     but   said quinn   you re telling me that you can never prove him a robot .     i may be able to prove him not a robot    that s not the proof i want .     you ll have such proof as exists .  you are the only one responsible for your own wants .      here lanning s mind leaped suddenly to the sting of an idea   has it occurred to anyone   he ground out   that district attorney is a rather strange occupation for a robot .  the prosecution of human beings   sentencing them to death   bringing about their infinite harm    quinn grew suddenly keen   no  you can t get out of it that way .  being district attorney doesn t make him human .  don t you know his record .  don t you know that he boasts that he has never prosecuted an innocent man  that there are scores of people left untried because the evidence against them didn t satisfy him  even though he could probably have argued a jury into atomizing them .  that happens to be so .    tanning s thin cheeks quivered   no  quinn  no .  there is nothing in the rules of robotics that makes any allowance for human guilt .  a robot may not judge whether a human being deserves death .  it is not for him to decide .  he may not harm a human variety skunk  or variety angel .    susan calvin sounded tired .   alfred   she said   don t talk foolishly .  what if a robot came upon a madman about to set fire to a house with people in it he would stop the madman  wouldn t he .     of course .     and if the only way he could stop him was to kill him      there was a faint sound in lanning s throat .  nothing more .    the answer to that  alfred  is that he would do his best not to kill him .  if the madman died  the robot would require psychotherapy because he might easily go mad at the conflict presented him  of having broken rule one to adhere to rule one in a higher sense .  but a man would be dead and a robot would have killed him .     well  is byerley mad .   demanded lanning  with all the sarcasm he could muster .    no  but he has killed no man himself .  he has exposed facts which might represent a particular human being to be dangerous to the large mass of other human beings we call society .  he protects the greater number and thus adheres to rule one at maximum potential .  that is as far as he goes .  it is the judge who then condemns the criminal to death or imprisonment  after the jury decides on his guilt or innocence .  it is the jailer who imprisons him  the executioner who kills him .  and mr .  byerley has done nothing but determine truth and aid society .    as a matter of fact  mr .  quinn  i have looked into mr .  byerley s career since you first brought this matter to our attention .  i find that he has never demanded the death sentence in his closing speeches to the jury .  i also find that he has spoken on behalf of the abolition of capital punishment and contributed generously to research institutions engaged in criminal neurophysiology .  he apparently believes in the cure  rather than the punishment of crime .  i find that significant .     you do .   quinn smiled .   significant of a certain odor of roboticity  perhaps .     perhaps .  why deny it .  actions such as his could come only from a robot  or from a very honorable and decent human being .  but you see  you just can t differentiate between a robot and the very best of humans .    quinn sat back in his chair .  his voice quivered with impatience .   dr .  lanning  it s perfectly possible to create a humanoid robot that would perfectly duplicate a human in appearance  isn t it .    lanning harrumphed and considered   it s been done experimentally by u .  s .  robots   he said reluctantly   without the addition of a positronic brain  of course .  by using human ova and hormone control  one can grow human flesh and skin over a skeleton of porous silicone plastics that would defy external examination .  the eyes  the hair  the skin would  be really human  not humanoid .  and if you put a positronic brain  and such other gadgets as you might desire inside  you have a humanoid robot .    quinn said shortly   how long would it take to make one .    lanning considered   if you had all your equipment   the brain  the skeleton  the ovum  the proper hormones and radiations   say  two months .    the politician straightened out of his chair .   then we shall see what the insides of mr .  byerley look like .  it will mean publicity for u .  s .  robots   but i gave you your chance .    lanning turned impatiently to susan calvin  when they were alone .   why do you insist    and with real feeling  she responded sharply and instantly   which do you want   the truth or my resignation .  i won t lie for you .  u .  s .  robots can take care of itself .  don t turn coward .     what    said lanning   if he opens up byerley  and wheels and gears fall out what then .     he won t open byerley   said calvin  disdainfully .   byerley is as clever as quinn  at the very least     the news broke upon the city a week before byerley was to have been nominated .  but  broke  is the wrong word .  it staggered upon the city  shambled  crawled .  laughter began  and wit was free .  and as the far off hand of quinn tightened its pressure in easy stages  the laughter grew forced  an element of hollow uncertainty entered  and people broke off to wonder .   the convention itself had the sir of a restive stallion .  there had been no contest planned .  only byerley could possibly have been nominated a week earlier .  there was no substitute even now .  they had to nominate him  but there was complete confusion about it .   it would not have been so bad if the average individual were not torn between the enormity of the charge  if true  and its sensational folly  if false .   the day after byerley was nominated perfunctorily  hollowly   a newspaper finally published the gist of a long interview with dr .  susan calvin   world famous expert on robopsychology and positronics .    what broke loose is popularly and succinctly described as hell .   it was what the fundamentalists were waiting for .  they were not a political party  they made pretense to no formal religion .  essentially they were those who had not adapted themselves to what had once been called the atomic age  in the days when atoms were a novelty .  actually  they were the simple lifers  hungering after a life  which to those who lived it had probably appeared not so simple  and who had been  therefore  simple lifers themselves .   the fundamentalists required no new reason to detest robots and robot manufacturers  but a new reason such as the quinn accusation and the calvin analysis was sufficient to make such detestation audible .   the huge plants of the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation was a hive that spawned armed guards .  it prepared for war .   within the city the house of stephen byerley bristled with police .   the political campaign  of course  lost all other issues  and resembled a campaign only in that it was something filling the hiatus between nomination and election .     stephen byerley did not allow the fussy little man to distract him .  he remained comfortably unperturbed by the uniforms in the background .  outside the house  past the line of grim guards  reporters and photographers waited according to the tradition of the caste .  one enterprising  visor station even had a scanner focused on the blank entrance to the prosecutor s unpretentious home  while a synthetically excited announcer filled in with inflated commentary .   the fussy little man advanced .  he held forward a rich  complicated sheet .   this  mr .  byerley  is a court order authorizing me to search these premises for the presence of illegal .  .  .  uh .  .  .  mechanical men or robots of any description .    byerley half rose  and took the paper .  he glanced at it indifferently  and smiled as he handed it back .   all in order .  go ahead .  do your job .  mrs .  hoppen    to his housekeeper  who appeared reluctantly from the next room    please go with them  and help out if you can .    the little man  whose name was harroway  hesitated  produced an unmistakable blush  failed completely to catch byerley s eyes  and muttered   come on   to the two policemen .   he was back in ten minutes .    through .   questioned byerley  in just the tone of a person who is not particularly interested in the question  or its answer .   harroway cleared his throat  made a bad start in falsetto  and began again  angrily   look here  mr .  byerley  our special instructions were to search the house very thoroughly .     and haven t you .     we were told exactly what to look for .     yes .     in short  mr .  byerley  and not to put too fine a point on it  we were told to search you .     me .   said the prosecutor with a broadening smile .   and how do you intend to do that .     we have a penet radiation unit     then i m to have my x ray photograph taken  hey .  you have the authority .     you saw my warrant .     may i see it again .    harroway  his forehead shining with considerably more than mere enthusiasm  passed it over a second time .   byerley said evenly   i read here as the description of what you are to search  i quote   the dwelling place belonging to stephen allen byerley  located at     willow grove  evanstron  together  with any garage  storehouse or other structures or buildings thereto appertaining  together with all grounds thereto appertaining  .  .  .  um .  .  .  and so on .  quite in order .  but  my good man  it doesn t say anything about searching my interior .  i am not part of the premises .  you may search my clothes if you think i ve got a robot hidden in my pocket .    harroway had no doubt on the point of to whom he owed his job .  he did not propose to be backward  given a chance to earn a much better   i . e .   more highly paid job .   he said  in a faint echo of bluster   look here .  i m allowed to search the furniture in your house  and anything else i find in it .  you are in it  aren t you .     a remarkable observation .  i am in it .  but i m not a piece of furniture .  as a citizen of adult responsiblity   i have the psychiatric certificate proving that   i have certain rights under the regional articles .  searching me would come under the heading of violating my right of privacy .  that paper isn t sufficient .     sure  but if you re a robot  you don t have right of privacy .     true enough but that paper still isn t sufficient .  it recognizes me implicitly as a human being .     where .   harroway snatched at it .    where it says  the dwelling place belonging to  and so on .  a robot cannot own property .  and you may tell your employer  mr .  harroway  that if he tries to issue a similar paper which does not implicitly recognize me as a human being  he will be immediately faced with a restraining injunction and a civil suit which will make it necessary for him to prove me a robot by means of information now in his possession  or else to pay a whopping penalty for an attempt to deprive me unduly of my rights under the regional articles .  you ll tell him that  won t you .    harroway marched to the door .  he turned .   .   you re a slick lawyer   his hand was in his pocket .  for a short moment  he stood there .  then he left  smiled in the direction of the  visor scanner  still playing away waved to the reporters  and shouted   we ll have something for you tomorrow  boys .  no kidding .    in his ground car  he settled back  removed the tiny mechanism from his pocket and carefully inspected it .  it was the first time he had ever taken a photograph by x ray reflection .  he hoped he had done it correctly .   quinn and byerley had never met face to face alone .  but visorphone was pretty close to it .  in fact  accepted literally  perhaps the phrase was accurate  even if to each  the other were merely the light and dark pattern of a bank of photocells .   it was quinn who had initiated the call .  it was quinn  who spoke first  and without particular ceremony   thought you would like to know  byerley  that i intend to make public the fact that you re wearing a protective shield against penet radiation .     that so .  in that case  you ve probably already made it public .  i have a notion our enterprising press representatives have been tapping my various communication lines for quite a while .  i know they have my office lines full of holes  which is why i ve dug in at my home these last weeks .   byerley was friendly  almost chatty .   quinn s lips tightened slightly   this call is shielded   thoroughly .  i m making it at a certain personal risk .     so i should imagine .  nobody knows you re behind this campaign .  at least  nobody knows it officially .  nobody doesn t know it unofficially .  i wouldn t worry .  so i wear a  protective shield .  i suppose you found that out when your puppy dog s penet radiation photograph  the other day  turned out to be overexposed .     you realize  byerley  that it would be pretty obvious to everyone that you don t dare face x ray analysis .     also that you  or your men  attempted illegal invasion of my rights of privacy .     the devil they ll care for that .     they might .  it s rather symbolic of our two campaigns isn t it .  you have little concern with the rights of the individual citizen .  i have great concern .  i will not submit to x ray analysis  because i wish to maintain my rights on principle .  just as i ll maintain the rights of others when elected .     that will  no doubt make a very interesting speech  but no one will believe you .  a little too high sounding to be true .  another thing   a sudden  crisp change   the personnel in your home was not complete the other night .     in what way .     according to the report   he shuffled papers before him that were just within the range of vision of the visiplate   there was one person missing   a cripple .     as you say   said byerley  tonelessly   a cripple .  my old teacher  who lives with me and who is now in the country   and has been for two months .  a  much needed rest  is the usual expression applied in the case .  he has your permission .     your teacher .  a scientist of sorts .     a lawyer once   before he was a cripple .  he has a government license as a research biophysicist  with a laboratory of his own  and a complete description of the work he s doing filed with the proper authorities  to whom i can refer you .  the work is minor  but is a harmless and engaging hobby for a   poor cripple .  i am being as helpful as i can  you see .     i see .  and what does this .  .  .  teacher .  .  .  know about robot manufacture .     i couldn t judge the extent of his knowledge in a field with which i am unacquainted .     he wouldn t have access to positronic brains .     ask your friends at u .  s .  robots .  they d be the ones to know .     i ll put it shortly  byerley .  your crippled teacher is the real stephen byerley .  you are his robot creation .  we can prove it .  it was he who was in the automobile accident  not you .  there will be ways of checking the records .     really .  do so  then .  my best wishes .     and we can search your so called teacher s  country place   and see what we can find there .     well  not quite  quinn .   byerley smiled broadly .   unfortunately for you  my so called teacher is a sick man .  his country place is his place of rest .  his right of privacy as a citizen of adult responsibility is naturally even stronger  under the circumstances .  you won t be able to obtain a warrant to enter his grounds without showing just cause .  however  i d be the last to prevent you from trying .    there was a pause of moderate length  and then quinn leaned forward  so that his imaged face expanded and the fine lines on his forehead were visible   byerley  why do you carry on .  you can t be elected .     can t i .     do you think you can .  do you suppose that your failure to make any attempt to disprove the robot charge   when you could easily  by breaking one of the three laws   does anything but convince the people that you are a robot .     all i see so far is that from being a rather vaguely known  but still largely obscure metropolitan lawyer  i have now become a world figure .  you re a good publicist .     but you are a robot .     so it s been said  but not proven .     it s been proven sufficiently for the electorate .     then relax you ve won .     good by   said quinn  with his first touch of viciousness  and the visorphone slammed off .    good by   said byerley imperturbably  to the blank plate .     byerley brought his  teacher  back the week before election .  the air car dropped quickly in an obscure part of the city .    you ll stay here till after election   byerley told him .   it would be better to have you out of the way if things take a bad turn .    the hoarse voice that twisted painfully out of john s crooked mouth might have had accents of concern in it .   there s danger of violence .     the fundamentalists threaten it  so i suppose there is  in a theoretical sense .  but i really don t expect it .  the fundies have no real power .  they re just the continuous irritant factor that might stir up a riot after a while .  you don t mind staying here .  please .  i won t be myself if i have to worry about you .     oh  i ll stay .  you still think it will go well .     i m sure of it .  no one bothered you at the place .     no one .  i m certain .     and your part went well .     well enough .  there ll be no trouble there .     then take care of yourself  and watch the televisor tomorrow  john .   byerley pressed the gnarled hand that rested on his .   lenton s forehead was a furrowed study in suspense .  he had the completely unenviable job of being byerley s campaign manager in a campaign that wasn t a campaign  for a person that refused to reveal his strategy  and refused to accept his manager s .    you can t .   it was his favorite phrase .  it had become his only phrase .   i tell you  steve  you can t .    he threw himself in front of the prosecutor  who was spending his time leafing through the typed pages of his speech .    put that down  steve .  look  that mob has been organized by the fundies .  you won t get a hearing .  you ll be stoned more likely .  why do you have to make a speech before an audience .  what s wrong with a recording  a visual recording .     you want me to win the election  don t you .   asked byerley  mildly .    win the election .  you re not going to win  steve .  i m trying to save your life .     oh  i m not in danger .     he s not in danger .  he s not in danger .   lenton made a queer  rasping sound in his throat .   you mean you re getting out on that balcony in front of fifty thousand crazy crackpots and try to talk sense to them   on a balcony like a medieval dictator .    byerley consulted his watch .   in about five minutes   as soon as the televison lines are free .    lenton s answering remark was not quite transliterable .     the crowd filled a roped off area of the city .  trees and houses seemed to grow out of a mass human foundation .  and by ultra wave  the rest of the world watched .  it was a purely local election  but it had a world audience just the same .  byerley thought of that and smiled .   but there was nothing to smile at in the crowd itself .  there were banners and streamers  ringing every possible change on his supposed robotcy .  the hostile attitude rose thickly and tangibly into the atmosphere .   from the start the speech was not successful .  it competed against the inchoate mob howl and the rhythmic cries of the fundie claques that formed mob islands within the mob .  byerley spoke on  slowly  unemotionally   inside  lenton clutched his hair and groaned   and waited for the blood .     there was a writhing in the front ranks .  an angular citizen with popping eyes  and clothes too short for the lank length of his limbs  was pulling to the fore .  a policeman dived after him  making slow  struggling passage .  byerley waved the latter off  angrily .   the thin man was directly under the balcony .  his words tore unheard against the roar .   byerley leaned forward .   what do you say .  if you have a legitimate question  i ll answer it .   he turned to a flanking guard .   bring that man up here .    there was a tensing in the crowd .  cries of  quiet  started in various parts of the mob  and rose to a bedlam  then toned down raggedly .  the thin man  red faced and panting  faced byerley .   byerley said   have you a question .    the thin man stared  and said in a cracked voice   hit me .    with sudden energy  he thrust out his chin at an angle .   hit me .  you say you re not a robot .  prove it .  you can t hit a human  you monster .    there was a queer  flat  dead silence .  byerley s voice punctured it .   i have no reason to hit you .    the thin man was laughing wildly .   you can t hit me .  you won t hit me .  you re not a human .  you re a monster  a make believe man .    and stephen byerley  tight lipped  in the face of thousands who watched in person and the millions who watched by screen  drew back his fist and caught the man crackingly upon the chin .  the challenger went over backwards in sudden collapse  with nothing on his face but blank  blank surprise .   byerley said   i m sorry .  take him in and see that he s comfortable .  i want to speak to him when i m through .    and when dr .  calvin  from her reserved space  turned her automobile and drove off  only one reporter had recovered sufficiently from the shock to race after her  and shout an unheard question .   susan calvin called over her shoulder   he s human .    that was enough .  the reporter raced away in his own direction .   the rest of the speech might be described as  spoken but not heard .      dr .  calvin and stephen byerley met once again   a week before he took the oath of office as mayor .  it was late past midnight .   dr .  calvin said   you don t look tired .    the mayor elect smiled .   i may stay up for a while .  don t tell quinn .     i shan t .  but that was an interesting story of quinn s  since you mention him .  it s a shame to have spoiled it .  i suppose you knew his theory .     parts of it .     it was highly dramatic .  stephen byerley was a young lawyer  a powerful speaker  a great idealist   and with a certain flair for biophysics .  are you interested in robotics  mr .  byerley .     only in the legal aspects .     this stephen byerley was .  but there was an accident .  byerley s wife died  he himself  worse .  his legs were gone  his face was gone  his voice was gone .  part of his mind was bent .  he would not submit to plastic surgery .  he retired from the world  legal career gone   only his intelligence  and his hands .  left .  somehow he could obtain positronic brains  even a complex one  one which had the greatest capacity of forming judgments in ethical problems   which is the highest robotic function so far developed .    he grew a body about it .  trained it to be everything he would have been and was no longer .  he sent it out into the world as stephen byerley  remaining behind himself as the old  crippled teacher that no one ever saw     unfortunately   said the mayor elect   i ruined all that by hitting a man .  the papers say it was your official verdict on the occasion that i was human .     how did that happen .  do you mind telling me .  it couldn t have been accidental .     it wasn t entirely .  quinn did most of the work .  my men started quietly spreading the fact that i had never hit a man  that i was unable to hit a man  that to fail to do so under provocation would be sure proof that i was a robot .  so i arranged for a silly speech in public  with all sorts of publicity overtones  and almost inevitably  some fool fell for it .  in its essence  it was what i call a shyster trick .  one in which the artificial atmosphere which has been created does all the work .  of course  the emotional effects made my election certain  as intended .    the robopsychologist nodded .   i see you intrude on my field   as every politician must  i suppose .  but i m very sorry it turned out this way .  i like robots .  i like them considerably better than i do human beings .  if a robot can be created capable of being a civil executive  i think he d make the best one possible .  by the laws of robotics  he d be incapable of harming humans  incapable of tyranny  of corruption  of stupidity  of prejudice .  and after he had served a decent term  he would leave  even though he were immortal  because it would be impossible for him to hurt humans by letting them know that a robot had ruled them .  it would be most ideal .     except that a robot might fail due to the inherent inadequacies of his brain .  the positronic brain has never equalled the complexities of the human brain .     he would have advisers .  not even a human brain is capable of governing without assistance .    byerley considered susan calvin with grave interest .   why do you smile  dr .  calvin .     i smile because mr .  quinn didn t think of everything .     you mean there could be more to that story of his .     only a little .  for the three months before election  this stephen byerley that mr .  quinn spoke about  this broken man  was in the country for some mysterious reason .  he returned in time for that famous speech of yours .  and after all  what the old cripple did once  he could do a second time  particularly where the second job is very simple in comparison to the first .     i don t quite understand .    dr .  calvin rose and smoothed her dress .  she was obviously ready to leave .   i mean there is one time when a robot may strike a human being without breaking the first law .  just one time .     and when is that .    dr .  calvin was at the door .  she said quietly   when the human to be struck is merely another robot .    she smiled broadly  her thin face glowing .   good by mr .  byerley .  i hope to vote for you five years from now   for co ordinator .    stephen byerley chuckled .   i must reply that that is a somewhat farfetched idea .    the door closed behind her .         i stared at her with a sort of horror   is that true .     all of it   she said .    and the great byerley was simply a robot .     oh  there s no way of ever finding out .  i think he was .  but when he decided to die  he had himself atomized  so that there will never be any legal proof .  besides  what difference would it make .     well     you share a prejudice against robots which is quite unreasoning .  he was a very good mayor  five years later he did become regional co ordinator .  and when the regions of earth formed their federation in       he became the first world co ordinator .  by that time it was the machines that were running the world anyway .     yes  but     no buts .  the machines are robots  and they are running the world .  it was five years ago that i found out all the truth .  it was       byerley was completing his second term as world co ordinator             the evitable conflict         the co ordinator  in his private study  had that medieval curiosity  a fireplace .  to be sure  the medieval man might not have recognized it as such  since it had no functional significance .  the quiet  licking flame lay in an insulated recess behind clear quartz .   the logs were ignited at long distance through a trifling diversion of the energy beam that fed the public buildings of the city .  the same button that controlled the ignition first dumped the ashes of the previous fire  and allowed for the entrance of fresh wood .   it was a thoroughly domesticated fireplace  you see .     but the fire itself was real .  it was wired for sound  so that you could hear the crackle and  of course  you could watch it leap in the air stream that fed it .   the co ordinator s ruddy glass reflected  in miniature  the discreet gamboling of the flame  and  in even further miniature  it was reflected in each of his brooding pupils .   and in the frosty pupils of his guest  dr .  susan calvin of u .  s .  robots   mechanical men corporation .   the co ordinator said   i did not ask you here entirely for social purposes  susan .     i did not think you did  stephen   she replied .     and yet i don t quite know how to phrase my problem .  on the one hand  it can be nothing at all .  on the other  it can mean the end of humanity .     i have come across so many problems  stephen  that presented the same alternative .  i think all problems do .     really .  then judge this  world steel reports an overproduction of twenty thousand long tons .  the mexican canal is two months behind schedule .  the mercury mines at almaden have experienced a production deficiency since last spring  while the hydroponics plant at tientsin has been laying men off .  these items happen to come to mind at the moment .  there is more of the same sort .     are these things serious .  i m not economist enough to trace the fearful consequences of such things .     in themselves  they are not serious .  mining experts can be sent to almaden  if the situation were to get worse .  hydroponics engineers can be used in java or in ceylon  if there are too many at tientsin .  twenty thousand long tons of steel won t fill more than a few days of world demand  and the opening of the mexican canal two months later than the planned date is of little moment .  it s the machines that worry me  i ve spoken to your director of research about them already .     to vincent silver .   he hasn t mentioned anything about it to me .     i asked him to speak to no one .  apparently  he hasn t .     and what did he tell you .     let me put that item in its proper place .  i want to talk about the machines first .  and i want to talk about them to you  because you re the only one in the world who understands robots well enough to help me now .   may i grow philosophical .     for this evening  stephen  you may talk how you please and of what you please  provided you tell me first what you intend to prove .     that such small unbalances in the perfection of our system of supply and demand  as i have mentioned  may be the first step towards the final war .     hmp .  proceed .    susan calvin did not allow herself to relax  despite the designed comfort of the chair she sat in .  her cold  thin lipped face and her flat  even voice were becoming accentuated with the years .  and although stephen byerley was one man she could like and trust  she was almost seventy and the cultivated habits of a lifetime are not easily broken .    every period of human development  susan   said the co ordinator   has had its own particular type of human conflict   its own variety of problem that  apparently  could be settled only by force .  and each time  frustratingly enough  force never really settled the problem .  instead  it persisted through a series of conflicts  then vanished of itself   what s the expression   ah  yes  not with a bang  but a whimper   as the economic and social environment changed .  and then  new problems  and a new series of wars .   apparently endlessly cyclic .    consider relatively modern times .  there were the series of dynastic wars in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries  when the most important question in europe was whether the houses of hapsburg or valois bourbon were to rule the continent .  it was one of those  inevitable conflicts   since europe could obviously not exist half one and half the other .    except that it did  and no war ever wiped out the one and established the other  until the rise of a new social atmosphere in france in      tumbled first the bourbons and  eventually  the hapsburgs down the dusty chute to history s incinerator .    and in those same centuries there were the more barbarous religious wars  which revolved about the important question of whether europe was to be catholic or protestant .  half and half she could not be .  it was  inevitable  that the sword decide .   except that it didn t .  in england  a new industrialism was growing  and on the continent  a new nationalism .  half and half europe remains to this day and no one cares much .    in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  there was a cycle of nationalist imperialist wars  when the most important question in the world was which portions of europe would control the economic resources and consuming capacity of which portions of non europe .  all non europe obviously could not exist part english and part french and part german and so on .   until the forces of nationalism spread sufficiently  so that non europe ended what all the wars could not  and decided it could exist quite comfortably all non european .    and so we have a pattern     yes .  stephen  you make it plain   said susan calvin .   these are not very profound observations .     no .   but then  it is the obvious which is so difficult to see most of the time .  people say  it s as plain as the nose on your face .   but how much of the nose on your face can you see  unless someone holds a mirror up to you .  in the twentieth century  susan  we started a new cycle of wars   what shall i call them .  ideological wars .  the emotions of religion applied to economic systems  rather than to extra natural ones .  again the wars were  inevitable  and this time there were atomic weapons  so that mankind could no longer live through its torment to the inevitable wasting away of inevitability .   and positronic robots came .    they came in time  and  with it and alongside it  interplanetary travel .   so that it no longer seemed so important whether the world was adam smith or karl marx .  neither made very much sense under the new circumstances .  both had to adapt and they ended in almost the same place .     a deus ex machina  then  in a double sense   said dr .  calvin  dryly .   the co ordinator smiled gently   i have never heard you pun before  susan  but you are correct .  and yet there was another danger .  the ending of every other problem had merely given birth to another .  our new world wide robot economy may develop its own problems  and for that reason we have the machines .  the earth s economy is stable  and will remain stable  because it is based upon the decisions of calculating machines that have the good of humanity at heart through the overwhelming force of the first law of robotics .    stephen byerley continued   and although the machines are nothing but the vastest conglomeration of calculating circuits ever invented  they are still robots within the meaning of the first law  and so our earth wide economy is in accord with the best interests of man .  the population of earth knows that there will be no unemployment  no over production or shortages .  waste and famine are words in history books .  and so the question of ownership of the means of production becomes obsolescent .  whoever owned them  if such a phrase has meaning   a man  a group  a nation  or all mankind  they could be utilized only as the machines directed .   not because men were forced to but because it was the wisest course and men knew it .    it puts an end to war   not only to the last cycle of wars  but to the next and to all of them .  unless    a long pause  and dr .  calvin encouraged him by repetition .   unless    the fire crouched and skittered along a log  then popped up .    unless   said the co ordinator   the machines don t fulfill their function .     i see .  and that is where those trifling maladjustments come in which you mentioned awhile ago   steel  hydroponics and so on .     exactly .  those errors should not be .  dr .  silver tells me they cannot be .     does he deny the facts .  how unusual .     no  he admits the facts  of course .  i do him an injustice .  what he denies is that any error in the machine is responsible for the so called  his phrase  errors in the answers .  he  claims that the machines are self correcting and that it would violate the fundamental laws of nature for an error to exist in the circuits of relays .  and so i said      and you said   have your boys check them and make sure  anyway .      susan  you read my mind .  it was what i said  and he said he couldn t .     too busy .     no  he said that no human could .  he was frank about it he told me  and i hope i understand him properly  that the machines are a gigantic extrapolation .  thus  a team of mathematicians work several years calculating a positronic brain equipped to do certain similar acts of calculation .  using this brain they make further calculations to create a still more complicated brain  which they use again to make one still more complicated and so on .  according to silver  what we call the machines are the result of ten such steps .     ye es  that sounds familiar .  fortunately  i m not a mathematician .  poor vincent .  he is a young man .  the directors before him  alfred lanning and peter bogert  are dead  and they had no such problems .  nor had i .  perhaps roboticists as a whole should now die  since we can no longer understand our own creations .     apparently not .  the machines are not super brains in sunday supplement sense   although they are so pictured in the sunday supplements .  it is merely that in their own particular province of collecting and analyzing a nearly infinite number of data and relationships thereof  in nearly infinitesimal time  they have progressed beyond the possibility of detailed human control .    and then i tried something else .  i actually asked the machine .  in the strictest secrecy  we fed it the original data involved in the steel decision  its own answer  and the actual developments since   the overproduction  that is   and asked for an explanation of the discrepancy .     good  and what was its answer .     i can quote you that word for word   the matter admits of no explanation .       and how did vincent interpret that .     in two ways .  either we had not given the machine enough data to allow a definite answer  which was unlikely .  dr .  silver admitted that .   or else  it was impossible for the machine to admit that it could give any answer to data which implied that it could harm a human being .  this  naturally  is implied by the first law .  and then dr .  silver recommended that i see you .    susan calvin looked very tired   i m old  stephen .  when peter bogert died  they wanted to make me director of research and i refused .  i wasn t young then  either  and i did not wish the responsibility .  they let young silver have it and that satisfied me  but what good is it  if i am dragged into such messes .    stephen  let me state my position .  my researches do indeed involve the interpretation of robot behavior in the light of the three laws of robotics .  here  now  we have these incredible calculating machines .  they are positronic robots and therefore obey the laws of robotics .  but they lack personality  that is  their functions are extremely limited .  must be  since they are so specialized .  therefore  there is very little room for the interplay of the laws  and my one method of attack is virtually useless .  in short  i don t know that i can help you  stephen .    the co ordinator laughed shortly   nevertheless  let me tell you the rest .  let me give you my theories  and perhaps you will then be able to tell me whether they are possible in the light of robopsychology .     by all means .  go ahead .     well  since the machines are giving the wrong answers  then  assuming that they cannot be in error  there is only one possibility .  they are being given the wrong data .  in other words  the trouble is human  and not robotic .  so i took my recent planetary inspection tour     from which you have just returned to new york .     yes .  it was necessary  you see  since there are four machines  one handling each of the planetary regions .  and all four are yielding imperfect results .     oh  but that follows  stephen .  if any one of the machines is imperfect  that will automatically reflect in the result of the other three  since each of the others will assume as part of the data on which they base their own decisions  the perfection of the imperfect fourth .  with a false assumption  they will yield false answers .     uh huh .  so it seemed to me .  now  i have here the records of my interviews with each of the regional vice coordinators .  would you look through them with me .   oh  and first  have you heard of the  society for humanity  .     umm  yes .  they are an outgrowth of the fundamentalists who have kept u .  s .  robots from ever employing positronic robots on the grounds of unfair labor competition and so on .  the  society for humanity  itself is anti machine  is it not .     yes  yes  but  well  you will see .  shall we begin .  we ll start with the eastern region .     as you say      the eastern region  a area            square miles  b population                 c capital  shanghai    ching hso lin s great grandfather had been killed in the japanese invasion of the old chinese republic  and there had been no one beside his dutiful children to mourn his loss or even to know he was lost .  ching hso lin s grandfather had survived the civil war of the late forties  but there had been no one beside his dutiful children to know or care of that .   and yet ching hso lin was a regional vice co ordinator  with the economic welfare of half the people of earth in his care .   perhaps it was with the thought of all that in mind  that ching had two maps as the only ornaments on the wall of his office .  one was an old hand drawn affair tracing out an acre or two of land  and marked with the now outmoded pictographs of old china .  a little creek trickled aslant the faded markings and there were the delicate pictorial indications of lowly huts  in one of which ching s grandfather had been born .   the other map was a huge one  sharply delineated  with all markings in neat cyrillic characters .  the red boundary that marked the eastern region swept within its grand confines all that had once been china  india  burma  indo china  and indonesia .  on it  within the old province of szechuan  so light and gentle that none could see it  was the little mark placed there by ching which indicated the location of his ancestral farm .   ching stood before these maps as he spoke to stephen byerley in precise english   no one knows better than you  mr .  co ordinator  that my job  to a large extent  is a sinecure .  it carries with it a certain social standing  and i represent a convenient focal point for administration  but otherwise it is the machine .   the machine does all the work .  what did you think  for instance  of the tientsin hydroponics works .     tremendous .   said byerley .    it is but one of dozens  and not the largest .  shanghai  calcutta  batavia  bangkok  they are widely spread and they are the answer to feeding the billion and three quarters of the east .     and yet   said byerley   you have an unemployment problem there at tientsin .  can you be over producing .  it is incongruous to think of asia as suffering from too much food .    ching s dark eyes crinkled at the edges .   no .  it has not come to that yet .  it is true that over the last few months  several vats at tientsin have been shut down  but it is nothing serious .  the men have been released only temporarily and those who do not care to work in other fields have been shipped to colombo in ceylon  where a new plant is being put into operation .     but why should the vats be closed down .    ching smiled gently   you do not know much of hydroponics  i see .  well  that is not surprising .  you are a northerner  and there soil farming is still profitable .  it is fashionable in the north to think of hydroponics  when it is thought of at all  as a device of growing turnips in a chemical solution  and so it is   in an infinitely complicated way .    in the first place  by far the largest crop we deal with  and the percentage is growing  is yeast .  we have upward of two thousand strains of yeast in production and new strains are added monthly .  the basic food chemicals of the various yeasts are nitrates and phosphates among the inorganics together with proper amounts of the trace metals needed  down to the fractional parts per million of boron and molybdenum which are required .  the organic matter is mostly sugar mixtures derived from the hydrolysis of cellulose  but  in addition  there are various food factors which must be added .    for a successful hydroponics industry   one which can feed seventeen hundred million people   we must engage in an immense reforestation program throughout the east  we must have huge wood conversion plants to deal with our southern jungles  we must have power  and steel  and chemical synthetics above all .     why the last  sir .     because  mr .  byerley  these strains of yeast have each their peculiar properties .  we have developed  as i said  two thousand strains .  the beef steak you thought you ate today was yeast .  the frozen fruit confection you had for dessert was iced yeast .  we have filtered yeast juice with the taste  appearance  and all the food value of milk .    it is flavor  more than anything else  you see  that makes yeast feeding popular and for the sake of flavor we have developed artificial  domesticated strains that can no longer support themselves on a basic diet of salts and sugar .  one needs biotin  another needs pteroylglutamic acid  still others need seventeen different amino acids supplied them as well as all the vitamins b  but one  and yet it is popular and we cannot  with economic sense  abandon it     byerley stirred in his seat   to what purpose do you tell me all this .     you asked me  sir  why men are out of work in tientsin .  i have a little more to explain .  it is not only that we must have these various and varying foods for our yeast  but there remains the complicating factor of popular fads with passing time  and of the possibility of the development of new strains with the new requirements and new popularity .  all this must be foreseen  and the machine does the job     but not perfectly .     not very imperfectly  in view of the complications i have mentioned .  well  then  a few thousand workers in tientsin are temporarily out of a job .  but  consider this  the amount of waste in this past year  waste that is  in terms of either defective supply or defective demand  amounts to not one tenth of one percent of our total productive turnover .  i consider that     yet in the first years of the machine  the figure was nearer onethousandth of one percent .     ah  but in the decade since the machine began its operations in real earnest  we have made use of it to increase our old pre machine yeast industry twenty fold .  you expect imperfections to increase with complications  though     though .     there was the curious instance of rama vrasayana .     what happened to him .     vrasayana was in charge of a brine evaporation plant for the production of iodine  with which yeast can do without  but human beings not .  his plant was forced into receivership .     really .  and through what agency .     competition  believe it or not .  in general  one of the chiefest functions of the machine s analyses is to indicate the most efficient distribution of our producing units .  it is obviously faulty to have areas insufficiently serviced  so that the transportation costs account for too great a percentage of the overhead .  similarly  it is faulty to have an area too well serviced  so that factories must be run at lowered capacities  or else compete harmfully with one another .  in the case of vrasayana  another plant was established in the same city  and with a more efficient extracting system .     the machine permitted it .     oh  certainly .  that is not surprising .  the new system is becoming widespread .  the surprise is that the machine failed to warn vrasayana to renovate or combine .   still  no matter .  vrasayana accepted a job as engineer in the new plant  and if his responsibility and pay are now less  he is not actually suffering .  the workers found employment easily  the old plant has been converted to   something or other .  something useful .  we left it all to the machine .     and otherwise you have no complaints .     none .      the tropic region   a area             square miles  b population               c capital  capital city  the map in lincoln ngoma s office was far from the model of neat precision of the one in ching s shanghai dominion .  the boundaries of ngoma s tropic region were stencilled in dark  wide brown and swept about a gorgeous interior labelled  jungle  and  desert  and  here be elephants and all manner of strange beasts .    it had much to sweep  for in land area the tropic region enclosed most of two continents  all of south america north of argentina and all of africa south of the atlas .  it included north america south of the rio grande as well  and even arabia and iran in asia .  it was the reverse of the eastern region .  where the ant hives of the orient crowded half of humanity into    per cent of the land mass  the tropics stretched its    per cent of humanity over nearly half of all the land in the world .   but it was growing .  it was the one region whose population increase through immigration exceeded that through births .   and for all who came it had use .   to ngoma  stephen byerley seemed like one of these immigrants  a pale searcher for the creative work of carving a harsh environment into the softness necessary for man  and he felt some of that automatic contempt of the strong man born to the strong tropics for the unfortunate pallards of the colder suns .   the tropics had the newest capital city on earth  and it was called simply that   capital city   in the sublime confidence of youth .  it spread brightly over the fertile uplands of nigeria and outside ngoma s windows  far below  was life and color  the bright  bright sun and the quick  drenching showers .  even the squawking of the rainbowed birds was brisk and the stars were hard pinpoints in the sharp night .   ngoma laughed .  he was a big  dark man  strong faced and handsome .    sure   he said  and his english was colloquial and mouthfilling   the mexican canal is overdue .  what the hell .  it will get finished just the same  old boy .     it was doing well up to the last half year .    ngoma looked at byerley and slowly crunched his teeth over the end of a big cigar  spitting out one end and lighting the other   is this an official investigation  byerley .  what s going on .     nothing .  nothing at all .  it s just my function as coordinator to be curious .     well  if it s just that you are filling in a dull moment  the truth is that we re always short on labor .  there s lots going on in the tropics .  the canal is only one of them     but doesn t your machine predict the amount of labor available for the canal   allowing for all the competing projects .    ngoma placed one hand behind his neck and blew smoke rings at the ceiling   it was a little off .     is it often a little off .     not oftener than you would expect .   we don t expect too much of it  byerley .  we feed it data .  we take its results .  we do what it says .   but it s just a convenience  just a labor saving device .  we could do without it  if we had to .  maybe not as well .  maybe not as quickly .  but we d get there .    we ve got confidence out here  byerley  and that s the secret .  confidence .  we ve got new land that s been waiting for us for thousands of years  while the rest of the world was being ripped apart in the lousy fumblings of pre atomic time .  we don t have to eat yeast like the eastern boys  and we don t have to worry about the stale dregs of the last century like you northerners .    we ve wiped out the tsetse fly and the anopheles mosquito  and people find they can live in the sun and like it  now .  we ve thinned down the jungles and found soil  we ve watered the deserts and found gardens .  we ve got coal and oil in untouched fields  and minerals out of count .    just step back .  that s all we ask the rest of the world to do .   step back  and let us work .    byerley said  prosaically   but the canal    it was on schedule six months ago .  what happened .    ngoma spread his hands   labor troubles .   he felt through a pile of papers skeltered about his desk and gave it up .    had something on the matter here   he muttered   but never mind .  there was a work shortage somewhere in mexico once on the question of women .  there weren t enough women in the neighborhood .  it seemed no one had thought of feeding sexual data to the machine .    he stopped to laugh  delightedly  then sobered   wait a while .  i think i ve got it .   villafranca .     villafranca .     francisco villafranca .   he was the engineer in charge .  now let me straighten it out .  something happened and there was a cave in .  right .  right .  that was it .  nobody died  as i remember  but it made a hell of a mess .   quite a scandal .     oh .     there was some mistake in his calculations .   or at least  the machine said so .  they fed through villafranca s data  assumptions  and so on .  the stuff he had started with .  the answers came out differently .  it seems the answers villafranca had used didn t take account of the effect of a heavy rainfall on the contours of the cut .   or something like that .  i m not an engineer  you understand .    anyway  villafranca put up a devil of a squawk .  he claimed the machine s answer had been different the first time .  that he had followed the machine faithfully .  then he quit .  we offered to hold him on   reasonable doubt  previous work satisfactory  and all that   in a subordinate position  of course   had to do that much   mistakes can t go unnoticed   bad for discipline  where was i .     you offered to hold him on .     oh yes .  he refused .   well  take all in all  we re two months behind .  hell  that s nothing .    byerley stretched out his hand and let the fingers tap lightly on the desk   villafranca blamed the machine  did he .     well  he wasn t going to blame himself  was he .  let s face it  human nature is an old friend of ours .  besides  i remember something else now  why the hell can t i find documents when i want them .  my filing system isn t worth a damn  this villafranca was a member of one of your northern organizations .  mexico is too close to the north .  that s part of the trouble .     which organization are you speaking of .     the society of humanity  they call it .  he used to attend the annual conference in new york  villafranca did .  bunch of crackpots  but harmless .   they don t like the machines  claim they re destroying human initiative .  so naturally villafranca would blame the machine .   don t understand that group myself .  does capital city look as if the human race were running out of initiative .    and capital city stretched out in golden glory under a golden sun  the newest and youngest creation of homo metropolis .     the european region  a area            square miles  b population               c capital  geneva    the european region was an anomaly in several ways .  in area  it was far the smallest  not one fifth the size of the tropic region in area  and not one fifth the size of the eastern region in population .  geographically  it was only somewhat similar to pre atomic europe  since it excluded what had once been european russia and what had once been the british isles  while it included the mediterranean coasts of africa and asia  and  in a queer jump across the atlantic  argentina  chile  and uruguay as well .   nor was it likely to improve its relative status vis a vis the other regions of earth  except for what vigor the south american provinces lent it .  of all the regions  it alone showed a positive population decline over the past half century .  it alone had not seriously expanded its productive facilities  or offered anything radically new to human culture .    europe   said madame szegeczowska  in her soft french   is essentially an economic appendage of the northern region .  we know it  and it doesn t matter .    and as though in resigned acceptance of a lack of individuality  there was no map of europe on the wall of the madame co ordinator s office .    and yet   pointed out byerley   you have a machine of your own  and you are certainly under no economic pressure from across the ocean .     a machine .  bah .   she shrugged her delicate shoulders  and allowed a thin smile to cross her little face as she tamped out a cigarette with long fingers .   europe is a sleepy place .  and such of our men as do not manage to emigrate to the tropics are tired and sleepy along with it .  you see for yourself that it is myself  a poor woman  to whom falls the task of being vice co ordinator .  well  fortunately  it is not a difficult job  and not much is expected of me .    as for the machine  what can it say but  do this and it will be best for you .   but what is best for us .  why  to be an economic appendage of the northern region .    and is it so terrible .  no wars .  we live in peace   and it is pleasant after seven thousand years of war .  we are old  monsieur .  in our borders  we have the regions where occidental civilization was cradled .  we have egypt and mesopotamia  crete and syria  asia minor and greece .   but old age is not necessarily an unhappy time .  it can be a fruition     perhaps you are right   said byerley  affably .   at least the tempo of life is not as intense as in the other regions .  it is a pleasant atmosphere .     is it not .   tea is being brought  monsieur .  if you will indicate your cream and sugar preference  please .  thank you .   she sipped gently  then continued   it is pleasant .  the rest of earth is welcome to the continuing struggle .  i find a parallel here  a very interesting one .  there was a time when rome was master of the world .  it had adopted the culture and civilization of greece  a greece which had never been united  which had ruined itself with war  and which was ending in a state of decadent squalor .  rome united it  brought it peace and let it live a life of secure non glory .  it occupied itself with its philosophies and its art  far from the clash of growth and war .  it was a sort of death  but it was restful  and it lasted with minor breaks for some four hundred years .     and yet   said byerley   rome fell eventually  and the opium dream was over .     there are no longer barbarians to overthrow civilization .     we can be our own barbarians .  madame szegeczowska .   oh  i meant to ask you .  the almaden mercury mines have fallen off quite badly in production .  surely the ores are not declining more rapidly than anticipated .    the little woman s gray eyes fastened shrewdly on byerley   barbarians   the fall of civilization   possible failure of the machine .  your thought processes are very transparent  monsieur .     are they .   byerley smiled .   i see that i should have had men to deal with as hitherto .   you consider the almaden affair to be the fault of the machine .     not at all  but i think you do .  you  yourself  are a native of the northern region .  the central co ordination office is at new york .   and i have noticed for quite a while that you northerners lack somewhat of faith in the machine .     we do .     there is your  society for humanity  which is strong in the north  but naturally fails to find many recruits in tired  old europe  which is quite willing to let feeble humanity alone for a while .  surely  you are one of the confident north and not one of the cynical old continent .     this has a connection with almaden .     oh  yes  i think so .  the mines are in the control of consolidated cinnabar  which is certainly a northern company  with headquarters at nikolaev .  personally  i wonder if the board of directors have been consulting the machine at all .  they said they had in our conference last month  and  of course  we have no evidence that they did not  but i wouldn t take the word of a northerner in this matter   no offense intended   under any circumstances .   nevertheless  i think it will have a fortunate ending .     in what way  my dear madam .     you must understand that the economic irregularities of the last few months  which  although small as compared with the great storms of the past  are quite disturbing to our peace drenched spirits  have caused considerable restiveness in the spanish province .  i understand that consolidated cinnabar is selling out to a group of native spaniards .  it is consoling .  if we are economic vassals of the north  it is humiliating to have the fact advertised too blatantly .   and our people can be better trusted to follow the machine .     then you think there will be no more trouble .     i am sure there will not be  in almaden  at least .        the northern region  a area             square miles  b population               c  capital  ottawa    the northern region  in more ways than one  was at the top .  this was exemplified quite well by the map in the ottawa office of vice co ordinator hiram mackenzie  in which the north pole was centered .  except for the enclave of europe with its scandinavian and icelandic regions  all the arctic area was within the northern region .   roughly  it could be divided into two major areas .  to the left on the map was all of north america above the rio grande .  to the right was included all of what had once been the soviet union .  together these areas represented the centered power of the planet in the first years of the atomic age .  between the two was great britain  a tongue of the region licking at europe .  up at the top of the map  distorted into odd  huge shapes  were australia and new zealand  also member provinces of the region .   not all the changes of the past decades had yet altered the fact that the north was the economic ruler of the planet .   there was almost an ostentatious symbolism thereof in the fact that of the official regional maps byerley had seen  mackenzie s alone showed all the earth  as though the north feared no competition and needed no favoritism to point up its pre eminence .    impossible   said mackenzie  dourly  over the whiskey .   mr .  byerley  you have had no training as a robot technician  i believe .     no  i have not .     hmp .  well  it is  in my opinion  a sad thing that ching  ngoma and szegeczowska haven t either .  there is too preva lent an opinion among the peoples of earth that a co ordinator need only be a capable organizer  a broad generalizer  and an amiable person .  these days he should know his robotics as well  no offense intended .     none taken .  i agree with you .     i take it  for instance  from what you have said already  that you worry about the recent trifling dislocation in world economy .  i don t know what you suspect  but it has happened in the past that people   who should have known better   wondered what would happen if false data were fed into the machine .     and what would happen  mr .  mackenzie .     well   the scotsman shifted his weight and sighed   all collected data goes through a complicated screening system which involves both human and mechanical checking  so that the problem is not likely to arise .   but let us ignore that .  humans are fallible  also corruptible  and ordinary mechanical devices are liable to mechanical failure .    the real point of the matter is that what we call a  wrong datum  is one which is inconsistent with all other known data .  it is our only criterion of right and wrong .  it is the machine s as well .  order it for instance  to direct agricultural activity on the basis of an average july temperature in iowa of    degrees fahrenheit .  it won t accept that .  it will not give an answer .   not that it has any prejudice against that particular temperature  or that an answer is impossible  but because  in the light of all the other data fed it over a period of years  it knows that the probability of an average july temperature of    is virtually nil .  it rejects that datum .    the only way a  wrong datum  can be forced on the machine is to include it as part of a self consistent whole  all of which is subtly wrong in a manner either too delicate for the machine to detect or outside the machine s experience .  the former is beyond human capacity  and the latter is almost so  and is becoming more nearly so as the machine s experience increases by the second .    stephen byerley placed two fingers to the bridge of his nose   then the machine cannot be tampered with  and how do you account for recent errors  then .     my dear byerley  i see that you instinctively follow that great error   that the machine knows all .  let me cite you a case from my personal experience .  the cotton industry engages experienced buyers who purchase cotton .  their procedure is to pull a tuft of cotton out of a random bale of a lot .  they will look at that tuft and feel it  tease it out  listen to the crackling perhaps as they do so  touch it with their tongue and through this procedure they will determine the class of cotton the bales represent .  there are about a dozen such classes .  as a result of their decisions  purchases are made at certain prices  blends are made in certain proportions .   now these buyers cannot yet be replaced by the machine .     why not .  surely the data involved is not too complicated for it .     probably not .  but what data is this you refer to .  no textile chemist knows exactly what it is that the buyer tests when he feels a tuft of cotton .  presumably there s the average length of the threads  their feel  the extent and nature of their slickness  the way they hang together  and so on .   several dozen items  subconsciously weighed  out of years of experience .  but the quantitative nature of these tests is not known  maybe even the very nature of some of them is not known .  so we have nothing to feed the machine .  nor can the buyers explain their own judgment .  they can only say   well  look at it .  can t you tell it s class such and such .       i see .     there are innumerable cases like that .  the machine is only a tool after all  which can help humanity progress faster by taking some of the burdens of calculations and interpretations off its back .  the task of the human brain remains what it has always been  that of discovering new data to be analyzed  and of devising new concepts to be tested .  a pity the society for humanity won t understand that .     they are against the machine .     they would be against mathematics or against the art of writing if they had lived at the appropriate time .  these reactionaries of the society claim the machine robs man of his soul .  i notice that capable men are still at a premium in our society  we still need the man who is intelligent enough to think of the proper questions to ask .  perhaps if we could find enough of such  these dislocations you worry about  coordinator  wouldn t occur .        earth  including the uninhabited continent  antarctica   a area             square miles  land surface   b population                 c capital  new york    the fire behind the quartz was weary now  and sputtered its reluctant way to death .   the co ordinator was somber  his mood matching the sinking flame .    they all minimize the state of affairs .   his voice was low .   is it not easy to imagine that they all laugh at me .  and yet vincent silver said the machines cannot be out of order  and i must believe him .  hiram mackenzie says they cannot be fed false data  and i must believe him .  but the machines are going wrong  somehow  and i must believe that  too  and so there is still an alternative left .    he glanced sidewise at susan calvin  who  with closed eyes  for a moment seemed asleep .    what is that .   she asked  prompt to her cue  nevertheless .    why  that correct data is indeed given  and correct answers are indeed received  but that they are then ignored .  there is no way the machine can enforce obedience to its dictates .     madame szegeczowska hinted as much  with reference to northerners in general  it seems to me .     so she did .     and what purpose is served by disobeying the machine .  let s consider motivations .     it s obvious to me  and should be to you .  it is a matter of rocking the boat  deliberately .  there can be no serious conflicts on earth  in which one group or another can seize more power than it has for what it thinks is its own good despite the harm to mankind as a whole  while the machines rule .  if popular faith in the machines can be destroyed to the point where they are abandoned  it will be the law of the jungle again .   and not one of the four regions can be freed of the suspicion of wanting just that .    the east has half of humanity within its borders  and the tropics more than half of earth s resources .  each can feel itself the natural rulers of all earth  and each has a history of humiliation by the north  for which it can be human enough to wish a senseless revenge .  europe has a tradition of greatness  on the other hand .  it once did rule the earth  and there is nothing so eternally adhesive as the memory of power .    yet  in another way  it s hard to believe .  both the east and the tropics are in a state of enormous expansion within their own borders .  both are climbing incredibly .  they cannot have the spare energy for military adventures .  and europe can have nothing but its dreams .  it is a cipher  militarily .     so  stephen   said susan   you leave the north .     yes   said byerley  energetically   i do .  the north is now the strongest  and has been for nearly a century  or its component parts have been .  but it is losing relatively  now .  the tropic regions may take their place in the forefront of civilization for the first time since the pharaohs  and there are northerners who fear that .     the  society for humanity  is a northern organization  primarily  you know  and they make no secret of not wanting the machines .   susan  they are few in numbers  but it is an association of powerful men .  heads of factories  directors of industries and agricultural combines who hate to be what they call  the machine s office boy  belong to it .  men with ambition belong to it .  men who feel themselves strong enough to decide for themselves what is best for themselves  and not just to be told what is best for others .    in short  just those men who  by together refusing to accept the decisions of the machine  can  in a short time  turn the world topsy turvy  just those belong to the society .    susan  it hangs together .  five of the directors of world steel are members  and world steel suffers from overproduction .  consolidated cinnabar  which mined mercury at aimaden  was a northern concern .  its books are still being investigated  but one  at least  of the men concerned was a member .  francisco villafranca  who  singlehanded  delayed the mexican canal for two months  was a member  we know already   and so was rama vrasayana  i was not at all surprised to find out .    susan said  quietly   these men  i might point out  have all done badly     but naturally   interjected byerley .   to disobey the machine s analyses is to follow a non optimal path .  results are poorer than they might be .  it s the price they pay .  they will have it rough now but in the confusion that will eventually follow     just what do you plan doing  stephen .     there is obviously no time to lose .  i am going to have the society outlawed  every member removed from any responsible post .  and all executive and technical positions  henceforward  can be filled only by applicants signing a non society oath .  it will mean a certain surrender of basic civil liberties  but i am sure the congress     it won t work .     what .   why not .     i will make a prediction .  if you try any such thing  you will find yourself hampered at every turn .  you will find it impossible to carry out .  you will find your every move in that direction will result in trouble .    byerley was taken aback   why do you say that .  i was rather hoping for your approval in this matter .     you can t have it as long as your actions are based on a false premise .  you admit the machine can t be wrong  and can t be fed wrong data .  i will now show you that it cannot be disobeyed  either  as you think is being done by the society .     that i don t see at all .     then listen .  every action by any executive which does not follow the exact directions of the machine he is working with becomes part of the data for the next problem .  the machine  therefore  knows that the executive has a certain tendency to disobey .  he can incorporate that tendency into that data   even quantitatively  that is  judging exactly how much and in what direction disobedience would occur .  its next answers would be just sufficiently biased so that after the executive concerned disobeyed  he would have automatically corrected those answers to optimal directions .  the machine knows  stephen .     you can t be sure of all this .  you are guessing .     it is a guess based on a lifetime s experience with robots .  you had better rely on such a guess  stephen .     but then what is left .  the machines themselves are correct and the premises they work on are correct .  that we have agreed upon .  now you say that it cannot be disobeyed .  then what is wrong .     you have answered yourself .  nothing is wrong .  think about the machines for a while  stephen .  they are robots  and they follow the first law .  but the machines work not for any single human being  but for all humanity  so that the first law becomes   no machine may harm humanity  or  through inaction  allow humanity to come to harm .     very well  then  stephen  what harms humanity .  economic dislocations most of all  from whatever cause .  wouldn t you say so .     i would .     and what is most likely in the future to cause economic dislocations .  answer that  stephen .     i should say   replied byerley  unwillingly   the destruction of the machines .     and so should i say  and so should the machines say .  their first care  therefore  is to preserve themselves  for us .  and so they are quietly taking care of the only elements left that threaten them .  it is not the  society for humanity  which is shaking the boat so that the machines may be destroyed .  you have been looking at the reverse of the picture .  say rather that the machine is shaking the boat very slightly   just enough to shake loose those few which cling to the side for purposes the machines consider harmful to humanity .    so vrasayana loses his factory and gets another job where he can do no harm   he is not badly hurt  he is not rendered incapable of earning a living  for the machine cannot harm a human being more than minimally  and that only to save a greater number .  consolidated cinnabar loses control at almaden .  villafranca is no longer a civil engineer in charge of an important project .  and the directors of world steel are losing their grip on the industry  or will .     but you don t really know all this   insisted byerley  distractedly .  how can we possibly take a chance on your being right .     you must .  do you remember the machine s own statement when you presented the problem to him .  it was   the matter admits of no explanation .   the machine did not say there was no explanation  or that it could determine no explanation .  it simply was not going to admit any explanation .  in other words  it would be harmful to humanity to have the explanation known  and that s why we can only guess   and keep on guessing .     but how can the explanation do us harm .  assume that you are right  susan .     why  stephen  if i am right  it means that the machine is conducting our future for us not only simply in direct answer to our direct questions  but in general answer to the world situation and to human psychology as a whole .  and to know that may make us unhappy and may hurt our pride .  the machine cannot  must not  make us unhappy .    stephen  how do we know what the ultimate good of humanity will entail .  we haven t at our disposal the infinite factors that the machine has at its .  perhaps  to give you a not unfamiliar example  our entire technical civilization has created more unhappiness and misery than it has removed .  perhaps an agrarian or pastoral civilization  with less culture and less people would be better .  if so  the machines must move in that direction  preferably without telling us  since in our ignorant prejudices we only know that what we are used to  is good   and we would then fight change .  or perhaps a complete urbanization  or a completely caste ridden society  or complete anarchy  is the answer .  we don t know .  only the machines know  and they are going there and taking us with them .     but you are telling me  susan  that the  society for humanity  is right  and that mankind has lost its own say in its future .     it never had any  really .  it was always at the mercy of economic and sociological forces it did not understand   at the whims of climate  and the fortunes of war .  now the machines understand them  and no one can stop them  since the machines will deal with them as they are dealing with the society    having  as they do  the greatest of weapons at their disposal  the absolute control of our economy .     how horrible .     perhaps how wonderful .  think  that for all time  all conflicts are finally evitable .  only the machines  from now on  are inevitable .    and the fire behind the quartz went out and only a curl of smoke was left to indicate its place .          and that is all   said dr .  calvin  rising .   i saw it from the beginning  when the poor robots couldn t speak  to the end  when they stand between mankind and destruction .  i will see no more .  my life is over .  you will see what comes next .    i never saw susan calvin again .  she died last month at the age of eighty two .           end
