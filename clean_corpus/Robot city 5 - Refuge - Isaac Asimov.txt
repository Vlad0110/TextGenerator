history of homo sapiens  all human beings were hunters and gatherers .  of necessity  they were wanderers  for to stay in one place would mean gathering all there was of vegetable food and driving away all there was of animal food   and starvation would follow .   the only habitations such wanderers  or    nomads     could have would have to be either parts of the environment  such as caves  or light and movable artifacts  such as tents .   agriculture  however  came into being some ten thousand years ago and that introduced a great change .   farms  unlike human beings and animals  are not mobile .  the need to take care of farms and agricultural produce nailed the farmers to the ground .  the more they grew dependent upon the harvest to maintain their swollen numbers  too great for most to survive if they had to return to hunting and gathering   the more hopelessly immobile they became .  they could not run away  except for brief intervals  from wild animals  and they could not run away at all from nomadic raiders who wished to help themselves to the copious foodstores that they had not worked for .   it followed that farmers had to fight off their enemies  they had no choice .  they had to band together and build their houses in a huddle  for in unity there was strength .  forethought or  failing that  bitter experience  caused them to build the huddle of houses on an elevation where there was a natural water supply  and to lay in foodstores and then build a wall about the whole .  thus were built the first cities .   once farmers learned to protect themselves and their farms  and became reasonably secure  they found they could produce more food than they required for their own needs .  some of the city dwellers  therefore  could do work of other types and exchange their products for some of the excess food produced by the farmers .  the cities became the homes of artisans  merchants  administrators  priests  and so on .  human existence came to transcend the bare search for food  clothing  and shelter .  in short  civilization became possible and the very word    civilization    is from the latin for    citydweller .      each city was developed into a political unit  with some sort of ruler  or decision maker  for this was required if defense of homes and farms was to be made efficient and successful .  the necessity of being prepared for battle against nomads led to the development of soldiers and weapons which  during peaceful periods  could be used to police and control the city population itself .  thus  there developed the    city state .      as population continued to grow  each city state tried to extend the food growing area under its control .  inevitably  neighboring city states would collide and there would be disputes  which became armed wars .   the tendency would be for one city state to grow at the expense of others  with the result that an    empire    would be established .  such large units tended to be more effective than smaller ones  for reasons that are easy to explain .   consider that agriculture requires fresh water  and that the surest supply of that is to be found in a sizable river .  for that reason  early farming communities were built along the shores of rivers such as the nile  the euphrates  the indus  and the hwang ho .   the rivers also served as easy avenues for commerce  transportation  and communication .    rivers  however  took work .  dikes had to be built along the shores to confine the river and prevent ruin through floods .  irrigation ditches had to be built to bring a controlled supply of water directly to the farms .  to dike a river and to maintain a system of irrigation requires cooperation not only of individuals within a given city state  but among the city states themselves .  if one city state allowed its own system to deteriorate  the flood that might follow would disastrously affect all other city states downstream .  an empire that controls many city states can  more effectively  enforce the necessary cooperation and maintain a general prosperity .   an empire  however  usually means the domination of many people by one conquering group  and resentment builds up  and struggles for    liberty    break out .  eventually  under weak rulers  an empire is therefore likely to break up .   world history seems to demonstrate an oscillation between empires  often prosperous  but despotic   and decentralized political units  often producing a high culture  but quarrelsome and militarily weak  .   on the whole  though  the tendency has been in the direction not only of large units  but of larger and larger ones  as advancing technology made transportation and communication easier and more efficient  and as overall population increase heightened the perceived value of security and prosperity over liberty and squabbling .   as population grew  cities grew larger and more populous  too .  memphis thebes nineveh babylon   and then  eventually  rome  which at its peak in the second century a . d .  may have been the first city to have a population of one million .   the multi million city became a feature of the modem world after the industrial revolution introduced enormous advances in transportation and communication .  the nineteenth century saw cities of four million people and the early twentieth century saw cities of six and seven million people .   all through the last ten thousand years  in other words  the world has become more and more urbanized  and after world war ii  the process became a runaway cancer .  in the last forty years  the world population has doubled and the population of the developing countries  where the birth rate remained high  has considerably more than doubled .  we now have cities  like mexico city  s  o paulo  calcutta  with populations climbing toward the twenty million mark and threatening to go higher still .  such cities are becoming squalid expanses of shantytowns  endlessly polluted  without adequate sanitation  and with the very technological factors that encourage the growth beginning to break down .   where do we go from here .  anywhere other than decay  breakdown and dissolution .   i tackled the problem of the future city in my novel the caves of steel  which first appeared as a three part serial in galaxy science fiction in      .  i was influenced in my thinking by the fact that i happen to be a claustrophile .  i feel comfortable in crowded and enclosed environments .   thus  i enjoy living in the center of manhattan .  i move about its crowded canyons with ease and with no sensation of discomfort .  i like to work in a room with the blinds pulled down  and at a desk that faces a blank wall  so that i increase my feeling of enclosure .   naturally  then  i pictured my future new york as a kind of much more extreme version than the present new york .  some people marveled at my imagination .      how could you think up such a nightmare existence as that in the caves of steel .      to which i would reply in puzzled surprise     what nightmare existence .      i had added one novelty  to be sure .  i had the entire huge city of the future built underground .   perhaps that was what made it seem a nightmare existence  but there are advantages to underground life  if you stop to think of it .   first  weather would no longer be important  since it is primarily a phenomenon of the atmosphere .  rain  snow  and fog would not trouble the underground world .  even temperature variations are limited to the open surface and would not exist underground .  whether day or night  summer or winter  temperatures in the underground city would remain equable and nearly constant .  in place of spending energy on heating and cooling  you would have to spend energy on ventilation  to be sure  but i think that this would involve a large net saving .  electrified transportation would be required to avoid the pollution of the internal combustion engine  but then walking  considering the certainty of good weather  would become much more attractive and that  too  would not only save energy  but would promote better health .   the only adverse environmental conditions that would affect the underground world would be volcanoes  earthquakes  and meteoric impacts .  however  we know where volcanoes exist and where earthquakes are common and might avoid those areas .  and perhaps we will have a space patrol to destroy any meteoric objects likely to bring them uncomfortably close .   second  local time would no longer be important .  on the surface  the tyranny of day and night cannot be avoided  and when it is morning in one place  it is noon in another  evening in still another and midnight in yet another .  the rhythm of human life is therefore out of phase .  underground  where artificial light will determine the day  we can if we wish make a uniform time the planet over .  this would certainly simplify global cooperation and would eliminate jet lag .   if a global day and global night turn out to have serious deficiencies  any other system can be set up .  the point is it will be our system and not one forced on us by the accident of earth   s rotation .    third  the ecological structure could be stabilized .  right now  with humanity on the planetary surface  we encumber the earth .  our enormous numbers take up room  as do all the structures we build to house ourselves and our machines  to make possible our transportation and communication  to offer ourselves rest and recreation .  all these things distort the wild  depriving many species of plants and animals of their natural habitat   and sometimes  involuntarily  favoring a few  such as rats and roaches .   if humanity and its structures are removed below ground    well below the level of the natural world of the burrowing animals   man would still occupy the surface with his farms  his forestry  his observation towers  his air terminals and so on  but the extent of that occupation would be enormously decreased .  indeed  as one imagines the underground world becoming increasingly elaborate  one can visualize much of the food supply eventually deriving from soilless crops grown in artificially illuminated areas underground .  the earth   s surface might be increasingly turned over to park and to wilderness  maintained at ecological stability .   nor would we be depriving ourselves of nature .  indeed  it would be closer .  it might seem that to withdraw underground is to withdraw from the natural world  but would that be so .  would the withdrawal be more complete than it is now  when so many people work in city buildings that are often windowless and artificially conditioned .  even where there are windows  what is the prospect one views  if one bothers to   but sun  sky  and buildings to the horizon   plus some limited greenery .   and to get away from the city now .  to reach the real countryside .  one must travel horizontally for miles and miles  first across city pavements and then across suburban sprawls .  and the countryside we would be viewing would be steadily retreating and steadily undergoing damage .   in the underground world  we might have areas of greenery  too  even parks   and tropical growth in greenhouses .  but we don   t have to depend on these makeshift attempts  comforting though they may be to many .  we need only go straight up  a mere couple of hundred yards above the level of    main street    underground    and   there you are .   the surface you would visit would be nature   perhaps tamer than it might be  but relatively unspoiled .  the surface would have to be protected from too frequent  or too intense  or too careless visiting  but however carefully restricted the upward trips might be the chances are that the dwellers in the underground world would see more of the natural world  under ecologically sounder conditions  than dwellers of surface cities do today .   i am interested to see  by the way  that the notion of underground living has begun to seem more realistic in the decades since i wrote the caves of steel .  for instance  many cities in the more northerly latitudes  where cold weather  ice  and snow inhibit shopping by making it unpleasant  are building underground shopping malls   more and more elaborate  more and more self contained  more and more like my own imagined world .   however  my imagination is not the only one the world possesses .  here we have refuge  by rob chilson  in which my underground city of the future is explored by another science fiction writer skilled in his craft  who has taken my underground cities as the starting point for his own .       chapter    kappa whale    the stars gave no light .  derec crawled slowly along the ship   s hull  peering intently through his helmet at the silvery metal .  the ship was below him  or beside him  depending entirely on how one looked at it .  he preferred to think of it as    beside      he felt less as if he might fall that way .   to his left  to his right     above    and    below    him  was nothing .  but space was nothing new to derec  whose memories began only a few months ago in a space capsule   a lifepod  in fact .  at the moment he had no time for memories of the pod  of the ice asteroid  or of capture by the nonhuman pirate aranimas .  he was concentrating on swimming .      i   m at the strut     he announced .      good     said ariel  her voice booming in his helmet .   derec hadn   t time to turn his radio down  nor did he wish to let go just yet .  his crawl along the hull  helped by the electromagnets in knees and palms  had been slow  but inexorable .  when he seized the strut  his hand stopped but his body continued on past  like a swimmer carried by a wave .  a wave .   f inertia .   gripping the strut  he found himself slowly swinging around it like a flag  facing back the way he   d come .  he had realized immediately that he shouldn   t have grabbed the strut  but didn   t compound his error by trying to undo it .  he let the swing take him  absorbed his momentum with his arm   it creaked painfully   and came to a stop .   a robot  advancing in its tracks  arrested itself on the other side of the strut in the proper way  a hand braced against it  the arm soaking up the momentum like a spring .  being a robot  he had no fear of sprained wrists  the most common injuries in free fall .   the robot  mandelbrot  paused courteously while derec resolved his entanglement with the strut .  derec gripped it with both hands and bent one elbow while keeping the other straight .  his body revolved slowly around the bent arm until he had reversed himself .  placing his foot against the strut  he tippy toed away from it  letting go  uncoiling  and reaching out for the hull .   for a moment derec was in free  dreamy flight  not touching the ship  then his palms touched down  the magnets clicking against it as he turned on crawlpower .  he slid forward on hands and forearms while his inertia wave was absorbed by the    beach    of the ship   s hull .  his chest and belly and finally his knees touched down painfully  to slide scraping along .      frost .     said ariel .     what are you doing  sawing the hull in half .      derec didn   t reply .  not letting all his momentum be absorbed  he came quickly to hands and knees  reaching and pulling at the hull .  the magnets were computer controlled and clicked on and off alternately in the crawl pattern .   in a few seconds he braked and all the magnets went on .  he skittered slowly to a stop .  mandelbrot joined him in a similar fashion and looked at the hull  then moved aside .      right  we   re at the hatch     said derec .     it doesn   t look like we   ll need any tools to get in  just a matter of turning inset screws .      there were two slits in the hull  each in a small circle .  the circles were at one edge of a square outline   the hatch .  derec stuck two fingers in one of the slits  mandelbrot copying his motion at the other side  and they twisted the circles clockwise .  there was a pop  and the hatch rode free .      got it open     derec said .   that was a little premature .  he would have to stand up on the hull to raise the hatch  or else move around .  but before he could make up his mind  mandelbrot reinserted his fingers into one of the slits and pulled .  the hatch came free easily .  mandelbrot bent his arm like a rope  heaving the hatch up over his head  put up his other arm  and the hatch stood out from the hull .      can   t see a frosted thing     muttered derec .  his helmet light bounced off the shiny underside of the hatch and again off the huddled machinery exposed  but without air to scatter the light  what he saw was a collection of parallel and crossing lines of light against velvet blackness .  after a moment  however  he made out a handle .  these things weren   t meant only for doctorates in mechanical engineering to understand  after all .  there was a release in the handle .   squeezing the release  derec pulled up on the handle .  nothing happened .  there wasn   t room on the handle for mandelbrot to help him .  gripping it tightly  derec stood on the hull and put his back into it .  it came free with a creaky vibration he felt all the way up through the soles of his feet  an odd sort of hearing .      trouble .     ariel asked  concern in her voice .  perhaps she had heard his breathing and the gasp when it broke free .      stuck  but i got it loose .  i think a little ice had frozen around it .      with the help of the robot  who had released the hatch and now stood upright on the hull  derec pulled out a mass of cunningly nested pipes all connected together  rather like unfolding a sofa bed .  mandelbrot reached down and pulled a heavy cord  and a mass of thick  silvery plastic unfolded .  as soon as the plastic balloon was sufficiently unfolded not to suffer damage  derec peered down at its root .   he had to move around to the side  but there was the valve  looking uncommonly like a garden faucet on far off aurora .  for a moment derec was shaken by a perfect memory of a faucet in some dewy garden on the planet of the dawn .  he   d had indications before this that he was from that greatest of spacer planets  but very few specific memories leaked through his amnesia  fewer still were as sharp as this one .   after a few moments  though  he realized he was not going to remember what or where that garden was .  all he knew about it was that it was a pleasant memory .  he had liked that garden .  now all he had of it was the memory of its faucet .   it isn   t wise to shrug in freefall  so derec reached carefully inside the hatch and  bracing himself  twisted the faucet .  there was a hiss he heard through his fingers and the air in the arm of his suit  as steam under low pressure rushed into the balloon .  in a moment  mandelbrot was out of sight behind it .   that wonderful flexible arm came into view  mandelbrot twisted the return valve  and in a moment there was the faint murmur of a small pump .  water  too  was moving through the pipes by now .   the radiator and vacuum distillation sections of the water purification and cooling system was in operation .  they had settled down for a long stay in space .   should have done this days ago  derec thought but didn   t say aloud .  an optimist  he had hoped a ship would have come by before now .  ariel  who tended to be pessimistic  had doubted .      i   m coming back by way of the sun side     he said .     the light   s better .      ariel didn   t answer .  a punch on a button made his safety line release itself and reel in from the forward airlock .  he reattached it to a ring near the hatch  the robot mimicked his movements .  feeling better about standing upright on the hull  derec strode slowly and carefully around the rather narrow cylinder until the tiny red lamp of their current    sun    came into view  then on around until it was overhead .   a class m dwarf  the red star was no doubt very old .  it was certainly very small and it had no real planets .  its biggest daughter was an ancient lump of rock barely four hundred kilometers in diameter  its next biggest less than half that in size .  most of its daughters were fragments that ranged from respectable mountains down to fists   and there weren   t many of any size .  a star that old was formed at a time when the nebulas in the galaxy had only begun to be enriched with heavy elements .  this was not a metalliferous star  no prospector had ever bothered to check out those lumps of rock for anything of value  none ever would .   dim and worthless though it was  the star lit the way .  .  .  somewhat .  under its light  the silvery hull looked like burnished copper   a pleasing sight .  shadows still were sharp edged  his own shadow an odd shaped  moving hole  it seemed  in the hull  a hole into some strange and other dimensional universe .   mandelbrot followed him gracefully .      detection alert     said ariel  sounding bored .     rock coming our way .  looks like it might be about a mouthful  if you were hungry for rocks .         i   m not     said derec  but it made him think of baked potatoes .  he was getting hungry .   had there been any danger  ariel would have said so  derec assumed that the rock would miss them by a wide margin .  they were well out from the star  sparsely populated though its space was with junk .  this was only the second thing they   d detected in two days  and the first was merely a grain of sand .  probably both objects were    dirty ice      the stuff of comets .   danger or no  mandelbrot moved closer to him  scanning the sky without pausing .  derec didn   t notice  and didn   t bother to look for the rock .  the sun drew his eye instead .  at this distance  dim as it was and weak in ultraviolet light  it could be looked at directly .   pitiful excuse though it was for a star  poor as its family was  still it made an island of light in a vast sea of darkness where stars hard and unwinking as diamonds cut at him with their stares .  he thought of the space around the red star as a room  a warmly lit room in an immensity of cold and darkness .   after the circumscribed life of robot city  he felt free .  space  derec thought  is mankind   s natural home .   there came a bark from inside the vessel  and he was reminded with a sudden chill that others than men used space .  one of those others was within this ship  wolruf  the doglike alien with whom he   d made alliance on aranimas   s ship .  she had escaped first from aranimas with him  then from the hospital station  then from robot city .   things had been worse for them in the past  he thought .  if they had to wait here for a week or two .  .  .   then he thought  i   m worried about ariel  though .   he moved forward  found the airlock  and crowded in to make room for the bulky robot .   frost condensed on his armor as soon as he entered the ship  but derec ignored that  knowing that it wasn   t too cold to touch yet  they   d only been out for minutes .  it seemed even more cramped inside after having been out .  .      we should spend more time outside     he said .     it   s not exactly fresh air  but at least there   s a feeling of freedom .      ariel looked momentarily interested  then shrugged .     i   m all right .       mandelbrot looked keenly at her  pausing in his ridiculous motion of scraping frost off his eyes  but said nothing .  he had said nothing to derec yet  but derec knew that he was worried  too .  ariel had a serious disease .  a fatal disease  she had said  it had caused her occasional pain before this  stabbing muscular aches  and she frequently seemed feverish and headachey and generally out of it  sometimes she even had hallucinations .  but this prolonged gloom was new  and worrisome .      so there   s water for showerr  yess .     said wolruf .  she was the size of a large dog and not infrequently went on all fours  but usually walked upright  for her front paws were clumsy seeming hands  ill shaped by human standards but clever with tools .      give it half an hour     derec said .  the furry alien needed showers daily in a ship where there was no escape from each other .      derec  shall i prepare food .     mandelbrot asked .     it approaches the usual hour for your meals .      ariel roused herself  said     i   ll do that  mandelbrot .  what do you want  derec  wolruf .      there were no potatoes ready .  of course he did not expect to find real food in a spaceship  and it took time for the synthesizer to prepare a specialty item .     stew would be fine .  keep varying the mix and it   ll be a long time before i get bored with it .         i eat same as    ou     wolruf said .      borscht today     said ariel with a smile that seemed natural .     we   ve got lots of tomato sauce  and besides  i like it .         it   s wonderful to have a commercial synthesizer and a large stock of basics     derec said  cheering at her cheer .     remember our experiments in robot city .      she made a face .     remember .  i   m trying to forget .      dr .  avery   s ship was well equipped .  indeed  they could live indefinitely out here   at least until the micropile gave out  or their air and water leaked away .  the water purifier used yeast and algae to reclaim sewage  the plants then being stored as basic organic matter for the synthesizer .   derec  having removed the suit with motions suitable to a contortionist  stowed it away in its clips beside the airlock .  mandelbrot immediately went to it and checked it over .  reaching to the ceiling of the cabin  derec touched off  tippy toed off the floor  and back off the ceiling .  called    brachiating     it was the most efficient mode of movement within a cabin in free fall .   he turned on the receiver .  it was tuned to beacon   local .  a calm  feminine sounding robotic voice spoke .     beacon kappa whale arcadia .  report  please .  beacon kappa whale arcadia .  report  please .     turning off the sound  derec glumly checked the indicators .  kappa whale was coming in on the electromagnetic band  both laser and microwave .  they were getting minimal detection on the hyperwave  however .      i don   t understand it     he muttered .  ariel glanced at him over her shoulder as she floated before the cooking equipment .   wolruf joined him .     wass broken by doctorr avery  do    ou think .         sabotage .  i don   t know .  it was picking up kappa whale beautifully when we took off from robot city .      they had left the planet of robots hurriedly in this stolen ship .  dr .  avery  who had created the robots that went on to build robot city  had been pursuing them for reasons none of them understood .  though derec suspected that ariel knew more about the enigmatic and less than sane doctor than she had said .   once off the planet and safe from dr .  avery  they discovered that either there were no astrogation charts in the ship  or they were well concealed in its computer .  though positronic  that was not a full fledged positronic brain .  had it been  they could have convinced it that without the charts they would die in space .  under the first law of robotics  it would be unable to withhold the charts  regardless of the orders it had been given .   the first law of robotics states  a robot may not knowingly harm a human being  or knowingly allow a human being to come to harm .   orders would have come merely under the second law  which is  a robot must obey the orders of a human being  except where this would conflict with the first law .   but the computer was merely a more complicated calculator  incapable of the simplest robotic thought .  robotic ships with positronic brains had been tried  and had all failed  because all full sized positronic brains were designed with the three laws built into them .  necessarily  they were too intent on preventing possible harm to their occupants .  since space travel is inherently unsafe  they had a tendency to go mad or to refuse to take off .      i feel like hitting the damn computer  or kicking it     he said .   wolruf grinned her rather frightening grin .     ho .     ou think  like jeff leong  all machines should have place to kick .         or some way to jar information loose .  i   m convinced there must be charts in there somewhere        it was a reasonable guess .  nobody could remember all the miles of numbers that was a star chart .  charts were rarely printed out in whole  though for convenience in calculation  some sections might be .  this little ship didn   t have a printer .  all it had   they presumed   was a recording in its memory .   but they couldn   t find it .   even that wouldn   t have been too serious if the hyperwave hadn   t gone out on them .  lacking charts  in orbit about robot city  they had swept space with the hyperwave and picked up kappa whale arcadia quite well .  the fix was good enough to jump toward  and they had done that .  logically  they should then have been able to pick up other beacons and hop  skip  and jump their way to anywhere in inhabited space  the fifty spacer worlds  or the settler worlds that earth had recently begun to occupy .      we   re somewhere within telescopic distance of arcadia     murmured derec .  that was a minor and distant spacer world .  but they had no idea on which side of it lay the constellation of the whale .  they knew only that this   kappa   was the ninth brightest star in that constellation  and that there was only one fainter  lambda whale .  constellations  by interstellar agreement  had  for astrogational purposes  no more than ten stars .      sooner or laterr a ship will come     wolruf said reassuringly .   sooner or later .  derec grunted .   he didn   t need to have the argument repeated  it had been mostly his .  when they found that  after the jump  the hyperwave would only pick up the nearest beacon  derec had suggested that they lie low until a ship came by  and request a copy of the astrogational charts from it .  to beam a copy over would take the ship only a few minutes  and be no trouble at all .   sooner or later .      soup   s on  or stew in this case     ariel said .  the oven opened with an exhalation of savory steam .     we still have some of your crusty bread  derec .  i reheated it .  but we   ll want more later .         it smells good     derec said honestly .  wolruf  with even greater honesty  licked her chops and grinned .  derec had overcome his irritation at ariel   s invasion of the male preserve of the chief of cuisine  and had admitted to her that she was a better chef than he .   common cooking was robot work  which no human admitted to doing .    they ate in silence for a short while .  the stew was served in covered bowls  but it clung to the inner surfaces .  manipulating their spoons carefully  they were able to eat without flinging food allover the ship .  at first even ariel   s appetite was good  but she quickly lost interest .      do you think a ship will ever come by here .     she asked finally  her gaze  and apparently her thought  a long way away .      of course     said derec quickly .     i admit i was too optimistic .  i suspect we   re well out on the edge of inhabited space  this lane is not too well traveled .  but eventually .  .  .  .         eventually .  .  .     she said  almost dreamily .  she seemed  often now  in a drifting  abstracted state .      eventually     derec repeated weakly .   he was too honest to try to argue her into belief .  ships didn   t fly from star to star like an aircraft .  they jumped  with massive thrusts of their hyperatomic motors  going in a direction that was at right angles to time and all three spatial dimensions simultaneously .  since they went no distance  it naturally took no time to jump .  therefore there were no lanes of star travel .   for safety reasons  ships jumped from star to star  if one was stranded for any reason  rescuers had only to chart the route and check every star along it .  and since not every star had inhabited planets  all along these well traveled lanes  as they were called  were the beacon stars .  a ship jumping into this beacon system was supposed to verify that it had indeed arrived at kappa whale  beam its ship   s log to the beacon   s recorders  and depart .  periodically  patrol ships copied those records to assure that nothing untoward had happened .   but days had passed and no ships had appeared .  of course a ship appearing on the other side of kappa whale would not be detected by them on the electromagnetic band until it had jumped out .  the hyperwave radio  though  was functioning well enough to detect a ship reporting to the beacon anywhere in this stellar system .  derec and wolruf agreed on that .   so  eventually they would be found and rescued .   wolruf finished her meal by opening her bowl and licking it clean efficiently .     i wass thinking     she said .     maybe jump wave shock shifted things in    ou   rr hyperwave antenna .         shifted the elements .     derec nodded uncertainly .  he had no idea where he had been educated  but he had a good general technical background with a strong specialty in robotics   not unusual for a spacer youth  as he assumed himself to be .  but hyperwave technology was a whole other and  if anything  even more difficult school of knowledge .      do    ou have      ou know   things to measure them with .      derec had seen a toolbox on the ship   s schematic that he had accessed before going out to set up the recycling system .  . there might be .      there was .  a few minutes later  with ariel listless at the detectors and wolruf at the communicator  derec carefully strode forward outside  followed by mandelbrot .   the hyperwave antenna could have been put in any part of the ship  since the hyperatomo didn   t kowtow to the laws of space time  but it would have had to have been well shielded lest its backlash in the small ship damage the instruments .  or even the crew .  so in these star seeker models it was in a blister on the bow  as far from everything as possible .   the antenna looked like a series of odd shaped chunks of metal and coils of wire  and the testing gear simply shot current through each element in turn .  the readouts were within normal range  as nearly as he could tell from the manual he had accessed before coming out .      i don   t get it     derec complained  thinking of the classical definition of hell  the place where all the instruments test out to be perfect  but none of them work .     how can i fix it if it isn   t broken .         i think     said wolruf slowly     that dr .  avery hass retuned the antenna .          retuned .     derec had never heard of such a thing  but knew little about the subject .     i thought all spacer talk was in the same range .  is he trying to pick up   settlers .  or what .         maybe aranimass .      maybe  derec thought  chilled .  maybe  indeed .  that long armed pirate was definitely interested in dr .  avery   s doings  though he might not know who or what dr .  avery was .   derec stood  looking around the warm room generated by kappa whale  and shivered .  for the first time the thought came to him  what if the first ship that showed up was aranimas   s .  he must be systematically searching the beacon stars     a touch on his arm nearly made derec jump off the hull .     chapter    perihelion    the burnished  enigmatic face of mandelbrot approached his .  the robot gripped him with his normal left arm .  his avery construct right arm bent impossibly  reached around derec and switched off his communicator .   derec had had nightmares about that arm .  it was a piece of scrap from an avery robot  which aranimas had had picked up from the ice asteroid where derec had first awakened .     build me a robot     the alien had said .  derec had put pieces together to build the robot he called alpha .  it wasn   t a good job  but it worked .   then  weeks later  the crudely attached right arm seated itself firmly and made a few modifications in alpha   s brain  alpha informed them that he was now known as mandelbrot .  derec had observed the fine structure of the arm  a series of tiny chips  or scales  that gripped each other and could therefore mold the arm to any shape that might be desired .   each unit was a sort of robotic cell  together  they were a brain .  and having integrated themselves  they had   to a degree   taken over alpha .  derec   s nightmare was that the cells were eating the robot out from the inside  that his interior was one solid mass of them  and he was about to become something    horrifying .   impossible  the cells couldn   t eat .  also  all the brains were robotic  mandelbrot   s normal positronic brain and the units in the cells .  the three laws compelled them all .  but dreams are not logical .   at the moment  the worst nightmare had come true  until mandelbrot put his head against derec   s helmet .  it would have looked to an observer as if the robot were kissing his cheek  his microphone touched derec   s helmet and mandelbrot spoke .      derec  i am worried about ariel .      they had been careful to conceal from mandelbrot the worst of ariel   s condition .  the robot knew only that she was sick  not that the disease was usually fatal .  the effect on his positronic brain was more than they cared to risk  the first law left no loophole for incurable diseases .      ariel is bored  as well as ill     derec said .   he looked away uneasily from the robot   s expressionless but intense face .  the stars beckoned  promising and threatening  somewhere out there  perhaps  he might recover his memory .  he remembered jeff leong  who had crashed on robot city after an accident while on his way to college .  in a few years  derec would have been thinking about college  if this fantastic thing hadn   t happened to him .      ariel is very sick     said mandelbrot .     her eating pattern has altered markedly .  she suffers from fever most of the time .  her attention span is abnormally low  she is sensitive to light  she moves about only with effort           all right     said derec  feeling that he would ossify before the robot finished its catalog if he didn   t interrupt .     it   s true that ariel is ill .  but i am not worried about her .      that wasn   t true  especially now that it had been brought out into the open .      you should worry .  i fear for her safety if something is not done for her .         what do you suggest we do .         you may have to use the key to perihelion .      after scouring robot city for weeks for a key to perihelion  the mysterious device that would transport them instantly off the planet  they had managed to steal dr .  avery   s ship when he had come to investigate their    interference .     on the ship they had found the key  but derec   s investigation of dr .  avery   s office had shown him where the key would probably take him .   derec said     that would take us back to robot city   with no way of escape and dr .  avery after us .  surely that   s less safe than this mild illness .      mandelbrot was silent for a moment .  then he said     that is true .  i hope you are right and that this is a mild illness .  but she has suffered many of these symptoms for many days now .  mild illnesses usually subside within this time .      the robot fell silent but did not move away .         ou might as well come back in     said wolruf  startling derec .     i do not think we can find the problem out therre .  i wish i knew more about dense energy fieldss .  .  .  .      derec turned  and at his first motion the robot released him  first turning his communicator back on .  the motion was as much an indicator of derec   s will as a command  and the second law of robotics forced the robot to comply with his desire .      right  i   m coming back     derec said  as if there had been no hiatus in their communications .   he returned reluctantly .  there was free fall within the cabin   and three times as much space as there had been under acceleration   but there were decks and bulkheads and overheads .  out here he was in his element .  it was like floating in warm salt water .  even the cumbersome suit didn   t detract from the feeling of freedom he got from letting his gaze rove out and on out  from star to ever more distant star .  all of them waiting  just beyond this red lit room .   stars beyond stars  with their waiting worlds  which now only the earth settlers were opening up .  and beyond  other intelligent races  other adventures .  .  .  . a member of one of those races waited now in the ship .  derec had again a moment of intense wonder that he of all people should be among the first to meet aliens .  most of those who had met the pirate aranimas hadn   t survived .  .  .  .   who knew what other beings awaited them among all those bright stars .  he wondered why the spacers had sat for so many centuries on their fifty worlds  too satisfied to go looking for adventure .  the way he felt now  it was impossible to believe .   derec had an impulse to jump and go tumbling head under heels across the sky  but he knew ariel would think it silly with his safety line and dangerous without .  right on both counts  he thought ruefully .  frost  why can   t i be a little kid for once .  j can   t remember ever having been one  it   s like i   ve been cheated out of all that kiddish fun .  .  .  .   there was a warm  pleasant smell in the air of the ship when they reentered .     i made toast     said ariel emptily .   she had toasted the last of the crusty bread  but hadn   t buttered it .  it was now nearly cold .  derec pretended not to notice  merely nodded and thanked her  trying to sound pleased .  popping the slices into the oven  he reheated them  and punched up his sequence for bread on the synthesizer   three loaves .  when the toast was warmed  he buttered it and shared it with wolruf .  the caninoid  like a true dog  was always ready to eat  if only a bite or two .   ariel wasn   t hungry .      i think doctorr avery hass retuned the hyperwave antenna by changing the densities of the force fieldss in the core elementss     wolruf said  exhaling crumbs .     dense force fieldss arre the only things that can stop hyperatomos .  but why change it  if not to detect something .      derec nodded uncertainly .  a dense force field was one that permeated some object  a magnet with a keeper across its poles was the classic example .  altering the density of the atomic level fields in the core elements of the antenna would change the    acceptance    of the core .      if not to detect something  like  say  aranimas   s ship or transmissions .     he asked .     it   s a consideration .  it   s not unlikely that they have crossed paths  as dr .  avery has keys to perihelion and aranimas wants them .      it might well be reassuring  then  that the hyperwave wasn   t detecting anything .  it might mean that aranimas wasn   t operating anywhere around here .      ariel  you seem sleepy     said mandelbrot .     it approaches your usual bedtime .  perhaps you should go to bed .         yes  good idea     said ariel vaguely .  she continued to sit and stare vacantly for another fifteen minutes before sighing deeply and getting slowly    up    .   when she had gone to the one private cabin the little ship boasted  wolruf turned fiercely on derec .      she iss sick .     ou must do something  derec .  the robot iss worried .  i am worried .      mandelbrot had accompanied ariel into the cabin .  derec lowered his voice  nevertheless .     you   re right .  don   t let mandelbrot know how far advanced her condition is  it might destroy his brain .      wolruf caught his breath .     she will die .  iss that what you mean .      derec nodded  haggard .     she told me her disease is usually fatal .  i i   d been hoping that it wouldn   t be .  but since we   ve been sitting here  doing nothing .  .  .  .         i think some iss boredom .  but mosst is sickness .      derec nodded .  the cabin door opened and mandelbrot emerged  closed it gently  and moved purposefully toward them  fingers against the overhead  toes against the deck .      ariel must have medical attention     he said bluntly when he was close  speaking as circumspectly as derec and wolruf had done .     the first law demands it .  i fear for her life if this trend continues  derec .      they looked at him and he saw it coming .      you must use the key to perihelion .      wolruf nodded her agreement .   derec felt sick at the thought of returning to robot city  even aside from the thought of dr .  avery .     that would leave you here with no spacesuit and only mandelbrot able to go outside           iss no matter .     ou musst not rissk ariel   ss life .         it is a first law imperative .     mandelbrot could not conceive that a human could resist that imperative  any more than he himself could .      very well .  as soon as she has awakened and eaten .  tomorrow  in other words .  and i hope dr .  avery isn   t at home .        the thing that alarmed derec most next morning was that ariel didn   t resist .  a tart tongued young woman  had she been in her normal condition she   d have frosted them well .  as it was  there was a spark of eagerness in her eye  not so much  derec thought  hope that the robotic human medical team on robot city might have found a cure  as relief from boredom .   it was no small risk they were taking .  dr .  avery was brilliant  a genius  but undoubtedly insane   megalomaniacal .  humans were but robots to him  to be used as he wished .   derec looked at ariel .   frost  he thought  i hope we make it .  she had come to mean a lot to him .  how much  he hadn   t been free to say .  she did  after all  have this disease .  it was not readily contagious  and in fact derec had learned that it was sexually transmitted .  additionally  she remembered him from before his memory began .   apparently there had once been some kind of strong emotion between them  and she was torn two ways by the memory  or by the contrast between his present innocent state and what had once been between them .  she had told him frustratingly little about himself  though he thought she knew much .   none of her secretiveness mattered .  she was ariel  and he would rather be sick himself than see her suffer so .   nevertheless  going back to robot city was a wrench when they   d come so near to escaping .      we might as well get it over with     said ariel .  he thought she sounded better than she had for days .  possibly being chased halfway across robot city would be good for her .   mandelbrot handed derec the key .  it was rectangular and flat  small enough to hold in a hand  but larger than any mechanical key .  it glittered in the light  looking more like silver than aluminum .  it was in fact a highly conductive alloy permeated with a force field .  that made it more reflective than any unenergized metal  and was suggestive of hyperatomics .   derec put an arm around ariel for stability and pressed the key into her palm  gripping her hand from below .  as both of them gripped the key  he pressed each corner in turn .  derec considered that the keys had a nonhuman source  though the robots on robot city had learned to make them .  humans wouldn   t design a control system like that .   when the fourth corner was pressed  a button rose from the smooth  seamless surface .  derec took a final glance around  nodded farewell to the caninoid and the robot  and to the ship itself .  there wasn   t time for lengthy speeches  the button would soon recede .   he pressed the button .   the ship disappeared from around them  and fog took its place .     perihelion .   the word meant the point in an orbit closest to a sunmore accurately  the sun  the sun of old earth .  but now the term was synonymous with periastron .  perihelion had been described to them as the place closest to every place else in the universe .   they retained their floating attitudes  still in free fall  and looked around .  perihelion hadn   t changed .  all around them was a soft gray light  and air  air that smelled fuggy and dusty .  no purifiers here  thought derec  twisting to look around .  it seemed that perihelion went on forever  but he suspected that it had sharp limits to its size .      what are you looking for .     ariel asked  sounding as if she cared again .      the hyperatomic motors .         the what .         the jump motors .  this key couldn   t have brought us here by itself  not if the robots could duplicate it .  it has to be tuned to motors elsewhere  i think it   s just a tiny hyperwave radio .  i don   t know if we   re in hyperspace or if this is a place in normal space   a big balloon  the size of a planet  perhaps .         you mean  somebody made it .     ariel asked  aghast .      it   s obviously an alien transport station   maybe for moving really heavy freight     said derec .     it may be one of many .  i wonder if it   s abandoned  or if it   s actually in use but is so big we don   t see the others and they don   t see us .         the light comes from all sides     ariel said  thoughtfully .      yes     said derec  also thoughtful .     i hadn   t thought of that .  well  much remains mysterious .  it would take a small ship to explore this place .      in any case  they could do nothing now .      we might as well get on with it     said ariel  bored once the first interest had worn off .  she made a face at the thought of robot city  but derec was heartened .  she hadn   t had that much spirit last night .   derec repeated the keying motions and pressed the button .  gravity slapped their feet and light slapped their eyes .  they looked around in shock .  walls surrounded them   obviously the walls of an apartment .  but this wasn   t an apartment designed by avery robots .  they weren   t on robot city .   they had no idea where they were .     chapter    webster groves    the apartment was small  cramped  mean .  it had not been lived in   there were no human touches  no pictures of relatives  no flowers or personalized decorations .  it was very clean  but the flooring looked worn   no carpets   and the door handles looked dulled from use .  a silly looking robot stood against one wall .   this room was perhaps three meters by five and had a chair and a small couch that might seat two   three if they didn   t mind contact .  there was a curious blank space against one wall  a control panel was near one closed door .  an open door led into what seemed to be a bedroom .  a third door was closed and smaller than the others .   in the bedroom  derec saw when he took a step  was another closed door .  it was side by side with the closed door in this room  and he judged that they were both closets .  also in that wall  in both rooms  were drawer pulls   drawers built into the wall .  a faint mechanical hum permeated the apartment .   and that was it .      just two rooms     he said in disbelief .      no bathroom .     said ariel .      no .  and no kitchen or dining room .      they looked at each other .  the only thing derec could think of was a prison  but that wasn   t right  there   d be a bathroom  at least .  and this was too small and sterile for a prison  anyway .      i wonder if that robot is functional     said ariel  frowning at it .   it didn   t look functional .  it had a rigid  silly grin on a plastic face  unlike any robot derec had seen or heard of .  now that he looked at it critically  its joints and the associated drive mechanisms looked large and clumsy .  his training in robotics had dealt primarily with the brains  but the bodies  too  had been covered .  it seemed to be looking at them  but it hadn   t moved  of course .      robot  are you functional .     derec asked .      yes  master     it said obsequiously  not moving  that fatuous grin never altering .   robots should not have phoney human faces  derec thought in irritation  one kept wanting to respond  but there was no emotion there to respond to .      what is your name .         my name is r .  david  master .      ariel looked questioningly at him .  derec shook his head .  robots often had human names  if they attended humans .  ariel had told him that as a child she had named her nurse robot guggles  though her parents had named the robot katherine .  nowhere  though  had he heard of a robot with a prefix to its name .  r .  david .  or had he heard     r .  david  what planet is this .     ariel asked .      this is earth  miss avery     the robot said respectfully .   startled   staggered  in fact   they looked at each other .   of course .  the rooms were so small  so cramped and mean  because earth was immensely overpopulated .  it had more people than all fifty spacer worlds put together .  the robot was crude because earthmen were backward in robotics and in fact had a strong prejudice against them .   as strong as their prejudice against spacers .      we might have been better off back on robot city     derec said .      maybe we can get back to civilization from here     ariel said .      good thinking .  r .  david  is it possible to take ship from earth to the spacer worlds .         yes  mr .  avery .  ships leave earth at least weekly  and often more frequently .      mr .  avery .  and he had called ariel    miss avery .     they glanced at each other and with one accord decided not to mention it .   it seemed obvious to derec that this robot was accustomed to seeing dr .  avery come and go in the instantaneous fashion possible only to key wielders .  it had accepted that    avery    could come and go in such fashion .  seeing them arrive in the same way  it came to the logical but wrong conclusion that they were    averys     though they were obviously not    or .  avery .         the first thing to do  then  is to get to the spaceport     derec said .     does that door lead to the outside .         one moment  mr .  avery  if you please .  it would not be wise for you to venture forth without preparation .         what sort of preparation .     derec asked .  the robot was right  this was earth .      first  you will need a complete prophylactic regimen against the diseases of earth .  these are many and varied  and you have no natural immunity .      frost  that was so .  they looked at each other in alarm .      however  the problem is not so great as most spacers believe .      the robot stirred  opened a drawer in the wall and produced hypoguns  vials  pills .  grimacing  but needing no urging  they submitted themselves to their use .      take the pills when next you drink .  if at any time you have any physical sensations of illness  you must notify me at once .  it will be necessary to diagnose you immediately for treatment .       derec and ariel nodded solemnly  more than a little nervous at the thought of earthly diseases .      you will also need identification  ration slips and tags  and money     said r .  david decisively when that was done .  moving clumsily  it opened the door to the closet in the sitting room .  it was jammed with things  from a bookviewer and boxes of records to compact duplication devices .  derec recognized these as spacer made  and surmised that it would be no great feat to duplicate earthly id symbols .   in this he was correct .  r .  david lowered the blank thing on the wall   a folding table   and spent an hour or so producing numerous bits of plastic and metal bearing their pictures  long numbers  various obscure statements about them  and of course a complete id workup  including fingerprints  footprints  retinal scans  corneal images  ear pictures  and blood analysis .      dr .  avery procured comparatively large sums of earthly money when he first landed     r .  david explained .     he traded rare metals for it .  of course  money as such is of little value on earth  as it can only be used to purchase nonessentials such as book recordings .  food  housing  clothing  and so on  are rationed .         frost     said ariel nervously .     i wouldn   t want some poor earther to starve because i got his rations .         there is no danger of that  miss avery .  there is ample margin .  it does no harm to anyone to provide you with earthly id  as dr .  avery has more than paid for the consumption of earth   s scarce resources with his rare metals .  rationed items are available in amounts and qualities controlled by the individual   s rating .         rating .         one   s position in earthly society .  i understand that things are not greatly different in any human society  but on earth such things have been formalized to a much higher degree .         it   s true that in the spacer worlds the most important people usually get the best of what   s going     said ariel wryly .     maybe earth is actually more honest in admitting this .  what kind of government does earth have .  is it democratic  aristocratic  or what .  do the higher ratings run everything .         in answer to your last question  yes  to a degree .  earth is a democratic syndicalism  with elections to parliament made from location   in the lower house   and from industry to the upper house  or senate .  elections are democratic in those areas  but most of the administration is by appointed officials  these being people who have passed certain tests and worked their way up from less important offices .  syndicalism means that industry   primarily the feeding  housing  and clothing of the population   dominates the government .         i can see how that would be necessary     said derec  watching the robot   s big  clumsy hands proceed delicately at their task .     how many ratings are there  and what   s the highest .         currently there are twenty one ratings .  the rating a is usually considered the highest .  it is rarely bestowed .  only ten million humans are in this rating category .      one out of ten  derec thought automatically .  then he caught himself .  no  on aurora  or most of the spacer worlds  ten million would be ten percent of the populace .  but earth had     what   s the population of earth  r .  david .     ariel asked  having paralleled derec   s thought .      eight billion  miss avery .      eight billion .  they looked at each other .  the population of eighty spacer worlds   and there were only fifty .      who is in the a rating .  government officials .         no  this rating is reserved for entrepreneurs who solve large problems  for inventors  heroic spacemen  and other adventurers .  it may be conferred by popular acclaim  as in the case of certain beloved entertainers .  recipients of the a rating have many privileges  among them the right to adorn their doors with laurel .      a high honor  like the medal of aurora .  derec nodded  the details   what was laurel .    didn   t matter .      what   s the next lowest rating .         b rating is reserved for planetary and continental governmental officials  both elected and appointed .  c refers to city officials .  d is for industry officials .  from there it becomes complex and not obvious .  there are fifteen steps in each rating  the lowest being step one .         so  what rate and step are you preparing for us .         i am preparing identification for t ratings  as i did for dr .  avery  as i assume you will wish to remain anonymous as spacers .  it will certainly facilitate your investigations of earthly society if you pass unremarked  and the t rating is the best for that purpose .         what kind of people normally are assigned t ratings .     ariel asked .      the    t    stands for    transient .     any person whose duties require him or her to travel may be assigned this rating  unless the rating itself allows of that eventuality  as do b ratings and many a ratings .  salesmen  for instance  may be rated d or t but usually t as d is assigned to administrative duties .      in your cases     r .  david continued     i had considered assigning you s ratings   students   but i judged it not advisable  as students have certain restrictions  and i would be forced to specify a school .      interesting as all this was  derec found the hour it took to prepare the id dragging .  the tiny roomed apartment  with only two rooms  was a prison more confining than any he had viewed in historical novels .  even the dungeons of the ancient times on earth had seemed larger .  the varying mechanical drone seemed to grow louder and louder until he was forced to speak  whereupon it faded at once to its actual low level .   it was the sound  he thought in some awe  of the city   a sound no earthman could avoid  from birth to death .  for they never went outside their cities .   finally  the id was completed  and r .  david explained the uses of the various pieces .     this is your ration tag for food  your home kitchen is   g .  personals are also assigned  but you may use any you see .  derec  take care not to speak to or look at anyone in personal  there is a strong taboo for men on earth .  ariel  women have no such taboo  you may speak in personal .  your ratings do not grant you stall privileges .  you must supply your own combs  brushes  and shaving equipment .      r .  david droned on  provided them with a map of the local area .  there was an attempt to put everything on the same level  they learned .  their quarters were low status  and so they had to go up or down to personals and commissary .   at length the robot gave them hats and let them go  obviously worried .  ariel opened the door and stepped out  derec following .   the same oyster white walls as the interior  they might have been in a very cheap hotel  and in fact  derec surmised  they were .  a youth with long  elaborately coiffed hair and gaudy cheap clothes gave them a sullen look from down the corridor as he entered an apartment .  an older woman  heavy and squarish and short  passed them  carrying an open bottle and exhaling the odor of mousey beer .  she did not so much not look at them as not see them .   turning to the right  derec led them toward a gleam of brighter light .  behind them  two men exited from an apartment  talking casually together about a sports event  oddly called    boxing .     moments later  derec and ariel were at the junction .   a wider  busier corridor crossed theirs at right angles .  ariel pointed out the sign that told them that theirs was sub corridor    .  they had just entered corridor m .  turning left  they followed a small crowd  which quickly resolved itself into an accidental grouping .  there must have been fifty people in view at any given moment  derec estimated  and was slightly staggered .   abruptly  on the right the wall became transparent and they looked into an open space in which children raced about and bounced balls .  a playground .  the inside of the wall had crude bits of childish art affixed to it  posters boasted of obscure triumphs  and    recitations    were advertised .  it was strange  yet derec found it familiar .  sometime in his forgotten past he had played in such a playground  though nothing specific came through .   one thing  though  he missed  the gleam of attentive robots along the wall and amid the yelling mobs .   corridor m terminated at a large circular junction .  in the angles  four escalator strips spiraled   two up and two down .  beyond  according to the signs  was another subsection  theirs was sub section g .   perhaps a hundred men  women  and children were visible  derec thought .  he and ariel  awed  slowed their pace and drifted to one side of the center of the junction  avoiding both the mouths of the corridors and the escalators .  a hundred   and not the same hundred .  moment by moment  people filtered in and filtered out  up or down  away along the corridors  or in from either direction .   derec supposed wildly that within  en minutes a person might see   oh   five hundred people .  frost .  maybe a thousand .   and now that the playground had alerted him  he noted that none of them were robots .   there were small tables with uncomfortable looking benches before them  at which people sat  some playing chess .  other benches without tables  equally uncomfortable in appearance  harbored other people .  not far from them an old fellow like a wrinkled apple smiled cherubically at everything he saw  beside him on the bench was an uncapped bottle wrapped in brown paper up to the neck .  others who sat about were also old .  some played chess or other board games at the tables  some snacked on various foodstuffs .   the walls under the escalators had identifying marks high up  but lower down there were large boards with papers affixed to them  announcing various events .  below that still were wide strips running from escalator to corridor mouth  on which crude  vigorous murals had been painted .  at one corner an earnest group of youths  younger than ariel or derec  were touching the mural lightly with flat applique boards  painting a new mural over the old .  watching them was a young woman all in blue .  she looked short  square  sturdy  and wore an odd cap with a bill of translucent blue that threw a blue shadow over her face  above the bill was a golden medal .   she turned and they saw that she had the label c   on her upper left chest  and a tool of some sort dangling from her left side  it was half a meter long and had a sturdy grip .  c ratings were city functionaries  derec remembered .  then he realized that the tool was a neuronic whip .  no  it was far too big and heavy  the neuronic whip might be in that buttoned shut pouch in front .  the tool had to be a club .   a policewoman .  her eye took them in  paused  went on  and she crossed to speak to one of the old parties at a table .  derec stared in fascination .  he had never  to his knowledge  laid eyes on one whose duty was to apply force to other human beings .      standing here as we are  we stand out  she   s probably trained to notice people who act oddly     ariel said in a low voice .   derec agreed wordlessly  started toward the down escalator  reflecting that no one could understand them from a little distance if they spoke normally  so great was the noise of people and the murmur of the escalators .   each escalator flattened out where it met the floor  and there was a three meter strip of level surface .  ahead of them  earthmen strode forward and stepped on without breaking stride  then turned about to face their direction of travel .  derec and ariel tried to imitate that confident stride .  at least the example taught them to enter against the direction of travel  a thing derec wouldn   t have guessed .  they stepped on with only a slight flexing of the legs and a quick shuffle to retain balance .  they turned around and looked down  just as the strip dived down behind the wall .   the escalator  they saw  was not actually a stairway  as they had expected  it was a flat  moving ramp .  overhead was a sloping ceiling from which came the muted rumble of drives  one of the other strips  derec supposed  probably an up strip .  the down escalator did a complete half circle clockwise  then the wall to their right opened and they were on the other side of the junction at the next level down .   one more half circle  another junction  then there came a full circle with no exit  and they were at the bottom .  the murmur became thunderous .  the escalator dived into a slit in the floor  and  derec presumed  ran    underground    for a few meters  only to reverse itself and climb backward  out of the floor and up .  there were only two strips  not four  each going both up and down simultaneously .   two dozen people got off below them  then they got off  and fifty more followed them  dispersing briskly in all directions  fighting through hundreds of people going eight different ways .  this junction was four times as busy as the ones they   d seen above .  derec and ariel tried not to gape .   light and noise came through the arches that replaced the corridor mouths above  and they saw people whirling past .  if before they   d seen hundreds  now they saw thousands .   derec swallowed a small knot of fear .  so many people .  he got the distinct impression he   d never seen that many people together before .  he realized he was making quick calculations of how much air they were using  and  more importantly  how much was left for him .  no  he thought  if there   s enough for eight billio  there   s enough for me .   to right and left  moving strips hurtled past  faster and faster and higher and higher as they got farther from the junction .  high overhead were glowing  crawling signs like worms of light  the largest saying webster groves .  before and behind them  the other two arches opened on the non moving space between the strips .  it was dotted with kiosks   some being communications booths  some being the heads of strips that came up from below .  far away down the concourse was another wide tube coming down from the ceiling  with its four escalators .  behind  at the limits of sight  was another .   they drifted out  read the signs  awed .  people swarmed about them  the noise was continuous and not so loud as it seemed  the air was warm and humid and thick with the odor of thousands  hundreds of thousands  of people .      so this is earth .        chapter    there   s no place like home kitchen    hesitantly  derec led the way to the expressway that ran west  as it proclaimed .  the lightworrns overhead proclaimed kirkwood exits next .   they mounted the first strip .  it was traveling at about half walking speed  and each succeeding strip was that much faster than the previous .  a fat old man skipped nimbly across three strips in a practiced motion that would have sent derec tumbling .  sedately  he and ariel crossed three strips  then she gasped and gripped his arm .   hurriedly they recrossed the strips  going down  and were carried only a little way past their destination .  they had gotten nowhere near the fast lanes of the express .   once between the ways again they were a little puzzled  but there was a kiosk not far away  from which people emerged .  entering it  they found strips to carry them down to a cross corridor that would take them under the ways .  they surfaced on the other side of the express strips  where there was a set of localways  rode the second slowest strip back for a short distance and got off  to dive into a huge corridor .   it was lined with shops of various kinds  but they didn   t stop to look .  thousands of people were peering through the transparent walls at bright displays of goods .   at the second cross corridor was the symbol for the personal .  it wasn   t the one to which they were assigned  they must have passed that within minutes after leaving the apartment .  at ariel   s questioning look  derec nodded  but he felt a qualm though he walked firmly toward the door to the men   s personal .  for the first time  they were separated .   don   t look at or speak to anyone  r .  david had said .  he pushed open the door and found himself in an anteroom .  no one lingered there  so he also passed on  through a door ingeniously arranged not to be in line of sight of the first .  inside he saw a series of small hallways lined with blank doors  about half with red lights glowing .  some of these little cubicles were four times as large as others  and as a man exited one he glimpsed such felicities as laundry facilities .  the stalls  he supposed  to which he had no access .   the tiny cubicle his keyed plastic strip got him into had a crude john  a metal mirror  and below it a wash basin .  there was no towel  merely a device to blow hot  dry air .  the showers were at the other end .   he felt better when he left .  after a lengthy wait  ariel reappeared  looking radiant .   derec stared .  certainly she was looking better than she had in days on shipboard .  he had a wild hope that she was not really sick after all  or that she had experienced one of those mysterious remissions that still baffled doctors .  then he realized that he was letting his wishes rule his reason  and cursed himself for setting himself up for a reaction .      shall we go .     she asked  smiling and taking his arm .   it was not far to the section kitchen to which they were assigned .  as t  s they could go to any kitchen they happened to be near  but that would entail accounting difficulties for the staff of the kitchen  and might draw attention to them .   three lines of people formed up at the door  right  left  and center .  they joined one of the lines  readying their metal ration tags .  ahead of them the earthers   talking and laughing uninhibitedly  as was their wont   filtered forward  inserting their tags into slots and after a moment recovering them and striding into noisy confusion  removing their hats .  there was a strong  pleasant odor of unfamiliar food .      hey  charlie .     came a raucous cry from behind them  making them jump a little .  someone in the line behind them had recognized someone in the next line .     back from yeast town  hey .      charlie answered incomprehensibly  something about being good to be back .     right .     bellowed the man behind them .     no kitchen like home kitchen  eh .      considering that they all must serve food from the same source  derec thought  that must just be familiarity  not the food .  come to think of it  if everybody ate in such kitchens three times a day  they   d soon get to know their neighbors at the nearby tables .   they moved forward  derec   s tag slippery in his hand .  with nothing better to do  he counted the people passing through the entry .  each line filtered diners through at about one per second .  sixty per minute .  at least a hundred and eighty per minute for the three lines .  frost .  he thought .  and we   ve been in line for five minutes .   it got worse  something like eighteen hundred people must have entered in the ten minutes it took them to work their way to the entry .  a turnstile barred their way .  derec boldly thrust his tag into the slot of the machine .  it blinked at him  non positronic computer  he thought   lit up with the legend table j   no free choice  and ejected the tag .  derec took it and found that the turnstile gave under pressure from his knee .  ariel followed in a moment  but there was no time to breathe easily .   beyond stretched an enormous room .   the whole city was one gigantic steel and concrete cavern  and this was the largest opening in it that they had seen  except for the slash of the moving ways .  it went on  it seemed  forever .  from the ceiling  which glowed coolly  descended pillars in an orderly array  short sections of transparent wall  apparently to minimize noise  and columns apparently full of tubes and cables .  between them stretched the tables   kilometers of tables  in ranks and files .  all was confusion  and the earthers were swarming past them while they stood gaping  the gleam of light on polished imitation wood  the clatter of plastic flatware on plastic plates  the babble of thousands of voices  the crying of children .  behind manual windows to their right and left  men and women dealt with those whose feeding could not be automated .   overhead  light signs indicated the rows  and at ariel   s nudge derec started the long trudge to row j .   because of his spacer conditioning  he had been thinking of this kitchen as a spacer restaurant  with maybe a dozen tables  most for four people  some for two  a few for eight or ten .  but these tables each seated   he guessed fifty on each side .  even after they reached row j  table   was a long way away .   hesitantly  they approached it   at least it was plainly marked   and found two seats together .  the people they passed were grumbling because choice was suspended .     too many transients     growled someone  and they felt guilty .      food is probably one of the few high spots of their days     ariel whispered .   they took their seats and looked at the raised section of the table before them .   no free choice glowed to the right .  on the left was a panel that said  chicken   sundays  opt .  mon .  fish   fridays .  opt .  sat .  on earth  there was a seven day week  but derec had no idea which day was which .  there being no choice  he shrugged  glanced at ariel  and pressed the contact .  the panel immediately lit with  zymosteak  rare  med .  .  well d .  not sunday or friday  he thought .  derec chose well done and the sign vanished  replaced with salad  tonantzin  calais  del fuego  peppertom .   ariel shrugged  glancing at him  and they chose  suppressing smiles  neither had heard of any of these dressings .   order placed .  that sign stared at them for several minutes .  the earthmen around them were a scruffy lot  and derec realized that he had been subliminally aware of that for some time .  earthers were short  and tended to be plain  if not actually homely .  here and there a handsome man or a beautiful woman attracted admiring glances  but they were a minority .   at least earth people weren   t starving  as derec had expected .  he knew vaguely that it took a major effort on the part of the population and its robots   restricted to the countryside   to feed earth .  standard food synthesizers were too expensive  and used much too much energy for earth to afford .  but a large minority of these people were fat  and many more were plump .   at this table they waited patiently  not talking or laughing as at other tables .      probably a table for transients who don   t know each other     ariel said  low toned .  there were only a couple of quiet conversations at the table .   presently  the food ended their embarrassment  a disk slid aside in front of each of them and another rose into position  the second one holding a covered server of plastic .  when they removed the servers from the service disks  the latter closed smoothly .   the food looked like steak  baked potato with shrimp sauce  and a salad with dressing on the side .  crusty  faintly yellow bread .  it smelled marvelous and  to derec   s amazement  it was natural .  his first bite confirmed that  the rich  subtle  varied flavor of real food was unmistakable .  and yet it wasn   t real food  either .  zymosteak .  it was plain these people normally got meat only twice a week  with a chance at it on two more days .  four days out of seven .      i can   t believe it   s so good     ariel said under the cover of the clatter of earthers opening their servers .   derec hadn   t realized he was so hungry  it hadn   t been that long since breakfast .  perhaps he   d gotten so bored with synthetic food that he   d been eating less and less .   he turned his attention to another problem .  they had been served with amazing rapidity .  he couldn   t remember service on any spacer world  but he was sure it wasn   t this fast .  there had to be automation behind the scenes .  of course  with no free choice  they had merely to drop the chosen kind of dressing into the server  clamp the lid down  and pop it into an oven for the few seconds required to cook the zymosteak to the desired degree .  probably ran it through the oven on a belt .  with a good oven  there could have been ice cream on the same plate and it wouldn   t have melted before the meat was done .   even so  row j was the last  ten rows of ten tables each  a hundred tables  each seating a hundred .  this commissary was equipped to feed ten thousand people .  derec mentioned as much to ariel  who was as dumbfounded as he .  it wasn   t at capacity now  perhaps there were only six thousand people in the room .   on aurora  a sports arena that seated ten thousand was a big one .   halfway through the meal  derec found his breath coming fast  it was too much .  he felt trapped in this concrete cavern  felt that the spacious room was closing in  the ceiling  not low but not high  was the lid of a trap  the mobs of unconscious people around him weren   t real .  they probably went all their lives without seeing the sun or open air  he thought  and that made it worse .  with difficulty  he fought off the panic  panting .   when they had finished their meals  they put the servers and flatware back on the disk and pressed the same contact again  as they   d seen their neighbors do  and watched them vanish .  the exit was on the opposite side .  once outside  an elaborate turnstile permitted exit only   derec breathed more freely .  they were a little at a loss  this not being the way they   d come in  but the sound of the ways was obvious  and they soon found their way back to them .      the trouble is  there   s no quiet  no private place to talk     ariel complained as they hesitated .      i know .  we want to go to the spaceport  but i don   t feel like unfolding the map here .         look .  .  .  .     ariel fell silent until a chattering cluster of pre teenage girls had passed  not even noticing them .     look  the signs indicate that it isn   t    rush hour      whatever that is   r .  david mentioned it .         right  and lowly fours like ourselves can ride the express platforms for many hours yet .      they made their way up the strips of the local  down again to the motionless strip between the locals and the express  then up again  faster and faster .  derec realized uneasily that if they were to trip and fall at these speeds they might be seriously injured .  nor was there an attentive robot to rush forward and grasp their arms if they should fall .  earthers never fell  he supposed .  they learned when very young .   on up they went  till the wind whipped their hair and stung their eyes  up and up to the top  where each platform had a windbreak at the front of it .  there they found an empty one behind a platform occupied by a man with the mad hatter   s huge hat and sat  breathing heavily .  ariel grinned at him and derec laughed back .   carefully  in the shelter of the windbreak  they unfolded the map and studied it .  they knew that they were in webster groves section  proceeding east  and quickly found the spot  just as they passed under the sign that said shrewsbury section .  but study the map how they would  they saw no sign of any spaceport .   derec looked blankly at ariel .     it   s got to be here somewhere .      a group of teenagers  mostly male  passed by two platforms away  one fleeing  the others pursuing  expertly negotiating the strips .  a whistle shrilled  over the shrilling of the wind  and a blue uniformed man waved his club and set off in pursuit of the children  who scattered down the strips .  adults scowled at them .   they studied it all over again  until the signs overhead said tower grove sector .      possibly it isn   t on the map     ariel said .     earthers are prejudiced against spacers .  they might not like to advertise the port .         if you have business there  you   re told how to find it  i suppose     said derec glumly .     we should have asked r .  david how to get there .      the expressway was not straight  and as derec looked down now  he saw that the local had spun off  another came in  made a turn  and paralleled the expressway in its place .  a storefront gave way to a palatial entry that faced the oncoming expressway obliquely  above the entry was a glowing marquee on which the back view of a woman wearing tight pants appeared .  she vanished  replaced by the slogan if i wiggle .  she reappeared  peering archly over her shoulder at the viewer  will you follow .   derec supposed that there were as many people in view as there had been in the kitchen  and the ways were not half full  maybe not a quarter full .     rush hour must be when the ways are full     he said .      yes .  if they all go to work at the same time       ariel said  and he snapped his fingers .      rush  indeed .     they looked about and tried to picture the swarming mobs going up and down the strips multiplied by three or four .   old town sector .      you know     said ariel     daneel olivaw might have sat on this very platform  or at least ridden this very way .      derec nodded .  he had no memory of ever having met the famous humaniform robot  daneel olivaw .  daneel was designed to look exactly like a man   like roj nemmenuh sarton  in fact  who had built his body .  he had helped the earthman  plainclothesman elijah baley  solve the murder of dr .  sarton  and later had gone to solaria  where he had helped baley solve another murder .   han fastolfe had built two humaniforms  the first with sarton   s help .  the intricate programming that enabled a humaniform to play the part of a human being  hampered as it was by the three laws  was a triumph of robotics that had never been recreated .  fastolfe had refused to make more than two such robots  and one had been deactivated .  daneel olivaw  he supposed  was still extant  somewhere on aurora .      look at that hat .       derec looked  then gaped .  they had seen odd hats all along  but this woman   s head was a flower garden  except that many of the    flowers    were bows .  as in all earthly hats  though  there was a prominent band for the insertion of the rating ticket that entitled them to such things as a seat during rush hour .      you know  maybe some of these people know the way to the port     ariel said .   that was a thought derec had hoped she wouldn   t have  but he nodded tightly .  frankly  he didn   t want to speak to anyone .  perhaps because they were earthers and he was a spacer   with all his prejudices intact .  it was a sore point with him that only earth was exploring and settling new planets .  it was not that he objected to earth   s doing that  he objected that the spacer worlds weren   t .  not these people   s fault  but     standing up  he leaned out and got the attention of a young man   a little older than himself  he thought   who was making his way toward an unoccupied platform .      pardon me  sir  could you direct us to the spaceport .      the other   s rather blank expression broke into one of handsome good cheer .     hey  gato  you do the spacer accent ex good .     he exclaimed .     too bad you don   t have the fabric to match  but that speech   ll get you on any subetheric for the asking .      derec concealed his confusion  lifted an eyebrow .     yes .         oh  ex  ex  that haughty look   s the highest .     the other glanced around  lost his cheer  and said quietly     but  look  this   s fun and all  but i wouldn   t try that speech in yeast town  savvy .     and with that  he was gone .   they looked at each other and shook their heads  dumbfounded .      do you think you could ape that   that speech of his .     derec asked .  ariel shook her head again .   they were in a much more exalted district than webster groves  this old town sector looked spanking new  with neat  clean  shiny buildings and prosperous looking shops .  places of entertainment seemed more common and more lavish  as if the people who lived here had more leisure and more ration points  or money  or whichever it took  for entertainment .      what did he mean     subetherics     .      derec thought a moment .     hyperwave broadcasts  i think .  i   m not up on that technology  but i think at one time hyperwave transmission was called that .  probably cheaper than piping cables through all these man made caves .      derec   s voice thinned as he glanced up to where the sun should be but wasn   t .  steadying his voice  he added     i think he meant we could be entertainment stars pretending to be spacers for earther novels .       they grinned at each other .   east st .  louis sector .      what does the    st    mean .     neither knew .      derec  we   re getting a long way from .  .  . home kitchen .  maybe we should turn around and go back .      derec wasn   t happy about that either  but was reluctant to give up .      maybe one more try     he said .   he looked around for someone to ask  and was struck by the buildings in this new sector .  they seemed industrial  blank fronts  a minimum of signs  a lot of which didn   t even glow .  all the color and gaiety seemed to have gone out of the city .  half the people on the ways had left in old town sector  and no wonder .   those who remained were far less prepossessing .  they were poorly dressed and few wore hats  which meant  as derec had gathered  that they had no passes for platform rides .  low ratings  like he and ariel .      what   s that funny smell .     ariel asked .   derec sniffed  became aware of an odor .  not bread .     something living .  maybe the ventilators don   t work so good here .         you mean we   re smelling people .      derec felt a little sick himself at the thought .      pardon me  sir  could you direct me to the spaceport .     he asked a sullen man .      buzz off  gato .      seething  derec waited for another prospect .  a woman seized a seat on a platform with such an angry  triumphant expression that he crossed her off .  then a group of young men and women approached  four men and two women  the latter in gaudy  tight pants  the former all in brown corduroy .  derec repeated his question .   the first man looked at him sharply .     whattaya tryina pull  gato .  spaceport .  spacer speech .  whod   ya thinkya are  huh .      clamping his jaw on his anger  derec said     i merely asked           oh  you merely ahsked  didja  haughty har .  whod   ya thinkya are  i asked you  gato .         i just wanted           clamp down  haughty har  don   t go gittin    high horse with me .  keep a civil tongue  and also a polite face  hear .      seething  derec fought for control .  and another earther spoke .  he had a warm  dark brown complexion and the eyes of a hawk  racial types had remained more distinct on earth than on the spacer worlds .      hey  jake  i think he   s rilly a spacer .  both of    em .  lookit those ex fabrics .      he and ariel were wearing plain shipsuits of synthetic fabric  a quiet  glossy substance in different shades of gray  hers lighter than his .  nobody had remarked on their clothes before  but nobody had looked closely at them .   jake stared in amazed disbelief .     naw .         yeah  jake     one of the women shrilled  looking closely at ariel .     and look at    em  both of    em   tall and handsome  like .  spacers .         spacers .     said jake in almost reverent tones .  his eyes sharpened .     i always wanted t   meet a spacer .  just to tell   em what i think of    em .         yeah .         you think you   re so smart  doin    your little social science investigation of    earther    society  huh  spacer .     this time it sounded like a spit .   derec   s anger cooled in apprehension  ariel had unobtrusively taken his arm .     thanks for your help  but we   ve got to be going .      again his accent aroused their ire .   they all began to jabber hostilely as he and ariel stepped to one side  were struck by the wind  and fell behind on their slower strip .      stop .  we ain   t done talkin    atya .     cried jake  and the earthers swarmed off the platform level and started down .   ariel gasped and derec realized that they would soon be below them  on the slower strips  between them and the locals .      back up .     derec said tensely  and in a moment they were squeezing between platforms .  their persecutors caught the change of direction instantly and were in full cry .   he hurried ariel rapidly down the strips on the inside  their enemies gaining rapidly with a lifetime   s expertise .  at the motionless median between expressways  he looked around wildly .  there was no possibility of their climbing the reverse ways and staying ahead .      in here .     said ariel  and they dived into a kiosk and ran down the strip  not waiting for it to carry them .  they ran under the ways  hearing voices crying    spacer .  spacer .     behind them .   at the other end  they had a choice of a moving strip that would take them up beside the expressway  or a maze of corridors at this level  poorly lit  poorly cleaned  sparsely populated  and thick with nameless organic odors .   there was quite a mob behind them  by the sound .  panting  they ran into the first corridor  took the first branching  then the next .  they paused  listening .  a derelict lay on a low platform beside a wide freight door  scruffy and unshaven .  st .  louis yeast  plant     said the door .   derec had a sudden flashing memory of having viewed a novel set on earth in the medieval days  when a derelict like this turned out to be a crusty  cheerful  picaresque  heart of gold character who saved the day for the hero and became his closest buddy .   this one had more the attitude of a rat .  rousing himself with surprising energy  he listened  rubbed his graying whiskers  and  growling something about    stirring up the damn yeast farmers     he dived into a small door beside the freight door  and slammed it .  they heard it lock .   voices and footfalls approached .  they looked around .  there were no tiny crannies to escape into  nothing but corridors wide enough for trucks to be driven through .  eventually they   d be run down wherever they went  however fast they ran .  and their enemies no longer merely wanted to talk to derec and ariel .  they had something much more direct in mind .     chapter    escape .     ariel heard them coming .  heart pounding  she looked around again .  no place to run to  no place to hide .  after a blank moment derec took the key to perihelion out of his pocket  ariel gasped   put it in her palm  squeezed the four corners in succession  and closed both their hands around it fiercely .  ariel pushed the button as they held their breath .   the gray nothingness of perihelion was around them  forever and ever to the limits of vision .   derec let his breath out .     frost .  i thought they had us .         so did i .      they were in no hurry to return to earth  yet there was surely no more boring place in hyperspace or normal space  whichever it was  than perihelion .  they looked at each other  and ariel shrugged  as derec wiped his brow .      oh  no .      they had moved at the same time  and  releasing each other  had drifted apart .  with great presence of mind  derec lunged for her .  ariel was frozen in shock  had she reached for him at the same time  she could have caught his hand .  too late .   they looked at each other tragically .  inexorably  they drifted further apart .   ariel felt she had to make up for it .     i   ll throw you the key .     she cried .     you go back to earth   forget about me .         nonsense .  if you do  i   ll throw it back        at that moment his face went blank and he contorted himself into a knot  reaching for his soft shoes  he tore them off .  writhing with a practiced free fall motion  he turned his back to her and hurled the first shoe away .  with the reaction to that throw  he ceased to recede .  now he was rotating .  he allowed himself to rotate twice  studying her  then writhed again  and threw the other shoe .   after a prolonged wait they seized each other  ariel gasping in relief .  to her surprise  she felt him shaking .      derec  you were marvelous .  i thought we were lost .      derec grinned shakily .     what you said about throwing the key gave me the idea .         frost  i   m glad something did .     ariel took the key and pressed the corners again  and  with both gripping it  pushed the button .   r .  david was against the wall in his usual place .      frost     ariel said  feeling ready to collapse .  she sat down  knees shaking  and so did derec .      what did they mean     your little social study of conditions on earth      the yeast farmers .     derec asked .   ariel had no idea .  they put the question to r .  david  careful not to let him know that they had been in serious danger .   he said     i have no access to news feed  but i believe that dr .  avery made some public announcement about studying social conditions on earth when he first contacted earthly authorities to transfer rare metals for money .  he promised not to send in humaniform robots  and of course it did not occur to the authorities that he would enter earthly society himself .          then how did he expect to make any study of earth society .     ariel asked  skeptical .      he purchased many earthly studies of the subject  and also me .  while ostensibly studying these sources  he quietly developed the medical prophylaxis with which i treated you  and infiltrated earth society in his own person  learning what kinds of identification and ration media he would need to have to pretend to be an earthman .  some of those he bought openly as samples for his study .  in short  over a period of an earthly year he was occasionally in the news as he came and went from earth .  and from this study he was allegedly making  i suppose that rumors may have gone abroad that teams of spacers are studying earthly sociology on the spot .  that is  of course  very unlikely .         very     said derec  with a grimace .     spacers are just not interested in the subject  and if they were  they wouldn   t take the health risk .      ariel could not care less about earth   s rumors .     the important thing is to get back into space     she said .      you   re right     derec said .     i   m more than tired of concrete caves and the troglodytes that live in them .     she smiled fleetingly at the term .     so the third thing is to find out how to get to the spaceport .  the first being to have those directions to the nearest personal repeated  and the second  to find a shoe store .      ariel grimaced  but said     you   re right .      when put to the question  r .  david said     the spaceport is located near new york  miss avery .      they looked at each other blankly .  of course they knew that there were eight hundred cities on earth .  they had been thinking in terms of one giant city covering all earth  the natural extension of their earthly experience .      what city is this  then .     ariel asked .      the city of saint louis     said r .  david .     it is on the same continent as new york  so travel is facilitated .  one may take the train  and for a third of the distance the way is enclosed and roofed over .  it takes less than twelve hours   half an earthly rotation  mr .  avery .     he had detected the question on derec   s face .   ariel had no idea what a    train    might be  and wasn   t happy about its being enclosed   she visualized something like the expressway .  she looked at derec  who looked equally unhappy .      do we have the money   the rating or whatever   to go on the train .     derec asked dubiously .   r .  david said     your travel vouchers have not been touched  but i believe there is an inadequate amount .  as fours  you do not rate much  nor do many earth people often travel between cities .         even though we are transients .         you are transients in this sector  but not necessarily in this city .         we   d better visit the personal first     said ariel tiredly .     we   ll think it over when we get back .      r .  david repeated his directions to the personals  which turned out to be in opposite directions .  rather reluctantly  they split up  and derec left with a backward glance .  ariel walked slowly toward the women   s personal  hoping derec   s stockinged feet would not be too noticeable .   since this was the personal assigned to her  ariel found a shower cubby with the same number as the one on her tag  and took a shower .  again  no towels  she saw a woman carrying a little cloth satchel into a similar cubby and presumed it contained a towel  combs  and so on .  she wouldn   t need one  as short a time as they expected to be on earth .  she had  of course  brought a comb  though she should see about getting a brush .  fortunately  her hair wasn   t long .   she made her way back to sub section g  corridor m  sub corridor     apartment     without difficulty  hardly seeing the crowds of earthers who swarmed through the passageways .   derec was back before her and full of energy .  despite their brush with the mob  he wanted to go check out the    train station .     he was careful not to say so in front of r .  david  who might think it dangerous  but she thought he wanted to see if they could devise a method of stowing away .   showing them on the map  r .  david gave them directions that would take them  by the route they had previously followed  to old town and something called the gateway arch plaza .  the station was beneath that .  they would pass several shoe stores on the way .   ariel felt distinctly nervous as they threaded their way again through the corridors to the junction and took the down ramp  but nobody paid any attention to them .  she would have liked to have changed clothes  but their shipsuits were all they had  and they weren   t all that conspicuous .  it still wasn   t rush hour  so they had the freedom of the express platforms  and went straight up to them on the eastbound side .   the clerk in the shoe store was a human  a plump  youngish woman  older than ariel .  she quirked her mouth in a half humorous fashion at derec   s socks and said     been running the strips  eh .     she produced neat  cheap shoes expeditiously  checked his ration tag in her machine  accepted the money tag  and waved them away  calling     next time be more careful of the edges .      back to the expressway .   she heard derec   s breath speed up beside her  as old town sector came rushing toward them  but they saw none of the yeast farmers from before   less than an hour ago .      i   ll walk the rest of the way before i   ll ride this thing into   yeast town     she said  leaning over to shout at derec .      yeah     he said weakly .  ariel saw that he was staring up at the high ceiling  which was higher here than in webster groves .  there was probably nothing overhead but the roof of the city  for here the ways were in a great slash through the building blocks .  no matter   he was having a claustrophobic attack .   ariel sympathized   she had had several of them herself .  at the moment it was the crowds  not the oppressive buildings  that made her own breath come short .   before she could attempt to reassure him  derec gripped her arm and pointed  gateway arch plaza exit .  they descended hastily and rode the ramp down under the ways  found a sign pointing north  and followed it to a localway  also plainly marked .   presently they entered the gateway arch plaza .   it was enormous .  gaping like rubes  they stepped out of the way of swarms of chattering earthers  and frankly stared .  the gateway arch itself was smaller  perhaps  than the pillar of the dawn on aurora that commemorated the early pioneers  and surely was less moving than the memorial at the pillar   s base  where outstanding men and women of each generation were honored .  but at a hundred ninety meters tall  the arch was no small monument .  its span was nearly equal to its height  and the roof was another ten meters above it .  it was all matte stainless steel  ancient looking but in good repair .   the room that enclosed the whole mastodonic fabrication was commensurate in size  over two hundred meters in diameter  its circular walls a cliff of concrete and metal around the arch .  this cliff was covered with the balconies of high rated apartments .   derec walked boldly toward the lower area between the feet of the arch  and ariel followed  inwardly amused at the awe on the faces of some of the earthmen   some showed unmistakable signs of agoraphobia  exposed to this much open space .   below the arch was a museum dating from pre spaceflight times  which might have been interesting  but they were looking for a train station .  quietly determined to ask no directions  they wasted half an hour  some of it in looking at exhibits .  ariel was struck by the unfinished look of the items people used in the pre industrial age  all made by crude hand methods .  derec pointed out a plaque that stated that  in the old days  citizens had ridden a sort of tramway up inside the arch     agoraphobia     he said  echoing her thought .   ariel nodded and led him briskly out of the museum .  it felt like underground to her  and the crowds of earthers swarming around were bringing on another claustrophobic attack .  she felt much more sympathetic to them and less inclined to sneer at earthly phobias .   they had to leave the plaza itself to find the route to the station  they had been following the plaza signs and hadn   t noticed the station signs when they left the localway .  the station was a level or two deeper  and a different route took them there .   there were fewer people here  but below the passenger level they found a series of freightways crisscrossing the city  which carried heavy items in bulk containers .  many men in rough clothing rode these ways in handling carts  shunting the big containers off the belts at their destinations .  these freightways all traveled at a walking pace  no more .   at the station they also found the terminus of a tube system for small capsules .  letters and small items   parcel post   could be blown about the city very rapidly by this system  and derec became quite excited by it .   he   d seen a system like this before  on a somewhat different scale .  the robot city robots had generated a tremendous vacuum as a side effect of their key manufacturing facility  and derec and ariel had ridden the vacuum tubes more than once when they were in a hurry .   but here on earth they were using the same technology not because they had a vacuum they could use  they had to create a vacuum to make it work .  in one form or another  derec knew  vacuum tubes like these had been used since the early industrial age   and earth had apparently never discarded their use  because on earth they made sense .      much more efficient than sending a car with a robot     he said .   it is if your houses are close together  ariel thought .  on the spacer worlds  they were scattered .   the station seemed to deal mostly in inter urban freight  but there was a window for passenger traffic .  they avoided it  and prowled along the cars .   the train was no moving beltway  as ariel had expected .  derec was clearly disappointed  he had expected something like the expressway .  these were cars with ridiculously tiny wheels  and after a while derec decided that they used magnetic levitation under speed .  it was a very old technique .      now i see what r .  david meant by saying that the way is largely roofed over     ariel said .      twelve hours in one of those  eh .     derec said  bleakly .   the cars had no windows .      hey .  hey  you .  you kids .      they turned  concealing their apprehension .   a rough looking stranger approached  wearing blue canvas and a peaked cap with stripes of pale gray and darker blue gray  very distinctive .  continental railroad  said the emblem on his chest .      what are you doing here .         looking at the train  sir     said derec  after a moment  trying to mimic the earth dialect .   the other did not notice that .  he closed in and examined them sharply  a beefy individual  taller than either of them and looking as if he worked out every day .      why .     he asked  irritably .      school assignment  sir     said ariel  thinking quickly .   he looked at her sharply again in her tight shipsuit  and she realized with a despairing feeling that she no longer had the figure of a schoolgirl .  but he nodded  more in appreciation of her than in agreement  and said  more reasonably      a study of the continental system  eh .  well  you   ll not learn much by prowling the yards .  read your books .  but i can show you the marshaling yard and the loading docks .  you should   ve brought visual recorders .      evidently their new acquaintance   peter  or dieter  scanlan   had little to do at the moment and was bored .  taking them briskly back the way they had come  he showed them where the cars were pulled aside  their doors opened  and men in handling machines carried forth containers of assorted cargo .      that lot is bulk cargo  mostly   wheat from kansas and points north     scanlan shouted over the constant rumble of wheels and the whine of electric motors .     now  over there    see those big blue cars .    that   s pigs of metals from the seawater refineries on the gulf  down south away .  you   ll see some manufactured goods going out  and quite a bit coming in   st .  louis mostly exports food  especially gourmet items .  not a big manufacturing city like detroit .      what ariel saw was that each of these big cars was crammed full of containers cunningly stacked to fill every corner  leaving no wasted space for even a rat to hide in .      come this way     said scanlan  and he put them on a tiny truck like a motorized platform .   its control was purely manual and ariel fought down fear as she joined the men on it .  scanlan sent it hurtling around the fringes of activity to dive into a bright tunnel  which branched  branched again  and minutes later and two kilometers away he braked to a halt at a balcony .   they looked down on the marshaling yards .      trains are made up here     he shouted   it was noisy here  too .   ariel looked  and realized why they were called    trains     each was a long series of units like link sausages .  the cars were the units .  they were being driven individually along the floor to the marked    rails    or roads painted on the floor  to the trains they were to make up .  each train was made up in a specific order .      over there to your left   passenger train for the west coast .  three cars in blue  with silver and gold trim .      it was crawling slowly on its wheels toward  she supposed  the ticket window and embarking ramp .  once in the tunnels the cars would be lifted off their wheels by the magnetic rails .   on their right was a train of a hundred cars  in various colors according to what cargo they carried .  that seemed to be the ratio of passengers to freight  except that there were more freight trains than passenger trains .      computer controlled     shouted scanlan .     there   s a driver in each car for safety  but the computer does most of the placing .  it knows where each car goes in the train .  they pick up new cars at each stop on the front end  and drop off cars from the tail .  the computer also knows which container is in each car  and what   s in each container .      down here .      scanlan started the vehicle up again  whirled them down and down  braked in a flood of light .  black water lapped ahead of them  boats bobbing on it under the low ceiling .      the mississippi     he said  hissing like a snake .     transshipment docks .      they   d seen enough  but had to submit to another half hour of education on a subject they could not   now   care less about .   they weren   t going to be using the train .     chapter    studies in sociology    derec sighed with relief when they reentered the cheerless little apartment .      i   m   tired     said ariel .     i need to rest .         sure  you go lie down     said derec  instantly concerned and quite understanding .  he was exhausted and disappointed also .  it had been a long day .   r .  david stepped forward and unnecessarily showed her how to work the dimmer in the bedroom .  it felt good to be back where robotic concern  the basis of all truly civilized societies  was available .   derec sat down  thinking of that  and felt vaguely dissatisfied .  he had always taken that statement for granted  and considered earth uncivilized  in the lofty spacer manner .  no wonder  he thought slowly  that spacers are resented on earth .  because those people seemed to get along quite well without robots .  that commissary might seem like an animal feeding trough to the overrefined sensibilities of a spacer  but was that just .  human beings could adapt to a wide variety of societies .  if earthers were adapted to a way of life that gave spacers the heebie jeebies  it did not necessarily follow that earth society was inferior .   true  earth   s cities were the end product of an artificial process  and were highly unstable .  if power supplies were interrupted for an hour  every human in the city would die of asphyxiation .  water was nearly as critical  and food almost as critical as water .  nor could the people leave the cities in case of emergency  there was no place to go  and in any case  they could not bear the open air .   that train system could not begin to evacuate them  assuming it had power when the city didn   t .   was not spacer society  though  with its dependence on robots  in its way just as artificial and dependent as earth   s .  it was a novel and alarming thought .  true  the robots could not all be simultaneously stricken by some plague  nor would all the factories shut down and not be reopened before the last robot wore out .  they were not going to be deprived of their robots and robotic care .   no  derec thought uneasily  it was a more serious problem than that .  more serious even than spacers    reliance on robots to save them from their own folly .  derec had had all he could do to keep from stopping and looking back to watch their pursuers being seized by the robots he knew must be there .  beyond that reliance  which was actually quite trivial  was the freezing of their whole society .   when a robot was unable to respond  caught between conflicting demands of the laws of robotics  it was said to be in    mental freeze out .     all of spacer society  he suspected  might be in mental freeze out  or at least in stasis .  it was the earthers  after all  who were settling the galaxy .   somberly  he thought  the only solution might be to give up robots .  or at least restrict their numbers .   in the meantime  dr .  avery had some mad scheme for spreading advanced robots all across a planet  and then  apparently  peopling it with humans .   with that thought in his mind  derec drifted off to sleep  and was not conscious of r .  david springing forward to keep him from falling off the couch .     derec dreamed .   he had swollen to enormous size  and larger  and larger .  he was a planet  and something was crawling across his stomach .  raising his head and peering at the swollen dome of his belly  he saw that it was a city .  not an earthly city  but a city of buildings separated by streets .  a city populated by robots  ever changing as buildings were built  torn down  rebuilt in different shapes .  it was robot city  and it spread around his equator .   he watched in fascination for a time  in fascination and horror   this was wrong  wrong  it was a spreading disease    and then he heard ariel   s voice .   no .  the human medical team was carrying her lifeless body sadly toward the crematorium .  he struggled to move  to cry out .  .  . but he no longer had hands  or a voice  ariel was shaking him awake  he lay in a cramped position on the couch .  r .  david hovered in concern behind her .      you were sleeping peacefully  then started struggling when you heard my voice .  sorry .         nothing     he managed .     just a nightmare .         ah .     she turned to r .  david and began to question him while derec sat on the couch  arms dangling  still badly shaken by the nightmare  telling himself it was only a dream .  only a dream .   but it gripped him  shook him as badly as the pursuit by the yeast farmers had done .  he threw it off and looked up as ariel turned to him .      i   ve been asking about news     she said in a complaining tone .     there   s no broadcast reception in this apartment  not of any kind .  frost .  no news  no entertainment   there   s only the book viewer .  not even an audio for music .         this apartment is for solitary step threes of various ratings     said r .  david soothingly .     step threes are expected to consume their entertainment at the public facilities .         it   s probably for youngsters with low paying entry level jobs  just getting away from their parents     derec said vaguely .   he looked closely at ariel .  during their excursions on the expressway she had seemed alive  vital  healthy .  now she seemed tired  petulant  lethargic .  fear gripped his heart like a fist .      i   m tired of being cooped up .  i want out .     she said .   derec had to slow his own breathing and wait till his heart stopped pounding .     so do i     he said  his tone so controlled that despite her lethargy she glanced quickly at him .   r .  david   s face was not made to express his concern .     few earth people leave their cities  but there are some with a perverse attraction for openness and isolation .  these direct the robots of the mines and farms  and man certain industrial facilities distant from the cities for safety reasons .  other earthers  wishing to become settlers  join conditioning schools that accustom them to space and openness .         settlers .     said ariel with surprise .      of course     said derec wonderingly .     we know earth people never leave their cities  we also know that they alone are settling new planets .  we should have made the connection long since .  conditioning is the only answer .         could we join one of these schools .     she asked .      it would take us outdoors     said derec uncertainly .  but as he thought about it he shook his head .     i suspect that applicants for settler worlds are investigated pretty strictly .         oh .  then   the other .      derec didn   t know .     if we could get a job on a farm  directing robots .  .  .     he turned to r .  david .     how are these workers chosen .         i am not sure of the details  but i suppose that one must apply for the job     said r .  david .   something scanlan had said occurred to derec .     food and other raw materials are brought in from the surrounding areas by truck     he said .     maybe  if we got jobs driving trucks        he didn   t care to finish the sentence  not knowing to what extent r .  david would condone violations of earth laws .  ariel caught his meaning at once however and her eyes brightened .   how long it would take to drive a distance that a train could travel in twelve hours  he didn   t know .  what kind of pursuit they could expect  he had no idea .  but nothing else seemed even remotely feasible .   r .  david told them how to find out what they needed to know  the nearest communo would give them most of the information they needed for a start .  ariel   s mood had lifted again  and again they ventured forth .   they consulted the directory at the communo  found job service  and checked farms   truck drivers .  a number of company names were listed  and derec chose the missouri farm company at random .  it immediately transmitted an application form for them  which they could fill out by answering verbally when the pointer moved from question to question .   the first question was  do you have a driver   s license .   derec sighed and canceled everything  went back to the menu  and did some exploring .      i wish there was an information robot we could call up and ask     he said  frustrated .   it turned out that many earthers who never went outside the city needed to know how to drive .  there were schools  which taught them according to the regulations   and the instructions and regulations  being government standardized  were readily available .  they only had to take a book card and go to a library  then pay to have them printed off .   another request gave them a map of the area  with you are here labeled and target  library indicated .  they compared that to their own map  and nodded .   opening the door of the communo booth made it switch back from opaque to clear  and they were given a sour look by the middle aged fellow waiting for it .      canntchee find a private place out of people   s way .     he growled  lurching past them .   derec turned red  half with anger  half with embarrassment .  ariel was equally angry and much less embarrassed .   they walked away  seething  and observed that the playground was largely deserted .  it was getting late .      i hope we   re not too late     he said .      yes .     after a moment  ariel said     i suppose earthers have a lot of trouble courting .      she had a point .  no pleasant  nearly empty gardens for them to walk in on fine days  no large rambling mansions to prowl through on wet ones .  what did they do .  derec wondered what he and ariel might have done  back in his unremembered past .   it had been the leading edge of the rush hour when they had arrived back home from the train station .  now all that was over  and the people were leaving the section kitchen in droves .  they had only eaten twice today  both times fairly early   and neither had eaten much on the ship .      frost  they   re still open     said derec .     i thought we   d go hungry all night .         so did i     said ariel .  the line moved rapidly and they were soon in  and were astonished to find that free choice had not been suspended .  they were assigned to table f   this time .  the place  with only a couple of thousand people in it  seemed deserted .   the table  when they found it  had probably been used by three or four relays of diners for the evening meal  but it was surprisingly clean and neat .  they saw earthers industriously wiping up their places prior to leaving .  others  attendants  came around with cleansing utensils that seemed almost superfluous  some sprayed the places with steam guns to sterilize them .   they were far enough from their neighbors to speak freely in low tones .     i suppose there are strong social forces to make them clean up their places     ariel said .   derec thought about it  nodded .  mere laws could not have such force .     i suppose they train their kids  clean up your places .  what   ll the neighbors think .         the forces for conformity to social norms must be tremendous     she said .     it   s not necessarily a bad thing .         it makes their whole civilization possible .  and are we that different .     he asked .   ariel shook her head somberly .  she had been exiled for violating some of those norms .   they were given three choices  zymosteak  again  sweet and pungent zymopork  and pseudo chicken casserole .  side dishes included such things as salads and fruit plates  hearty hungarian goulash  vegetable pseudo beef stew  and so on .  they chose the zymopork and the casserole  and browsed among the side dishes  almost famishing from the smell of the food around them .      at least  seated here in the middle  we can watch the families     ariel said .      right .  i was wondering if it would be acceptable to divide our dishes with each other .  but see that family with the four kids   the kids are swapping around ad lib .         yes   and the parents .  different side dishes come with different main courses  and they   re trading off .      the food arrived at that point  and they wasted no more time watching others eat .   when they had finished and exited the kitchen  derec paused  glancing around .      what   s wrong .         it   s still light     he said .     it should be getting dark .      she laughed nervously .  they moved aside  out of the way  and strolled slowly toward the ways .     i know what you mean .  especially for us  since we got up well before what these people consider the dawn .  but  of course  the lights will never dim .      they rode the localway for a short distance  changed ways  and presently found themselves at a massive entrance flanked with stone lions .      stone .     said ariel  sounding astonished .     i supposed they   d be plastic or something .         or nothing     said derec .  he liked libraries  though people rarely visited them on the spacer worlds .  it was simpler just to call them up and have the books transmitted over your phone .      i suppose many apartments on earth must be equipped to receive book transmissions     he said .      in higher social classes     ariel said wryly  and he laughed .  spacers though they were  they were not masquerading merely as earthers  but as low rated earthers .   crowds of people  as usual on earth  swarmed up and down the ornamental steps that led up to the entry .  some sat on the steps or the balusters  talking  laughing  eating or drinking  and many reading .  a group of children played on one of the lions  their book viewers laid carefully between its paws .  inside were uniformed guards with clubs and surprisingly cheerful expressions  sober people of all ages swarming about  many of them young  and people sitting around tables .  virtually every terminal was in use .      this must be the library   s rush hour     derec whispered .   with school out for the day  people off work and looking for the cheapest entertainment   it probably was .   at length they found an unused terminal and did a twenty minute search for the information  making sure they had all they needed .  derec had a moment of doubt when he inserted his money tab into the slot .  this metal tab was not unlike the credit transfer system on the spacer worlds .  but he had no idea what formalities were employed here  or how much money there was in this account .   accepted  said the blinking transparency  and the machine tinkled a tune to let them know it was copying the information on their card .      we   ve got it     he said  breathing more easily .     let   s go .      out of the library  down the steps  to the right .  they marched more slowly than they had at the beginning of the day .  derec was as tired as ariel looked .      it   s been a long day     he said hollowly .      and we   ve come a long way     she added .   turn  and turn again  and they confronted a smaller marquee than one they   d seen in old town sector  will you follow .      not tonight  honey     said derec vaguely .     i   m too tired .         we didn   t come by that  derec     ariel said  gripping his arm .      i know     he said tiredly .     we   ve gotten turned around .      they retraced their steps  and now couldn   t find the library .  after quite a while they paused  gray faced with weariness and strain  before a window showing dresses and hats of incredible fabrics  some of which glowed .  cheap finery .  men and women peered through windows  pointed out things they   d like but would probably never afford .  not far from them a young man in tight blue pants and silver pseudo leather jacket  with elaborately coiffed hair  stood next to a girl who seemed much older than ariel and who wore even tighter violet pants and a nearly transparent  slashed top .  her hair was blonde and long on one side and short and red on the other  and her eyes were cynical and hard .   this was a major thoroughfare  though it was not part of the moving way system .  it ought to join to the ways somewhere  but didn   t seem to .  they had no idea which way to go .      just like a couple of transients     said derec glumly .     we can   t be far from the ways  but we could spend an hour blundering around looking for them .      the youth with the tough expression and the silvery jacket turned toward them .      transients  eh .     he said .  he looked them up and down .  the hard featured young woman looked at them curiously also .   derec braced himself .     chapter    back to school       that way two blocks  take the up ramp     the young tough said courteously  and the hard featured young woman looked sympathetically at them .      thank you     said derec  and ariel  as startled as he  echoed him .   their rescuers had forgotten them before they were out of sight  but derec and ariel remembered them all the way home .     the section kitchen had become a familiar place by the time of their third meal  next morning .  much of the shock of enormous rooms  enormous numbers of loud talking earthers  of being ignored amid mobs  was gone .  after breakfast  out into the monotonous every day of the ways  they rode south toward the edge of the sprawling megalopolis .  finally  in a section called mattese  they found the driving school they sought .   they had chosen it because it was a    private    school .  though regulated by the government  it counted as a luxury  and one paid for the privilege of learning here  a concept that bemused the spacers .      yes  please .      the receptionist was not the robot the term called to their minds  but a middle aged woman   though earthers aged fast by spacer standards  she was probably quite young  perhaps no more than forty five or fifty .      derec and ariel avery     derec said apologetically  trying again to imitate the earth dialect .      oh  yes  new students .  you   re a bit early  but that   s good   you have to do your forms .      they thought they   d already done the forms over the communo  but took the papers and sat down .  these forms were simple and asked primarily how much experience they   d had with automobiles and something called    models .         can that mean what i think it does .     ariel asked .  derec could only shrug .   they had sweated over the application last night  for it asked for their schooling  but r .  david had given them the names of schools in the city they might have gone to .  they hoped the driving school would be lax in checking up .  of course  sooner or later their imposture would be detected  but even one day  they calculated     you may see ms .  winters now     said the receptionist  smiling kindly .   ms .  winters kept them waiting in an outer office for a moment while she examined their forms  and ariel nudged derec .      did you hear that receptionist .  she was trying to copy our accent .      ms .  winters called them in  asked a question or two  nodded  and  taking the forms  left with a brief    wait just a moment .     it hadn   t taken her long  as they had indicated no experience .   she hadn   t closed the door completely .      red .  those two students  the brother and sister .  .  .  upper rating children slumming  or kicked out of the house  or something .     doubtfully  she added     maybe student reporters  checking up on the schooling system  or something .         who cares .     came a gruff sounding male voice .     they got money  they want to learn  we sell schoolin    .  send    em on out .      with a dazzling smile  ms .  winters ushered them through the farther door into a large room with a number of carrels within it .  students were entering in a steady stream from a different door and occupying carrels and other learning stations farther down .   red confronted them  a blocky fellow with thinning sandy hair and a handsome face  his body one solid slab of muscle .  he looked them over shrewdly for a moment  nodded  gave a noncommittal grunt .      drivin   s a hands on schoolin        he said bluntly .     you either learn it with your reflexes or else you don   t learn it .  it ain   t so different from learnin    to ride the ways  though you don   t remember how you did that .     it was a set speech  and went on in that vein for about three minutes .  red   s face remained blank .   derec was impressed despite his prejudices .  education among spacers  as little of it as he could remember  was a more gracious process  lavishly supported by ever patient robots .  it was clear that this indifferent man proposed to push them into the water and watch to see if they drowned .  if they did not  they would be rewarded only by his good opinion .       .  .  . it   s your money and your time  so i know you   ll do your best and not waste either .      though his experience with different machines must be far greater than this earther   s  derec wryly found that red   s good opinion was a thing worth striving for .   the carrels were cockpits containing mockups of the control sets of various kinds of vehicles  and trimensionals of the roadways .  red gave them a brief instruction on the rules of the road and the operation of the craft  showed them a printed set of instructions on the right and of rules on the left  and said     do it  gatos .      derec and ariel grinned faintly at each other  and did it for about half an hour .   red came by at the end of the time  sucking on the stem of a cup  if a cup had a stem  and exhaling smoke courteously away from them .  he bent and looked on the back sides of the carrels .      you did good     he said  his eyebrows expressing more than his voice .     you did real good  for beginners .      maybe too good  derec thought uneasily .   red looked at them  blew smoke thoughtfully  and said     come down here to the models .      the models were as they had supposed  small scale versions of various vehicles they   d have to learn to drive in order to graduate  from one man scooters to big transport trucks .  they were given models of four person passenger cars marked police  and control sets  the models being  of course  remote controlled .   this was an interactive game with a vengeance  and the other students who had advanced this far grinned at them and made room .  derec started his car slowly  nearly got run over by a big truck  speeded up  nearly went out of the lane going around a corner  cut too sharply  but gradually began to get the hang of it .   then a white gleaming ambulance with red crosses on its doors and top made a left turn from the outside lane  the operator crying    oops .     belatedly as he realized where he was .  derec avoided him skillfully and slipped past .  after a moment his controls froze  as did the ambulance   s .  the ambulance operator grimaced  then grinned ruefully  and they all looked at a trimensional screen to one side .   a   illegal turn  no signals .  p    failure to apprehend traffic violator .      frost .  swim or drown     derec muttered  and the girl next to him laughed .   it wasn   t as easy as it looked  and he wasn   t thinking only of not knowing the rules   such as that a police car was expected to act like a police car .  the streets were full of vehicles  and he had to be prepared to predict their moves .  none of his spacer training was of much use here .  to his mortification  he rammed a fire engine at one stopping  not seeing the signal lights in time .  it didn   t help that ariel slaughtered half a dozen pedestrians at a place where the motorway and pedestrian levels merged .  the other students were far better  but cheerful about it  or derec couldn   t have stood it .   it was humiliating .   after an hour of exhilarating play  during which they got much better  red came by and said     take a break  all  give the second team a chance .      the students relinquished their controls  leaving the vehicles in mid street  and trooped out  old and young alike  to some kind of refectory .  red caught derec   s eye  nodded to ariel  they stepped aside .      i   ve been watching the monitor record .  you   re not so swift on models  where i was expectin    you t    shine     he said .     figured you   d have lots of experience on them .      he paused and eyed them questioningly  but they just nodded .  shrugging  red said     i   m gonna put you on trucks .  big ones .  you ever been outside .      chilled  derec said     what .         outside the city      red said patiently .      well       derec exchanged a glance with ariel .     yeah .  we   ve  uh  we   ve given it a try .         ever have nightmares about it .         what .  no .      red nodded shrewdly .     the shrinks have all kinds tests  but one thing talks true  nightmares .  thing is  you   re young  you could be conditioned easily if you aren   t what shrinks call phobic .  that means  if you don   t have nightmares .  big money in driving the big rigs outside   not many people to do this kind of job .  most trucks are computer controlled  or remote controlled   but even remote control ops get upset  break down  have nightmares .  they even use a lot of robot drivers .          really .      red shrugged .     why not .  they   re not takin    anybody   s job away .  not many people will do that kind of work .  if you can do it   and will   it pays real good .      derec and ariel looked at each other .      don   t have to decide right away     red said shrewdly .     i know   people   d think you   re queer  wanting to go outside .  and i should tell you  i get a bounty on every prospect i send out .      he looked at them with a hint of humor .     oh  yeah  you got to apply for the job   outside .      he paused for an answer  and derec said slowly     well  can we think it over .  i mean  we don   t know anything about trucks           i   ll put you on simulators now   c   mon back here .      at the back of the room were giant simulators they had to climb up into   three of them .      most of the trucks we train on are for inside the city  and they   re pretty small .  lots of competition for the driver jobs on them   most freight goes by the freightways  naturally  and driving the freight handler trucks is a different department of the transportation bureau .  lots of competition for those jobs  too .  but these big babies go beggin    .  yet they   re real easy to learn .      the important thing was remembering that one had a long    tail    behind one .  they moved .  slowly when maneuvering  though  and anyone who had landed a spaceship could learn this readily enough .      give it half an hour or so  an    we   ll look at your records .      it was closer to an hour  and derec and ariel were both tired when red approached them again .      you done real good     he said  looking at a print out .     you were made for outside drivin    .  you do much better where you don   t have to watch out for traffic .     he looked at them with a faint smile .     it   s never as frantic in the motorways as in our model .  usually they   re wide open and empty .  .  but you learn about traffic in traffic .         how   d we do .     ariel asked  imitating his accent fairly well  to derec   s ear .      good enough to make it worth your while to go on     said red .     a week   s training  and i   ll be sending you out to mattell trucking   transport .  yes .      ms .  winters  from the inner office  had approached him .  she glanced at them curiously .      you two go take a break  drink some fruit juice or something  and i   ll talk to you in fifteen minutes .      when they were out of sight  ariel said     keep on going .         i thought so  but i couldn   t be sure     derec said .      i suppose she checked out our education  or something     ariel said glumly .      yes  well  it had to happen .  and we   ve had an hour   s worth of training on big trucks .     derec was quite buoyant .     i doubt very much if they are equipped to chase stolen trucks across the countryside .  at least  not well equipped .  how many earthers would not only steal a big truck  but take off across country .         we haven   t stolen our truck yet     ariel said gloomily .   derec found himself joining her in gloom as they made their way back to the expressway  and then they found it jammed and had to stand on the lower ratings    level .  it traveled just as fast  but it was a tiring nuisance .   they stopped off at the kitchen for a light lunch  and at the personals on the way back to the apartment .  derec made his way back to sub section g  corridor m  sub corridor     apartment     from the personal  with a skill that was by now automatic .  then he sat and waited .  and waited .   derec was quite concerned by the time ariel returned  and became more concerned with one look at her .  she had taken twice as long as he  and looked dull .      what took you so long .         i got lost     she said lusterlessly .      you look   tired .  you want   to lie down .     derec   s voice kept catching with his fear .      i guess .      but ariel sat down on the couch and didn   t move .  she didn   t respond to anything derec said .  after a long while she got up and dragged herself into the bedroom .   derec was worried and restless .  he had wanted to discuss ways and means of getting a truck  but that was impossible under the circumstances .  she obviously had at least a mild fever .   instead  he spent the afternoon viewing books .  some of dr .  avery   s local collection were earthly novels  some were documentaries  some were volumes of statistics about population densities  yeast production  and so on .  it was not the most stimulating reading he   d ever done  but derec read or viewed the documentaries   some were print  some audiovisual .   presently he found that it was late and he was hungry  but he hesitated .     r .  david  please check on ariel and see if she is awake .  if so  ask if she would like to accompany me to the section kitchen .      the robot did so  found her awake  and repeated the answer derec had heard     no  mr .  avery  miss avery does not feel hungry and requires no food .      he hesitated about leaving her .  if she felt hungry later  he could accompany her to the kitchen door  but doubted he   d be allowed in again tonight .  still  he could hang around outside and hope he wasn   t questioned by a policeman .  in any case  he himself was quite hungry despite his worry over ariel .   he went out  stopping off at the personal again and getting a drink from a public fountain outside it  then threaded the maze to the section kitchen .  this time he got table j     and there was a longer wait  he saw that the room was near capacity .  there weren   t two adjoining spaces free at the table  as the earthers tended to spread out as much as possible .   it was a gloomy meal  alone amid so many .   then he retraced his weary route .  i suppose a person could get used to this  he thought .  it   s inconvenient  but you don   t miss what you never had .  the earthers obviously didn   t give it a thought .   questioned on this subject  r .  david said     it is not necessary for all earth people to make this trek every time  of course .  holders of higher steps in each rating have such things as larger apartments  activated wash basins  subetherics  and so on .  of course  it is far more efficient to supply one section kitchen for four or five thousand households than to supply a room for cooking in each of these apartments  plus a cooker  food storage devices  food delivery  and so on .  just so with subetherics  when one big machine can replace a thousand small ones .         but some people do have these things  and convenient laundry facilities in personal  without having to go to the section laundry .  don   t the have nots resent these privileges .         perhaps some do so  mr .  avery  for humans are illogical .  but human emotions are allowed for in the distribution of these favors  according to the teramin relationship .         the what .         the teramin relationship .  that is the mathematical expression that governs the differential between inconveniences suffered with privileges granted  dee eye sub jay taken to the           spare me the math  i   m a specialist in robotics  and even my math there is not fully developed .  but i   m interested  i   ve never heard of any kind of math being applied to human relations .  can you express this tera whatchacallit relationship verbally .         perhaps an example would suffice  master .  consider that the privilege of having three meals a week in the apartment  even if the recipient has to fetch the meals himself from a section kitchen  if the privilege were granted for cause  will keep a large if varying number of people patient with their own inconveniences .  for it demonstrates that privileges are real  can be earned without too great an effort  and have been earned by people whom one knows .         interesting     said derec  thinking that the robots of robot city ought to know this .     how do you know all this .         i aided dr .  avery in his researches on society .  i also aided him in his research into robotic history .         robotic history .  on earth .         but of course  mr .  avery .  the positronic brain  and the positronic robot  were invented on earth .  susan calvin was an earthwoman  and dr .  asenion an earthman .      those names he knew   dr .  asenion  especially  the man who had codified the mathematics that expressed the three laws in ways that made it possible to incorporate them into positronic brains .  but earth people .  still  it might explain much about robot city .  dr .  avery was studying mass society and non specialized robots on earth .      is there a book on the mathematics of human society .     he asked  thinking it might well be good to take such a thing back to robot city .  those poor robots had scarcely ever seen a human being  yet they were designed to serve mankind .      i believe there are no spacer books on the subject  mr .  avery .  however  i have several earthly references of which you may have copies .         i   d like that .      he   d like even more for ariel to wake up and be her old self again .  all during the afternoon he had had twinges of sharp fear  and kept trying not to remember that her disease was ultimately fatal .     chapter    outside .     apparently everybody in webster groves had the idea of getting breakfast early  this was the worst jam yet .  ariel shifted from foot to foot and had the ungallant wish that derec would carry her .  finally  however  they got in  made their way to their table  and sat with twin sighs .   the meal was lavish and included quite a few choices  including real meat sausages .  derec ate heavily  she saw  taking his own advice  it might be a long day .  she tried to do so  but could not .      i thought you were feeling better     he said .      yes     she said  and tried valiantly to eat more .  how could she explain that her problem was as much psychological as physical .  she had felt better this morning  but perhaps she was still feverish .  derec  in fact  had looked bad himself  as if he   d had another and worse nightmare .  he   d said nothing .      just a claustrophobic attack     she muttered to him .   derec nodded somberly .   it was partly that .  partly it was depression .  partly  she thought  it was sensory overload .  earth was so overwhelming .  even now   ten thousand jaws masticating food and the ceaseless din and motion around her   she wanted it all to stop for a minute  just for a minute .  even in her sleep  however  it never stopped .   and her illness was undoubtedly creeping up on her .  if it crossed the blood brain barrier  they had told her  it would be fatal .  until then she could still hope   dream   of a cure .  well  the moments of inattention she had been experiencing  the fugues as she relived past memories only to lose them forever  the dreamlike hallucinatory state she often found herself in  could only mean one thing .   how could she tell derec .      ready .      nodding  concealing her dread  ariel rose and followed him out into yet more motion and noise .   the ways were surprisingly quiet  considering how many tons of people they carried  considering the speeds they moved at  considering the cleaving of the air over them .  but the roar was always there under all consciousness  making ariel feel more than ever that it was all a hallucination .   they retraced their route to old town section  then through    yeast town     which began with east st .  louis section .  they sat  quiet  tense  through this section  but nobody paid any attention to them .  beyond  the sections stretched again  on and on to the east .   new york lay to the east  derec had found  and he had no desire to try to drive around the city .      mommer .     yelled a young girl not far from them .   derec and ariel glanced at her apprehensively .  it was rush hour  and all of them were standing  the earthers patiently .      yeahr .     inquired an older woman  presumably mommer .  she wore a dark  baggy suit .  the daughter wore a tight yellow one  over a rather unfortunate figure        member when mayor wong and all the notables was at busch stadium    time the reds played .     she yelled .      no     said mommer  indifferently .         member the girl that played the       ariel didn   t get the title  it sounded like    star mangled spanner         on the bugle .         yeahr  so what .         that   s my boyfriend freddy   s cousin rosine .     the daughter shouted .  she looked around triumphantly .      no kiddin     .     mommer asked  losing her indifference .         swearta god .     cried the girl  looking around proudly  famous by contagion .     in fronta wong an     all them notahies .      at length  the lightwoffils overhead signaled end of line .  the crowd had thinned out long before  mommer and daughter among the first to go .  only a few distinctly scruffy types were still on the ways .  the edge of the city was evidently not a fashionable place .  a number of men in obvious workmen   s dress also rode with them .   the eastbound and westbound strips separated  were further divided by a building  and the strips tilted .  at heartstopping full speed the eastbound lane looped to the left  circled the building  and became the westbound lane .  ariel followed derec down the strips just after the turn .  he   d apparently been too interested to get off sooner .      oh  no .      there was no crowd  and she thought that was the reason he got careless .  derec   s foot came down on the join of two strips  and in a moment he   d been jerked off his feet .  he rolled on his back down onto the slower strip .   ariel leaped after him  in her haste not bracing herself  and fell forward at full length   fortunately  on the slower strip .   derec  grunting  had rolled half onto a yet slower strip  which slipped from under his fingers as he clawed at it .  with great presence of mind he rolled over yet again fully onto that strip .   ariel hastily picked herself up and gingerly transferred to his new strip .  derec sat grinning faintly and watched her as she walked back toward him .  a couple of earthers glanced at them incuriously and looked up at the lightworms .  apparently falling riders weren   t that uncommon .  nobody laughed .   dusting himself off  derec grinned more widely and led her down  then stopped in some consternation .      where   s your purse .      ariel clapped a hand to her side  gasped .  she didn   t often carry a purse  but had had to on earth .  with all the identification and such she had to carry here  it was a real necessity .  now it was all gone .      no real matter   r .  david can fake up more identification for you     derec said .   they looked along the ways  but saw no sign of it .  it must be hundreds of meters off by now  and they didn   t know on which strip .  ariel shrugged .      there must be some central office where you can reclaim things lost on the ways     derec said  but dismissed it .   with a skill increased by their previous experiences  they made their way down into the bowels of the city to the freightway level .  no riding .  pedestrians forbidden  the signs proclaimed .  so they walked along beside them to the terminus  which was much like that of the passengerways above .   small trucks with lifts in front and broad  flat beds behind brought in cannisters of freight .  somewhere not far from here big trucks were unloading these cannisters  driving in  wheeling out .      hey  you   you kids .  git away from there .  don   t you see the sign .  go on  back .      authorized persons only .   muttering  derec led ariel up a motionless ramp  hesitated  and struck out along a corridor running east .  after half an hour of fruitlessly trying to go down to the entrance there  he retraced his steps and they went down to the lower level  and then marched toward the entrance .  it was marked on the city maps as an entrance  not as an exit .  there were no exits on the map .   no admittance to unauthorized persons .   derec opened the door cautiously  beckoned her through .  beyond it they found a garage for the handling trucks that transferred the cannisters .  men swarmed around it  but ignored them .      we can   t go there     ariel said when he had led her behind the trucks to the motorway .   it was a stub motorway joining the entrance with the freightway strips .  to step out into that rumbling passage would be to get run over on the spot .   derec hesitated .     steal a handler and drive it out there .     he asked .      and maybe keep on going .     she asked wistfully  thinking of sunlight and air .  tomorrow and new york were too far away to bother about .  her head hurt .      no  we couldn   t get much past the exit .  these things are all beam powered .  that   s why we have to have one of those big trucks .  they   re nukes .      in the end  they picked out a small handler and figured out the controls  which were quite simple .      i   m surprised there   s no control lock     said ariel .     knowing earthly psychology .         frost  you   re right     said derec  worried  and looked it over .     this slot     he said after a moment .     for an id tag  probably a specialized one .     he looked it over and said     i wish i had my tools .      wonders can be performed with such things as metal ration tags .  he worked away behind the control panel while ariel crouched behind him in the tiny cab and watched anxiously for anyone approaching .      ready     he said at last .     take the stick and drive us slowly out into the rnotorway .      she did so  nervously .  at the door  the machine slowed  a panel on its controls lighting with the words  identification required beyond this point .  derec did something  a relay clicked quietly  and the handler rolled smoothly out into the stream .      so far  so good     derec said .     nobody following .     ariel turned to the right  guided them across the motorway to the proper lane  and they rolled slowly along toward the light .  the traffic was fairly heavy  but moved slowly .      oh  almost       ariel said .   the light came from a vast open space where elephantine trucks trundled in and backed up to the loading docks .  the handlers ran in and out of them  transferring their cargoes to small trucks  which took them to the freightways .  off to the right  a row of the huge trucks were disgorging golden grain into pipelines with a roar and a hiss of nitrogen .      no good .     cried derec .     too many people .  pullover to the right  by those dumpsters .  we   ll pretend to be inspectors or something .      sick  ariel saw that he was right  there was little hope of seizing a truck unnoticed .  the loading was done with smooth efficiency  though nobody seemed to move very fast .  there were little knots of gossiping drivers and operators around .  men and women went around with clipboards  checking manifests .  as soon as a truck was unloaded  it pulled out .      too bad we can   t find a clipboard or two     derec said .   ariel thought that their shipsuits fit in pretty well  but wished they were cleaner .  they had not thought to launder them   she had slept in hers  though the fabric didn   t show it .   they got out of the handler reluctantly  and stood looking about .   ariel yearned for the open .  they could go to the edge of the dock  drop their own height to the concrete  and walk perhaps a hundred or a hundred fifty meters  and find themselves at the opening .      might have expected these earthers to block off the opening     she observed .  light came in  but they couldn   t see out .      they don   t even like as much of an opening as they   ve got     said derec .     notice how they all stand with their backs to it .      they did .  each little group was a semicircle facing away from the opening .      let   s go outside     she said impulsively .   derec hesitated .     it might not be easy to explain .  it might not be easy to get back in .         who wants to .     she said fiercely .     i just want to see sunlight one last time .     .   derec looked at her  frightened  concealed it  and said gently     all right  we   ll see what we can do .      he led her across the dock space and peered up at the numbers and letters on the side of one of the mammoth trucks .  it was damp  and had dripped a puddle under it .  ariel had had no idea of how big they were till then .  nodding wisely  derec stepped to the edge  turned  and dropped off .   ariel followed .   they strode briskly  as if they had business there  toward the front of the truck .  beyond lay the barrier .  trucks entered obliquely between overlapping walls  so that vision could not reach out to the frightening openness outside but the trucks could enter without opening and closing doors .  ariel suspected that the way zigzagged  so great was the fear they showed of the outside .      hey .  hey  you two .      a group of men were walking threateningly toward them on the docks  gesturing them back .  one turned and dropped off as they watched .     come back here .         run .     said derec .   a big wet truck erupted from the barrier even as they began to run  and they swerved .  they found themselves running toward the grain trucks dropping their cargoes from their bellies .   a sign hovered in the air before them  warning  oxygen required beyond this point .   ariel remembered reading somewhere that grain dust could explode if liberally mixed with air .  they stored it in nitrogen to prevent that .  but  she observed  stricken with fear  the men working here were not wearing masks .   derec led her on a route that avoided them   these workers looked up curiously but did not join the chase immediately   and they ran through the first dust cloud  then through the second .      not good enough     he said  as they paused  panting .  ariel tried not to cough  the dust was in her throat .      back up on the docks     she wheezed  and he nodded  led the way .  with a grunt they were up  between trucks .  the grain trucks didn   t back up to the actual docks  which were quite narrow here .  the whole area was fogged with dust .   they heard a shout     damn thieves     and looked back .   they had not been seen yet  but it was only a matter of time .  the space beyond the dust cloud was a bedlam of whistles  shouts  and pounding feet .  a big truck pulled away  its great wheels churning up more dust but making no sound .   a shout  something about laying the dust  came to them .  ariel couldn   t get her breath .  we need oxygen  she thought  and wanted to cough worse than ever .  out there they were coughing  too .   red lights flamed overhead and a deep toned horn sounded .  ariel looked up apprehensively to see yellow signs beside the red lights  sprinklers .  .  . sprinklers .  .  .  sprinklers .  .  .  .      back in here  quick .     derec cried  and pulled her back behind a tangle of implements  broken handler trucks  dustbins  and the like .   water spurted in a fine spray from the overhead  laying the dust immediately .  a blue clad man was among the truck drivers and dock workers  he carried a now familiar club .      a cop .     derec said  groaning .   ariel had glanced at him .  and saw  beyond him        a door .         where .         there  behind that tire .      the tire  a huge thing in bright blue composition  discarded from one of the trucks  marked the end of the dump they were crouched in .  there was a passageway by it to a small door .   in a moment they were trying it  and before the sprinklers cut off they were in a small  dim hallway with only one out of three lights burning .   pipeline control section  no admittance to unauthorized persons .  but the hall led past .  farther on  they saw  grain   bulk supply rationalizing   balancing .      administrative controls on the basic levels .     said derec  and ariel thought of the men and women with clipboards .      but there   s nobody here     she said .      well  cities grow and change  these may be abandoned  or only needed periodically .  the important thing is they may have access above        they did .   at the upper level  they found that they were far from the docks  to which they knew better than to return  but were not gone from the barrier yet .  the motorways used by emergency vehicles also reached at least to the entry .   beside the motorway was a pedestrian access door  the motorway door had no controls and probably opened by radio .  once through  walking nervously on the motorway  they found to their frustration that the way avoided the entrance  swooped  and dived down to the lower levels .      it   s for emergency vehicles     said derec .     ambulances  and so on .  accidents must be common on the docks .      presently  they did find a half concealed route that took them to the opening  and they looked out and down .   it was pouring with cold rain .   even then derec didn   t give up  but ariel   s mind refused to record the details of the rest of the day .  for several more hours he kept them prowling around the area  always trying to find a way to get at a big truck .  but he could find no garage for them within the city and doubted seriously if there was one near to it .   finally ariel pleaded hunger and they gloomily rode the ways back to their section kitchen  able at least to sit down .  ariel felt doomed  one look at the cold gray rain falling endlessly outside had chilled her on some deep  basic level .  she knew it was the last she   d ever see of the sky .  for derec  she felt sad  but was too tired to speak .      we   ll try again tomorrow at a different entrance     derec said when she had eaten the little she could .     the sun will be shining   probably  anyway   and things will be all right .      she nodded indifferently .     chapter    amnemonic plague    to derec   s dismay  ariel did not reappear that afternoon  and the next morning she arose late and looked terrible .   r .  david became alarmed .     miss avery  you are not well .  what are your symptoms .         the same as usual  r .  david .  don   t worry  i brought this illness with me  it   s nothing to worry about .     she sounded tired and fretful  trying not to worry his three law dominated brain .   but a robot will worry if it seems appropriate  whether told not to or not .  they weren   t so different from humans in that respect  thought derec  himself alarmed .      i hope you are indeed not seriously ill  miss avery  but please tell me your symptoms so that i may judge .  as you know  first law compels me to help you .      she grimaced .     okay .  i   m frequently feverish   is there any water in the place .         no     derec said .     i   ll bring you   frost .  is there anything to carry water in .         no     said r .  david .   mentally  derec cursed all earthers  individually and collectively  and the teramin relationship  too .      anyway  i   m often feverish  and tired and lethargic and listless .  and   and       she glanced at derec .     i have mental troubles .  confusion   i forget where i am  lose track of what   s going on .  a lot of the time i sit and don   t speak because i can   t follow the conversation .  i   ve been reliving the past a lot .       suddenly she cried out passionately     nothing seems real .  i feel like i   m in a hallucination .      it was more serious than derec had thought .  hesitantly  he asked     do you feel like going to the section kitchen .         no .  i don   t feel like doing anything  except drinking a liter of water and going back to bed .         you must go to section hospital at once     said r .  david decisively  stepping forward .   derec could have groaned .     what kind of medical care can you expect in an earthly hospital .     he asked .     we   ve got to get you back to the spacer worlds           there   s no cure for me there     she said quietly .  damn .  that was true .  derec hesitated  torn  and said     well  back to robot city  then .  maybe the human medical team has a cure .         my medical knowledge is limited  primarily to the effects of earthly ills on spacers .  but that knowledge makes me doubt that miss avery will   will live long enough for a space journey     said r .  david  the catch in his voice obvious .     she is obviously in  or approaching  the   crisis of her disease .      derec hesitated .  that was too obviously true .   ariel smiled sadly and said     i fear he is right  derec .  i   i   m losing my memory   my mind .  and it   s getting worse .  i couldn   t remember my way back here the other night        abruptly  she was weeping .   oh .  frost .  derec thought helplessly .   r .  david gave them an argument  he wanted to accompany them   to carry ariel  in fact .      no .     said derec .     i may be ignorant of many things about earth  but i know well enough what earthers do to any robots they catch on the ways .  and if we tried to do anything about it  our first words would give us away as spacers .  they   d be allover us .  i   ve been chased once by yeast farmers .  frost .  i don   t want to have every earther we meet at our throats .      it took the firmest commands reinforcing dr .  avery   s to keep r .  david in the apartment .  only when ariel perked up  as she usually did at the prospect of change  was the robot   s first law conditioning allayed .  ariel was even almost gay as she left  rendering a zany marching song     one two three .  here we go .  bedlam  bedlam  ho ho ho .  drrringding ding  brrrumbum bum  brrrreebeedeebee dabbabba dumbum bum .      but once the door had closed she looked haggard .      water     she said  smiling wanly at derec   s concerned look .   after she had drunk a liter or so  she gasped for breath a few minutes  but was game to go on .  the route to the section hospital was longer than the one to the kitchen  and she drooped visibly .  worse  it was morning now and the express was jammed .  they had to stand  threes weren   t allowed to sit during rush hour .       it seemed that the nightmare of rushing ways and whistling wind and unconcerned  self centered earthers would go on forever .  derec had to watch ariel   he feared she would collapse   and also watch the signs overhead  fearing that he would forget or confuse the instructions he had carefully impressed on his memory .   but even the longest journey ends at last  and the exit was clearly marked section hospital  with the same red cross on white that spacers used .   the anteroom smelled of antiseptic and was mobbed with men  women  and children .  children .  thought derec vaguely   never seen so many children in my life as on earth .  though his memories still were lost  he was sure  by his astonished reaction  that he had not .  of course  they had to keep replacing this huge population .   fumbling  he inserted ariel   s newly forged id tags into the computer  whose panel lit with check up  illness  emergency .  ariel was leaning against him  gasping and pale after the ordeal  and even the usually unconcerned earthers were looking at them in some alarm .  emergency  he decided  panicky  and punched it .   instantly a red star appeared in the panel  blinking  apparently alarms rang elsewhere  for a strong looking woman appeared  started to remonstrate with him for mistaking an illness for an emergency   young husbands .  but ariel turned a ghastly  apologetic smile on her  and the woman   s mouth closed with a snap .      here .      she half carried ariel past three rooms full of still more waiting earthers  to a room with a wheeled  knee high cart in it .      lie down  baby .      the gurney stood up  she strapped ariel on  and an older woman entered .     dr .  li           mmm .  i see .     she began to check over ariel  not bothering with instruments   she took ariel   s temperature by placing her hand on ariel   s head .   a harassed looking man entered .  he wore a curious ornament in the form of a frame holding glass panes in front of his eyes .  derec had noticed some of these on the ways .  it gave his face a dashing  futuristic look .     what is it  dr .  li .         don   t know yet  dr .  powell .  elevated temperature  febrile heartbeat  hectic flush  exhaustion .  i want to measure everything first  of course .     she reached to the bottom of the gurney and started pulling out instruments  to derec   s considerable relief .  ariel had closed her eyes  and seemed to be asleep .   the doctors bent over her  shaking their heads and measuring everything about ariel .  tense as he was  derec looked about for a place to sit  content for the moment to leave it in their hands .  abruptly the nurse said .     how long has it been since she   s eaten .      the doctors ignored this till derec said     uh   yesterday afternoon .  not long after noon .      dr .  li grunted  and dr .  powell said     inanition .         young as she is  that shouldn   t have brought on this collapse .  feel that arm .  she   s practically starving .     the three of them looked at each other  plainly shocked .      why hasn   t she been eating  young man .     dr .  li demanded .      she hasn   t felt like it  ma   am     said derec  and all three of them frowned at his accent .      settler prospects  eh .     powell removed his frame and wiped the panes with a tissue .     you   ll not have much need of spacer talk on a frontier planet .  better to learn some good medieval jargon  brush  creek  log cabin .  not to mention    sweat .     what   s wrong with her .         i don   t know  doctor .  she said     he gulped     it could be fatal if it crossed the blood brain barrier .  it   s   it   s affecting her mind .  she   s had th this low level fever and lethargy  with occasional muscular aches and pains  for a long time .         vomiting .  night sweats .     asked dr .  li tensely .      i don   t know .  she   she didn   t want to worry me .      they looked outraged  he should know .      there   s a number of things it could be     said dr .  li unhappily .     i have a few ideas  though           so do i .     said dr .  powell sourly .     look here  young fella  i don   t doubt that accent caused you many a pain  but you   d better doff it in here .  it antagonizes too many people .         he can   t     said dr .  li expressionlessly .     he   s a real spacer .      dr .  powell and the nurse goggled .     impossible .  a spacer running around on earth  .  he   d drop down dead of         the doctors whirled to look at ariel .  frowning  the nurse stepped out .     it could be any of a hundred common and harmless diseases .     said dr .  powell .      yes .  harmless to earth people .         how about yourself  young man .  do you feel all right .      derec nodded .     never better .         why  then .     dr .  powell exploded .     you should be sick a dozen times over .         i   ve been given a prophylactic regimen   so has ariel     said derec  hoping they wouldn   t ask too many questions .     i don   t know too much about it .         apparently it didn   t take in her case     said dr .  li somberly .     you let us know the moment you feel unwell  young man .         they can   t be spacers     said the nurse grimly  holding ariel   s id tag in her hand .     how could they be  and travel around earth .  without ration cards  id  and so on .  this is perfectly ordinary earth id  city of st .  louis        they looked at him  frowning harder  and derec felt himself hot .  .  . not to mention sweating .     that   s all arranged  sir .  it   s part of a trade agreement .  .  . we   re doing sociological research .  .  .         so young .         who notices a kid .     he countered swiftly  feeling the hair clammy against his forehead .     young eyes see more sharply .  .  . and so on .         hummph .  no child of mine would take such a risk           maybe we   d better query the terries     said dr .  li reluctantly .   they all looked concerned .   derec questioned them with his eyes  but finally had to break down and ask .     the who .         the terries terrestrial bureau of investigation     said dr .  powell .  he polished his panes unhappily .      they cause more trouble than       muttered the nurse .      still  best to take no chances .  if the girl is in a bad way  it could cause trouble with the spacers   there   s enough bad blood between us already .      derec thought swiftly  appalled .  the    terries    would find no record of them  would query whatever spacer representation there might be on earth  find no record there  and the reactor would flash over .  but he couldn   t think of a thing to say .      look        ariel moaned and turned partly on her side  only the straps kept her from falling .  if she   d been listening  she couldn   t have timed it better .  all three earthers leaped to her  and derec pocketed the id tag the nurse had put down .   he thought quickly .  the doctors were concerned and totally focused on ariel .  derec looked around .  as he recalled r .  david   s work  the id tag merely gave name and id workup .  not address .  medical care was on an as needed basis  not rationed  so nobody cared about place of residence  and in fact they hadn   t been required to enter that .   or was that because ariel   s tag gave her rating as transient .  he needed to know a lot more about earth .    in any case  he thought  the only thing they knew about ariel was what the computer recorded from the id tag .   leaving them working over her  he slipped out and strolled around  speaking to no one  trying to look like a worried  expectant father pretending to be nonchalant .  a couple of people looked at him sympathetically  but most didn   t seem to notice him at all  for which he was grateful .   there it was .  an office .  he slipped in  looked at the terminal .  it was probably dedicated to a single function  but he could try .  he had watched r .  david coding id tags of a dozen kinds  and had a good grasp of what was implied .  and frankly  these computers were simple after programming positronic brains and restructuring the programming of the central computer of robot city .  it took him a mere half hour to get through the programming  retrieve the record on ariel  and erase it .   now let   s hope there isn   t a backup memory somewhere  he thought gloomily .   they caught up with him in the interior waiting room  standing aimlessly about and unobstrusively slipping toward the outer waiting room  where he supposed he belonged .      there you are     said the nurse .  for the first time  he noted that her jacket had a name label imprinted korolenko  j .     why didn   t you wait in the friends    lounge .      he didn   t bother to tell her they hadn   t shown him to it .     had to go to the personal     he said  not knowing if earthers could mention the personal so openly .   she got ideas  frowned  put something warm from her pocket against his head .  apparently his temperature was all right .     very well .  but come in here .  the doctors will need to speak to you .      within ten minutes dr .  li entered the room briskly  sat down  exhaled heavily .     she had us worried  but it was mostly exhaustion of the body   s resources .  starvation  to put it crudely .  she must have been going on nerves and caffeine for weeks .         she hasn   t been eating well     derec admitted .  he   d been blind not to see how little she   d been eating .     what does she have .         we   ll know for sure in a day  we   ve done a culture .  but our best guess is amnemonic plague .         ay   nuhmonic    .         from medieval mnemonic  meaning memory .  amnemonic means no memory .  it   s a mutation of an old influenza virus  first reported on one of the settler worlds   sometimes called burundi   s fever  after the discoverer .     she looked at him sharply  but clearly that name meant no more to derec than the first .      will she   get better .      dr li sighed .     when burundi    s crosses the blood brain barrier  it isn   t good .  we   re giving her support   nourishment and so on   and antibiotics that eventually will cure the disease .  our anti virals are fairly effective  except where the virus has crossed the blood brain barrier .  antibodies will help a little     and we   re administering them .  we   ll be able to stop the infection in all but her brain within a day or two .      derec had the illusion that his chest had turned into a block of wood .  his heart pushed once  hard  against its unyielding surroundings  and gave up .  he felt it stop moving .     her .  .  . brain .      dr .  li sighed and looked four hundred years old .     there   s hope .  it   s by no means over .  i do wish we   d gotten at her sooner .  .  .  . well  try not to feel guilty  and i   m sorry if i made you feel worse .  you couldn   t have known .  all kids are heedless  think they   ll live forever .  .  .  .     she brooded on her capable hands for a moment .     then you think she   ll live .         let   s say  i have a good hope of it .  saul   dr .  morovan    is a specialist on viruses and has treated amnemonic plague three times  twice successfully   and the third time was a patient whose disease had advanced much farther than your wife   s .      derec suspected that the symptoms of the other two had been much less advanced than ariel   s  but said nothing .  it was something  he acknowledged  that they knew the disease  had a cure for it  and had hope for her .  of course  he thought  we were fools   chauvinistic fools   to assume that the spacer worlds were the only ones that knew anything about medicine .  who but earth  incubator of virtually every disease known to mankind  would know more about medicine .  among the spacer worlds  he supposed  amnemonic plague was invariably fatal when it crossed the blood brain barrier .  .  .  .   derec felt his knees shaking and was glad he wasn   t standing .      what .     he   d missed some of what she   d been saying .      need a sample     she repeated .     we can   t give you the vaccine if you have the disease  at least in its later stages .      the key to perihelion affected the stomach like this  a sudden drop as one went from gravity to free fall instantly .  derec nearly threw up .  gulping  he said     y yes  ma   am     and held out his arm .   disease .   the possibility had always been there  associating with ariel .  but it was obvious that what she had wasn   t easily contagious .  she had only mentioned once  more or less directly  how she had contracted her illness  as a warning to him .  but that was the only time they had come close to more than accidental physical contact .  now that he thought about it  she had kept her distance  even when she had clearly wanted and needed to be hugged .  his spacer   s horror of disease had not been as greatly allayed as he had thought  he realized  shaky .  the prophylactic treatment r .  david had given them had reassured him  ariel   s attitude and his worry over her had reassured him  and the heedlessness of youth .  .  .  .   his eyes must have mirrored some of his horror  for dr .  li looked at him sharply and said     don   t worry .  you   re obviously in a very early stage  if you have it at all .  and we   re going to give you a thorough going over  to make sure you aren   t coming down with something else .      they did that for the next half hour .  the human medical team would have been faster .  but no less thorough .  he thought .      good  you   re totally free of disease  so far as we can tell     said dr .  powell .     fortunately  your intestinal microorganisms are not markedly different from the terrestrial strains  and there   s as yet nothing else to worry about .  dr .  li  the vaccine .  .  .  .         incidentally  we detected antitoxins to burundi   s in your system     said dr .  li .     you may have had a mild case of the fever earlier  it may even still be latent in your system .  however  the vaccine will immunize you totally .         uh       said derec  as a thought took him .     have i been a carrier all this time .      uneasily  he visualized ariel and himself spreading disease all over rockliffe station  where they had crashlanded after escaping the pirate aranimas .  any human who subsequently entered the station might contract the disease     perhaps  but don   t worry about it .  amnemonic plague is misnamed  it isn   t a true plague .  it   s not infectious at all  and only minimally contagious .  you have to exchange actual body fluids  it   s commonly passed in sexual intercourse  or in contaminated blood supplies .  and occasionally by poorly sterilized hypodermics  out on the settler worlds where they have to reuse their needles .      that was a relief .  but it left a puzzle  how had derec been exposed to the disease  if not from breathing the air around ariel .  had he had it before he   d met her on aranimas   s ship .   he must have .  how else had he lost his memory .  but how  then  had he survived .  if amnemonic plague only affected the memory after passing the blood brain barrier  and among spacers was invariably fatal when it did  again he had missed something .      i said  your wife is almost certainly going to live .  here  catch him .      derec didn   t know who did what  his vision had momentarily blanked .  when the light came back  he was sitting and there was a tingle in his arm  a stimulant spray .  he thought vaguely .  they were proffering a glass of orange juice to him   perfectly normal orange juice  just like the oranges of aurora .  he wondered how much it had cost to ship it here  then realized that they must have bought orange tree seedlings sometime in the past  and raised their own .      thank you     he whispered .   they stood around and watched him intently .      is there something .         yes     said dr .  li reluctantly .     i hope you   re up to this .  it .  .  . may upset you .      derec took another swallow of the juice  marveling again that it could be so exactly like auroran juice .     i   m braced     he said .     go ahead .         amnemonic plague is well named  though it   s no plague .  your wife is losing her memory  and at a progressive rate .  by the time we   ve cured her  there won   t be much of it left .        chapter     the key to memory    derec lay on the hard  narrow bed and wondered what wolruf and mandelbrot were doing .  probably still sitting out around kappa whale in the star seeker  waiting  waiting .  of course  they could not readily get space charts without a human to front for them  though mandelbrot might try .  it would not be unusual for a robot to open communications .  but if the other ship insisted on speaking to the owner captain    star seekers were small ships  he couldn   t very well be far from the controls .  for that matter  derec was uncertain how well mandelbrot could lie in such circumstances .   well  there was nothing he could do for them .  he couldn   t leave earth  and if he could  he couldn   t leave ariel here .  and ariel was now raving in delirium in the section hospital in webster groves sector  city of saint louis .  a long way  he gathered  from the nearest spaceport  near new york .   derec wished for a drink .  he wished for a light snack  cookies at least  and fresh hot coffee  even synthetic coffee .  in the next room was a robot  ready to spring into action at his slightest word   almost .  it was an earthly robot  in an earthly city .  derec could send r .  david out  but there was no assurance it would return   and it would not be with food  for derec didn   t rate meals in his own apartment .  damn dr .  avery for not arranging for higher ratings .   but that would have been more conspicuous  he supposed .   light from the door shone across the bed .     time to arise  mr .  avery     said r .  david .      yes  thank you  r .  david .      derec groaned silently and sat up to sit for a moment with his elbows on his knees  chin in hands .  in the short life that he could remember  it had been one crisis after another .  all i want  he decided  is peace and quiet  a little establishment on some mountain brook in the boondocks of aurora or nexon  maybe  with just a couple of robots and a landing field only big enough for my own machine and one other .  maybe the solarians had the right idea  they never saw anybody  and lived totally surrounded by robots .   no  he had decided .  that wasn   t such a good idea  after all .   earth turned inside out  he thought vaguely .  no better than        mr .  avery  are you well .         yes  r .  david .  merely depressed .  i worry about ariel .      that  the robot could well understand .      yes  mr .  avery .  i   also worry about her .  but the doctors report her condition good  do they not .         yes  they did last night  r .  david .  what she   s like today       he left it  somber  dressed carelessly  and tucked some equipment into the little bath satchel he had bought the day before .   admonishing r .  david rather hollowly not to worry  he set off for the personal  returned to drop off the satchel when he had showered and washed his extra clothing  and departed for the section kitchen .  this part of the trip was so routine now that he neither saw nor was seen by the policemen in the corridors and junctions  he no longer stood out like a stranger .   breakfast was  as usual  good  but to him  tasteless .  listlessly  derec ate it  not even interested in a fact he had finally deduced  it was neither synthetic nor natural  but both .  it was made of living things and was therefore natural  but was made by an artificial process and was therefore synthetic .  the basis of three quarters of it was yeast .   he suspected that there might be a steady  if small  market for earthly food yeasts in the spacer worlds  if spacers could overcome their sense of superiority long enough to try it .  granted  spacer high cuisine had no equal on earth that derec had tasted  but spacer ships were usually furnished with synthesizers .  so much or spacer cuisine  he thought .   the hospital was a familiar place to him now .  derec did not trouble with the waiting rooms  but went to the friends    lounge and queried ariel   s condition on the monitor .  there had been a problem with that when they had discovered that she wasn   t in the system .  derec had professed ignorance of the id tag  and it was assumed   he hoped   that it had been lost when they all crowded around to help ariel during her collapse .   naturally he didn   t remember her number  and in their honest ignorance she and he had left other id forms behind .  derec had promised to supply them with it next day  but so far had    forgotten    to do so the one time they remembered to ask him for it .  they had had to input her with a dummy id .   ariel was in a room with two robots .  here  in intensive care  people were either unconscious or so debilitated by their illnesses that they didn   t care that it was robots who waited on them .   she was not raving today .  at first derec thought she was asleep  she lay so quietly .  but then she moved  and a robot sprang forward to smooth the pillow behind her .  she looked at it vacantly  closed her eyes .   a faint sound behind him was dr .  li .  the woman shook her head sadly .      how is she  doctor .     derec asked .      as far as the disease goes  the worst is over .  she will live .  but what you   re seeing now might be worse .  she is gradually losing her memories .      derec had had some of this explained to him .     i suppose she   s half in a hallucinatory state now .         yes  or something like an intense daydream .  perhaps a brown study would be a better analogy   one of those almost hypnotic states of concentration in which you don   t see what   s in front of you .      derec had a vague flash memory of someone waving a hand in front of his nose  and nodded .   ariel was reliving her life as drowning people are popularly supposed to do .  it wouldn   t take me long  he mused  j suppose i might have time for it .  but ariel .  .  .  .      could i visit her .      dr .  li frowned  looking sadder .     you could  but after today it will get worse .     she hesitated .     there   s always a shock for the loved ones  when the patient doesn   t recognize them .  that will happen  you know .      derec hadn   t thought of that  and the mere thought shocked him .     then   can i visit her today .         i   ll ask .      ariel looked at him blankly  but it wasn   t a lack of recognition .  it was more a lack of energy .     oh  derec .  how are you .      what do you say to someone who may be alive tomorrow  but won   t remember you .  if derec   s memories had been a hundred years long rather than a couple of months  he still wouldn   t have had anything to guide him .      well enough     he said awkwardly .  he drew near to the bed  touched it .  she looked at him without much emotion .      are you going to help them restore my memory .         of course .  i   ll have to .  and i hope you   ve been talking    .     he indicated the robots with a tilt of his head .      a little     she said reluctantly .     i   m so tired all the time .  and they keep me so full of drugs i don   t have the spirit .  besides  it doesn   t matter .  it won   t help .  it w won   t really be me .  derec  it   s like dying .  it   s just like dying .  i won   t see you again   i won   t see anyone again   it   s all fading        one of the robots sprang to the head of the bed and did something  and ariel   s eyes closed .  when they opened after a moment the horror had largely passed .  derec thought it was still there  though  masked by the drug .      that isn   t so  ariel     he said insistently .     your memories are still there  in your brain .  they merely need to be unlocked .  we   ll        she was shaking her head .     no  it   s all going .  i   m dying  derec .  whoever takes my place will be someone different .      abruptly he said     am i different than   the man i was .         of course .  and yet  you   re him .     she closed her eyes and tears trembled on her eyelids .  the robot got busy at the headboard again .      derec  i want you to know that i   ve always loved you .  even when i was most angry  even when i was most frightened .  i never blamed you .  for weeks i   ve watched  hoping you would never develop the final form of the disease .  i guess you did  or you wouldn   t have lost your memory .  whoever cured you .  .  . didn   t have the .  .  . technology to restore .  .  . your memory .  .  .      she drifted off into sleep  and after a moment derec choked down his impulse to cry out  to demand that they awaken her .  suddenly his lost memory seemed less important  what she knew seemed less important  than what she thought of him .      farewell  ariel     he managed to say huskily  and stumbled out into the friends    lounge  where he sat and wept for a time  quietly .  he wondered vaguely if  in all his unremembered life  he had felt this sharp  poignant pain  and doubted it .  yet  he had known her in another life  and it had not been wholly a happy relationship .   he   d had amnemonic plague  the emptiness in his head was proof enough for him .  had he gotten it from her   or given it to her .   presently he took a deep breath  let it out in a sigh that came from the bottom of his belly  and wiped his face on a tissue from the dispenser .  robots were probably watching him  within minutes dr .  li and a weary looking dr .  powell entered the room .   they sat and looked him over while he braced himself .  fortunately  they  like he  had more important things on their minds than ariel   s id tags .      i understand that korolenko has told you a little about memory restoration     dr .  powell said .   derec remembered an exchange from an earlier visit .  he nodded .     memory traces are not memory .  yes .         quite so .  a memory trace is the synapse   the nerve connection in the brain   that leads to the memory  which is stored in chemical form .  it is these synapses that are being erased by the neurotoxin of the plague .  the actual memories remain untouched .      they looked at him .  if only you knew how much i know about this  he thought .     right     he said .     but since their addresses are unknown   to put it in computer jargon   the memories are as lost as if the records had been wiped .         almost     said dr .  li .     there are ghost memories flitting about the patient   s mind  and many little things will jolt a few of the memories loose .         smell is one of the subtlest and most powerful memory keys     said dr .  powell  nodding .   derec knew .     yes .         so .  in what we loosely call a memory restoration  we merely supply new synapses as nearly identical to the old as possible .         and in the functioning of the new memory traces     derec said  parroting what he   d been told     the patient reactivates the old chemical memories .         quite so .  the more accurate and detailed the new memory traces are  the more complete not only the restoration of the memories  but the restoration of the patient   s original personality .  i hope you can see that .       it was an angle that had never occurred to him .  he supposed he had the same basic personality as ever  pragmatic  problem solving  not given to abstract thought  not artistic or poetic .  an equable temperament .  the engineering mind .   now that he thought of it  though  perhaps his personality was different .  he had known ariel in his former life .  he must have had strong feelings about her .  he did again .  not still   again .  for if he had not met her since his memory loss  and had not continuously been practically in solitary confinement with her  he might well not have felt that way about her again .   his parents  for instance .  he no longer felt about them as he once must have done .  his friends   all those parts of his personality were gone .  if he acquired new friends  his emotional responses would be much the same  of course .  his personality had not changed in any basic way  or so he supposed .  he did not seem very strange to ariel .  still  he was a new and different person from the old derec  whatever his name had been .   perhaps ariel was right  perhaps it was a form of death .   yet      if the memory traces are close enough to the original    .         ideally  it would be like copying a program into a blank positronic brain     said dr .  li .     the second robot would  for all practical purposes  become the old one .         we always explain what   s been done to them     derec said absently .      yes .  but if the original was destroyed       derec frowned .        the new one would  for all intents and purposes  be the same one in a new body .      true  it was not unlike shifting a positronic brain to a new robotic body .  derec had an uneasy flash .  on robot city there had been an accidental death  of a boy called david  which derec and ariel had investigated for the robots .  this david had looked just like him  he usually shrugged that fact off  but now he was jolted .  maybe the other was the duplicate   or was it himself .      in a human  of course  it is not quite so simple     said dr .  powell  not noticing his jolted expression .     we could activate a significant fraction of the locked memories without reactivating the old personality .  it   s a matter of knowing which memories are important to the patient .         how close can we come .     derec asked .      it depends on how much we know .  the robots are  of course  recording and analyzing everything she says  and there   s a tendency to relive the most important memories first and most often  till they   re gone .  so we   re developing a good sketch  too crude to be called a diagram .      derec nodded .     that   s where you need my help .         quite so .  you know her better than we  or the robots  can hope to .         not well enough  i   m afraid     said derec steadily  wishing for some of that tranquilizer they were keeping ariel on .     i   ve only known her for a few weeks .      and already married  their expressions said .  spacer morals .  derec didn   t enlighten them .     i can go into a lot of detail about our time together  but before that .  .  . she was a very private person .      again  their expressions spoke for them  spacers lived alone  on the surface  surrounded only by robots  and had few human contacts .  .  .  . not true  but try to explain .  besides  he   d had his own quota of chauvinistic nonsense about earthers to lose .      whatever you can do  you must do     dr .  li said heavily .      uh .  .  . well .  .  . i can   t     derec said lamely .   if he mentioned his amnesia  they   d be allover him .  the question of their identities would arise in a way he couldn   t duck .  the terries would certainly be called in  and the spacer embassy at the port would be queried .  the whole house of cards would come down   next thing you knew  they   d have learned about dr .  avery   and robot city .   that secret must be kept at all costs .      why not .     dr .  powell barked .      it   s .  .  . a matter of privacy  sir .         oh .     greatly mollified .  spacers .     well  there   s a lot more than you could do sitting here .  .  . why don   t you take all the material we have with you  go home  and do your dictating there  .      derec had been so used to having first law driven robots intruding on his life that he was startled by this easy acquiescence .  a robot wouldn   t let anything be put into ariel   s head without checking it over first     and the memory traces .  will they be kept private .      the doctors looked at each other .     well  they have to be coded     dr .  li began .   dr .  powell said     they use a technique modified from one used to implant synapses in positronic brains .  of course that can   t be used on human brains  but it   s based on the same idea  as it were .  i don   t know the full details  myself            but it   s a matter of coding     said dr .  li .     we   re having a specialist come in from the mayo .  if he could teach you   perhaps you could code the more private portions .  .  .  .      it took several conversations and a conference before it was decided to let derec attempt coding memory traces for ariel .  his education stood him in good stead  he had the necessary background to do the work .  spacer .  said the expressions again  this time with approval .  spacer education in robotics and computers in general was notoriously the best .   the work called for the use of a good computer  and with some trepidation he revealed the existence of r .  david during the conference .      of course     dr .  powell said .     a spacer would naturally have a robot in his apartment .      they seemed to take it quite for granted  and to be a little amused by it .      scots sleeping with bagpipes     someone muttered at the back of the room  a reference that sounded so funny that derec meant to look it up  but forgot .  he didn   t think of it again till weeks later .  .  . far too late to ask .   so  once he was instructed in the technique   not simple  but not too hard to learn   of coding memories as synapses  derec sat up  day and night  dictating his memories of his life with ariel .      any time she remembers something  playing the memory trace  there is a certain strong chance that she will unlock the actual memory of the event  or of part of it     the expert told derec .     each such unlocked memory will be retained  and will strengthen the memory trace leading to it  and to the fields about it .  all this was worked out at the lahey within the past ten years .      she was a sharp nosed  unpretty woman  tiny and quite dark of skin .  the breeds of mankind  or races as they were called on earth  remained far more distinct than on the spacer worlds .  darla  her name was  and she knew her stuff .  she seemed to be hundreds of years old  he supposed vaguely that she might be sixty or seventy .      eventually  the personality that is recovered will be indistinguishable from the patient   s original personality  both to the patient and to the patient   s loved ones .  but that depends on the accuracy of the memories  the accuracy of the coding  and the completeness of the memories .      the coding accuracy he could create by care and sheer hard work .  the completeness of the memories he had little control over .  at least  he thought comfortingly  the last weeks of her life must be very important  and those he could cover well .   but the accuracy of the memories .  how did he know what was important to her and what was not .  her moods had always been a mystery to him .   he could but do his best  and try not to worry too much .   derec took to visiting the hospital every other day  and sometimes every third day .  whether he went or not  he always stopped at the public combooth mornings and evenings  on the way to and from the kitchen  to call and ask about her .  the news usually was that she was doing well but was in no condition to talk .   derec knew it .  his work went rapidly enough  but there was a lot of it .  he slogged through it grimly .  if not for the necessity of going out to call the hospital  he might not have gone near the kitchen until r .  david was forced to take action to prevent collapse .   he had one slight consolation .  his own memories must also be locked away  unharmed by the plague .  if only he could find someone who knew him as well as ariel did before she lost her memories  someone he could persuade to come to earth and dictate his memories .  .  . not likely  knowing spacers .  but there was that thread of hope that he might recover his memories .  .  . might recover himself .   nights were bad .  he dreamed nightmares of ariel not responding to the treatment and being as blank as he had been upon awakening .  it was terribly important that she not lose her memories of him .  .  . and in the dream it was always his fault .  his coding failed  or she was swept away in the flash floods through the drains of robot city  or .  .  .  .   robot city .  it  too  haunted his dreams  and these dreams were even darker and more frightening than the nightmares about ariel .  those he could understand  they sprang from a quite natural anxiety .   but the robot city dreams were different .  .  . they didn   t even seem like dreams .  they seemed frighteningly real .  in the mornings derec   s hands shook  and he hoped the doctors never started asking serious questions .  they   d know for sure he was crazy .   he was dreaming that robot city was inside him .  he dreamed of gleaming buildings rising on the lobes of his liver  great dark red plains stacked above each other  or on his ribs  or inside his lungs  the buildings expanding and contracting as he breathed .  then the dreams seemed to become much clearer  and he    knew     in the crazy dream way  that robot city was in his bloodstream .   enclosed buildings  like space cities on lonely rocks  he thought .  yeah .  but jeering didn   t drive off the frightened  helpless feeling  the feeling of being invaded and used .     suppose that   s the source of this dream  he thought  trying to comfort himself .  i   ve been moved and manipulated from the beginning .   the next time he walked into the friends    lounge  korolenko brought him dr .  li and an unsmiling .  athletic young man with the look of eagles in his eyes .      yes .     derec said to the stranger .      this is special agent donovan     said dr .  li  frowning slightly .     of the terrestrial bureau of investigation .        chapter     questions .     the terry followed him and dr .  li to a more private conference room  where dr .  li left them .   the special agent looked derec over intently  but not in a hostile manner .  derec braced himself  shaky .  above all  he mustn   t mention robot city .  neither could he mention aranimas and wolruf .  they   d consider him crazy .   any break in his story would mean endless questioning  queries to the spacer worlds  questions about dr .  avery  the discovery of wolruf in orbit about kappa whale  perhaps the discovery of all that dr .  avery was doing .  .  . not all of that bad  but it would take time .  worst of all  the investigation would ultimately uncover robot city .  .  . and that secret had to be kept at all costs .   derec and ariel had to get back there .      i must warn you that this conversation is being recorded  and that anything you say may be used against you .  further  you have the right to remain silent  if you feel that your interests might be threatened by answering .  on the other hand  we have as yet no positive evidence that any crime has been committed .  the bureau has been called in primarily because you are allegedly a spacer .  .  . diplomatic reasons  that is      derec nodded  throat tight .      who are you .     the agent asked abruptly .      derec .         and your last name .      derec debated  decided not  and said     i sit mute .         that is your right .  do you wish a witness that you have not been coerced .         waived  but  uh     derec could not quite remember the spacer legal formula   so far it had seemed close to earth   s .  if anything  earth was more fanatical about preserving the individual   s rights than the spacer worlds were .     oh  i wish to retain the right to ask for a witness later .         waived right to a witness pro tern     said donovan  nodding shortly once  in faint approval .     i assume then that you do not mean to sit mute to all questions .  therefore  i ask you  have you ever had burundi   s disease  popularly known as amnemonic plague .         i don   t remember .     derec smiled faintly at the other and received a faint smile back .      do you remember your last visit to towner laney memorial hospital  two days ago  and the blood sample that was taken at that time .      derec remembered the visit  but not the blood sample .  even when donovan pointed at the red scab inside his left elbow  he still didn   t remember the sample being taken .   concerned  donovan said     do you assert that it was taken without your knowledge  particularly  do you accuse anyone of using anesthesia on you against your will .         is that a crime on earth .  no  i make no such   uh   assertion .  i just don   t remember .  .  . i was probably in a fog .  i usually am  these days .      the agent looked at him .     isn   t unauthorized anesthesia a crime on the spacer worlds .         it might be  but i doubt it .  i doubt that it happens often enough for anyone to pass a law against it .  the robots would prevent it  usually .         hmmm     said the terry  possibly reflecting that a robot saturated society might have its points .     in any case  i now inform you that a blood sample was taken from you on that occasion and carefully studied .  the conclusion of the doctors here  and at the mayo  and in bethesda  is that though you have antitoxins to burundi   s  you have never had the disease in its severe form .      derec stared at him .   donovan continued     yet  something you said to the spacer plague victim  and which she answered  indicates that your memory was lost in the characteristic fashion of this disease .  can you elucidate that  or do you wish to sit mute .      the robots .  thought derec .  furniture to a spacer  he had paid no attention .  and usually a robot   s discretion was proverbial  so much so that their testimony was rarely heard even in spacer courts .  but these had been instructed to record and play back everything that ariel said .  derec couldn   t remember what she and he had said  but they   d given the game away more than an earthly week ago .   had they mentioned robot city .      why do you ask .     he asked warily .      do you suffer from amnesia .     the other countered .   derec ought to sit mute .  he considered that seriously  wondered if perhaps it was already too late  then thought of a possible way around .      why do you ask .  surely it   s no crime to suffer amnesia .  nor would i expect the terries to be called in even if a spacer suffered .  the condition isn   t contagious  you know .         there are laws against harboring certain diseases  nevertheless     said donovan automatically  but he waved that aside .     public policy .  no  the question here is more serious .  essentially  two things about you alarm us .  one is that you do not remember your past .  the other is that you are not on earth .      derec gaped at him  almost started to ask exactly where st .  louis was .      officially  i mean     said donovan  frowning in irritation .     we   ve done a thorough computer check  and we find no sign of you before you appeared here a couple of weeks ago  eating at the section kitchen  big as life and twice as natural .  this was brought to our attention by the hospital   s accountants and computer operators  who have never discovered how your partner   s records vanished out of the hospital   s computer .      the terry looked at him again .     normally i wouldn   t reveal so much  but there   s a good deal of alarm in washington .  it   s considered that you are not the source of the mystery  and may in fact be unaware of it .  who sent you to earth  and why .      derec   s mind was spinning like a wheel  but he managed to say     i suppose you figure the ones who sent us have done this computer trick .  how could they possibly have .      donovan shrugged angrily .     any number of ways  i suppose .  there   s talk of bandit programs that take over computers .  more realistically  there   s talk of disappearing programs  that automatically wipe themselves after a certain time   that is  they contain instructions that cause the computer to wipe them  do you see .      derec nodded  a memory clicking into place .  he   d heard of such programs as toys  but a good computer could usually retain them .  and a network of computers .  .  . if you were getting food or lodging with your ration tag  that allocation would have to be routed through so many computers that though the first computer might lose the program  the memory of the transaction would remain .  his little erasure at the hospital had been simple  and he   d caught the accounting trail early  so there was no trace .   but of course there was no memory of their arrival in any earthly computer .  only in one earthly positronic brain .      violation of the immigration act can be charged against you     said donovan chattily .     we couldn   t make it stick without proof that you knowingly and deliberately invaded without the legal formalities .  but we could hold you pending an investigation .         we couldn   t go far in any case     said derec .     earth is one big jail .      donovan nodded .      any planet is .      derec tried to imagine how many computers in how many bureaus and branches of government would have to be foxed to slip a spy in .  his mind boggled  no wonder they were concerned .  far easier to believe that a ship sneaked in and dropped someone  despite orbital radar and other detection devices .   they were overreacting  easier to slip in spies in other guises  like traveling sociology students .  except that spacers never went anywhere on earth  and now here were two of them .      how many of you are there  on earth .     donovan asked casually .   it hit derec that he didn   t really know .  he had supposed that dr .  avery worked alone  but his belief that it was so didn   t make it so .  besides  dr .  avery worked through robots  and there could be any number of them     i don   t know     he said frankly .     we were told little .  i have reason to think that we are the only two .     he shrugged .     it   s hard to find volunteers for social studies on earth .  too few spacers care about the subject in the first place  they   d rather study robotics .      donovan nodded  sitting leaning slightly toward him  not at all relaxed .  there was so much energy and sheer competence in that pose that derec had the sudden realization that if he were to attack the earthman  the other would pinion him as efficiently as any robot .  if not quite as gently .  the idea of concealing the location of r .  david and the apartment seemed silly .  this man represented a planetwide investigative organization .      most of their agents are robots     he said  and that got an instant response  instantly blanked .   a nice fat red herring for you to follow  he thought gleefully  and then idly wondered what a red herring was  and on what planet the phrase had originated .      any idea who they are .     donovan asked  casual again .   very little .     only that it   s a sociological investigation .  there   s been some talk about laws of humanics  the mathematical expressions that describe how human beings relate to each other .  studies of society have been made on various spacer worlds  as disparate as aurora and solaria .     derec was detailing the theories of certain of the robots of robot city .   he finished with a shrug .     i suppose that they find earth the best case study  it having the densest population and the longest cultural history .         it seems odd that they   d memory wipe their agents just for a cultural study     said donovan dubiously .     what were you instructed to look for .      derec thought fast  holding his face as nearly expressionless as he could .  he felt that he was sweating .  keep it close to the truth  he told himself .     the study   s not so important  but uncontaminated data is .  if we entered openly  we   d be under the surveillance of your bureau .  understandable enough  spacers aren   t common on earth .         especially not in the cities     said donovan dryly .      the knowledge that we were being watched  followed  even protected  would affect what we observed .  it would be an emotional wall between us and earth people .  it would be a safety net .  it would prevent us from living like earthers .         and that   s what you were sent here to do .     the tbi man was skeptical  but not closed minded .      yes .  we weren   t told to look for anything specific  that would have warped our data .  we were simply told to go to st .  louis  to settle in  to spend some time  and to record our impressions .     the moment he spoke the last four words derec realized how big an error he   d made .   then he thought of an explanation .  but he was still sweating when the terry said     but that doesn   t explain why your memories were erased .         oh .  to prevent us from telling anything about the techniques by which our ids were wiped from your computers .  you see  they wanted us to disappear completely  to prevent contamination .       donovan nodded slowly .  derec couldn   t tell how much of it he had swallowed .      i see .  well  you have not yourself violated any law that we know of  except as accessory to violation of the immigration act  and computer fraud .  the last of which can    t be proven  because we have no records to cite .  we   ve found platinum and iridium that we think must have been dumped by your organization to pay for your support here .  there   s also some hafnium we can   t trace a source for .  you  or they  have more than paid for all you   ve consumed  so there are no complaints on that score .      donovan looked severely at him .     you understand that there are a lot of red faces at the tbi  and some angry ones elsewhere in washington .  i   m just the a in c of the local office  and even i felt the heat .  they don    t  we don   t  like having our computers messed with so freely  gato .  but nobody wants trouble either   certainly we don   t want to see you lynched .  sorry about your wife .  hope she gets better .  we suggest that you leave as soon after that as possible .      derec nodded  gulping  glad the other didn   t ask to see the    impressions    they were supposedly recording .  he could say she   d been taken sick so rapidly they hadn   t had time   true enough  too .  leaving when ariel got better was a good idea  too   and not just because of the sternly repressed dislike on the special agent   s face .     after that  things got worse .  for five days in a row they refused to let derec see ariel .  afterward  he could see her  but only her trimensional image  he wasn   t allowed in the room .  she passed through the crisis of the disease during that time  and they began to implant the earliest memories .  that left her in an hypnotic state most of the time  and when she wasn   t in it she was asleep or on the verge of sleep .      somnambulistic state     dr .  powell said .     though of course she can   t walk .  too weak yet .      derec grimly worked at recording and coding  eating little and sleeping less .  dreams of robot city haunted him waking and sleeping .  he couldn   t help brooding  while working  over such nonsensical questions as  did dr .  avery get out of robot city before it was shrunk  or was a tiny madman swimming through his bloodstream at this moment .  how about the human medical team  were they making the most of their opportunity to study human anatomy and biochemistry .   earthers whom he passed in the corridors and ways tended to avoid him  he looked sick and desperate  as his infrequent glances in mirrors told him .  not all earthers avoided him  however .  once a man glanced directly at him in personal  and derec was so accustomed to earthly ways that he was shocked .  then he thought for a startled moment that it was donovan .  but it wasn   t the special agent  it was merely a man who looked like him  a man with an easy  athletic carriage  an air of competence  and the look of eagles in his eyes .   another such man sat across from him at breakfast one morning  and occasionally he was half conscious of other tbi men about .  nothing so conspicuous as ducking into corners as he came by  or peering from doorways .  they simply were about .   he decided not to worry about it .  the terries had compelling reasons of their own for not making a scene  and so long as he gave no evidence of spying  he doubted they   d do anything .  probably they were there for his protection .  derec grinned faintly  the only hint of humor in all that bleak time  they were contaminating his observations .      i told you so     he said to the absent donovan .   being watched by the tbi did not bother him  he was used to being watched by mother hen robots .   he did think much  though  on what the terry had told him  he had never had the plague  though he had antitoxins to its neurotoxin in his blood .  he   d had the memory loss without the plague .  he   d received a dose of the neurotoxin without having had the disease .   well  his arrival on that ice asteroid  without his memory  while the robots were searching for the key to perihelion  never had seemed to him like an accident or a coincidence .  he felt  and always had  as if he were a piece in a game  being herded across the board for someone else   s reasons .  a mad someone else .   the only one he knew of with both the madness and the genius was dr .  avery .   they had to get back to robot city .   one morning during this period he looked up from table j   and saw korolenko next to him .  she was wearing her hospital whites  or he might not have recognized her .      eat your bacon     she said crisply as recognition dawned on his face .   the thought made him ill .  yeast based or no  it was fat and greasy and sickening .  his opinion of the bacon showed on his face .      then eat the eggs .  and the toast .     korolenko   s voice was grim .     look  mr .  avery  you won   t help your wife by collapsing of starvation .      derec wanted to say it was stress  not starvation  but realized that there was something in what she said .  he   d been living on fruit juices and caffeine .  he managed to choke down the toast and some of the scrambled eggs  with lots of hot  sweet tea .      that   s better .  we   ll see you at the hospital tomorrow .      that night derec had one of his worst dreams about robot city  and the next day he sat looking at nothing and thinking about it .  .   nothing silly about dr .  avery shrinking  or the human medical team .  he knew perfectly well that robot city was on its own planet   even during the dream .  what he was dreaming was that a miniature version had been injected into his blood  where it had started growing and reproducing .  here the dream became silly   the miniature city was getting iron from his red blood cells .  but there was nothing silly about the feeling it left him with .   come to think of it  robot city could be thought of as a kind of infection of the planet on which it had been established .  it  too  had grown from a single point of infection  a living organism that had grown and reproduced .   robot city inside him .  he could feel it there .  the feeling was so strong that he forgot all about eating  or going to the hospital .  even ariel was faint in the back of his mind .     chapter     amnesiac    ariel awoke slowly  stretched tired limbs  and looked about .  the hospital .  it seemed to stretch into the remote past .  she could scarcely remember a time when it wasn   t all around her .  the world beyond it was vague in her mind .  a city  she recalled .  no  a city  a city of earth  a humming hive of people  people  people .  beyond  though  was space  and stars  and the spacer worlds .   robot city was there  and derec  and the human medical team .  wolruf and mandelbrot  who had been called alpha  long ago .  aranimas  too  was out there somewhere .  beyond that   aurora .  she couldn   t remember .  aurora   everybody knew about aurora .  planet of the dawn  first settled from earth  land of peace and contentment and civilization  richest and most powerful of the spacer worlds .   the world she had called home  and which had exiled her  leaving her to die alone .   but no memories came .   she couldn   t remember her homeworld .  she couldn   t remember her parents  her school  her first robot .   of course not .  she had had amnemonic plague   burundi   s fever  they called it in the spacer worlds .  she had lost her memory .   but she was alive .  ariel began to weep .   a robot was at her bedside  a silly earth robot with a cheerful face .     mrs .  avery  are you well .  we have been ordered to minimize drug dosages to let you recuperate  but if your distress is too intense we can give you tranquilizers .      with an effort  she calmed herself enough to say     thank you  but i am quite well .  i merely weep in relief that i am alive .  i did not expect to survive .      the spell broken  she found the weeping fit over .  she was hungry .  she told them so  and was promptly fed .  afterward  feeling tired  very tired  vastly tired  from long lying in even the cleverest hospital bed with all its muscle tone retaining tricks  she drifted off to sleep .   when ariel awoke  she was aware again of who she was and that she had had amnemonic plague .  she had survived .  they told her that her memories would return gradually  based on the foundation they had implanted in her brain .  she didn   t believe them  but she didn   t care .  she was alive .   when she had eaten again  they told her     your husband is here .      husband .  for an awful moment she was totally blank .     my what .      they led in a thin  hollow eyed boy .      your husband   derec avery     said the robot .   after a moment  she recognized     his name isn   t derec .     she said  and at his anguished expression she halted .  no   david was dead  he had died of carbon monoxide poisoning on robot city .  no   he had disappeared   she didn   t know what had happened   her memories were scrambled  or gone .   derec .   after a moment she asked  hesitantly  half knowing it was wrong  half fearing it was wrong     husband .         why  of course     said he  smiling .  he looked so thin  the smile was a grimace on his wasted cheeks .  her heart bumped painfully  and she felt a pricking in her eyes .  one of his eyes closed and opened as he continued confidently     some things come back faster than others  they tell me   not much of a compliment to me that our wedding wasn   t the first thing you remembered .      ariel smiled and thought  avery .  she couldn   t remember how that name of all names was stuck on them   she knew he hadn   t been going under it .  but no doubt there was a logical explanation that she would remember in due time .  she remembered now their escape from robot city  their use of the key  leaving wolruf and mandelbrot  and their arrival on earth in a sparse apartment .   still smiling faintly  she leaned back and said     i do remember now  but it   s all a little faint   like  like a remembered dream .  i hope you won   t quiz me on it till i   ve had time to remember more .         of course not     he said  and the instant he had completed the phrase  a robot broke in .      the doctors    directions are that you not attempt to force the memories .  it would be better  mr .  avery  if you never questioned her about your past or hers .         yes  i   ve been told .  thank you     he said  with true spacer politeness toward robots .  here in the hospital  the medtechs and nurses called them all boy .      so when can i get out of this place and   and out .     she asked  feeling the suffocating terror of claustrophobia closing in .  gamely  she fought against it .  it had been her constant companion since arriving in the hospital  and all during her illness she had battled it .  if not for tranquilizers  she   d have lost her mind while losing her memory .      well  you   re still pretty weak physically  and the doctors are not sure yet about your memory .  they want to keep you here for a couple more days just on mind games .  after that    i dunno .  r .  jennie  do you know .         mrs .  avery must have several days of physical therapy before she can safely leave the hospital  mr .  avery     said the robot .      as for her memory  and her mind generally  i have not been informed .         if i don   t get out of here soon  i   ll go mad .     she said with a sudden vehemence that startled her .  there was an impulse to resist what her conditioning told her was a lapse into madness  but she had had all she could take of concrete caverns and crowds of   of troglodytes .     i want to see the sun again  and breathe air  and   and feel the grass  and        abruptly she was weeping  for in the midst of this catalog of sights that she had not seen since her memory began  there came a sudden demanding vision  an image of a garden  somewhere  of bright light and flowers and warmth  drowzy warmth  with bees humming sweetly on key  and the scent of orange blossoms .  someone she loved lay just out of sight .   ariel turned over and wept passionately for some minutes  her face in her pillow .  she felt a hand on her shoulder  not a robotic hand  and felt faintly grateful  but was too wretched to turn .   a detached  floating calm gradually washed away her tears  leaving her tired but spent .  tranquilizer  the robots never gave her more than a few minutes to weep .  they usually allowed her that   or she   d have gone mad from the inability to express her emotions at all .   when she turned  korolenko was there  frowning in conversation with   derec  she must remember always to call him .  that was right  that was what the earthers called him .  but there was another reason  which she couldn   t quite recall  why she must not use his true name .  or did she know his true name  after all .  she had forgotten so much  could she trust that memory too .   avery .  she thought  remotely astonished .  the drug made all emotions remote .   she wondered vaguely where dr .  avery was now .  still on robot city  she supposed .  for a moment she felt an ironic amusement at the thought that they had been using his apartment  his robot  and his funds on earth .  then she knew that this was an old amusement  she   d had this thought before  and with that thought  she remembered having had the amusement before .      memory is like drink     she said to the uncomprehending robot .  she felt a little light headed .   the nurse and a robot stepped aside as they spoke together and ariel looked  shocked  at .  .  . derec .      why is .  .  . he so   thin .     she demanded abruptly .      mr .  avery .  he had been under a strain  mrs .  avery .  he has been worried about you and has not been eating sufficiently .         does he have       her heart stopped  started painfully .        burundi   s fever .     again her heart shook her .      no  mrs .  avery .  he is merely under a strain .         he   s sick     she said .      no  mrs .  avery .         he is sick     ariel said positively  peering at him narrowly with the observant eyes of one who has recently passed near to the gates of death .     he is   dying .      nurse korolenko heard enough of that to frown at her  and one of the robots   r .  jennie  ariel thought   went to the control board at the head of the bed  but merely checked the readings .      derec is a young fool who has neither been sleeping nor eating  and who has spent all his time brooding over you     said korolenko  angry not at her or at derec  but at his stupidity .      there   s nothing else to do in that stupid apartment but stare at the ceiling     ariel said  irritated on his behalf .  why did he keep staring at her with eyes like holes in space .     frost  there   s not even a trimensional there .         you wanted to experience life as earth people do  and apparently low rated earth people at that  so you have no more than they do     korolenko said  shrugging .   wanted .  .  . to experience .  .  .  .  she turned eyes in inquiry on .  .  . derec  who shrugged also  grimacing ruefully .      perhaps you don   t remember that the institute wiped our memories temporarily before we came to earth  so we wouldn   t be able to reveal their techniques     he said .   ariel could only stare in amazement .     when you are well enough to travel  we will leave .  of course  since we   ve been discovered here  our purpose of sociological study is negated .  and once back on aurora  we will have our own recorded memories reimplanted .      she had heard of none of this .  the institute .  institute of what .  study .  of earth .  but  own recorded memories reimplanted .  .  .  . ariel leaned back and for a moment thought tears would leak from her eyes .      so you   ve lost your memory twice over  but it   s only temporary .         i   d like to know just how that   s done     growled a baritone voice .  after a moment ariel identified it  dr .  powell .  she had heard it often enough in the past weeks .     i know  i know  you haven   t the foggiest   only a brief layman   s description that doesn   t describe .      when she opened her eyes  they were all around her bed  with r .  jennie at the controls .      well  young lady  your request for a visit to the outdoors is a bit .  .  . unusual .     he visibly repressed a shudder of distaste at the thought  and ariel  fascinated  realized that to this man the outside was more fear inspiring than the claustrophobic city was to her .      we can   t very well add you to the list on a settler acclimatization group  and the only other people who go .  .  .  outside are the odd farming  mining  and pelagic overseers .  they are solitary as well as agoraphilic  very strange types  they wouldn   t welcome an addition .  certainly not a sick spacer .  and there   s nobody else to take care of you .         robots .     she asked weakly  looking at r .  jennie .   the doctor frowned  shook his head .     it   s difficult to move a robot through the city without having it mobbed and destroyed .  robots are being restricted more and more each year  we have half as many here now at towner laney than when i was an intern .  that leaves only your husband  and frankly  within a couple of days you   ll be taking care of him .         i   m all right     said derec with a flash of irritation that for a moment brought back the companion of the hospital station   ariel couldn   t remember the name  but she remembered the station   and of robot city .     what   s the signal coding of the local office of the tbi .         the what .     dr .  powell stared at him .     the comm number .  why would you want to call the terries .     from his tone it was obvious he had guessed  and seethed at the thought .      to get authorization to have robots moved through the motorways  and for permission to leave the city  if only for a short period .         hmmph .  medically           medically it would do her good  doctor     said the nurse quietly .      true  damn it  but we need to be sure that her mental condition   the implants           we can   t keep bringing her back and forth  i admit     said korolenko .      ariel  could you .  .  . hold off till tomorrow .     derec asked .   tomorrow .  .  . she was so tired  from inaction and drugs  that she   d sleep till then anyway .  .  . ariel could have stood anything for a tomorrow in the sun .      oh  yes  yes .     she   d be good  she   d  ariel had a moment of vivid memory  herself quite young  promising her mother that she would be very  very good .  was that when she   d been given her first robot .  or was that boopsie  the pup .   when the first vivid reexperience faded  she looked up and they had drawn apart .  it was no matter  it would be all right tomorrow .        never saw myself as nursemaid to a couple of spacers and a robot     said donovan .  the agent in charge had not trusted any of his men to go outside .   the hospital had an emergency entrance and egress for ambulances  and was a major junction on the motorways .  r .  jennie carried ariel down in its arms  ariel having chosen that over being wheeled  strapped to a gurney  or in a chair with wheels .   the hospital had supplied an ambulance  but the terry eyed it with distaste .     we   ll use the bureau car     he said .     there   s room for four of us  robot or no .      r .  jennie gently put ariel into the back seat and got in beside her  the car creaking and sinking under the weight until the suspension system analyzed the imbalance and compensated for it .  derec and donovan got into the front seat  and the agent took the controls and sent them surging silently down a ramp and into a lit but dim seeming tunnel .   for a moment ariel fought a scream  tensing  the claustrophobia was worse in such tight passages .  but she fought it off  helped by the speed of their passage .  signs blurred past soundlessly as the terry tapped more and more of the beamed power .  once the ceiling lit up in bloody light  and winking yellow arrows along the walls gave obscure warning .  then a blue car whipped by in the other direction  donovan having avoided it with the warning .      like the models we trained on     murmured derec  glancing back at her .   for a moment she was blank on that  the she remembered the roofless roads and the emergency vehicle monitors  the remote control sweaty in her hand  and the laughing students crowding around .  but that was nothing like this dim  empty wormhole .   glendale  kirkwood  manchester  winchester  ballwin  ellisville  the signs flowed past  as fast as the expressway would have taken them .  ariel ignored all the labyrinthine branchings and windings that twisted obscurely away right and left out of sight  peering past derec to see as far before them as possible .   the tunnel was a rectangle of dim light  two glowing tracks overhead and a pair of glowing  beaded tracks on the sides  the last being the glowing signs  fading into tininess .   at last  though  there came an interruption in the shape of the tunnel .  it got dark at the limit of vision  the darkness outlined in light .  presently the outline of light appeared as various warning signs .  the darkness was a ramp  leading up .   donovan slowed sharply  causing r .  jennie to lean forward and prepare itself for a snatch at the controls .      don   t worry  boy     said the terry  grinning but not looking back .  ariel had him in profile .     i   ve driven for thousands of hours  faster than this  and no problems .         twenty one point three percent of all major traumas to enter towner laney memorial hospital occur in the motorways     said r .  jennie  unperturbed .     fewer than twenty percent occur on the ways .  a few thousand humans use the motorways  seven million use the ways .         damn  i always hated know it all robots     grunted donovan  taking the ramp with unnecessary flair .     could never stand to live on any spacer world .  a man should have the right to go to hell in his own way .      the car eased to a stop at a barrier .  donovan played a tune on his computer controls and the barrier opened .  he drove through  they wound a complicated path that apparently avoided heavy traffic   there were thunderous rushing sounds through the walls  but no traffic in their motorway   and they were at a huge entry in the outer wall .   kilometer long lines of great trucks full of produce  some robot driven  most computer controlled  roared in with noisy  huge tires but silent engines and dived into the city just below them .  they were on a higher ramp  one of a dozen that leaped out of the city from high and low .  donovan stopped the car well back from that light blazing gap .      you   ll have to walk from here     he said abruptly .     car won   t go any further   no beamcast beyond the barrier .        chapter     robot city again       paulins     said r .  jennie .     they are used to cover machinery in the fields against rain and dew .  there are no tents available in the immediate vicinity of st .  louis .  perhaps in a day or two there will be a tent .      the plasticated canvas of the big paulins worked as well as a tent  strung over a couple of poles and tied to a tree limb .  it was needed more for shade than shelter .  this move to the country had not been a simple one  nor could they keep it up for more than a day or two .   but it was such a relief .   ariel could tell that derec felt the same sense of escape that she did .  the sky of earth was wide and blue and very high  and little puffy clouds ambled slowly across it  all framed by the pointed opening of the    tent .     the sunlight was just right .  the plants were the familiar green of earth life everywhere  and they too seemed just right .  except in greenhouses  she had probably never seen earthly plants in the natural light of the sun in which they evolved .  even the heat was not unpleasant .      we won   t need a tent  if we have to wait that long     said derec grimly .      you should return to the city as soon as you can     r .  jennie said .     mrs .  avery is far from recovered from the fever .      ariel felt quite recovered from the fever  though her memory was returning slowly .  weak as she undoubtedly was  she thought with concern  she could have wrestled derec two falls out of three and won .  but he said nothing about his own condition .      everything   s so .  .  . ordinary     said ariel  looking out at the kind of birds and plants and small animals she had seen all her life .  a squirrel is a squirrel  and sounds just the same on aurora .  even the shrilling of the unseen insects was familiar .  humans had taken their familiar symbiotic life forms with them to the stars .  she had expected earth to be more exotic .   the reality was a relief more than a disappointment .      it must have been a bad time for you     she said to derec  when r .  jennie had stepped out to the .  .  . kitchen .  they had been supplied with something called a    hot plate    and a dielectric oven .   derec moodily watched the robot prepare the packaged meals  designed for people with high enough ratings to permit them to eat in their own apartments .  this was luxury for their rate .      bad  well .     he shrugged  clearly not wishing to discuss it .     i did learn one thing from r .  david  there   s a spaceship belonging to dr .  avery in the new york port .  if we could get there           how  if our rating doesn   t permit us to travel that far .         we   ll have to get him to make id with higher ratings for us        r .  jennie stepped under the opening with a tray holding coffee and juices .  when she had gone  ariel said     i hope they don   t discover the apartment .         i suspect the terries know all about it  but won   t make trouble .  they want us gone before we get mobbed or something .  we   ve been very lucky .         couldn   t we ask donovan for assistance .     she asked wistfully .      we could .  i thought of it     derec said  broodingly .     but that   d be above his level  surely .  if earth can ignore us  it won   t be so badly embarrassed if we   re discovered here  investigating   or spying on   earth people .  but if they have helped us in any way  they can   t deny having known about us .         helping us would be seen as condoning our presence     she said grayly .     i understand .     politics seemed to be the same everywhere .     so what can we do .  get new id   will the terries spot that  do you think .         frost  i don   t know        r .  jennie gave them fruit cups and whipped cream  returned to the kitchen  a rustic scene in the frame of the tent opening .   the fruit was good  but unusual   compotes served in what she thought of as unsweetened ice cream cones .  it was like eating warm ice cream with strong fruit flavors .  all yeast  she supposed .      if they do spot us at it  i suppose they   d look the other way .  but what worries me is that it would alarm them .  they   d know we weren   t telling everything  they   d realize that r .  david   or someone   has id duplicating equipment .  they might well raid the apartment .      ariel thought about that for a moment .  as long as they weren   t arrested and the key to perihelion taken from them  it didn   t matter .      oh .  the key is focused on the apartment     she said .     we   d be unable to retreat to it .     she remembered well the occasion when they   d had to do so .      we will be in any case  we couldn   t begin to explain our reappearance     derec said .     they   d guess too much           zymoveal     said r .  jennie .     there is also a chicken wing for each of you .  chicken soup  made of real chicken with yeast enhancement .  bread  real potatoes  gravy .      a simple  hearty meal .  ariel ate with good appetite  but her stomach seemed to have shrunk .  weeks of eating little in hospital had altered her eating habits .  derec  however  carried on grimly  eating long after it became obvious that he   d had all he wanted  eating on to the edge of nausea .   when the robot had retreated  ariel said     i see .  it   s all or nothing .  well  if so i won   t weep .  if we could just get to new york .         don   t think i haven   t thought about it .  i   d be tempted to walk   it   s on this continent   but it   s a couple of thousand kilometers  and we   d starve .         too bad .  derec  why do you go on eating when anyone can see you   re full .      he looked up at her grimly  harassed  his eyes sunken  his face thin and lined .  .  . i   ve not been eating enough  or sleeping well enough .  everybody says so .  i need to get my strength back now that you   re well .         have you really worried that much about me .     she asked  her heart thumping .  she felt flattered  and also dismayed  as if it were her fault .      well  it isn   t just that .     derec lowered his fork  swallowed coffee  looked queasy .     i   ve been upset .  i haven   t been sleeping .  i i keep having this strange stupid dream .  about robot city .      ariel stared at him .  .   a stupid dream made you look like a walking wreck .         yes .     he looked .  .  . frightened .     ariel  there   s something unusual about this .  i i keep dreaming that robot city is inside me .  we   ve got to get back there .      robot city .   ariel   s mind was flooded with a hundred images  sounds  odors even  of the great robot inhabited planet  where the busy machines worked away like so many bees  building and building for the ultimate good of humans .  it was an earthly city without a roof  populated by robots rather than humans .  they   d been trapped there  first by the robots themselves  then by their mad designer  dr .  avery .      go back there .     she whispered tensely .     i   ll never go back .         we must     said derec  his voice just as low and determined  but also indifferent .  it was as if he was speaking not to her but to himself .     i   m dying or something .  i don   t know what dr .  avery did to me  but .  .  .      what had he not already done .  derec had lost his memory long ago  and only dr .  avery could have removed it .  she had known that as soon as she realized that he had lost all memory of her .  human beings were less than robots to avery  they were guinea pigs .   go back .  to save derec   s life .   but i   m cured .  she wanted to cry .  i can go back to aurora and say to them  look  the despised earthers cured me after you cast me out .  you don   t need to watch your sons and daughters lose their memories and die   you can cure them .  if you can persuade the earthers to tell you how .   there need be no more of this aimless existence  running from planet to planet  looking for a cure  for an excuse to go on hoping .  there could be a home  a place in society  all the wealth of associations that membership in the human society meant .   they could even consider the keys  the existence of aliens  robot city itself   they could report dr .  avery  turn the key over to the proper authority  shift the burden to other shoulders .   ariel sighed .      you don   t look good     she said .   after all  how much did she owe him  anyway .  at lot of apologies  if nothing else .  she   d blamed him wrongly for too much .      i hope there are star charts in the ship     he said .  derec put a hand to his brow .     if we can get back to kappa whale  we can take both ships back to robot city .  that   ll give us a spare .  dr .  avery won   t think of that   i hope .     he rubbed his face slowly  his eyes squinted as if the light were too bright .      is it getting dark .     he asked .      not yet     ariel said .     the sun will be setting in a little while  but it won   t start to get dark for another hour .         oh .         what kind of dreams have you been having .     she asked skeptically  thinking that they might have been right  if he   d not been eating  or sleeping  it might all be strain        like i said  i dream that robot city has been shrunk into my bloodstream .  i don   t know why it frosts me so  but it does .  i can   t shake it off .  it   s a    a haunting feeling .     he rubbed his face again  haggard .   ariel didn   t know what to say .     it .  .  . doesn   t sound like an ordinary dream .         i   m sure it   s no dream     he said instantly  looking sick .     something   s going on .     r .  jennie entered the opening of the tent and he said  dully     r .  jennie  what are chemfets .         i do not know  mr .  avery .         derec           i wish i could sleep .  it drives you crazy if you don   t have real dreams .         derec  you really look   awful .     ariel felt a stab of real fear .     oh  derec .      he looked as if he were about to throw up .  drooling  he pushed his light camp chair back  starting to get up .  he fell over .      derec .      r .  jennie came with a rush  cradled him as derec   s arms and legs started to flail .     he is having convulsions .  i do not know what is wrong     she said .     help me hold him        ariel was too weak herself to be of much help  but after a few moments derec   s seizure eased  he sighed heavily  and he began to breathe in a more normal fashion instead of inhaling in great tortured gasps .  his limbs relaxed  and r .  jennie warily lowered him to the carpet covered grass of the tent floor .      he seems to be much better  but this is not a natural sleep     said the robot .     unfortunately  there is no communo in the area  nor do i possess a subetheric link .  i must go for help .  ariel  you must watch him .         what do i do if he .  .  . has another seizure .     she asked  huskily .      hold him .  do not put a spoon in his mouth .     and with that puzzling admonition  the robot began to run toward the city .   greatly to her relief  derec awoke within ten minutes .     how are you .     she whispered  frightened .      i   m okay     he said faintly .  he did look greatly relieved .     chemfets     he said .      what .         robot city is inside me  in a manner of speaking .     derec struggled with her weak help to a sitting position .     i   m thirsty .      hastily  ariel poured him some juice .  he drank carefully  seeming a little dizzy .      we keep thinking of robots in terms of positronic brains     he said  seemingly at random .     but computers existed before positronic brains and are still widely in use .  at least a dozen computers of different sizes for every positronic brain  even on the spacer worlds .  and for a long time there   ve been desultory attempts to reduce computers in size and give them some of the characteristics of life .         derec   are you all right .      he looked at her seriously  haunting knowledge in his sunken eyes .     no .  i   ve been infected with chemfets .  microscopic  self replicating computer circuits .  robot city is in my bloodstream .  when i fell asleep just now  the monitor that dr .  avery implanted in my brain opened communication with them .         what .  .  . what are they doing .     ariel could scarcely grasp it  it was so strange .  what would a chemfet want .  was it truly alive .      growing and multiplying  at the moment .  i don   t think they   re anywhere near .  .  . call it maturity .  the monitor .  .  . i don   t think it   s of any use yet .  it   s as if they have nothing to say to me yet .         but they may later .     she asked swiftly .      i suppose .     he looked at her  haggard .     i wonder if they   ve been programmed with the three laws .      ariel grunted .     yes .  i suppose they   ve been upsetting your body systems .  no wonder you   ve been sick .  will .  .  .  will the dreams continue .      he thought about it  shook his head .     i don   t think so .  i think those were just the monitor trying to open contact .  once the channel is opened  it won   t be worked unless they have something to say .         how about if you have something to say to them .     ariel asked  with a flash of anger .      i suppose .  .  . if i learn how to work the monitor     he said dubiously .      and tell them to get out of your body because they   re killing you .  first law     she said .   then     i hope they   re programmed with the three laws .     frightened  she looked at him .   strength and purpose seemed to have flowed back into him  knowledge of what was going on  a drop in the subtle pressure the monitor had been putting on him  relief  a good meal .  it was something merely to know what the problem was .      we   ve got to get back to robot city     he said with determination .     i now know that part of my feeling on that was due to the pressure of the monitor .  the chemfets want me back there for some reason .  but we have our own reason for going back .  we   ve got to confront dr .  avery and make him reverse this    infestation .       ariel nodded in angry agreement .     yes .  dr .  avery has played his games with us  and especially with you  for too long .      he stood up  and though he leaned on the table  he seemed much stronger .     but how do we get off earth .         we   ll have to consult with r .  david .  if we can get back to the apartment without a lot of .  .  .         where   s r .  jennie .         she   s gone for help .  you had   convulsions .         no wonder my muscles are sore .  she   s gone for   doctors .  i can   t let them examine me        ariel grunted in understanding .     we   d never get away   they   d hospitalize you .     she looked at him .     they might even be able to cure you .      derec said     i   ve come to have a lot of respect for earth    s doctors  but this is a matter of robotics .  i think we   d better go back to the source .  i   d like to know what reason dr .  avery had for this   what did he hope to accomplish .      ariel could only shake her head .     just using you as a guinea pig  i suppose .         yes  but that shows that he has some reason for developing chemfets  even if he doesn   t care about me .  there must be some use for them .     as he spoke  derec was groping in his pockets .  he produced the key to perihelion .     at least  with r .  jennie gone  we can vanish without any questions being asked .         questions will be asked     she warned him .      yes     derec said  pressing the corners and taking her hand .     but not of us .        perihelion   s gray nothingness surrounded them .     they   ll assume some sensible explanation  involving the imaginary institute that sent us to earth     derec added  looking around in the gray fog .      i guess so     she said dubiously .     as long as we aren   t spotted in the city .          or any other city .      the apartment appeared around them  and derec sagged with the return to gravity .  alarmed  ariel threw her arm around him and instantly r .  david was there  supporting him from the other side .      mr .  avery .  what is the matter .      derec obviously hadn   t prepared an answer .      derec is sick     said ariel swiftly .     we must get him to aurora for treatment .  the spaceship is at new york city port .  how can we get there the soonest .         the fastest means of travel on earth is by air     said r .  david .  the robot hesitated  bending over to assure itself that derec wasn   t dying at that moment .      i   ll be okay     said derec  his voice low but firm .      what   s the fastest means of travel that our rating will permit us to use .     ariel asked .      air travel     said the robot .     isn   t it rationed .         no     said the robot .     you see  on earth  necessities are rationed on an as needed basis .  scarce luxuries  such as real meat and fish  or larger and better quarters  are rationed mostly on a basis of social standing .  some of the less scarce luxuries  such as candy and birthday cards  are available partly on a rationing basis and partly on a cash basis .  these are the so called    discretionary luxuries     minor items not everyone wants .      finally  luxuries in large supply are distributed purely on a monetary basis  and this includes air travel .  the air system was designed for emergencies .  since earth people hate to travel by air  the excess is freely available .  it is expensive  but your bank account cards are amply charged .      ariel fumbled through her wallet for the window with the cash card .  was it a real memory  or did she dream that she had dropped her purse on the expressway .  a dream  or else r .  david had replaced the id .     will our use of cash be monitored .     she asked .      that is not possible .  the privacy laws of earth forbid scrutiny or oversight of these monetary transfers  so the provision doesn   t exist .      since money could only be used for    minor luxuries     no wonder .     how do we get to an airport .      r .  david gave minute directions for taking the expressway to something he called lambert field  and after derec had rested for a few minutes they went out to the communo and called for reservations on the next flight to new york .  after two hours of fearful waiting for the knock of the tbi on the door  they ventured out for what ariel devoutly hoped would be the last time through the corridors and ways of the city .   each step of that passage brought back memories from just before the crisis of the amnemonic plague .  this time they rode the way only to the north south junction  changed ways  and rode north for longer than they had ridden east on their previous excursion  brentwood  richmond heights  clayton  university city  vinita park  charlack  the forgotten political divisions of a simpler time .  st .  john  cool valley  kinloch .   and then  after thirty minutes of standing and holding on  fearing every moment that derec would collapse  they saw lambert field airport  exit left .   the airport was a sleepy place  considering st .  louis city   s seven million people .  there was but one ticket window  the clerk there seemed subdued  and the few people in the waiting rooms never spoke or smiled .  presently their plane was announced .   not only was the passage to the place covered  but the runway it took off from was also roofed over .  there were no windows in the place  so they had a choice of sleeping or of watching the continuous news and entertainment feed in front of each seat .  earthers scheduled most flights for night  and the five other passengers   only five .  ariel remembered the crowded millions on the ways   the other passengers elected to sleep  those who could .  most were too nervous to try .  derec slept all the way to new york  to ariel   s intense satisfaction .  she slept most of the way herself .  best of all  in the air and the airports  nobody spoke to them or even looked at them .     chapter     stars again    derec looked up at the ship in relief and wonder .     i can   t believe we made it     he said .      we haven   t gotten in yet     said ariel  edgily .   he approached and inserted his id tab into the slot .  after a moment  it opened .     of course     he murmured .     r .  david gave us compatible ids .      the ship was a star seeker  identical  or nearly so  to the one they   d left in orbit around kappa whale .  on the ground  it was clumsy getting around inside it  but that was normal .  they climbed slowly to the bow control room .   ariel climbed easily   like derec  not pushing it   and he was relieved to see that she was gaining strength day by day .  he himself felt better after last night   s sleep than he had in weeks  but knew that his reserves were still very low .  the acceleration seat was a relief after the climb .      checklist  please     he said  depressing the ship key and speaking to the air .  the ship obediently displayed a checklist on a visor  and they went over it carefully .  some items had to be checked personally  most importantly  food .  ariel reported with concern that that was a low item .      only a few imperishables     she said     a few packages of radiation preserved foods and some cans .      derec hesitated .  that could be serious .      what do you think .         i   d say take the chance     ariel said .     the tbi must be going mad over our disappearance .  if they do a computer check  they may wonder about this spacer ship .  don   t tell me they don   t watch carefully every takeoff and landing .      of course they wouldn   t be able to interfere  earthers had little control over their own port  as they owned few ships .  still  if he and ariel started shopping for food        right .  we   ll go .      when they requested clearance it was readily given  and derec primed the jets and goosed the micropile .  the tubes burst into muffled thunder .  he switched to air breathing mode as soon as they had a little speed  and took an economical high g trajectory into space .  in minutes  the great blue world was off to one side .      which way .     ariel asked .   there was a slight technical advantage in aiming one   s ship toward one   s objective  since intrinsic velocity was unaltered by passage through hyperspace .  but the adjustment could be made at the other end .      straight out     he said .     i   m not exactly afraid of pursuit  but           right .          straight out    was in the direction earth was traveling .  ariel calculated their fuel and derec elected to use twenty percent .  he liked a lot of maneuvering reserve .  the bum wasn   t long  and when it was over  earth had not altered much .  it was more aft of them  and only a bit smaller .  now  though  there was a wall of delta v between them and it  in order to catch them  any ship would have to match their change of velocity    their delta v .      we   ve got time to kill     derec said  feeling tired .  reaction weighed him down even in the absence of gravity .      think we should rig the condenser .     ariel asked .   the thought of the excursion in a space suit made him feel even more tired .  then he thought  of course  ariel can do it .  she   s not sick any more .   she was still weak  though  despite her rapid recovery .  and he himself was not up to it .      it   s only for a week or two     he said .     i think the ship can handle it .  it   s only for two people  also .      ariel nodded .     listen     she said .     how do you feel .  you seem better after your sleep  but you   re still sick .  just knowing what   s going on inside hasn   t cured you .      that was true .     i feel tired at the moment .  why .         i want to talk about robot city .  i want to talk to you about everything we went through together  right back to the control room of aranimas   s ship  before rockliffe station .      she looked at him  her eyes big and intent .     i want all the help you can give me to recover my memory .      that he could understand .     of course  i   ll be glad to help .  i just wish i could be more helpful .      ariel opened her mouth  closed it  her face pink .     derec .  .  .     she said .     i .  .  . derec  i   m sorry i didn   t tell you more about yourself   about us .  but i couldn   t .  i couldn   t tell you i had amnemonic plague .  and i i can   t talk about us   from before .  i   m not sure of my memories   i   ve lost so much  and i don   t know how much i can trust of what i have now .  i   m sorry   but it   s just too uncertain   and too painful .      illness can make a person   s mind preternaturally clear .  this was a girl who had been exiled and disinherited for having contracted a hideous disease .     of course .      her feeling for him was obvious   the attraction  the repulsion  pain and pleasure intertwined in memories he didn   t share .  memories that now she couldn   t trust .      no need to apologize     he said gently .     there   s been nothing between us since aranimas   s control room .  your previous memories  real or unreal  are of a different and forgotten person   whose name i don   t even know .      she managed a weak smile .     true  that   person is forgotten .  it   s true .  you are a different person .  derec   do you mind if i don   t tell you your   his   name .  i   m not sure i really do know it .  besides  it   s easier for me to think of you as derec        derec suppressed a sharp  small pain .  his lack of a past was an emptiness that was always with him .     of course i don   t mind     he said .     some things are more important than others .  you are more important to me than any memory .      and that was certainly true .      oh  derec .     ariel plunged at him  grappled him in a bearhug that sent them wheeling  laughing  through the air of the little ship  colliding with the bulkheads and the control board .  fortunately  the hoods were down over the control sections .     lingering in the vicinity of earth for a week was a risky business on several counts  derec thought  but he had not wanted to bum more fuel unless he had to .  refueling was  in one sense  no problem  the rocket simply heated reaction mass with the micropile and flung it aft at very high velocity .  almost any kind of mass would do  and powdered rock in water   a slurry   was a very good reaction mass .  it could be gotten almost anywhere .  water was next best  the ship was equipped to handle slurry  and the pumps could deal easily with water .  these items were readily available in space or on planets .   there might not be time to stop and spend ten hours refueling  though .  and they could well find themselves in a system with abundant fuel for them  but lacking the reserve fuel necessary to maneuver to it .   ariel was a competent pilot herself  and had been traveling on her own for some time   derec didn   t know how long   before being captured by aranimas .  and she was more reckless than he .      if we   re going to spend all this time drifting  why don   t we do it in safety   at kappa whale .  or off robot city .         if we   re pursued  we   ll bum more     derec said .     that would mean we   d have to bum still more at robot city to lose our intrinsic velocity .         i think we should hurry     she said .     derec  i   m not happy about your condition .  i don   t think you   re getting better .  every now and then you go off into a sort of fugue .      it was true that occasionally the monitor opened  and the chemfets festering in his bloodstream droned an emotionless report into his mind about having overcome this or that difficulty or achieved this or that milestone of their growth .  he supposed all this would mean much to dr .  avery .  to him it meant nothing  but he was not able to tune out the reports .      at least i don   t go into convulsions anymore     he said .  the one incident was all there had been  but ariel was obviously still frightened by the memory .  he was glad he hadn   t been able to see himself .     you occasionally have   fugues  i guess  in an even more literal sense   yourself .      she nodded .     i see you do the same thing   i suppose you still have flashes of memory  when memories return  so vividly that you are there .         usually when i   m asleep  and i lose most of them     derec said .   her memories were returning in a massive way  compared to his own .  she wasn   t getting anything like a coherent account of her past life  of course  merely a chunk here and a chunk there .  like pages of a book torn out and scattered by the wind  here a leaf caught by a tree  there one against a house .   four days out from earth  with the mother planet a mere blue green brilliant star behind them  now getting closer and closer to sol  derec and ariel agreed that it was safe to open the hyperwave .  they called wolruf and mandelbrot at kappa whale  but got no answer .      can you shift the elements so it broadcasts on the same wavelengths as the keys to perihelion do .     ariel asked .   he had told her their deduction about the failure of the hyperwave aboard dr .  avery   s other star seeker  she had been in such a feverish state that it hadn   t registered with her at the time .   derec shook his head somberly .     it calls for precision tools and a fairly lengthy research effort .  first  just to determine what broadcasts the keys spray their static on .         ship static wavelengths  perhaps .         perhaps .  .  .  . likely  in fact .     hyperwave static was a fact of life  one the usual hyperwave link was designed to ignore .     but when did you even hear of a hyperlink designed to pick up static .      ariel smiled faintly  shook her head .   a week out from earth  they started calculating the jump to kappa whale .      it hasn   t been too long     said ariel .     wolruf   s food will hold out  of course  and so will their energy .  the micropile is good for years yet .  they   ve a sufficient supply of fuel to do what little maneuvering they may require .  they could jump out of kappa whale and back to avoid pursuit  if they have to .         so they should still be there .  where would they go  without us  if they acquired star charts .      ariel couldn   t guess .   charts were one of the first things he and ariel had checked for when they had entered the ship .  there was a complete set  and if there hadn   t been  they could have requested a copy from control .  one would have been beamed to them immediately  without a question .      it   s easier to calculate a single jump for kappa whale     he said .     but it definitely isn   t safer .      ariel calculated three jumps  and derec almost agreed .     the trouble is  kappa whale is nearly behind us .  your first jump turns us in hyper  which is possible  but it   s a strain on the engines .  i suggest we jump to procyon  which is near enough to our line of flight  and do a partial orbit about it  burning to bring us out on direct line for the first of your jumps .      she bit her lip and said     i   m sorry .  i know i   m too reckless .  i think it   s because i had a sheltered childhood .  i never got hurt much when i was a kid .      derec grinned .     i have to admit that in my few short months of life i   ve acquired a healthy respect for the laws of chance .      their first approximations done  all that remained was to put final figures into the computer and let it solve the equations of the jump .  they needed to know their correct speed and direction with some accuracy  so they would know what to expect when they landed in procyon   s arms .   ariel bent to the instruments while derec fumble fingeredly tried to set up the computer for their first jump .   after a long time  he said      ariel  can you handle this .  i can   t seem to concentrate  and my fingers are made of rubber .      she looked at him in concern .     i was afraid you were going off into a fever again .     twice before on the trip he had had feverish episodes  as the chemfets altered their growth  in turn altering the environment around them  him .   derec tried to fight off fear .  he had no idea yet of the ultimate purpose of the chemfets  and had not been able to    talk    to them .  worse  he had no idea if he was contagious .  after that one hug  they had avoided so much as touching each other  for fear that ariel  too  would be infected with them .   they could well kill him   and might not care if they did .      very well     ariel said  her voice trembling a little .     why don   t you take some febrifuge and stretch out .  maybe a nap will bring you out of it .      it sounded good to him .  the febrifuge had helped break the last fever  they thought .  he was swallowing the thick liquid carefully  because of free fall and a slightly swollen throat  when ariel cried out .      yes .     he said  catching his breath and relieved that he had not choked .      there   s a spaceship closing on us .      pursuit from earth .  he thought .   the star seeker didn   t have very good detection apparatus  mostly meteor detection .  it was this that had flashed an alarm .  meteors  however  do not move very fast .  this object was flashing toward them .  the detector gave two readings  and derec finally   through the throb in his head    concluded that their assailant had come up behind a more slowly moving rock .      we should be able to get some kind of picture     said ariel .      it   s still too far off  i think  for a visual image     derec said .  he blinked his eyes to bring his vision back to a single focus .     i wish we had neutrino detectors .      all nuclear power plants gave off neutrinos  and nobody bothers to shield them off .  a neutrino reading would give them an estimate of power generating capacity  and thus of ship size .  of course  a battleship and a medium freighter would have similar sized power plants  but some information would be better than none .      heat .         it isn   t burning at the moment     she told him  consulting the bolometer .     it must have spotted us days ago and burned to intercept .         go ahead and enter our jump in the computer     he said .  it was all he could think of  and it wasn   t much .     how long will that take .         too long     she said gloomily .     you are right  though .  it   s the best bet  especially if that   s an earth patrol ship .  derec  it might follow .      he opened his mouth to say that it didn   t matter  then closed it .     frost .      they intended to maneuver at procyon   they might be in the system a week  during which the bigger ship could hunt them down .  nor would there be any hope of help there .   he grasped at a straw .     bigger ships need more fuel .  if he can   t match our maneuvers           and you call me reckless .  let   s not bet on it  okay .         frost .      the other pilot wasn   t maneuvering  he was swooping in to intercept their course from behind and to one side .  he   d cross their course at a very sharp angle  pull ahead  and brake down  to let them drift into his arms .  he was moving quite rapidly relative to them  far faster than the rock he was coming up behind  and would have to burn soon or swoop helplessly by them .   their options were limited  they could fire their rockets to speed up  they could roll the ship and burn to slow down  or they could jump .  it would take time to set up the computer for that  jumping blind might not mean certain death  it might merely mean being permanently lost in the vastness of the galaxy    or the galaxies .  in hyper  all parts of the normal universe were equidistant .   or they could roll the ship ninety degrees and turn aside .   ariel didn   t consider it  and derec didn   t even think of it .  they had spent twenty percent of their fuel to acquire their current velocity .  they would retain it no matter how much they pushed    sideways    on their course .  it would therefore take another twenty percent of their fuel to turn the ship aside at an angle of a mere forty five degrees   a negligible turn .      call for help .     ariel asked dubiously .      he   ll be on us in twenty minutes or less     said derec glumly .  no help could possibly reach them .     unless he burns toward us .          unlikely .         true .     his head wasn   t working right .  the rapidly closing ship wouldn   t want more velocity toward them  it would have to brake down enough as it was  when it passed .      i think we can assume that no earth patrol will fire on us without sufficient reason     ariel said .     so i propose that we talk to them as politely as possible  but maintain course and speed .  we can burn if necessary  but           you think it   s earth patrol .     derec said  then nodded .     a spacer wouldn   t shoot  either           a spacer would be calling us .  face it .  whoever this is  it   s an enemy     ariel said .      we should have a good idea of our course and speed relative to sol before he reaches near point     derec said  nodding in agreement .     we can jump any time after that now that you have the prob input .      the enemy spaceship wasn   t going to ram  of course  its point of nearest approach was its    near point    with their course  but the two ships would be farther apart   it would then be ahead of them .      and we won   t provoke them     ariel finished .      what with .     derec asked  feeling lightheaded .      you know what i mean .      then derec had it     we do have a weapon           comm .     she cried  at the breaking crystal sound of the chime .      i hope it   s not a spacer ship     she said  worried  as she opened the channel .   both of them gasped at the face that appeared in trimensional projection above their board .     chapter     aranimas again    oh no  ariel thought .  aranimas .   the alien pirate   s cold visage regarded them .   his face was vaguely human  but had definite overtones of lizard .  the eyes  for instance  were widely set  almost on the sides of his face .  they were barely close enough together to give him binocular vision   but  unnervingly  aranimas didn   t much bother with binocular vision .  most of the time one eye focused on whatever he was looking at while the other roved  apparently supplying peripheral vision .   at the moment he was focusing on derec with both eyes .     derrrrec     he said .  high pitched  trilling  his voice was the most hateful thing ariel had ever heard .     arrriel .      glaring at them  he altered the focus of his comm and shrank to distance without moving  his humanoid figure coming into view from the waist up .  in this view much of his alienness wasn   t obvious  but they both had seen him in person .  he was as tall seated as derec was standing  and his disproportionately long arms had three times the span of a tall human   s .  thin body  thin neck  domed  thinly haired head  pale skin .  dark eyes  angry now .      wherrre is the key to perihelion .  you escaped with it instead of leading me to robots .      after a heart stopping moment   derec gulped  temporarily shocked out of his sickness   ariel said  with only a faint tremor in her voice     we lost it in the wreck .  w we   ve been in hospital on earth           you lie .  i detected three bursts of key static about this planet .  the firrrst  weeks ago  began elsewhere .  the last two began and ended here .  only the key broadcasts in this manner .      they looked at each other sickly .  before they could speak  the pirate pulled a small  gleaming  gold pencil out of a pocket .  ariel choked  and she heard a gulp from derec  too .  a pain stimulator .  it was  she knew  something like a human neuronic whip  but even more intense .  or perhaps aranimas was just more violent with its use .  it did no damage if not overused  like a neuronic whip  but no one was tough enough to take more than one    treatment    before deciding to cooperate .      you will tell all  and tell trrrue  or i kill you slow with this .      they did not doubt his sincerity .  nor would he listen to anything until he had taken the ship apart .  they couldn   t just give him the key  even if it could have been of use to him    it was initialized only for humans .  he wanted robots  among other things   power most of all .   derec reached over and cut the channel .      we have another option     he said  turning to her .       fe could use the key  call agent donovan  and put the whole problem in the laps of the tbi and whatever spacer authorities are on earth .  or we can try to deal with aranimas ourselves .         deal with him   how .     she said skeptically .      i don   t mean bargain .  ariel  you should use the key .     his plans were clearly hardening as he spoke .     i think i can ram that clumsy ship when he closes with us .      ariel felt herself pale .     no  derec  .         it   s the only way .  we can   t let him live .  he   s too dangerous           but       her face cleared .     we can use the key at the last instant .      derec looked at her .  the burst of adrenaline that had washed away his illness was fading .  she determined that she would not use the key unless he did  and he seemed to realize that .      okay  that   s what we   ll do .  we   ll pretend to surrender        he reached for the comm  but she grabbed his wrist .     no  derec  it won   t work .  he   ll never leave this ship maneuverable while he closes  .         it   s the only chance we   ve got     he said .     our only weapon is the jet   and the nose of the ship .  i   d like to fire the rocket at him  but he   d never pass in front of it .      ariel sighed  but she was unable to think of anything better .      okay .  go get the key .  i   ll fly the ship .      derec nodded in relief  clearly not up to it .   when they tuned back into the comm channel  aranimas was howling in his nonhuman voice  so shrilly as to make her teeth ache .      you will not brrreak communications again  humans .  you           very well .  we have conferred and agreed to accede to your demands     she said .     we ask only that you guarantee our lives  or we   ll destroy the key in front of your eyes .         you will not destroy the key .  i kill slow           not if we   re dead first     said derec  sounding tired and exasperated   the sound of a father dealing with wrangling children .     we want your promise .      the alien fell silent and studied them for a cold blooded moment .     verry well .  you have my promise i will not kill you if you give me the key  undamaged .      ariel had a moment in which she wondered if the alien might keep that promise .  but it didn   t matter  derec was right .  he had to die .  she felt a momentary pang for the harmless and spiritless narwe slaves with whom aranimas manned his ship .   derec pulled the key out of his shirt and showed it to him .  while aranimas stared greedily at it  ariel  at the controls  asked casually     shall we maneuver to match you .         no  i maneuver .      there was a tense few minutes while the alien turned from them to his controls  rolled his ship  waited  waited  waited  then burned toward them .  at the end of the burn the ship was not far away and still passing slowly .  again it rolled  now plainly visible  a vast  ungainly mass of half a dozen or more hulls stuck together .  how aranimas balanced that thing along a center of mass so he could fire rockets without spinning out of control  all without computer aid  ariel couldn   t imagine .   he   s too close  she thought  panicky .  they hadn   t time to get much velocity for the impact   or to set the key .  even as she thought  she glanced at derec  who started squeezing the corners of the key .  she slammed the rocket on  spinning the ship on its secondaries   the gyro  more economical of fuel  was much too slow .   aranimas might be flying a clumsy conglomerate  but he was a skilled pilot   and it was a battlewagon .  it had adequate sensors even aft  where the rockets were .  the pirate spotted their maneuver and blasted aside  not bothering to scream at them over the comm channel .   ariel looked over at derec  slammed into her seat by the acceleration  the key was ready  but they weren   t .  the alien ship was above them  then beside them  even as she struggled to turn nose on toward it .  too late   aranimas had slid aside .   ariel instantly cut the jet and started to spin ship  not to get too far away   aranimas   s gunners would have them in their sights the instant they cleared the near zone .  aranimas shrewdly slapped on more side thrust when he saw which way she was turning  in order to widen the gap between them .   then the collision alarm rang .   they heard aranimas yelling for the first time since the battle began .  ariel fought them onto a line with the alien ship  too busy to look about .      the rock is moving .     derec cried .   the chunk of rock that had swung in behind them and had gradually been overtaking them was now accelerating toward them at about a standard gravity   and the bolo registered the temperature of rocket exhaust .   wolruf   s face appeared beside the diminished figure of aranimas on their board .      hold him  derec .  i come .      what aranimas said was not intelligible  but energy lanced from the big ship at the rock .  the rock vaporized  its outline flashing away in puffs of incandescent vapor as the guns bore .  those same mighty weapons had vaporized cubic meters of ices and snow at near absolute zero on the ice asteroid where aranimas had first found derec .   underneath the flimsy camouflage was a little star seeker like their own .   ariel   s vision dimmed as she cut in the rockets    full power .  in a moment  she cut them off .  her head bobbed against the headrest  and the ship was again diving toward aranimas .  he rolled and blasted to avoid them  and something monstrous slapped their flank  making the ship ring .      puncture .     derec gasped  but she had no time .  she had to hold him till wolruf got there     aranimas rolled his big ship again  and again blasted to avoid her  throwing off his gunners    aim .  good job  he doesn   t have computerized .  ire control  ariel thought .   she was confronted with a split second tactical problem .  in moments they   d be past the alien ship  too soon to roll nose on toward it .  aranimas had seen their intent and was going the other way .  so she rotated further in the direction the nose was pointed  to bring their tail toward the enemy .   at the critical moment she blasted  and fire splashed over aranimas   s ship .  it must have rung like a bell .  there was a great outrush of air and assorted particles .  ariel was grateful she couldn   t see well enough to tell if the particles were kicking .   in a flashing moment they were past  and the reflected flame glare died  and aranimas was moving again  fire spurting from points on the ungainly hulls .  another kind of fire flashed  their own ship gonged when hit  jolted again  as ariel   s head rattled against the headrest and alarms yelled  derec was saying something as she spun the ship as rapidly as shaking hands would let her .  mistake .  she thought .  should never have blasted away from him  now they were far enough away for the gunners to sight them .   clenching her teeth  ariel rolled the ship again  trying to ignore the hits  hoping one wouldn   t disable them   or kill them .  a single stray bolt would     we   re still in their near zone     said derec  breathlessly .     glancing hits only         true .  she thought  smiling mirthlessly   they were still alive .   and then they had completed their roll  much farther from aranimas than she liked  and she blasted back .  no more hits  the uneven outline of the alien ship grew and grew in their vision screens  and she breathed more evenly .   then she had a moment of wonder  she felt better because she was not going to be killed by aranimas   s gunners in the next few moments .  but she was trying to commit suicide by ramming his ship .   aranimas began to slide aside and she automatically corrected  centering on the dark bulk .  what should she do .      wolruf is closing fast  but i don   t know if she   s still maneuverable     said derec tensely .     she got hit hard .         give her a call .      then aranimas   s ship loomed monstrous and the alien had arranged a surprise  a gun on the hull swung to bear on them .  what prodigies of effort had gotten it ready in the short time the battle had taken  they would never know .  it was a full sized gun  though its first bolt was weak  an aiming shot .   aranimas   s gunners were not the timid narwe .  they were starfish shaped creatures about whom ariel knew little  they avoided the light and breathed a slightly different atmosphere than the rest of the crew .  she felt no compunction about them  and spun the ship aside .  aranimas saw that and moved to prevent her from pointing her rockets at the new gun .   a second bolt flashed at them  but the gunners lacked aranimas   s own savage efficiency .      another puncture  and our antenna   s out     said derec calmly .   his calmness calmed her  and she made one more attempt to ram .  in turning away from her jet  aranimas had run before their nose .  she cracked on full power and they were hurled back into their seats .  her vision dimmed .  she thought it was the power fading .   too slow  the huge  bloated body of the enemy slid sideways even as it grew monstrous before them .  then the vision screen erupted in one pale flare  pale because the safety circuit wouldn   t transmit the whole visual part of the flash  the sensor had taken the next hit from the gun .      there went our bow .     derec cried .   ariel gulped  half expecting to see space before her  but they hadn   t lost that much of the bow .  with the vision out  she could only crouch  panting  at her board  the rocket off  hoping for     the key   trigger it       she cried  turning to him  knowing in a flashing moment that it was too late   they   d hit     the ship jolted  and the impact was quite different from the gun hits .  they were thrown forward against their straps  the ship shuddered  metal squealed  something broke   all in an instant   then they were free  the ship floating quietly .   air hissed out  alarms still burring and shrilling .  all communications out  no exterior view .  ariel touched her controls and the attitude jets responded  she could turn and burn again .  but they were blind .      suits .     said derec .      and see if the auto circuit can give us more eyes .      suits first  she thought .  when the air goes out of a small ship  it can go fast .  should have had them on all along  if they   d had time .   they scrambled into their suits in a free fall comedy that was deadly serious .  every moment ariel expected the lancing fire of a hit  but the ship continued serenely on its way .   they didn   t bother to try communications  knowing that the gun   s bolt  or the impact  must have destroyed the forward antennas .  vision  however  could be brought in from any quarter of the ship .  only the bow eyes were out .  after a bit of fumbling  they found an undamaged sensor that bore toward their late battle .      what   what is it .     ariel asked  awed .      i was about to ask you     derec said .     you know more about aranimas   s ship  you were on it longer           that was before my amnesia     she said .      oh .         i think   one of the hulls  broken free .      they had only a partial view of it   it was below the sensor   s view .  only a spinning  irregular curve of dark metal  with an occasional highlight gleaming  here and there a projection   derricks  turrets  landing ports  sensors   and interior beams .      it can   t be the whole ship     derec said finally .     but what happened to it .      ariel took a deep breath  found the air inside her suit rank with her sweat .     i   ll turn around .     she said  chagrined .     i didn   t realize how tense i was .      she wasn   t thinking .  i   ll never be a combat pilot  she thought shakily .  wasted minutes looking into a view i could   ve adjusted   or do pilots get used to this kind of thing .   but the human race had no combat pilots .  no telling how well they could perform .  grimly  she thought  if there are many of aranimas   s kind in space  we may have to learn .      aranimas   he disintegrated .     derec said .   the big composite ship was now a dozen big pieces in a cloud of hundreds of smaller ones .  they looked at each other .  derec   s face was as blank as she felt her own to be .      did we do that .     she asked .      i don   t see how   wolruf .      after a moment she nodded .     you must be right .  but where did she get the guns .      derec just shook his head .   if anybody was alive over there  they weren   t disposed to do any more shooting .  the wreckage was retreating slowly .  ariel came to herself with a start .      we   ve got to get back over there           frost  yes .      but how .      it wasn   t easy  but they worked it out .  the view they had gave them bearings .  they chose a spot that would enable them to miss any of the junk  and rotated the ship until its blind nose pointed along that bearing .  ariel then placed her hands on the board  looked into darkness  and thought  now we find out how good a pilot you are  girl .   in a moment she was back on aurora  about to do her first solo takeoff .  she had had that very thought  or something very close to it  and even more nervousness than now .  now  though  she was in shock .  the memories went on and on  the takeoff  the acceleration seeming more fierce than ever now that she had to remain conscious  the relief as the jets shut down  and then the indescribable free  floating sensation of one   s first solo orbit .      ariel .      her instructor        ariel .      with a shake  she brought herself out of it .     sorry .  memory fugue .     as her hands moved over the board   taking care to push the buttons on the real board instead of the remembered one   the memories went on  flashed back  picked up details  a whole chunk of her past restored to her by a chance thought  a chance repetition of forgotten circumstance .   she burned for ten seconds and rolled the ship to study the junk .  there should be detectors back there that would tell them how fast they were moving relative to the junk  but they weren   t working .  the junk still seemed to be receding .  ariel rolled and blasted for another twenty seconds  again looked .      that should do it .      they had only to wait  floating toward the wrecked ship aft end first  ready to burn to brake down .      how did she do it .        chapter     wolruf again       it   s hopeless     said derec .   mandelbrot was trying to patch their hull .      it   s got to work     ariel said  biting her lip behind her helmet .  .  . otherwise  wolruf         the other star seeker had been hit harder than their own and was scarcely maneuverable .  mandelbrot  using rockets welded onto his body and a line gun  had brought them close together  with ariel doing most of the maneuvering .  there was very little air in either ship   and there was no spacesuit for the caninoid alien .      we   ve been stressed too severely .  the best we can do is temporary patching .     derec tried to rub his head  and his hand encountered his helmet for the fifteenth time .  frustrated  he let it drop .      if it holds long enough to jump out of here       she said .   derec shook his head .     four jumps to robot city   five for safety     he said .  .  . that   s days of work checking courses and calculating .  i wouldn   t want my life to depend on that kind of patching .  and we   ll be maneuvering .  that   ll strain the patches even more .         something   s got to be done .  maybe aranimas   s ship        jumping at straws  and she knew it .     even wolruf doesn   t really know how to fly it   assuming any of us had the arm reach for that control board .  no computer aid  ariel .      she nodded soberly .  .  . i know .  it   s not possible  it   s these ships or nothing .          maybe there   s air or food over there .  we could use both .      they looked at each other somberly .  it was not a pleasant position .   on a wrecked ship  barely maneuverable  with most of its instrumentation out  leaking like a proverbial sieve  on a trajectory that would take it somewhere near procyon in a few million years  short on air  water  and food  with a friend on another  worse ship  sealed into a single room .      join the space service and see the stars     derec said  forcing a grin .   ariel grinned back  just as wanly .   the alien ship was all around them  and some of the pieces definitely had once been living .  derec  feeling none too good to start  avoided looking at them  though they were at such a distance that details were lost .  his imagination supplied them .  many were narwe  but there was a goodly number of the starfish shaped dwellers in darkness he had glimpsed in his brief time aboard the ship .      i   m amazed they aren   t trying something     he said again .  they   d both been saying that for nearly an hour .      derec .  .  . i think they   re all gone .      it could be .  but      dead .     he asked .   many were .  ariel shook her head  though .     i don   t think so .  i think they must have jumped out at the height of the battle .       leaning forward  derec eagerly scanned such of the surroundings as were visible  trying to count the hulls .  it was no use .     i don   t know how many hulls there were  and they all look different now .  the central one  i suppose  had the hyperatomic motors .  maybe some of the other hulls did  too .  i don   t think there   s more than one hull missing  though .         you agree  then .     she asked  worried .      i agree     he said .     knowing aranimas  if he were alive and here  he   d be shooting at us .  with something .         yes .     she was silent for a moment .     it   s not likely that all that damage could have been done by mandelbrot .      wolruf had dropped the robot off when she had braked sufficiently to bring the relative motion of the ships down to a level mandelbrot   s rockets could handle .  the robot had made a landing on the alien ship  damaging one knee joint  and then had swarmed allover it  planting explosive charges at the joins of the hulls .  the mighty ship had simply broken up .      we already know that there were explosive charges at the hull connections     derec said .  aranimas had dropped one of his hulls to make his escape at rockliffe station .      yes .  he must have blown them all  got his central hull free  and jumped .         if he jumped blind  he could be anywhere in the universe     derec said .     let   s hope he never finds his way back .      it wasn   t something they could count on .   half an hour later  mandelbrot called them on the radio and suggested that they go lock to lock with wolruf   s ship .  presently  ariel brought them together  mandelbrot guiding them  and the open airlocks grated together .  they were compatible  and with a little nudging clanked into position .      this join will not hold air long     observed the robot .     we must charge it  and wolruf must move fast  despite the bag .      they had been pumping their leaking air into bottles  to save at least some of it .  derec took one of the bottles to the lock  shoved its bayonet fitting into the lock   s emergency valve  and opened the bottle .  presently wolruf banged on the inner door  the outer door clanking shut behind her .  derec let the air continue to hiss to equalize pressure   but the bottle went empty first .   muttering  he jerked it out of the emergency valve  which closed automatically  and turned to the manual spill valve .  it took a good grip to hold that open  but after a moment pressure was equal and they hadn   t lost much of their precious air .   wolruf entered in a transparent plastic balloon  now half deflated under cabin pressure .  she looked a little short of breath   or scared  derec certainly couldn   t blame her .  it could not have been easy to flounder in free fall  inside that balloon  through the other ship and the twinned locks .   the little caninoid emerged from the release zipper with a shake  saying     thank    ou .  it wass a nervous time .  i    ave grreat fearr of the erani .         we think aranimas is gone     said ariel .      i    ope so  but i do not understand .      ariel explained tersely .      he would sshoot  if he could     wolruf agreed .   mandelbrot   s voice came over the radio .     i will enter the other ship and bring forth what items i can     he said .     you will need more organic feedstock for the food synthesizers  and of course air .  perhaps it would be wise to explore the alien ship also .      that was a thought .  it made derec more than a little nervous  and he could see that ariel wasn   t much happier .      that wreckage is grinding around a good bit .  still  the bigger pieces are getting farther and farther away from each other     she said .     it should be safe   as things go .         that apartment back on earth looks more and more cozy every minute     said derec with a weak laugh .      i sstay behind and fly ship     said wolruf .     i glad to do thiss  do not thank me .      laughing crazily  they floundered into their suits and crowded into the airlock with wolruf   s plastic bag .  normally it was used to convey perishable items across vacuum .  now they pumped it up to half cabin pressure  pushed it up against the inner door of the lock  and started the lock pumps .  as soon as lock pressure fell below half cabin pressure  the bag began to push them against the outer door .   their suits braced them against the push  and the expansion of the balloon speeded the removal of the air outside of the bag from the lock .  when the outer door was opened they were shoved out   ariel just quick enough to grab a handhold on the door  derec grabbing her foot .  laughing again  they shoved the balloon back inside and slammed the lock .   their first item was to transfer the undamaged antennas of wolruf   s ship to their own  and to replace the burnt out or smashed eyes .  the two ships floated near to each other  linked by the light  strong line .  derec had brought tools  and also made a stop gap repair on mandelbrot   s knee .  an hour of work saw that completed  while the pieces of the alien ship got farther and farther away .   they squeezed back inside the ship to rest  recharge their air  and eat .  ariel said tiredly     how did you come to be here   near earth   wolruf .      the caninoid snapped hungrily at synthetic cabbage .     when    ou jump with key  i hear static hyperwave .  i hear two burrsts static  and i get fix on one .  i expect it to be robot city  but iss not .  we know coordinatess of robot city .  it a long way away  but mandelbrrot and i jump to follow .  dangerouss  one long jump .  but we darrre not make more  orr we lose bearings .  sso one jump all we take .      she paused to gulp more food .  they were used to her table manners .      when we arrive at earth  mandelbrot make identification .  he lissten to broadcasst   hyperwave still not worrking   and tell me  iss earth  and explain earth .  we do not have to wonderr for long if thiss where    ou went with key .  i hear two more burrstss static  close together  same place  earth .  i not know how    ou use key so close together .         simple     said derec .  he was tired and his head felt unduly light  even more than free fall would explain .     the key was focused on that apartment .  using it to leave anyplace else  even on the same planet  takes you back to the apartment .  we won   t starve   if necessary we can always go back to number     sub corridor     corridor m  subsection a  section    of webster groves  in st .  louis city .         anyway  we wait .  after a while  though  we detect hyperwave burrst of aranimas   s sship arriving  and we know therre will be trrouble .  he also had detected key use .         how long has he known how to do that .     ariel asked .   wolruf shrugged .     possible he always knew .  aranimass not one for saying all he know .  or more likely he learrned since we left him at rockliffe station .  is obviouss when    ou think about it .         how so .     ariel asked sharply .      obviouss  key must be hyperatomic motor     said wolruf  and derec interrupted .      i don   t think so .  the robots of robot city learned to duplicate them   they may even have made the key we have .  i don   t think humans or their robots could duplicate any such radical advance in science and technology as would be represented by the reduction of a hyperatomic motor to pocket size .  i think the keys are very compact hyperwave radios .  these subetherics trigger the hyperatomic motors  which are elsewhere  and focused on the keys .     .         ah     ou think motors are in perihelion .      wolruf was a starship pilot too  and knew the theory of hyperatomics .     probably     said derec .   the caninoid made a sound of interest  paused to eat more  and resumed her tale after pondering derec   s conclusion .     anyway  we sat therre waiting  and aranimas sat thecre waiting .  we expected    ou to use the key and escape .  aranimas musst have been chewing nails and sspitting rivets .  he could not know what wass going on  and earth too big even for reckless one like him to attack .          how did you know we were us .     ariel asked  and derec  head throbbing  tried to follow the logic of her sentence .      when    ou used    our hyperwave radio  he musst have known .  aranimas bum to intercept  and we follow him .  we fortunate to be closerr by half a solar orbit  get in firrst .  aranimas not sstop to think how lucky he be to have crock to hide behind  going just his way almost as fasst as he .  only mistake he evecr make .       derec hoped it would be his last .      what did you do to his ship  though .     ariel asked  exasperated .      blow up .  all time we waiting in orrbit  we were making explosivess .  carbonite recipe in dr .  avery ship data bank .  i know enough chemistry to add oxidizer .  had to use food synthesizerr feedstock  but only one of me to feed  and i ssmall .      the robots had no doubt needed carbonite for the building of robot city .  derec knew generally how it was made  it was a super form of black powder  using activated charcoal saturated with potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate .  since the carbon was nearly all burned up   it approached one hundred percent efficiency and was therefore nearly smokeless carbonite was about ten times as powerful as tnt .      even so  it would not worrk if aranimass had not panicked and jumped .  but he could not know what wass happening .      derec nodded  immediately wished he hadn   t  the room seemed to spin .     his panic is understandable     he said .      are    ou all right .     wolruff asked .      no  but i   m not getting worse .  i mean  i   m feeling no worse than before the battle .      ariel broke in to explain about the chemfets  and wolruf was concerned but unable to help .  she knew nothing of robots  nor did any race she knew of  save humans .      i hope    ou will be well     she said  but clearly had her doubts .  she seemed shaken by the idea of this invasion .   derec thought of it as a disease  and at least had the hope that the chemfets were programmed with the three laws .      shall we go .     he asked .  he turned and found mandelbrot looking at him .      what do you intend to do about this infestation .     the robot asked .      go to robot city and either turn the problem over to the human medical team or seize dr .  avery and force him to reverse it   or both     said ariel .      i see .  i can think of nothing better  for i do not believe that the medical and or robotic resources of aurora or the other spacer worlds would be adequate to the task of eradication of chemfets     mandelbrot said .     that then must remain purely as a final resort .         rright     said wolruf .     we go find dr .  avery .  he worrse than aranimass .      the next step was to explore the alien ship .  they cast off from wolruf   s star seeker and jetted lightly toward one of the larger  more intact hulls .  they carried clubs  and ariel a knife from the galley  but they found it airless and had little fear of survivors .  there were none  as it turned out .  nor were there all that many bodies .      aranimas musst have sounded the recall and called them to the main hull     wolruf said .     they would be valuable to him  of courrse .      still  a good number of innocent narwe   and not so innocent starfish folk   had died in the battle .  they found nothing of immediate use in the first two hulls  and became depressed .      we must have air  if nothing else     mandelbrot said .      and we should also find organic feedstock for the synthesizers .  it is  you tell me  five jumps to robot city .  it will take at least three weeks  and then there is the final approach  and a reserve against emergencies .  this hull will not hold air for three days .  it can be patched up more  but probably not enough to hold air for more than a week .  we will need four complements of air  and even so  i must spend every moment patching till the jump .         you   ll be patching after every jump     derec said grimly .   mandelbrot was right .  they returned to the search  though the hulls were getting far apart now .   the next hull had been one occupied by the starfish folk  and they immediately gave up hope of finding air here  the strange aliens breathed a mix containing a sulfur compound that wolruf called    yellow gas .     on the way out  though  they found a robot .   at ariel   s cry  derec shook his head and took a deep breath .  the robot  when he came into the open chamber where she was  seemed a breath of sanity in unreality  the shot up spaceship  in free fall and airless  was like an escher print of an upside down world .  the body of one of the starfish folk was stuck to one wall  a vicious looking energy piston in one tentacled grip .  ariel and the robot were spinning slowly in the vacuum  drifting toward a bulkhead .  she had leaped to seize it .      it   s dysfunctional     she said .   timing his moves with hers  he intercepted them at the bulkhead and they turned their lights on it .  it made no move  but whether it was speaking or not  they could not tell .   mandelbrot entered while they were examining the robot   s body .     energy scoring on the head  and fuse marks here and there  mostly on the body .  it looks like the starfish over there shot it up during the battle .      how did it come to be in the ship .     ariel asked .      hmm .  i suppose aranimas must have come upon it somewhere and captured it     said derec .      where could he have found it .      derec considered .     possibly it   s one he found at the ice asteroid .  but i doubt it .  he was desperate for me to make him a robot .  he   d have given me all the parts he had .      mandelbrot fixed his cold eyes on the damaged robot .     this is a robot from robot city .         yes .     the design style was unmistakable to the trained eye .      let   s get it into air  maybe it   s trying to speak     said ariel .   but back in the star seeker it lay as inert as before .  removing his spacesuit  derec got out the toolkit and looked at mandelbrot .  the prospect of work on the robot made him feel better than he had in days .  a matter of interest .  they quickly learned that power to the brain was off .  reenergizing it  though  did no good .      a near miss from an energy beam might well cause brain burn out without visibly damaging the brain     said mandelbrot .   the positronic brain was a platinum iridium sponge  with a high refractivity  it wouldn   t melt easily .  but the positronic paths through it were not so resistant .      so we can learn nothing from questioning it     derec said  dejected .     wait a minute .  what   s this .      clutched tightly in its fist was a shiny object .  a shiny rectangular object .      a key to perihelion     said mandelbrot expressionlessly .       aranimas would have taken it away from the robot if he   d known it had one     said ariel .     i wonder what the robot was doing with it .         we   ll never know .  maybe it took the first moment it wasn   t under observation to try use the key .  and the starfish caught it in the act .     derec gripped the key and pulled it out of the fist .  instantly he knew it was different .      it feels like two keys built together .         it is     said mandelbrot  peering at it .     one  i suppose  to take the robot from robot city .  one to return him to robot city .         which is which .     ariel asked .   derec and mandelbrot spent a few minutes determining that .  they found that one key had a cable plug in one end .      i see     ariel said  when they showed her .     a tiny cable  with five tiny prongs .  it must be for reprogramming .  i don   t know what would plug into it           something like a calculator     said derec     to enable one to input the coordinates of the destination .       the other key had no provision for changing its programming  and was therefore set permanently on robot city .      not that it does us any good     said ariel wistfully .     it   s initialized for a robot .  too bad  we desperately need to get to robot city  especially derec .  and only mandelbrot can get there .         that is true  derec must go to robot city soon  and the key is better than three weeks in a ship  even if the ship did not leak     said mandelbrot .     i will take you there  derec .     he wrapped his normal arm around derec  half carrying him .      what about us .     ariel cried .     this ship is no safer for wolruf and me .      mandelbrot   s mutable avery designed arm was already stretching into a long tentacle .     that is correct   it is very likely that you and wolruf will die if you do not accompany us     he said .     therefore  i shall have to take you all .      the tentacle coiled about ariel and wolruf and splayed out into a small hand at the end .     the key  if you please  derec .      derec placed the doubled key in the small hand .     at least dr .  avery won   t be expecting us     he said .      he find out soon    nough     said wolruf .   mandelbrot extruded another finger from the hand that held the key to perihelion .  it rose up and pressed  in sequence  the corners of the key  and waited for the activating button to appear .  knowing it was irrational  derec felt the air get staler in the tiny pace of time it took .  then  perihelion .   and then a planetary sky burst blue and brilliant above them .  they were breathing deeply  standing atop the compass tower   the mighty pyramid that reared over dr .  avery   s robot city .     data bank  illustrations by paul rivoche      r .  david  this robot is a typical example of an earthly robot .  like all robots  it possesses a positronic intelligence infused with the three laws of robotics .  r .  david wears a blandly smiling face  a standard feature on all earth robots  which are designed to reassure terrans .  the terran economy is based on full employment  not full automation like the spacer worlds .  thus robots are used only for those jobs that humans cannot or will not take .  terrans rarely come into contact with robots  increasing their fear and dislike of them .   r .  david is cruder in appearance than the positronic denizens of robot city because he has been designed to look less powerful  less invulnerable  and hence les threatening to suspicious humans .  he lacks the streamlined and efficient appearance of the robots dr .  avery created for robot city .       star seeker ship  dr .  avery   s small craft is the interstellar equivalent of an economy car  a small personal starcraft capable of transporting a maximum of six people .  the star seeker model comes equipped with only the essentials needed to sustain life during an interstellar voyage .  there are no luxuries .  there is a food synthesis system  a water purification and recycling system  which includes a shower  and sanitary facilities .     the ship   s communications system consists of hyperwave  microwave  and laser transmitters and receivers .  the hyperwave antenna is mounted in a nacelle in the ship   s nose  as far as possible from the hyperatomic engines to avoid disruption of the communications signal .   the ship   s computer is a less than positronic intelligence  actually not much more than a glorified calculator and information storage system .   like all interstellar ships  star seekers jump through hyperspace  with massive thrusts of the hyperatomic motors that propel the ship at right angles to time and all three spatial dimensions simultaneously .  ships cannot jump without precise coordinates  so their guidance systems lock onto beacons in orbit around stars along the lanes of interstellar travel .        the underground city of st .  louis  terran cities are enclosed  largely underground  and entirely dependent on the terran power grid .  light  ventilation  and climate control are all artificially maintained  and if power were to be disrupted for even an hour  it would mean the extinction of the city   s population .   in the enclosed cities of earth   s future  citizens rarely travel beyond the city of their birth  and almost never go outside .  agoraphobia is so widespread as to be the norm of human behavior .   st .  louis  like the other enclosed terran cities  is connected to the rest of the world by its communications systems  airport  and the highway system traveled mostly by robot driven  or remote controlled trucks .   travel within the cities is accomplished on the expressways .  there is some use of small trucks for transport of goods within the cities  but most freight is sent over a system of moving slidewalks .  personal vehicles are almost unknown  and are basically the prerogative of the very rich and powerful .   the city scene shown here is late at night .  normally  the streets and escalators are clogged with people .         expressways  this is the average citizen   s primary means of transportation in terran cities .  the expressways move at varying speeds  with the slowest ones at the outside to make it easier to enter  and the fastest lanes in the center .  there are expressways to all areas of the city .   to accommodate rush hour crowds  special rules go into effect  restricting access to certain lanes to the citizens with the highest ratings .   for earther   s  using the expressways is as natural as breathing  and terran babies learn to use them as soon as they learn to walk .         loading docks  the loading docks are one of the few areas that connect directly with the world outside of the city  and even then  the entryways are slanted at oblique angles to prevent the people working on the docks from gaining a potentially debilitating view of the outside .  the trucks are mostly remote controlled or robotically driven  though some are driven by hardy truckers who can tolerate the open roads without being crippled by their agoraphobia .  truckers willing to make hauls between cities are highly sought after and very well paid .   once trucks enter the loading docks  their cargo is transferred to the smaller inner city transports by loading vehicles known as handlers .        lambert field  although air travel is rarely used by the average citizens of terran cities  every city has an airport .  the airport itself  like the rest of the city  is totally enclosed  including the runways .  the airliners are windowless  to avoid traumatizing the agoraphobic passengers .  each seat on the airliner is equipped with a viewing screen that provides a constant feed of news and entertainment to occupy the thoughts of edgy air travelers .  sedatives are also provided for those passengers who wish to sleep during the entire trip  thus minimizing their trauma .       special agent donovan  donovan is the agent in charge of the st .  louis office of the terrestrial bureau of investigation .  the tbi is the global investigative force  which is charged  among other tasks  with keeping tabs on all earthside spacers in order to avoid any unpleasant incidents between the spacers and the less privileged earthers .   tbi agents are a tough  well trained corps of policeman .  in common with his brother agents  donovan is athletic  intelligent and relentlessly efficient .       rob chilson
