wrote a series of six derring do novels about david  lucky  starr and his battles against malefactors within the solar system .  each of the six took place in a different region of the system and in each case i made use of the astonomical facts as they were then known .   now  a quarter century later  gregg press is bringing out the novels in new hardcover editions  but what a quarter century it has been .  more has been learned about the worlds of our solar system in this last quarter century than in all the thousands of years of earlier observations .   prior to the     s  you see  we could only look from earth s surface  since then  we have been able to send out rocket probes to take photographs and make studies at close range .   the only one of the six lucky starr novels that has remained untouched by this at least so far is lucky starr and the pirates of the asteroids  which was written in      .  there is evidence that many of the asteroids may be a little darker and just a little larger than had been thought earlier  but that makes very little difference .   therefore  lucky can fight the pirates and engage in his deadly  vi  preface  duels right now just as he did a quarter century ago  when this book was written .  it i had to write the novel today  i would hardly have to change a word .   isaac asimov  dedication  to frederik pohl   that contradiction in terms

burnished lines of the space ship glittered in the bright earthlight that filled the moon s night sky .  its blunt prow pointed upward into empty space .  vacuum surrounded it and the dead pumice of the moon s surface was under it .  the number of its crew was zero .  there wasn t a living person aboard .          dr .  hector conway  chief councilor of science  said   what time is it  gus .    he felt uncomfortable in the moon offices of the council .  on earth he would have been at the very top of the stone and steel needle they called science tower .  he would have been able to look out the window toward international city .   here on the moon they did their best .  the offices had mock windows with brilliantly designed earth scenes behind them .  they were colored naturally  and lights within them brightened and softened during the day  simulating morning  noon  and evening .  during the sleep periods they even shone a dim  dark blue .   it wasn t enough  though  for an earthman like con way .  he knew that if he broke through the glass of the windows there would be only painted miniatures before     lucky starr  his eyes  and if he got behind that  then there would be just another room  or maybe the solid rock of the moon .   dr .  augustus henree  whom conway had addressed  looked at his wrist .  he said  between puffs at his pipe   there s still fifteen minutes .  there s no point in worrying .  the atlas is in perfect shape .  i checked it myself yesterday .     i know that .   conway s hair was pure white and he looked older than the lank  thin faced henree  though they were the same age .  he said   it s lucky i m worried about .     lucky .    conway smiled sheepishly .   i m catching the habit  i m afraid .  i m talking about david starr .  it s just that everyone calls him lucky these days .  haven t you heard them .     lucky starr  eh .  the name suits him .  but what about him .  this is all his idea  after all .     exactly .  it s the sort of idea he gets .  i think he ll tackle the sirian consulate on the moon next .     i wish he would .     don t joke .  sometimes i think you encourage him in his idea that he ought to do everything as a one man job .  it s why i came here to the moon  to keep an eye on him  not to watch the ship .     if that s what you came here for  hector  you re not on the job .     oh well  i can t follow him about like a mother hen .  but bigman is with him .  i told the little fellow i would skin him alive if lucky decided to invade the sirian consulate singlehanded .    the doomed ship     henree laughed .    i tell you he d do it   grumbled conway .   what s worse  he d get away with it  of course .     well  then .     it would just encourage him  and then someday he ll take one risk too many  and he s too valuable a man to lose .           john bigman jones teetered across the packed clay flooring  carrying his stein of beer with the utmost care .  they didn t extend the pseudo gravity fields outside the city itself  so that out here at the space port you had to do the best you could under the moon s own gravity field .  fortunately john bigman jones had been born and bred on mars  where the gravity was only two fifths normal anyway  so it wasn t too bad .  bight now he weighed twenty pounds .  on mars he would have weighed fifty  and on the earth one hundred and twenty .   he got to the sentry  who had been watching him with amused eyes .  the sentry was dressed in the uniform of the lunar national guard  and he was used to the gravity .   john bigman jones said   hey .  don t stand there so gloomylike .  i brought you a beer .  have it on me .    the sentry looked surprised  then said regretfully   i can t .  not when i m on duty  you know .     oh well .  i can handle it myself  i guess .  i m john bigman jones .  call me bigman .   he only came up to the sentry s chin and the sentry wasn t particularly tall  but bigman held out his hand as though he were reaching down with it .      lucky starr   i m bert wilson .  you from mars .   the sentry looked at bigman s scarlet and vermilion hip boots .  nobody but a martian farm boy would let himself be caught dead in space with them .   bigman looked down at them proudly .   you bet .  i m stuck here for about a week .  great space  what a rock the moon is .  don t any of you guys ever go out on the surface .     sometimes .  when we have to .  there isn t much to see there .     i sure wish i could go .  i hate being cooped up .     there s a surface lock back there .    bigman followed the thumb that had been jerked back across the sergeant s shoulder .  the corridor  rather poorly lit at this distance from luna city  narrowed into a recess in the wall .   bigman said   i don t have a suit .     you couldn t go out even if you had one .  no one s allowed out without a special pass for a while .     how come .    wilson yawned .   they ve got a ship out there that s getting set to go   he looked at his watch   in about twelve minutes .  maybe the heat will be off after it s gone .  i don t know the story on it .    the sentry rocked on the balls of his feet and watched the last of the beer drain down bigman s throat .  he said   say  did you get the beer at patsy s port bar .  is it crowded .     it s empty .  listen  tell you what .  it ll take you fifteen seconds to get in there and have one .  i ve got nothing to  the doomed ship     do .  i ll stay right here and make sure nothing happens while you re gone .    wilson looked longingly in the direction of the port bar .   i better not .     it s up to you .    neither one of them  apparently  was conscious of the figure that drifted past behind them along the corridor and into the recess where the space locks huge door barred the way to the surface .   wilson s feet took him a few steps toward the bar  as though they were dragging the rest of him .  then he said   nah .  i better not .           ten minutes to zero time .   it had been lucky starr s idea .  he had been in con way s home office the day the news arrived that the t . s . s .  waltham zachary had been gutted by pirates  its cargo gone  its officers frozen corpses in space and most of the men captives .  the ship itself had put up a pitifully futile fight and had been too damaged to be worth the pirate s salvage .  they had taken everything movable though  the instruments  of course  and even the motors .   lucky said   it s the asteroid belt that s the enemy .  one hundred thousand rocks .     more than that .   conway spat out his cigarette .   but what can we do .  ever since the terrestrial empire has been a going concern  the asteroids have been more than we could handle .  a dozen times we ve gone in there to clean out nests of them  and each time we ve left enough to breed the troubles again .  twenty five years ago  when          lucky starr  the white haired scientist stopped short .  twenty five years ago lucky s parents had been killed in space and he himself  a little boy  had been cast adrift .   lucky s calm brown eyes showed no emotion .  he said   the trouble is we don t even know where all the asteroids are .     naturally not .  it would take a hundred ships a hundred years to get the necessary information for the sizable asteroids .  and even then the pull of jupiter would be forever changing asteroidal orbits here and there .     we might still try .  if we sent out one ship  the pirates might not know it was an impossible job and fear the consequences of a real mapping .  if the word got out that we had started a mapping survey  the ship would be attacked .     and then what .     suppose we sent out an automatic ship  completely equipped  but with no human personnel .     it would be an expensive thing to do .     it might be worth it .  suppose we equipped it with lifeboats automatically designed to leave the ship when its instruments recorded the energy pattern of an approaching hyperatomic motor .  what do you suppose the pirates would do .     shoot the lifeboats into metal drift  board the ship  and take it to their base .     or one of their bases .  right .  and if they see the lifeboats try to get away  they won t be surprised at finding no crew aboard .  after all  it would be an unarmed survey ship .  you wouldn t expect the crew to attempt resistance .    the doomed ship      well  what are you getting at .     suppose further that the ship is wired to explode once its temperature is raised to more than twenty degrees absolute  as it certainly would if it were brought into an asteroid hangar .     you re proposing a booby trap  then .     a gigantic one .  it would blow an asteroid apart .  it might destroy dozens of pirate ships .  furthermore  the observatories at ceres  vesta  juno  or pallas might pick up the flash .  then  if we could locate surviving pirates  we might get information that would be very useful indeed .     i see .    and so they started work on the atlas .          the shadowy figure in the recess leading to the moon s surface worked with sure quickness .  the sealed controls of the air lock gave under the needle beam of a micro heatgun .  the shielding metal disc swung open .  busy  black gloved fingers flew for a moment .  then the disc was replaced and fused tightly back by a wider and cooler beam from the same heatgun .   the cave door of the lock yawned .  the alarm that rang routinely whenever it did so was silent this time  its circuits behind the tampered disc disarranged .  the figure entered the lock and the door closed behind him .  before he opened the surface door that faced out into the vacuum  he unrolled the pliant plastic he carried under his arm .  he scrambled into it  the material covering him wholly and clinging to him  broken only by a strip of clear silicone plastic across his eyes .  a small cylinder of     lucky starr  liquid oxygen was clamped to a short hose that lead to the headpiece and was hooked on to the belt .  it was a semi space suit  designed for the quick trip across an airless surface  not guaranteed to be serviceable for stretches of more than half an hour .          bert wilson  startled  swiveled his head .   did you hear that .    bigman gaped at the sentry .   i didn t hear anything .     i could swear it was a lock door closing .  there isn t any alarm  though .     is there supposed to be .     sure .  you ve got to know when one door is open .  it s a bell where there s air and a light where there isn t .  otherwise someone is liable to open the other door and blow all the air out of a ship or corridor .     all right .  if there s no alarm  there s nothing to worry about .     i m not so sure .   with flat leaps  each one covering twenty feet in the moon s baby gravity  the sentry passed up the corridor to the air lock recess .  he stopped at a wall panel on the way and activated three separate banks of ceiling floressoes  turning the area into a noonday of light .   bigman followed  leaping clumsily and in perpetual danger of overbalancing into a slow nose landing .   wilson had his blaster out .  he inspected the door  then turned to look up the corridor again .   are you sure you didn t hear anything .     nothing   said bigman .   of course  i wasn t listening .    the doomed ship     five minutes to zero time .   pumice kicked up as the space suited figure moved slow motion toward the atlas .  the space ship glittered in the earthlight  but on the moon s airless surface the light did not carry even an inch into the shadow of the ridge that hemmed in the port .   in three long leaps the figure moved across the lighted portion and into the pitchy shadow of the ship itself .   he moved up the ladder hand over hand  flinging himself into an upward drift that carried him ten rungs at a time .  he came to the ship s air lock .  a moment at the controls and it yawned open  then closed .   the atlas had a passenger .  one passenger .          the sentry stood before the corridor air lock and considered its appearance dubiously .   bigman was rattling on .  he said   i been here nearly a week .  i m supposed to follow my side kick around and make sure he doesn t get into trouble .  how s that for a space wrangler like me .  i haven t had a chance to get away       the anguished sentry said   give it a rest  friend .  look  you re a nice kid and all that  but let s have it some other         .    time .   for a moment he stared at the control seal .   that s funny   he said .   bigman was swelling ominously .  his little face had reddened .  he seized the sentry by the elbow and swung him about  almost overbalancing himself as he did so .    hey  bud  who re you calling a kid .     look  go away .       lucky starr   just a minute .  let s get something straight .  don t think i let myself get pushed around because i m not as tall as the next fellow .  put  em up .  go ahead .  get your fists up or i ll splatter your nose all over your face .    he was sparring and slipping about .   wilson looked at him with astonishment .   what s got into you .  stop being foolish .     scared .     i can t fight on duty .  besides  i didn t mean to hurt your feelings .  i ve just got a job to do and i haven t got any time for you .    bigman lowered his fists .   hey  i guess the ship s taking off .    there was no sound  of course  since sound would not travel through a vacuum  but the ground under their feet vibrated softly in response to the hammer blows of a rocket exhaust lifting a ship off a planet .    that s it  all right .   wilson s forehead creased .   guess there s no use making a report .  it s too late anyway .   he had forgotten about the control seal .          zero time .   the ceramic lined exhaust pit yawned under the atlas and the main rockets blasted their fury into it .  slowly and majestically the ship lifted and moved upward ponderously .  its speed increased .  it pierced the black sky  shrinking until it was only a star among stars  and then it was gone .          dr .  henree looked at his watch for the fifth time and said   well  it s gone .  it must be gone now .   he pointed with the stem of his pipe to the dial .   the doomed ship     conway said   let s check with the port authorities .    five seconds later they were looking at the empty space port on the visiscreen .  the exhaust pit was still open .  even in the near ultimate frigidity of the moon s dark side it was still steaming .   conway shook his head .   it was a beautiful ship .     still is .     i think of it in the past .  in a few days it will be a rain of molten metal .  it s a doomed ship .     let s hope that there s a pirate base somewhere that s also doomed .    henree nodded somberly .   they both turned as the door opened .  it was only bigman .   he broke into a grin .   oh  boy  it was sure nice coming in to luna city .  you could feel the pounds going back on with each step you took .   he stamped his feet and hopped two or three times .   see   he said   you try that out where i was and you hit the ceiling and look like one big fool .    conway frowned .   where s lucky .    bigman said   i know where he is .  i know where he is every minute .  say  the atlas has just taken off .     i know that   said conway .   and where is lucky .     on the atlas  of course .  where do you think he d be .    chapter    vermin of space  dr .  henree dropped his pipe and it bounced on the linolite flooring .  he paid it no attention .    what .    conway reddened and his face stood out  plumply pink  against his snowy hair .   is this a joke .     no .  he got on five minutes before it blasted .  i talked to the sentry  guy called wilson  and kept him from interfering .  i had to pick a fight with the fellow and i would have given him the old bingo bango   he demonstrated the one two punch with quick  hard blows at the atmosphere   but he backed off .     you let him .  you didn t warn us .     how could i .  i ve got to do what lucky says .  he said he had to get on at the last minute and without anyone knowing  or you and dr .  henree would have stopped him .    conway groaned .   he did it .  by space  gus  i should have known better than to trust that pint sized martian .  bigman  you fool .  you know that ship s a booby trap .     sure .  lucky knows it too .  he says not to send out ships after him or things will be ruined .     they will  will they .  there ll be men after him within the hour just the same .    henree clutched his friend s sleeve .   maybe not      lucky starr  hector .  we don t know what he s planning to do  but we can trust him to scramble out safely whatever it is .  let s not interfere .    conway fell back  trembling with anger and anxiety .   bigman said   he says we re to meet him on ceres  and also  dr .  conway  he says you re to control your temper .     you      began conway  and bigman left the room in  a hurry .          the orbit of mars lay behind and the sun was a shrunken thing .   lucky starr loved the silence of space .  since he had graduated and joined the council of science  space had been his home  rather than any planetary surface .  and the atlas was a comfortable ship .  it had been provisioned for a full crew with only so much omitted as might be explained by consumption before reaching the asteroids .  in every way the atlas was intended to look as though  until the moment of the pirates  appearance  it had been fully manned .   so lucky ate syntho steak from the yeast beds of venus  martian pastry  and boneless chicken from earth .   i ll get fat  he thought  and watched the skies .   he was close enough to make out the larger asteroids .  there was ceres  the largest of all  nearly five hundred miles in diameter .  vesta was on the other side of the sun  but juno and pallas were in sight .   if he were to use the ship s telescope  he would have found more  thousands more  maybe tens of thousands .  there was no end to them .   once it had been thought that there had been a planet  vermin of space     between mars and jupiter and that geologic ages earlier it had exploded into fragments  but that wasn t so .  it was jupiter that was the villain .  its giant gravitational influence had disrupted space for hundreds of millions of miles about it in the eons when the solar system was being formed .  the cosmic gravel between itself and mars could never coalesce into a single planet with jupiter pulling and pulling .  instead it coalesced into myriads of little worlds .   there were the four largest  each a hundred or more miles in diameter .  there were fifteen hundred more that were ten and a hundred miles in diameter .  after that there were thousands  no one knew exactly how many  that were between one and ten miles in diameter and tens of thousands that were less than a mile in diameter but still as large or larger than the great pyramid .   they were so plentiful that astronomers called them  the vermin of space .    the asteroids were scattered over the entire region between mars and jupiter  each whirling in its own orbit .  no other planetary system known to man in all the galaxy had such an asteroid belt .   in a sense it was good .  the asteroids had formed steppingstones out toward the major planets .  in a sense it was bad .  any criminal who could escape to the asteroids was safe from capture by all but the most improbable chance .  no police force could search every one of those flying mountains .   the smaller asteroids were no man s land .  there were well manned astronomical observatories on the largest  notably on ceres .  there were beryllium mines on pallas      lucky starr  while vesta and juno were important fueling stations .  but that still left fifty thousand sizable asteroids over which the terrestrial empire had no control whatever .  a few were large enough to harbor fleets .  some were too small for more than a single speed cruiser with additional space  perhaps  for a six month supply of fuel  food  and water .   and it was impossible to map them .  even in the ancient  preatomic times  before space travel  when only fifteen hundred or so were known  and those the largest  mapping had been impossible .  their orbits had been carefully calculated via telescopic observation and still asteroids were forever being  lost   then  found  again .          lucky snapped out of his reverie .  the sensitive er gometer was picking up pulsations from the outer reaches .  he was at the control board in a step .   the steady energy outpourings of the sun  whether direct or by way of the relatively tiny reflected dribbles from the planets  were canceled out on the meter .  what was coming in now were the characteristically intermittent energy pulses of a hyperatomic motor .   lucky threw in the ergograph connection and the energy pattern traced itself out in a series of lines .  he followed the graphed paper as it emerged and his jaw muscles hardened .   there had always been a chance that the atlas might meet an ordinary trading ship or passenger liner  but the energy pattern was none of that .  the approaching ship had motors of advanced design  and different from any of the terrestrial fleet .   vermin of space     five minutes passed before he had enough spread of measurement to be able to calculate the distance and direction of the energy source .   he adjusted the visiplate for telescopic viewing and the star field speckled enormously .  carefully he searched among the infinitely silent  infinitely distant  infinitely motionless stars until a flicker of movement caught his eyes and the ergometer s reading dials lined up at multiple zero .   it was a pirate .  no doubt .  he could make out its outlines by the half that glittered in the sun and by the port lights in the shaded half .  it was a thin  graceful vessel  having the look of speed and maneuverability .  it had an alien look about it  too .   sirian design  thought lucky .   he watched the ship grow slowly larger on the screen .  was it such a ship that his father and mother watched on the last day of their lives .          he scarcely remembered his father and mother  but he had seen pictures of them and had heard endless stories about lawrence and barbara starr from henree and conway .  they had been inseparable  the tall  grave gus henree  the choleric  persevering hector conway  and the quick  laughing larry starr .  they had gone to school together  graduated simultaneously  entered the council as one and done all their assignments as a team .   and then lawrence starr had been promoted and assigned to a tour of duty on venus .  he  his wife  and his four year old son were venus bound when the pirate ship attacked .      lucky starr  for years lucky had unhappily imagined what that last hour upon the dying ship must have been like .  first  the crippling of the main power drives at the stern of the ship while pirate and victim were still apart .  then the blasting of the air locks and the boarding .  the crew and passengers scrambling into space suits against the loss of air when the air locks caved in .  the crew armed and waiting .  the passengers huddling in the interior rooms without much hope .  women weeping .  children screaming .   his father wasn t among the hiders .  his father was a council member .  he had been armed and fighting .  lucky was sure of that .  he had one memory  a short one that had been burned into his mind .  his father  a tall  strong man  was standing with blaster raised and face set in what must have been one of the few moments of cold rage in his life  as the door of the control room crashed inward in a cloud of black smoke .  and his mother  face wet and smudged but clearly seen through the space suit face plate  was forcing him into a small lifeboat .    don t cry  david  it will be all right .    those were the only words he remembered ever having heard his mother say .  then there was thunder behind him and he was pressed back against a wall .   they found him in the lifeboat two days later  when they followed its coldly automatic radio calls for help .   the government had launched a tremendous campaign against the asteroid pirates immediately afterward and the council had lent that drive every last ounce of their  vermin of space     own effort .  for the pirates it turned out that to attack and kill key men of the council of science was bad business .  such asteroid hideouts as were located were blasted into dust  and the pirate menace was reduced to the merest flicker for twenty years .   but often lucky wondered if they had ever located the particular pirate ship that had carried the men who had killed his parents .  there was no way of telling .   and now the menace had revived in a less spectacular but far more dangerous fashion .  piracy wasn t a matter of individual jabs any longer .  it bore the appearance of an organized attack on terrestrial commerce .  there was more to it .  from the nature of the warfare carried on lucky felt certain that one mind  one strategic direction  lay behind it .  that one mind  he knew  he would have to find .          he lifted his eyes to the ergometer once more .  the energy recordings were strong now .  the other vessel was well within the distance at which space courtesy required routine messages of mutual identification .  for that matter  it was well within the distance at which a pirate might have made its initial hostile move .   the floor shuddered under lucky .  it wasn t a blaster bolt from the other ship  but rather the recoil of a departing lifeboat .  the energy pulses had become strong enough to activate their automatic controls .   another shudder .  and another .  five altogether .   he watched the oncoming ship closely .  often pirates shot up such lifeboats  partly out of the perverted fun of     lucky starr  it and partly to prevent escapees from describing the vessel  assuming they had not done so already through the sub ether .   this time  however  the ship ignored the lifeboats altogether .  it approached within locking range .  its magnetic grapples shot out  clamped on the atlas s hull  and the two vessels were suddenly welded together  their motions through space well matched .   lucky waited .   he heard the air lock open  then shut .  he heard the clang of feet and the sound of helmets being undipped  then the sound of voices .   he didn t move .   a figure appeared in the door .  helmet and gauntlets had been removed  but the rest of the man was still swathed in ice coated space suit .  space suits had a habit of doing that when one entered from the near absolute zero of space into the warm moist air of the interior of a ship .  the ice was beginning to melt .   the pirate caught sight of lucky only when he was two full steps into the control room .  he stopped  his face frozen in an almost comical expression of surprise .  lucky had time to note the sparse black hair  the long nose  and the dead white scar that ran from nostril to canine tooth splitting the upper lip into two unequal parts .   lucky bore the pirate s astonished scrutiny calmly .  he had no fear of recognition .  councilmen on active duty always worked without publicity with the very thought that a too well known face would diminish their usefulness .  his own father s face had appeared over the sub ether only after his death .  with fleeting bitterness lucky  vermin of space     thought that perhaps better publicity during life might have prevented the pirate attack .  but that was silly  he knew .  by the time the pirates had seen lawrence starr the attack had proceeded too far to be stopped .   lucky said   i ve got a blaster .  i ll use it only if you reach for yours .  don t move .    the pirate had opened his mouth .  he closed it again .   lucky said   if you want to call the rest  go ahead .    the pirate stared suspiciously  then  eyes firmly on lucky s blaster  yelled   blinking space  there s a ripper with a gat here .    there was laughter at that  and a voice shouted   quiet .    another man stepped into the room .   step aside  dingo   he said .   his space suit was off entirely and he was an incongruous sight aboard ship .  his clothing might have come out of the most fashionable tailor shop in international city  and would have suited better a dinner party back on earth .  his shirt had a silken look you got only out of the best plastex .  its iridescence was subtle rather than garish  and his tight ankled breeches blended in so well that  but for the ornamented belt  it would have seemed one garment .  he wore a wristband that matched his belt and a fluffy  sky blue neck sash .  his crisp brown hair was curly and looked as though it received frequent attention .   he was half a head shorter than lucky  but from the way he carried himself the young councilman could see that any assumption of softness he might make on the basis of the man s dude costume would be quite wrong .      lucky starr  the newcomer said pleasantly   anton is my name .  would you put down your gun .    lucky said   and be shot .     you may be shot eventually  but not at the moment .  i would like to question you first .    lucky held fast .   anton said   i keep my word .   a tiny flush appeared on his cheekbones .   it is my only virtue as men count virtue  but i hold fast to it .    lucky put down his blaster and anton picked it up .  he handed it to the other pirate .    put it away  dingo  and get out of here .   he turned to lucky .   the other passengers got away in the lifeboats .  right .    lucky said   that s an obvious trap  anton        captain anton  please .   he smiled  but his nostrils flared .    well  then  it s a trap  captain anton .  it was obvious that you knew there were no passengers or crew on this ship .  you knew it long before you boarded .     indeed .  how do you make that out .     you approached the ship without signaling and without a warning shot .  you made no particular speed .  you ignored the lifeboats when they shot out .  your men entered the ship carelessly  as though they expected no resistance .  the man who first found me entered this room with his blaster well bolstered .  the conclusion follows .     very good .  and what are you doing on a ship without crew or passengers .    lucky said grimly   i came to see you  captain anton .    chapter    duel in word  anton s expression did not change .   and now you see  j   me .    but not privately  captain .   lucky s lips thinned and closed with great deliberation .   anton looked quickly about .  a dozen of his men in every stage of space suit undress had crowded into the room  watching and listening with gaping interest .   he reddened slightly .  his voice rose .   get on your business  scum .  i want a complete report on this ship .  and keep your weapons ready .  there may be more men on board and if anyone else gets caught as dingo did  he ll be tossed out an air lock .    there was slow  shuffling motion outward .   anton s voice was a sudden scream .   quickly .  quickly .   one snaking gesture  and a blaster was in his hand .   i ll count three and shoot .  one  .   .   .  two  .   .   .    they were gone .   he faced lucky again .  his eyes glittered and his breath came and went quickly through pinched white nostrils .    discipline is a great thing   he breathed .   they must fear me .  they must fear me more than they fear capture by the terrestrial navy .  then a ship is one mind and one arm .  my mind and arm .       lucky starr  yes  thought lucky  one mind and one arm  but whose .  yours .   anton s smile had returned  boyish  friendly  and open .   now tell me what you want .    lucky jerked a thumb toward the other s blaster  still drawn and ready .  he matched the other s smile .   do you intend shooting .  if so  get it over with .    anton was shaken .   space .  you re a cool one .  i ll shoot when i please .  i like it this way .  what s your name .   the blaster held on its line with deadly steadiness .    williams  captain .     you re a tall man  williams .  you look strong .  and yet here i sit and with just a pressure of my thumb you re dead .  i think it s very instructive .  two men and one blaster is the whole secret of power .  did you ever think of power  williams .     sometimes .     it s the only meaning to life  don t you think .     maybe .     i see you re anxious to do business .  let s begin .  why are you here .     i ve heard of pirates .     we re the men of the asteroids  williams .  no other name .     that suits me .  i ve come to join the men of the asteroids .     you flatter us  but my thumb is still on the blaster contact .  why do you want to join .     life is closed on earth  captain .  a man like myself could settle down to be an accountant or an engineer .  i might even run a factory or sit behind a desk and vote at  duel in word     stockholders  meetings .  it doesn t matter .  whatever it is  it would be routine .  i would know my life from beginning to end .  there would be no adventure  no uncertainty .     you re a philosopher  williams .  go on .     there are the colonies  but i m not attracted by a life as a farm boy on mars or as a vat tender on venus .  what does attract me is the me on the asteroids .  you live hard and dangerously .  a man can rise to  power as you have .  as you say  power gives meaning to life .     so you stow away on an empty ship .     i didn t know it was empty .  i had to stow away somewhere .  legitimate space passage comes high and passports to the asteroids aren t being handed out these days .  i knew this ship was part of a mapping expedition .  the word had got around .  it was headed for the asteroids .  so i waited till just before it blasted off .  that s when everybody would be busy getting ready for take off and yet the air locks would still be open .  i had a pal take a sentry out of circulation .    i figured we d stop at ceres .  it would be bound to be prime base for any asteroid expedition .  once there  it seemed to me i could get off without trouble .  the crew would be astronomers and mathematicians .  snatch off their glasses and they d be blind .  point a blaster at them and they d die of fright .  once on ceres i d contact the pi    the men of the asteroids  somehow .  simple .     only you got a surprise when you boarded ship .  is that it .   asked anton .    i ll say .  no one aboard and before i could get it straight in my mind that there wasn t anyone aboard  it blasted off .       lucky starr   what s it all about  williams .  how do you figure it .    i don t .  it beats me .     well  let s see if we can find out .  you and i together .   he gestured with his blaster and said sharply   come      on .   the pirate chief led the way out of the control room into the long central corridor of the ship .  a group of men came out of a door up ahead .  they rumbled short comments at one another and stilled into silence when they caught anton s eyes .   anton said   come here .    they approached .  one wiped a grizzled mustache with the back of his hand and said   no one else on board this ship  captain .     all right .  what do you think of the ship .    there were four of them .  the number increased as more men joined the group .   anton s voice grew edgy .   what do any of you think of the ship .    dingo pushed his way forward .  he had got rid of his space suit and lucky could see him as a man .  it was not altogether a pleasant sight .  he was broad and heavy and his arms were slightly bowed as they hung loosely from bulging shoulders .  there were tufts of dark hair on the back of his fingers and the scar on his upper lip twitched .  his eyes glared at lucky .   he said   i don t like it .     you don t like the ship .   anton asked sharply .   dingo hesitated .  he straightened his arms  threw back his shoulders .   it stinks .     why .  why do you say that .    duel in word      i could take it apart with a can opener .  ask the rest and see if they don t agree with me .  this crate is put together with toothpicks .  it wouldn t hold together for three months .    there were murmurs of agreement .  the man with the gray mustache said   beg your pardon  captain  but the wiring is taped in place .  it s a two bit job .  the insulation is almost burnt through already .     all the welding was done in a real hurry   said another .   the seams stand out like that .   he held out a thick and dirty thumb .    what about repairs .   asked anton .   dingo said   it would take a year and a sunday .  it isn t worth it .  anyway  we couldn t do it here .  we d have to take it to one of the rocks .    anton turned to lucky  explaining suavely   we always refer to the asteroids as  rocks   you understand .    lucky nodded .   anton said   apparently my men feel that they wouldn t care to ride this ship .  why do you suppose the earth government would send out an empty ship and such a jerry built job to boot .     it keeps getting more and more confusing   said lucky .    let s complete our investigation  then .    anton walked first .  lucky followed closely .  the men tagged behind silently .  the back of lucky s neck prickled .  anton s back was straight and fearless  as though he expected no attack from lucky .  he might well feel so .  ten armed men were on lucky s heels .   they glanced through the small rooms  each designed     lucky starr  for utmost economy in space .  there was the computation room  the small observatory  the photographic laboratory  the galley and the bunk rooms .   they slipped down to the lower level through a narrow curving tube within which the pseudo grav field was neutralized so that either direction could be  up  or  down  at will .  lucky was motioned down first  anton following so closely that lucky barely had time to scramble out of the way  his legs buckling slightly with the sudden access of weight  before the pirate chief was upon him .  hard  heavy space boots missed his face by inches .   lucky regained his balance and whirled angrily  but anton was standing there smiling pleasantly  his blaster lined up straight and true at lucky s heart .    a thousand apologies   he said .   fortunately you are quite agile .     yes   muttered lucky .   on the lower level were the engine room and the power plant  the empty berths where the lifeboats had been .  there were the fuels store  the food and water stores  the air fresheners  and the atomic shielding .   anton murmured   well  what do you think of it all .  shoddy  perhaps  but i see nothing out of order .     it s hard to tell like this   said lucky .    but you must have lived on this ship for days .     sure  but i didn t spend time looking it over .  i just waited for it to get somewhere .     i see .  well  back to upper level .    lucky was first  down  the travel tube again .  this  duel in word     time he landed lightly and sprang six feet to one side with the grace of a cat .   seconds passed before anton popped out of the tube .   jumpy .   he asked .   lucky flushed .   one by one the pirates appeared .  anton did not wait for all of them  but started down the corridor again .    you know   he said   you d think we d been all over this ship .  most people would say so .  wouldn t you say so .     no   said lucky calmly   i wouldn t .  we haven t been in the washroom .    anton scowled and for more than just a moment the pleasantness was gone from his face  and only a tight  white anger flashed in its place .   then it passed .  he adjusted a stray lock of hair on his head  then regarded the back of his hand with interest .   well  let s look there .    several of the men whistled and the rest exclaimed in a variety of ways when the appropriate door clicked open .    very nice   murmured anton .   very nice .  luxurious  i would say .    it was .  there was no question of that .  there were separate stall showers  three of them  with their plumbing arranged for sudsing water  hike warm  and rinsing water  hot or cold  .  there were also half a dozen washbowls in ivory chrome  with shampoo stands  hair driers and needle jet skin stimulators .  nothing that was necessary was missing .      lucky starr   there s certainly nothing shoddy about this   said anton .   it s like a show on the sub etherics  eh  williams .  what do you make of this .     i m confused .    anton s smile vanished like the fleeting flash of a speeding space ship across a visiplate .   i m not .  dingo  come in here .    the pirate chief said to lucky   it s a simple problem  you .  we have a ship here with no one aboard  thrown together in the cheapest possible way  as though it were done in a hurry  but with a washroom that is the last word .  why .  i think it s just in order to have as many pipes as possible in the washroom .  and why that .  so that we d never suspect that one or two of them were dummies .   .   .   .  dingo  which pipe is it .    dingo kicked one .    well  don t kick it  you misbegotten fool .  take it apart .    dingo did so  a micro heatgun flashing briefly .  he yanked out wires .    what s that  williams .   demanded anton .    wires   said lucky briefly .    i know that  you lump .   he was suddenly furious .   what else .  i ll tell you what else .  those wires are set to explode every ounce of the atomite on board ship as soon as we take the ship back to base .    lucky jumped .   how can you tell that .     you re surprised .  you didn t know this was one big trap .  you didn t know we were supposed to take this back to base for repairs .  you didn t know we were supposed to explode ourselves and the base  too  into hot  duel in word     dust .  why  you re here as the bait to make sure we were properly fooled .  only i m not a fool .    his men were crowding close .  dingo licked his lips .   with a snap anton brought up his blaster and there was no mercy  no dream of mercy  in his eyes .    wait .  great galaxy  wait .  i know nothing about this .  you have no right to shoot me without cause .   he tensed for a jump  one last fight before death .    no right .   anton  eyes glaring  lowered his blaster suddenly .   how dare you say no right .  i have all rights on this ship .     you can t kill a good man .  the men of the asteroids need good men .  don t throw one away for nothing .    a sudden  unexpected murmur came from some of the pirates .   a voice said   he s got guts  cap n .  maybe we could use       it died away as anton turned .   he turned back .   what makes you a good man  williams .  answer that and i ll consider .     i ll hold my own against anyone here .  bare fists or any weapon .     so .   anton s teeth bared themselves .   you hear that  men .    there was an affirmative roar .    it s your challenge  williams .  any weapon .  good .  come out of this alive and you won t be shot .  you ll be considered for membership in my crew .     i have your word  captain .     you have my word  and i never break my word .  the crew hears me .  if you come out of this alive .       lucky starr   whom do i fight .   demanded lucky .    dingo here .  a good man .  anyone who can beat him is a very good man .    lucky measured the huge lump of gristle and sinew standing before him  its little eyes glittering with anticipation  and glumly agreed with the captain .   but he said firmly   what weapons .  or is it bare fists .     weapons .  push tubes  to be exact .  push tubes in open space .    for a moment lucky found it difficult to maintain an appropriate stolidity .   anton smiled .   are you afraid it won t be a proper test for you .  don t be .  dingo is the best man with a push gun in our entire fleet .    lucky s heart plummeted .  a push gun duel required an expert .  notoriously so .  played as he had played it in college days  it was a sport .  fought by professionals  it was deadly .   and he was no professional .   chapter    duel in deed  pirates crowded the outer skin of the atlas and of their own sirian designed ship .  some were standing  held by the magnetic field of their boots .  others had cast themselves loose for better viewing  maintaining their place by means of a short magnetic cable attached to the ship s hull .   fifty miles apart two metal foil goal posts had been set .  not more than three feet square in their collapsed state aboard ship  they opened into a hundred feet either way of thin beaten beryl magnesium sheets .  undimmed and undamaged in the great emptiness of space  they were set spinning  and the flickering reflections of the sun on their gleaming surfaces sent beams that were visible for miles .    you know the rules .   anton s voice was loud in lucky s ears  and presumably in dingo s ears as well .   lucky could make out the other s space suited shape as a sunlit speck half a mile away .  the lifeboat that had brought them here was racing away now  back toward the pirate ship .    you know the rules   said anton s voice .   the one who gets pushed back to his own goal post is the loser .  if neither gets pushed back  the one whose push gun expires first is the loser .  no time limit .  no off side .  you     lucky starr  have five minutes to get set .  the push gun can t be used till the word is given .    no off side  thought lucky .  that was the giveaway .  push duels as a legal sport could not take place more than a hundred miles from an asteroid at least fifty miles in diameter .  this would place a definite  though small  gravitational pull on the players .  it would not be enough to affect mobility .  it would be enough  however  to rescue a contestant who found himself miles out in space with an expired push gun .  even if not picked up by the rescue boat he had only to remain quiet and in a matter of hours or  at most  one or two days  he would drift back to the asteroid s surface .   here  on the other hand  there was no sizable asteroid within hundreds of thousands of miles .  a real push would continue indefinitely .  it would end  as likely as not  in the sun  long after the unlucky contestant had smothered to death when his oxygen gave out .  under such conditions it was usually understood that  when one contestant or another passed outside certain set limits  time was called until their return .   saying  no off side  was saying  to the death .    anton s voice came clear and sharp across the miles of space between himself and the radio receiver in lucky s helmet .  he said   two minutes to go .  adjust body signals .    lucky brought his hand up and closed the switch set into his chest .  the colored metal foil which had earlier been magnet set into his helmet was spinning .  it was a miniature goal post .  dingo s figure  a moment before merely a dim dot  now sprang into flickering ruddy hie .   duel in deed     his own signal  lucky knew  was a flashing green .  and the goal posts were pure white .   even now a fraction of lucky s mind was far away .  he had tried to make one objection at the very beginning .  he had said   look  this all suits me  you understand .  but while we re fooling around  a government patrol ship might       anton barked contemptuously   forget it .  no patrol ship would have the guts to get this far into the rocks .  we ve a hundred ships within call  a thousand rocks to hold us if we had to make a getaway .  get into your suit .    a hundred ships .  a thousand rocks .  if true  the pirates had never yet shown their full hand .  what was going on .    one minute left .   said anton s voice through space .   grimly lucky brought up his two push guns .  they were l shaped objects connected by springy  gummed f abric tubing to the doughnutlike gas cylinders  containing carbon dioxide liquid under great pressure  that had been adjusted about his waist .  in the old days the connecting tubing had been metal mesh .  but that  though stronger  had also been more massive and had added to the momentum and inertia of the guns .  in push duels rapid aiming and firing was essential .  once a fluorinated silicone had been invented which could remain a flexible gum at space temperatures and yet not become tacky in the direct rays of the sun  the lighter tubing material was universally used .    fire when ready .   cried anton .   one of dingo s push guns triggered for an instant .  the liquid carbon dioxide of his gas cylinder bubbled into violent gas and spurted out through the push gun s     lucky starr  needlelike orifice .  the gas froze into a line of tiny crystals within six inches of its point of emersion .  even in the half second allowed for release a line of crystals  miles long  had been formed .  as they pushed out one way  dingo was pushed in the other .  it was a spaceship and its rocket blast in miniature .   three times the  crystal line  flashed and faded in the distance .  it pointed into space directly away from lucky  and each time dingo gained speed toward lucky .  the actual state of affairs was deceptive .  the only change visible to the eye was the slow brightening of dingo s suit signal  but lucky knew that the distance between them was closing with hurtling velocity .   what lucky did not know was the proper strategy to expect  the appropriate defense .  he waited to let the other s offensive moves unfold .   dingo was large enough now to see as a humanoid shape with head and four limbs .  he was passing to one side  and making no move to adjust his aim .  he seemed content to bear far to lucky s left .   lucky still waited .  the chorus of confused cries that rang in his helmet had died down .  they came from the open transmitters of the audience .  though these were too far away to see the contestants  they could still follow the passage of the body signals and the flashes of the carbon dioxide streams .  they were expecting something  lucky thought .   it came suddenly .   a blast of carbon dioxide  then another appeared to dingo s right  and his line of flight veered toward the young councilman s position .  lucky brought his push   duel in deed     gun up  ready to flash downward and avoid close quarters .  the safest strategy  he thought  was to do just that  and to move as slowly and as little as possible otherwise  in order to conserve carbon dioxide .   but dingo s flight did not continue toward lucky .  he fired straight ahead of himself  a long streak  and began to recede .  lucky watched him  and only too late the streak of light met his eyes .   the line of carbon dioxide that dingo had last fired traveled forward  yes  but he had been moving leftward at the time and so it did likewise .  the two motions together moved it directly toward lucky and it struck his left shoulder bull s eye .   to lucky it felt like a sharp blow pounding him .  the crystals were tiny  but they extended for miles and they were traveling at miles per second .  they all hit his suit in the space of what seemed a fraction of an eyelid s flicker .  lucky s suit trembled and the roar of the audience was in his ear .    you got him  dingo .     what a blast .     straight toward goal post .  look at him .     it was beautiful .  beautiful .     look at the joker spin .    underneath that there were murmurs that seemed  somehow  less exuberant .   lucky was spinning or  rather  it seemed to his eyes that the heavens and all the stars in it were spinning .  across the face plate of his helmet the stars were white streaks  as though they were sparkles of trillions of carbon dioxide crystals themselves .      lucky starr  he could see nothing but the numerous blurs .  for a moment it was as though the blow had knocked the power of thinking out of him .   a blow in the midriff and one in the back sent him  still spinning  further on his hurtling way through space .   he had to do something or dingo would make a football of him from one end of the solar system to the other .  the first thing was to stop the spin and get his bearings .  he was tumbling diagonally  left shoulder over right hip .  he pointed the push gun in the direction counter to that twist  and in lightning releases pumped out streams of carbon dioxide .   the stars slowed until their turning was a stately march that left them sharply defined points .  the sky became the familiar sky of space .   one star flickered and was too bright .  lucky knew it to be his own goal post .  almost diametrically opposed was the angry red of dingo s body signal .  lucky could not fling himself backward beyond the goal post or the duel would be over and he would have lost .  beyond the goal post and within a mile of it was the standard rule for a goal ending .  nor  on the other hand  could he afford to get closer to his opponent .   he brought his push gun straight up over his head  closed contact  and held it so .  he counted a full minute before he released contact  and through all the sixty seconds he felt the pressure against the top of his helmet as he accelerated downward .   it was a desperate maneuver  for he threw away a half hour s supply of gas in that one minute .   duel in deed     dingo  in outrage  yelled hoarsely   you flumstered coward .  you yellow mugger .    the cries of the audience also rose to a crescendo .    look at him run .     he got past dingo .  dingo  get him .     hey  williams .  put up a fight .    lucky saw the crimson blur of his enemy again .   he had to keep on the move .  there was nothing else he could do .  dingo was an expert and could hit a one inch meteorite as it flashed by .  he himself  lucky thought ruefully  would do well to hit ceres at a mile .   he used his push guns alternately .  to the left  to the right  then quickly  to the right  to the left and to the right again .   it made no difference .  it was as though dingo could foretell his moves  cut across the corners  move in inexorably .   lucky felt the perspiration beading out upon his forehead  and suddenly he was aware of the silence .  he could not remember the exact moment it had come  but it had come like the breaking of a thread .  one moment there had been the yells and laughter of the pirates  and the next moment only the dead silence of space where sound could never be heard .   had he passed beyond range of the ships .  impossible .  suit radios  even the simplest type  would carry thousands of miles in space .  he pushed the sensitivity dial on his chest to maximum .    captain anton .    but it was dingo s rough voice that answered .   don t yell .  i hear you .       lucky starr  lucky said   call time .  there s something wrong with my radio .    dingo was close enough to be made out as a human figure again .  a flashing line of crystals and he was closer .  lucky moved away  but the pirate followed on his heels .    nothing wrong   said dingo .   just a gimmicked radio .  i ve been waiting .  i ve been waiting .  i could have knocked you past goal long ago  but i ve been waiting for the radio to go .  it s just a little transistor i gimmicked before you put on your suit .  you can still talk to me  though .  it ll still carry a mile or two .  or at least you can talk to me for a little while .   he relished the joke and barked l is laughter .   lucky said   i don t get it .    dingo s voice turned harshly cruel .   you caught me on the ship with my blaster in its holster .  you trapped me there .  you made me look like a fool .  no one traps me and i don t let anyone make a fool out of me in front of the captain and live very long after that .  i m not goaling you for someone else to finish .  i m finishing you here .  myself .    dingo was much closer .  lucky could almost make out the face behind the thick glassite of the face plate .   lucky abandoned attempts at bobbing and weaving .  that would lead  he decided  to being consistently out maneuvered .  he considered straight flight  pushing outward at increasing velocity as long as his gas held out .   but then afterward .  and was he going to be content to die while running away .   he would have to fight back .  he aimed the push gun at dingo  and dingo wasn t there when the line of crys   duel in deed     tals passed through the spot where a moment before he had been .  he tried again and again  but dingo was a flitting demon .   and then lucky felt the hard impact of the other s push gun blast and he was spinning again .  desperately he tried to come out of the spin and before he could do so  he felt the clanging force of a body s collision with his .   dingo held his suit in tight embrace .   helmet to helmet .  face plate to face plate .  lucky was staring at the white scar splitting dingo s upper lip .  it spread tightly as dingo smiled .    hello  chum   he said .   pleased to meet you .    for a moment dingo floated away  or seemed to  as he loosened the grip of his arms .  the pirate s thighs held firm about lucky s knees  their apelike strength immobilizing him .  lucky s own whipcord muscles wrenched this way and that uselessly .   dingo s partial retreat had only been designed to free his arms .  one lifted high  push gun held butt first .  it came down directly on the face plate and lucky s head snapped back with the sudden  shattering impact .  the relentless arm swung up again  while the other curled about lucky s neck .    hold your head still   the pirate snarled .   i m finishing this .    lucky knew that to be the literal truth unless he acted quickly .  the glassite was strong and tough  but it would hold out only so long against the battering of metal .   he brought up the heel of his gauntleted hand against dingo s helmet  straightening his arm and pushing the pirate s head back .  dingo rocked his head to one side      lucky starr  disengaging lucky s arm .  he brought the butt of his push gun down a second time .   lucky dropped both push guns  let them dangle from their connecting tubes  and with a sure movement snatched at the connecting tubes of dingo s guns .  he threaded them between the fingers of his steel gloves .  the muscles of his arms lumped and tightened painfully .  his jaws clenched and he felt the blood creep to his temples .   dingo  his mouth twisted in fierce joyful anticipation  disregarded everything but the upturned face of his victim behind the transparent face plate  contorted  as he thought  with fear .  once more the butt came down .  a small cracking star appeared where the metal had struck .   then something else gave and the universe seemed to go mad .   first one and  almost immediately afterward  the other of the connecting tubes of dingo s two push guns parted and an uncontrollable stream of carbon dioxide ravened out of each broken tube .   the tubes whipped like insane snakes  and lucky was slammed against his suit first this way  then that  in violent reaction to the mad and uncontrolled acceleration .   dingo yelled in jolted surprise and his grip loosened .   the two almost separated  but lucky held on grimly to one of the pirate s ankles .   the carbon dioxide stream slackened and lucky went up his opponent s leg hand over hand .   they were apparently motionless now .  the chance whippings of the stream had left them even without any  duel in deed     perceptible spin .  dingo s push gun tubes  now dead and flaccid  stretched out in their last position .  all seemed still  as still as death .   but that was a delusion .  lucky knew they were traveling at miles per second in whatever direction that last stroke of gas had sent them .  they were alone and lost in space  the two of them .   chapter    the hermit on the rock  lucky was on dingo s back now and it was his thighs that gripped the other s waist .  he spoke softly and grimly .   you can hear me  dingo  can t you .  i don t know where we are or where we re going  but neither do you .  so we need each other now  dingo .  are you ready to make a deal .  you can find out where we are because your radio will reach the ships  but you can t get back without carbon dioxide .  i have enough for both of us  but i ll need you to guide us back .     to space with you  you scupper   yelled dingo .   when i m done with you  i ll have your push tubes .     i don t think you will   said lucky coolly .    you think you ll let them loose  too .  go ahead .  go ahead  you loshing ripper .  what good will that do .  the captain will come for me wherever i am while you re floating around with a busted helmet and frozen blood on your face .     not exactly  my friend .  there s something in your back  you know .  maybe you can t feel it through the metal  but it s there  i assure you .     a push gun .  so what .  it doesn t mean a thing as long as we re held together .   but his arms halted their writhing attempt to seize lucky .    i m not a push gun duelist .   lucky sounded cheerful     lucky starr  about it .   but i still know more than you do about push guns .  push gun shots are exchanged miles apart .  there s no air resistance to slow and mess up the gas stream  but there s internal resistance .  there s always some turbulence in the stream .  the crystals knock together  slow up .  the line of gas widens .  if it misses its mark  it finally spreads out in space and vanishes  but if it finally hits  it still kicks like a mule after miles of travel .     what in space are you talking about .  what are you running off about .   the pirate twisted with bull strength  and lucky grunted as he forced him back .   lucky said   just this .  what do you suppose happens when the carbon dioxide hits at two inches  before turbulence has done anything at all to cut down its velocity or to broaden the beam .  don t guess .  i ll tell you .  it would cut through your suit as though it were a blowtorch  and through your body  too .     you re nuts .  you re talking crazy .    dingo swore madly  but of a sudden he was holding his body stiffly motionless .    try it  then   said lucky .   move .  my push gun is  hard against your suit and i m squeezing the trigger .  try  .    .     it out .    you re fouling me   snarled dingo .   this isn t a clean  .     win .    i ve got a crack in my face plate   said lucky .   the men will know where the foul is .  you have half a minute to make up your mind .    the seconds passed in silence .  lucky caught the motion of dingo s hand .   he said   good by  dingo .    the hermit on the rock     dingo cried thickly   wait .  wait .  i m just extending my sending range .   then he called   captain anton  .   .   .  captain anton  .  .  .    it took an hour and a half to get back to the ships .          the at las was moving through space again in the wake of its pirate captor .  its automatic circuits had been shifted to manual controls wherever necessary  and a prize crew of three controlled its power .  as before  it had a passenger list of one lucky starr .   lucky was confined to a cabin and saw the crew only when they brought him his rations .  the atlas s own rations  thought lucky .  or  at least  such as were left .  most of the food and such equipment that wasn t necessary for the immediate maneuvering of the ship had already been transferred to the pirate vessel .   all three pirates brought him his first meal .  they were lean men  browned by the unsoftened rays of the sun of space .   they gave him his tray in silence  inspected the cabin cautiously  stood by while he opened the cans and let their contents warm up  then carried away the remains .   lucky said   sit down  men .  you don t have to stand while i eat .    they did not answer .  one  the thinnest and lankest of the three  with a nose that had once been broken and was now bent sideways  and an adam s apple that jutted sharply outward  looked at the others as though he felt inclined to accept the invitation .  he met with no response  however .   the next meal was brought by broken nose alone .  he     lucky starr  put down the tray  went back to the door  which he opened .  he looked up and down the corridor  closed the door again  and said   i m martin maniu .    lucky smiled .   i m bill williams .  the other two don t talk to me  eh .     they re dingo s friends .  but i m not .  maybe you re a government man like the captain thinks  and maybe you re not .  i don t know .  but as far as i m concerned  anyone who does what you did to that scupper  dingo  is all right .  he s a wise guy and he plays rough .  he got me into a push fight once when i was new .  he nearly pushed me into an asteroid .  for no reason  either .  he claimed it was a mistake  but listen  he doesn t make any mistakes with a pusher .  you made quite a few friends  mister  when you dragged back that hyena by the seat of his pants .     i m glad of that  anyway .     but watch out for him .  he ll never forget it .  don t ever be alone with him even twenty years from now .  i m telling you .  it isn t just beating him  you see .  it s bluffing him with the story about cutting through an inch of metal with the carbon dioxide .  everyone s laughing at him and he s sick about it .  man  i mean sick .  it s the best thing that s ever happened .  man  i sure hope the boss gives you a clean bill .     the boss .  captain anton .     no  the boss .  the big fellow .  say  the food you ve got on board ship is good .  especially the meat .   the pirate smacked his lips loudly .   you get tired of all these yeast mashes  especially when you re in charge of a vat yourself .    the hermit on the rock     lucky was brushing up the remainder of his meal .   who is this guy .     who .     the boss .    maniu shrugged .   space .  i don t know .  you don t think a guy like me would ever meet him .  just someone the fellows talk about .  it stands to reason someone s boss .     the organization is pretty complicated .     man  you never know till you join .  listen  i was dead broke when i came out here .  i didn t know what to do .  i thought  well  we ll bang up a few ships and then i ll get mine and it ll be over .  you know  it would be better than starving to death like i was doing .     it wasn t that way .     no .  i ve never been on a raiding expedition .  hardly any of us are .  just a few like dingo .  he goes out all the time .  he likes it  the scupper .  mostly we go out and pick up a few women sometimes .   the pirate smiled .   i ve got a wife and a kid .  you wouldn t believe that now  would you .  sure  we ve got a little project of our own .  have our own vats .  once in a while i draw space duty  like now  for instance .  it s a soft life .  you could do all right  if you join up .  a good looking fellow like you could get a wife in no time and settle down .  or there s plenty of excitement if that s what you want .    yes  sir  bill .  i hope the boss takes you .    lucky followed him to the door .   where are we going  by the way .  one of the bases .     just to one of the rocks  i guess .  whichever is nearest .      lucky starr  you ll stay there till the word comes through .  it s what they usually do .    he added as he closed the door   and don t tell the fellows  or anybody  i ve been talking to you .  okay  pal .     sure thing .    alone again  lucky pounded a fist slowly and softly into his palm .  the boss .  was that just talk .  scuttlebutt .  or did it mean something .  and what about the rest of the conversation .   he had to wait .  galaxy .  if only conway and henree had the good sense not to interfere for a while longer .          lucky did not get a chance to view the  rock  as the atlas approached .  he did not see it until  preceded by martin maniu and followed by a second pirate  he stepped out of the air lock into space and found it a hundred yards below .   the asteroid was quite typical .  lucky judged it to be two miles across the longest way .  it was angular and craggy  as though a giant had torn off the top of a mountain and tossed it out into space .  its sunside glimmered gray brown  and it was turning visibly  shadows shifting and changing .   he pushed downward toward the asteroid as he left the air lock  flexing his leg muscles against the ship s hull .  the crags floated up slowly toward himself .  when his hands touched ground  his inertia forced the rest of his body on downward  tumbling him in slowest motion until he could grasp a projection and bring himself to a halt .   he stood up .  there was almost the illusion of a  the hermit on the rock     planetary surface about the rock .  the nearest jags of matter  however  had nothing behind them  nothing but space .  the stars  moving visibly as the rock turned  were hard  bright glitters .  the ship  which had been put into an orbit about the rock  remained motionless overhead .   a pirate led the way  some fifty feet  to a rise in rock in no way distinguished from its surroundings .  he made it in two long steps .  as they waited a section of the rise slipped aside  and from the opening a space suited figure stepped out .    okay  herm   said one of the pirates  gruffly   here he is .  he s in your care now .    the voice that next sounded in lucky s receiver was gentle and rather weary .   how long will he be with me  gentlemen .     till we come to get him .  and don t ask questions .    the pirates turned away and leaped upward .  the rock s gravity could do nothing to stop them .  they dwindled steadily and after a few minutes  lucky saw a brief flash of crystals as one of them corrected his direction of travel by means of a push gun  a small one  routinely used for such purposes  that was part of standard suit equipment .  its gas supply consisted of a built in carbon dioxide cartridge .   minutes passed and the ship s rear jets gleamed redly .  it  too  began dwindling .   it was useless to try to check the direction in which it was leaving  lucky knew  without some knowledge of his own location in space .  and of that  except that he was somewhere in the asteroid belt  he knew nothing .   so intense was his absorption that he was almost     lucky starr  startled at the soft voice of the other man on the asteroid .   he said   it is beautiful out here .  i come out so rarely that sometimes i forget .  look there .    lucky turned to his left .  the small sun was just poking above the sharp edge of the asteroid .  in a moment it was too bright to look at .  it was a gleaming twenty credit gold piece .  the sky  black before  remained black  and the stars shone undiminished .  that was the way on an airless world where there was no dust to scatter sunlight and turn the heavens a deep  masking blue .   the man of the asteroid said   in twenty five minutes or so it will be setting again .  sometimes  when jupiter is at its closest  you can see it  too  like a little marble  with its four satellites like sparks lined up in military formation .  but that only happens every three and a half years .  this isn t the time .    lucky said bluntly   those men called you herm .  is that your name .  are you one of them .     you mean am i a pirate .  no .  but i ll admit i may be an accessory after the fact .  nor is my name herm .  that s just a term they use for hermits in general .  my name  sir  is joseph patrick hansen  and since we are to be companions at close quarters for an indefinite period  i hope we shall be friends .    he held out a metal sheathed hand  and lucky grasped it .    i m bill williams   he said .   you say you re a hermit .  do you mean by that that you live here all the time .     that s right .    lucky looked about the poor splinter of granite and silica and frowned .   it doesn t look very inviting .    the hermit on the rock      nevertheless i ll try to do my best to make you comfortable .    the hermit touched a section of the slab of rock out of which he had come and a piece of it wheeled open once again .  lucky noted that the edges had been beveled and lined with lastium or some similar material to insure air tightness .    won t you step inside  mr .  williams .   invited the hermit .   lucky did so .  the rock slab closed behind them .  as it closed  a small fluoro lit up and shone away the obscurity .  it revealed a small air lock  not much larger than was required to hold two men .   a small red signal light flickered  and the hermit said   you can open your face plate now .  we ve got air .   he did so himself as he spoke .   lucky followed suit  dragging in lungfuls of clear  fresh air .  not bad .  better than the air on shipboard .  definitely .   but it was when the inner door of the air lock opened that the wind went out of lucky in one big gasp .   chapter    what the hermit knew  lucky had seen few such luxurious rooms even on earth .  it was thirty feet long  twenty wide  and thirty high .  a balcony circled it .  above and below the walls were lined with book films .  a wall projector was set on a pedestal  while on another was a gemlike model of the galaxy .  the lighting was entirely indirect .   as soon as he set foot within the room  he felt the tug of pseudo grav motors .  it wasn t set at earth normal .  from the feel of it it seemed somewhere between earth and mars normal .  there was a delightful sensation of lightness and yet enough pull to allow full muscular co ordination .   the hermit had removed his space suit and suspended it over a white plastic trough into which the frost that had collected thickly over it when they stepped out of frozen space and into the warm  moist air of the room might trickle as it melted .   he was tall and straight  his face was pink and un lined  but his hair was quite white  as were his bushy eyebrows  and the veins stood out on the back of his hands .   he said politely   may i help you with your suit .    lucky came to life .   that s all right .   he clambered out quickly .   this is an unusual place you have here .     you like it .   hansen smiled .   it took many years to     lucky starr  make it look like this .  nor is this all there is to my little  home .   he seemed filled with a quiet pride .    i imagine so   said lucky .   there must be a power plant for light and heat as well as to keep the pseudo grav field alive .  you must have an air purifier and re placer  water supplies  food stores  all that .   that s right .    a hermit s life is not bad .    the hermit was obviously both proud and pleased .   it doesn t have to be   he said .   sit down  williams  sit down .  would you like a drink .     no  thank you .   lucky lowered himself into an armchair .  its apparently normal seat and back masked a soft diamagnetic field that gave under his weight only so far  then achieved a balance that molded itself to every curve of his body .   unless you can scare up a cup of coffee .    easily .   the old man stepped into an alcove .  in seconds he was back with a fragrant and steaming cup  plus a second for himself .   the arm of lucky s chair unfolded into a narrow ledge at the proper touch of hansen s toe and the hermit set down one cup into an appropriate recess .  as he did so he paused to stare at the younger man .  lucky looked up .   yes .   hansen shook his head .   nothing .  nothing .  they faced one another .  the lights in the more distant parts of the large room faded until only the area immediately surrounding the two men was clear to vision .   and now if you ll pardon an old man s curiosity  said the hermit   i d like to ask you why you ve come here .    what the hermit knew      i didn t come .  i was brought   said lucky .    you mean you re not one of      hansen paused .    no  i m not a pirate .  at least  not yet .    hansen put down his cup and looked troubled .   i don t understand .  perhaps i ve said things i shouldn t have .     don t worry about it .  i m going to be one of them soon enough .    lucky finished his coffee and then  choosing his words carefully  began with his boarding of the atlas on the moon and carried it through to the moment .   hansen listened in absorption .   and are you sure this is what you want to do  young man  now that you ve seen a little of what the life is like .      t      im sure .    why  for earth s sake .     exactly .  for the sake of earth and what it did to me .  it s no place to live .  why did you come out here .     it s a long story  i m afraid .  you needn t look alarmed .  i won t tell it .  i bought this asteroid long ago as a place for small vacations  and i grew to like it .  i kept enlarging the room space  brought furniture and book films from earth little by little .  eventually i found i had all i needed here .  so why not stay here permanently .  i asked myself .  and i did stay here permanently .     sure .  why not .  you re smart .  back there it s a mess .  too many people .  too many rut jobs .  next to impossible to get out to the planets  and if you do  it means a job of manual labor .  no opportunity for a man any more unless he comes to the asteroids .  i m not old enough to settle     lucky starr  down like you .  but for a young fellow it s a free life and an exciting one .  there s room to be boss .     the ones who are already boss don t like young fellows with boss notions in their head .  anton  for instance .  i ve seen him and i know .     maybe  but so far he s kept his word   said lucky .   he said if i came out winner over this dingo  i d have my chance to join the men of the asteroids .  it looks as though i m getting the chance .     it looks as though you re here  that s all .  what if he returns with proof  or what he calls proof  that you re a government man .     tt  i   .    he won t .    and if he does .  just to get rid of you .    lucky s face darkened and again hansen looked at him curiously  frowning a bit .   lucky said   he wouldn t .  he can use a good man and he knows it .  besides  why are you preaching to me .  you re out here yourself playing ball with them .    hansen looked down .   it s true .  i shouldn t interfere with you .  it s just that being alone here so long  i m apt to talk too much when a person does come along  just to hear the sound of voices .  look  it s about time for dinner .  i would be glad to have you eat with me in silence  if you d rather .  or else we ll talk about anything you choose .     well  thanks  mr .  hansen .  no hard feelings .     good .    lucky followed hansen through a door into a small pantry lined with canned food and concentrates of all sorts .  none of the brand names familiar to lucky were  what the hermit knew     represented .  instead the contents of each can were described in brightly colored etchings that were themselves integral parts of the metal .   hansen said   i used to keep fresh meat in a special freeze room .  you can get the temperature down all the way on an asteroid  you know  but it s been two years since i could get that kind of supplies .    he chose half a dozen cans off the shelves  plus a container of milk concentrate .  at his suggestion lucky took up a sealed gallon container of water from a lower shelf .   the hermit set the table quickly .  the cans were of the self heating type that opened up into dishes with enclosed cutlery .   hansen said  with some amusement  indicating the cans   i ve got a whole valley on the outside brim filled with these things .  discarded ones  that is .  a twenty years  accumulation .    the food was good  but strange .  it was yeast base material  the kind only the terrestrial empire produced .  nowhere else in the galaxy was the pressure of population so great  the billions of people so numerous  that yeast culture had been developed .  on venus  where most of the yeast products were grown  almost any variety of food imitation could be produced  steaks  nuts  butter  candy .  it was as nourishing as the real thing  too .  to lucky  however  the flavor was not quite venusian .  there was a sharper tang to it .    pardon me for being nosy   he said   but all this takes money  doesn t it .     oh yes  and i have some .  i have investments on earth .      lucky starr  quite good ones .  my checks are always honored  or at least they were until not quite two years ago .     what happened then .     the supply ships stopped coming .  too risky on account of the pirates .  it was a bad blow .  i had a good backlog of supplies in most things  but i can imagine how it must have been for the others .     the others .     the other hermits .  there are hundreds of us .  they re not all as lucky as i am .  very few can afford to make their worlds quite this comfortable  but they can manage the essentials .  it s usually old people like myself  with wives dead  children grown up  the world strange and different  who go off by themselves .  if they have a little nest egg  they can get a little asteroid started .  the government doesn t charge .  any asteroid you want to settle on  if it s less than five miles in diameter  is yours .  then if they want they can invest in a sub etheric receiver and keep up with the universe .  if not  they can have book films  or can arrange to have news transcripts brought in by the supply ships once a year  or they can just eat  rest  sleep  and wait to die if they d rather .  i wish  sometimes  i d got to know some of them .     why haven t you .     sometimes i ve felt willing  but they re not easy people to know .  after all  they ve come here to be alone  and for that matter  so have i .     well  what did you do when the supply ships stopped coming .     nothing at first .  i thought surely the government would clean up the situation and i had enough supplies  what the hermit knew     for months .  in fact  i could have skimped along for a year  maybe .  but then the pirate ships came .     and you threw in with them .    the hermit shrugged .  his eyebrows drew together in a troubled frown and they finished their meal in silence .   at the end he gathered the can plates and cutlery and placed them in a wall container in the alcove that led to the pantry .  lucky heard a dim grating noise of metal on metal that diminished rapidly .   hansen said   the pseudo grav field doesn t extend to the disposal tube .  a puff of air and they sail out to the valley i told you of  even though it s nearly a mile away .     it seems to me   said lucky   that if you d try a little harder ptaff  you d get rid of the cans altogether .     so i would .  i think most hermits do that .  maybe they all do .  i don t like the idea  though .  it s a waste of air  and of metal too .  we might reclaim those cans someday .  who knows .  besides even though most of the cans would scatter here and there  i m sure that some would circle this asteroid like little moons and it s undignified to think of being accompanied on your orbit by your garbage .   .   .   .  care to smoke .  no .  mind if i do .    he lit a cigar and with a contented sigh went on .   the men of the asteroids can t supply tobacco regularly  so this is becoming a rare treat for me .    lucky said   do they furnish you the rest of your supplies .     that s right .  water  machine parts and power pack renewals .  it s an arrangement .     and what do you do for them .    the hermit studied his cigar s lighted end .   not much .      lucky starr  they use this world .  they land their ships on it and i don t report them .  they don t come in here and what they do elsewhere on the rock isn t my business .  i don t want to know .  it s safer that way .  men are left here sometimes  like yourself  and are picked up later .  i have an idea they stop for minor repairs sometimes .  they bring me supplies in return .     do they supply all the hermits .     i wouldn t know .  maybe .     it would take an awful lot of supplies .  where would they get them from .     they capture ships .     not enough to supply hundreds of hermits and themselves .  isnean  it would take an awful lot of ships .     i wouldn t know .     aren t you interested .  it s a soft life you have here  but maybe the food we just ate came off a ship whose crew are frozen corpses circling some other asteroid like human garbage .  do you ever think of that .    the hermit flushed painfully .   you re getting your revenge for my having preached to you earlier .  you re right  but what can i do .  i didn t abandon or betray the government .  they abandoned and betrayed me .  my estate on earth pays taxes .  why am i not protected then .  i registered this asteroid with the terrestrial outer world bureau in good faith .  it s part of the terrestrial dominion .  i have every right to expect protection against the pirates .  if that s not forthcoming  if my source of supply coolly says that they can bring me nothing more at any price  what am i supposed to do .    you might say i could have returned to earth  but  what the hermit knew     how could i abandon all this .  i have a world of my own here .  my book films  the great classics that i love .  i even have a copy of shakespeare  a direct filming of the actual pages of an ancient printed book .  i have food  drink  privacy .  i could find nowhere as comfortable as this anywhere else in the universe .    don t think it s been an easy choice  though .  i have a sub etheric transmitter .  i could communicate with earth .  i ve got a little ship that can make the short haul to ceres .  the men of the asteroids know that  but they trust me .  they know i have no choice .  as i told you when we first met  i m an accessory after the fact .    i ve helped them .  that makes me legally a pirate .  it would be jail  execution  probably  if i return .  if not  if they free me provided i turn state s evidence  the men of the asteroids won t forget .  they would find me no matter where i went  unless i could be guaranteed complete government protection for life .     it looks like you re in a bad way   said lucky .    am i .   said the hermit .   i might be able to get that complete protection with the proper help .    it was lucky s turn .   i wouldn t know   he said .    i think you would .    i don t get you .    look  i ll give you a word of warning in return for help .     there s nothing z can do .  what s your word .     get off the asteroid before anton and his men come back .     not on your life .  i came here to join them  not to go home .       lucky starr   if you don t leave  you ll stay forever .  you ll stay as a dead man .  they won t let you on any crew .  you won t qualify  mister .    lucky s face twisted in anger .   what in space are you talking about  old timer .     there it is again .  when you get angry  i see it plainly .  you re not bill williams  son .  what s your relationship to lawrence starr of the council of science .  are you starr s son .    chapter    to ceres  lucky s eyes narrowed .  he felt the muscles of his right arm tense as though to reach for a hip at which no blaster nestled .  he made no actual motion .   his voice remained under strict control .  he said   whose son .  what are you talking about .     i m sure of it .   the hermit leaned forward  seizing lucky s wrist earnestly .   i knew lawrence starr well .  he was my friend .  he helped me once when i needed help .  and you re his image .  i couldn t be wrong .    lucky pulled his hand away .   you re not making sense .     listen  son  it may be important to you not to give away your identity .  maybe you don t trust me .  all right  i m not telling you to trust me .  i ve been working with the pirates and i ve admitted it .  but listen to me anyway .  the men of the asteroids have a good organization .  it may take them weeks  but if anton suspects you  they won t stop till you re checked from the ground up .  no phony story will fool them .  they ll get the truth and they ll learn who you are .  be sure of that .  they ll get your true identity .  leave  i tell you .  leave .    lucky said   if i were this guy you say i am  old timer  aren t you getting yourself into trouble .  i take it you want me to use your ship .       lucky starr   yes .     and what would you do when the pirates returned .     i wouldn t be here .  don t you see .  i want to go with you .     and leave all you have here .    the old man hesitated .   yes  it s hard .  but i won t have a chance like this again .  you re a man of influence  you must be .  you re a member of the council of science  perhaps .  you re here on secret work .  they ll believe you .  you could protect me  vouch for me .  you would prevent prosecution  see that no harm came to me from the pirates .  it would pay the council  young man .  i would tell them all i know about the pirates .  i would co operate in every way i could .    lucky said   where do you keep your ship .     it s a deal  then .     i m just asking to see your ship .           the ship was a small one indeed .  the two reached it through a narrow corridor  walking single file  their figures grotesque again in space suits .   lucky said   is ceres close enough to pick out by ship s telescope .     yes indeed .     you could recognize it without trouble .     certainly .     let s get on board  then .    the fore end of the airless cavern that housed the ship opened outward as soon as the ship s motors were activated .    radio control   explained hansen .   to ceres     the ship was fueled and provisioned .  it worked smoothly  rising out of its berth and into space with the ease and freedom possible only where gravitational forces were virtually lacking .  for the first time lucky saw hansen s asteroid from space .  he caught a glimpse of the valley of the discarded cans  brighter than the surrounding rock  just before it passed into shadow .   hansen said   tell me  now .  you are the son of lawrence starr  aren t you .    lucky had located a well charged blaster and a holster belt to boot .  he was strapping it on as he spoke .    my name   he said   is david starr .  most people call me lucky .           ceres is a monster among the asteroids .  it is nearly five hundred miles in diameter  and  standing upon it  the average man actually weighs two full pounds .  it is quite spherical in shape  and anyone very close to it in space could easily think it a respectable planet .   still  if the earth were hollow  it would be possible to throw into it four thousand bodies the size of ceres before filling it up .   bigman stood on the surface of ceres  his figure bloated in a space suit which had been loaded to bursting with lead weights and on shoes the soles of which were foot thick lead clogs .  it had been his own idea  but it was quite useless .  he still weighed less than four pounds and his every motion threatened to twist him up into space .   he had been on ceres for days now  since the quick space flight with conway and henree from the moon      lucky starr  waiting for this moment  waiting for lucky starr to send in the radio message that he was coming in .  gus henree and hector conway had been nervous about it  fearing lucky s death  worrying about it .  he  bigman  had known better .  lucky could come through anything .  he told them that .  when lucky s message finally came  he told them again .   but just the same  out here on ceres  frozen soil with nothing between himself and the stars  he admitted a sneaking sensation of relief .   from where he sat he was looking directly at the dome of the observatory  its lower reaches dipping just a little below the close horizon .  it was the largest observatory in the terrestrial empire for a very logical reason .   in that part of the solar system inside the orbit of jupiter  the planets venus  earth  and mars had atmospheres and were by that very fact poorly suited for astronomic observation .  the interfering air  even when it was as thin as that of mars  blotted out the finer detail .  it wavered and flickered star images and spoiled things generally .   the largest airless object inside jupiter s orbit was mercury  but that was so close to the sun that the observatory in its twilight zone specialized in solar observations .  relatively small telescopes sufficed .   the second largest airless object was the moon .  here again circumstances dictated specialization .  weather forecasts on earth  for instance  had become an accurate  long range science  since the appearance of earth s atmosphere could be viewed as a whole from a distance of a quarter of a million miles .   to ceres     and the third largest airless object was ceres  and that was the best of the three .  its almost nonexistent gravity allowed huge lenses and mirrors to be poured without the danger of breakage  without even the question of sag  due to its own weight .  the structure of the telescope tube itself needed no particular strength .  ceres was nearly three times as far from the sun as was the moon and sunlight was only one eighth as strong .  its rapid revolution kept ceres  temperature almost constant .  in short  ceres was ideal for observation of the stars and of the outer planets .   only the day before bigman had seen saturn through the thousand inch reflecting telescope  the grinding of the huge mirror having consumed twenty years of painstaking and continuous labor .    what do i look through .   he had asked .   they laughed at him .   you don t look through anything   they said .   they worked the controls carefully  three of them  each doing something that co ordinated with the other two  until all were satisfied .  the dim red lights dimmed further and in the pit of black emptiness about which they sat a blob of light sprang into being .  a touch at the controls and it focused sharply .   bigman whistled his astonishment .  it was saturn .   it was saturn  three feet wide  exactly as he had seen it from space half a dozen times .  its triple rings were bright and he could see three marble like moons .  behind it was a numerous dusting of stars .  bigman wanted to walk about it to see how it looked with the night     lucky starr  shadow cutting it  but the picture didn t change as he moved .    it s just an image   they told him   an illusion .  you see the same thing no matter where you stand .    now  from the asteroid s surface  bigman could spot saturn with the naked eye .  it was just a white dot  but brighter than the other white dots that were the stars .  it was twice as bright as it appeared from earth  since it was two hundred million miles closer here .  earth itself was on the other side of ceres near the pea size sun .  earth wasn t a very impressive sight  since the sun invariably dwarfed it .   bigman s helmet suddenly rang with sound as the call flooded his left open radio receiver .    hey  shortie  get moving .  there s a ship coming in .    bigman jumped at the noise and moved straight upward  limbs flailing .  he yelled   who re you calling shortie .    but the other was laughing .   hey  how much do you charge for flying lessons  little boy .     i ll little boy you   screamed bigman furiously .  he had reached the peak of his parabola and was slowly and hesitatingly beginning to settle downward once more .   what s your name  wise guy .  say your name  and i ll crack your gizzard as soon as i get back and peel the   .  .   .    suit .    think you can reach my gizzard .   came the mocking rejoinder  and bigman would have exploded into tiny pieces if he had not caught sight of a ship slanting down from the horizon .   he loped in giant  clumsy strides about the leveled  to ceres     square mile of ground that was the asteroid s space port  trying to judge the exact spot on which the ship would land .   it dropped down its steaming jets to a feather touch planetary contact and when the air locks opened and lucky s tall  suited figure emerged  bigman  yelling his joy  made one long leap of it  and they were together .          conway and henree were less effusive in their welcome  but no less joyful .  each wrung lucky s hand as though to confirm  by sheer muscular pressure  the reality of the flesh and blood they beheld .   lucky laughed .   whoa  will you .  give me a chance to breathe .  what s the matter .  didn t you think i was coming back .     look here   said conway   you d better consult us before you take off on just any old fool notion .     well  now  not if it s too much of a fool notion  please  or you won t let me .     never mind that .  i can ground you for what you ve done .  i can have you put under detention right now .  i can suspend you .  i can throw you off the council   said conway .    which of them are you going to do .     none of them  you darned overgrown young fool .  but i may beat your brains out one of these days .    lucky turned to augustus henree .   you won t let him  will you .     frankly  i ll help him .     then i give up in advance .  look  there s a gentleman here i d like to have you meet .       lucky starr  until now hansen had remained in the background  obviously amused by the interchange of nonsense .  the two older councilmen had been too full of lucky starr even to be aware of his existence .    dr .  conway   said lucky   dr .  henree  this is mr .  joseph p .  hansen  the man whose ship i used to come back .  he has been of considerable assistance to me .    the old hermit shook hands with the two scientists .    i don t suppose you can possibly know drs .  conway and henree   said lucky .  the hermit shook his head .    well   he went on   they re important officials in the council of science .  after you ve eaten and had a chance to rest  they ll talk to you and help you  i m sure .           an hour later the two councilmen faced lucky with somber expressions .  dr .  henree tamped tobacco into his pipe with a little finger  and smoked quietly as he listened to lucky s accounts of his adventures with the pirates .    have you told this to bigman .   he asked .    i ve just spent some time talking to him   said lucky .    and he didn t assault you for not taking him .     he wasn t pleased   lucky admitted .   but conway s mind was more seriously oriented .   a sirian designed ship  eh .   he mused .    undoubtedly so   said lucky .   at least we have that piece of information .     the information wasn t worth the risk   said conway  dryly .   i m much more disturbed over another piece of information we have now .  it s obvious that the sirian organization penetrates into the council of science itself .    to ceres     henree nodded gravely .   yes  i saw that  too .  very bad .    lucky said   how do you make that out .     galaxy  boy  it s obvious   growled conway .   i ll admit that we had a large construction crew working on the ship and that even with the best intentions careless slips of information can take place .  it remains truth  though  that the fact of the booby trapping and particularly the exact manner of the fusing were known only to council members and not too many of those .  somewhere in that small group is a spy  yet i could have sworn that all were faithful .   he shook his head .   i still can t believe otherwise .     you don t have to   said lucky .    oh .  and why not .     because the sirian contact was quite temporary .  the sirian embassy got their information from me   chapter    bigman takes over   indirectly  of course  through one of their known spies   he amplified  as the two older men stared at him in shocked astonishment .    i don t understand you at all   said henree in a low voice .  conway was obviously speechless .    it was necessary .  i had to introduce myself to the pirates without suspicion .  if they found me on what they thought was a mapping ship  they would have shot me out of hand .  on the other hand  if they found me on a booby trapped ship the secret of which they had stumbled on by what seemed a stroke of fortune  they would have taken me at face value as a stowaway .  don t you see .  on a mapping ship i m only a member of the crew that didn t get away in time .  on a booby trap  i m a poor jerk who didn t realize what he was stowing away on .     they might have shot you anyway .  they might have seen through your double cross and considered you a spy .  in fact  they almost did .     true .  they almost did   admitted lucky .   conway finally exploded .   and what about the original plan .  were we or were we not going to explode one of their bases .  when i consider the months we spent on the construction of the atlas  the money that went into it          lucky starr   what good would it have done to explode one of their bases .  we spoke about a huge hangar of pirate ships  but actually that was only wishful thinking .  an organization based upon the asteroids would have to be decentralized .  the pirates probably don t have more than three or four ships in any one place .  there wouldn t be room for more .  exploding three or four ships would mean very little compared with what would have been accomplished if i had succeeded in penetrating their organization .     but you didn t succeed   said conway .   with all your fool risks  you didn t succeed .     unfortunately the pirate captain who took the atlas was too suspicious  or perhaps too intelligent for us .  i ll try not to underestimate them again .  but it s not all loss .  we know for a fact that sirius is behind them .  in addition  we have my hermit friend .     he won t help us   said conway .   from what you ve said about him  it sounds as though he were only interested in having as little to do with the pirates as possible .  so what can he know .     he may be able to tell us more than he himself thinks is possible   said lucky coolly .   for instance  there s one piece of information he can give us that will enable me to continue efforts at working against piracy from the inside .     you re not going out there again   said conway hastily .    i don t intend to   said lucky .   conway s eyes narrowed .   where s bigman .     on ceres .  don t worry .  in fact   and a shadow crossed  bigman takes over     lucky s face   he should be here by now .  the delay is beginning to bother me a little .           john bigman jones used his special pass card to get past the guard at the door to the control tower .  he was muttering to himself as he half ran along the corridors .   the slight flush on his pug nosed face dimmed his freckles and his reddish hair stood up in tufts like fence pickets .  lucky had frequently told him he cultivated a vertical hair do to make himself look taller  but he always denied that vigorously .   the final door to the tower swung open as he broke the photoelectric beam .  he stepped inside and looked about .   three men were on duty .  one with earphones sat at the sub etheric receiver  another was at the calculating machine and the third was at the curved radarized visi plate .   bigman said   which one of you knotbrains called me shortie .    the three turned toward him in unison  their faces startled and scowling .   the man with the earphones pulled one away from his left ear .   who in space are you .  how the dickens did you get in here .    bigman stood erect and puffed out his small chest .   my name is john bigman jones .  my friends call me bigman .  everyone else calls me mr .  jones .  nobody calls me shortie and stays in one piece .  i want to know which one of you made that mistake .    the man with the earphones said   my name is lem     lucky starr  fisk and you can call me anything you blame please as long as you do it somewhere else .  get out of here  or i ll come down  pick you up by one leg  and toss you out .    the fellow at the calculating machine said   hey  lem  that s the crackpot who was haunting the port a while back .  there s no point in wasting time on him .  get the guards to throw him out .     nuts   said lem fisk   we don t need guards for that  guy .   he took off his earphones altogether and set the sub   etherics at automatic signal .  he said   well  son  you came in here and asked us a nice question in a nice way .  i ll give you a nice answer .  i called you shortie  but wait  don t get mad .  i had a reason .  you see you re such a real tall fellow .  you re such a long drink of water .  you re such a high pockets .  it makes my friends laugh to hear me call you shortie .    he reached into his hip pocket and drew out a plastic container of cigarettes .  the smile on his face was bland .    come down here   yelled bigman .   come down here and back up your sense of humor with a couple of fists .     temper  temper   said fisk  clucking his tongue .   here  boy  have a cigarette .  king size  you know .  almost as long as you are .  liable to create some confusion  though  come to think of it .  we won t be able to tell whether you re smoking the cigarette or the cigarette is smoking you .    the other two tower men laughed vigorously .   bigman was a passionate red .  words came thickly to his tongue .   you won t fight .     i d rather smoke .  pity you don t join me .   fisk leaned  bigman takes over     back  chose a cigarette  and held it before his face as though admiring its slim whiteness .   after all  i can t be bothered to fight children .    he grinned  brought his cigarette to his lips  and found them closing on nothingness .   his thumb and first two fingers still held their positions about three eighths of an inch apart  but there was no cigarette between them .    watch out  lem   cried the man at the visiplate .   he has a needle gun .     no needle gun   snarled bigman .   just a buzzer .    there was an important difference .  a buzzer s projectiles  although needle like  were fragile and nonexplo sive .  they were used for target practice and small game .  striking human skin  a buzz needle would do no serious damage  but it would smart like the devil .   fisk s grin disappeared completely .  he yelled   watch that  you crazy fool .  you can blind a man with that .    bigman s fist remained clenched at eye level .  the thin snout of the buzzer projected between his two middle fingers .  he said   i won t blind you .  but i can fix it so you won t sit down for a month .  and as you can see  my aim isn t bad .  and you   he called over his shoulder to the one at the calculator   if you move an inch closer to the alarm circuit  you ll have a buzz needle right through your hand .    fisk said   what do you want .     come down here and fight .         against a buzzer .     i ll put it away .  fists .  fair fight .  your buddies can see to that .       lucky starr   i can t hit a guy smaller than i am .     then you shouldn t insult him  either .   bigman brought up the buzzer .   and i m not smaller than you are .  i may look that way on the outside  but inside i m as big as you .  maybe bigger .  i m counting three .   he narrowed one eye as he aimed .    galaxy .   swore fisk .   i m coming down .  fellas  be my witness that this was forced on me .  i ll try not to hurt the crazy idiot too much .    he leaped down from his perch .  the man at the calculating machine took his place at the sub etherics .   fisk was five feet ten  eight inches taller than bigman  whose slight figure was more like a boy s than a man s .  but bigman s muscles were steel springs under perfect control .  he awaited the other s approach without expression .   fisk did not bother to put up a guard .  he simply extended his right hand as though he were going to lift bigman by the collar and toss him through the still open door .   bigman ducked under the arm .  his left and right thudded into the larger man s solar plexus in a rapid one two  and almost in the same instant he danced out of reach .   fisk turned green and sat down  holding his stomach and groaning .    stand up  big boy   said bigman .   i ll wait for you .    the other two tower men seemed frozen into immobility by the sudden turn of events .   slowly fisk rose to his feet .  his face glowed with rage  but he approached more slowly .   bigman takes over     bigman drifted away .   fisk lunged .  bigman was not there by two inches .  fisk whipped a sharp overhand right .  it s thrust ended an inch short of bigman s jaw .   bigman bobbed about like a cork on rippling water .  his arms lifted occasionally to deflect a blow .   fisk  yelling incoherently  rushed blindly at his gnat like opponent .  bigman stepped to one side and his open hand slapped sharply at the other s smooth shaven cheek .  it hit with a sharp report  like a meteor hitting the first layers of dense air above a planet .  the marks of four fingers were outlined in red on fisk s face .   for a moment fisk stood there  dazed .  like a striking snake  bigman stepped in again  his fists moving upward to crack against fisk s jaw .  fisk went down into a half crouch .   distantly bigman was suddenly aware of the steady ringing of the alarm .   without a moment s hesitation he turned on his heel and was out the door .  he wove through a startled trio of guards heading up the corridor at a clattering run  and was gone .           and why   questioned conway   are we waiting for bigman .    lucky said   here s the way i see the situation .  there is nothing we need so badly as more information about the pirates .  i mean inside information .  i tried to get it and things didn t quite break the way i hoped they would .  i m a marked man now .  they know me .  but they don t know bigman .  he has no official connection with     lucky starr  the council .  now it s my idea that if we can trump up a criminal charge against him  for realism  you know  he can hightail it out of ceres in the hermit s ship        oh  space   groaned conway .    listen  will you .  he ll go back to the hermit s asteroid .  if the pirates are there  good .  if not  he ll leave the ship in plain view and wait for them inside .  it s a very comfortable place to wait in .     and when they come   said henree   they ll shoot him .     they will not .  that s why he s taking the hermit s ship .  they ll have to know where hansen went  to say nothing of myself  where bigman came from  how he got hold of the ship .  they ll have to know .  that will give him time to talk .     and to explain how he picked out hansen s asteroid out of all the rocks in creation .  that would take some tall talking .     that won t take any talking at all .  the hermit s ship was on ceres  which it is .  i ve arranged to leave it out there unguarded  so he can take it .  he ll find the ship s home asteroid s space time co ordinates in the logbook .  it would just be an asteroid to him  not too far from ceres  as good as any other  and he would make a beeline for it in order to wait for the furor on ceres to die down .     it s a risk   grumbled conway .    bigman knows it .  and i tell you right now  we ve got to take risks .  earth is underestimating the pirate menace so badly that       he interrupted himself as the signal light of the com mum tube flashed on and off in rapid dots of light .   bigman takes over     conway  with an impatient motion of his hand  cut in the signal analyzer  then sat up straight .   he said   it s on the council wave length and  by ceres  it s one of the council scramblings .    the small visiplate above the communi tube was showing a characteristic rapidly shifting pattern of light and dark .   conway inserted a sliver of metal  which he took from a group of such in his wallet  into a narrow slot in the communi tube .  the sliver was a crystallite unscrambler  the active portion of the gadget consisting of a particular pattern of tiny crystals of tungsten embedded in an aluminum matrix .  it filtered the sub etheric signal in a specific way .  slowly conway adjusted the unscrambler  pushing it in deeper and extracting it again until it matched exactly a scrambler  similar in nature but opposite in function  at the other end of the signal .   the moment of complete adjustment was heralded by the sudden sharp focusing of the visiplate .   lucky half rose to his feet .   bigman .   he said .   where in space are you .    bigman s little face was grinning puckishly out at them .   i m in space all right .  a hundred thousand miles off ceres .  i m in the hermit s ship .    conway whispered furiously   is this another of your tricks .  i thought you said he was on ceres .     i thought he was   lucky said .  then   what happened  bigman .     you said we had to act quickly  so i fixed things up myself .  one of the wise guys in the control tower was giving me the business .  so i slammed him around a little     lucky starr  and took off .   he laughed .   check the guardhouse and see if they re not on the lookout for a guy like me with a complaint of assault and battery against him .     that wasn t the brightest thing you could have done   said lucky gravely .   you ll have a hard time convincing the men of the asteroids that you re the type for assault .  i don t want to hurt your feelings  but you look a little small for the job .     i ll knock down a few   bigman retorted .   they ll believe me .  but that s not why i called .     well  why did you .     how do i get to this guy s asteroid .    lucky frowned .   have you looked in the logbook .     great galaxy .  i ve looked everywhere .  i ve looked under the mattress even .  there s no record anywhere of any kind of co ordinates .    lucky s look of uneasiness grew .   that s strange .  in fact it s worse than strange .  look  bigman   he spoke rapidly and incisively   match ceres  speed .  give me your co ordinates with respect to ceres right now and keep them that way  whatever you do  till i call you .  you re too close to ceres now for any pirates to bother you  but if you drift out further  you may be in a bad way .  do you hear me .     check .  got you .  let me calculate my co ordinates .    lucky wrote them down and broke connections .  he said   space  when will i learn not to make assumptions .    henree said   hadn t you better have bigman come back .  it s a foolhardy setup at best and as long as you haven t the co ordinates  give the whole thing up .     give it up .   said lucky .   give up the one asteroid  bigman takes over     we know to be a pirates  base .  do you know of any other .  one single other .  we ve got to find the asteroid .  it s our only clue to the inside of this knot .    conway said   he s got a point there  gus .  it is a base .    lucky jiggled a switch on the intercom briskly and waited .   hansen s voice  sleep filled but startled  said   hello .  hello .    lucky said briskly   this is lucky starr  mr .  hansen .  sorry to disturb you  but i would like to have you come down here to dr .  conway s room as fast as you can .    the hermit s voice answered after a pause   certainly  but i don t know the way .     the guard at your door will take you .  i ll contact him .  can you make it in two minutes .     two and a half anyway   he said  good humoredly .  he sounded more awake .    good enough .    hansen was as good as his word .  lucky was waiting for him .   lucky paused for a moment  holding the door open .  he said to the guard   has there been any trouble at the base earlier this evening .  an assault  perhaps .    the guard looked surprised .   yes  sir .  the man who got hurt refused to press charges  though .  claimed it was a fair fight .    lucky closed the door .  he said   that follows .  any normal man would hate to get up in a guardhouse and admit a fellow the size of bigman had given him a banging .  i ll call the authorities later and have them put     lucky starr  the charge on paper anyway .  for the record .   .     .  mr .  hansen .     yes  mr .  starr .     i have a question the answer to which i did not want floating around the intercom system .  tell me  what are the co ordinates of your home asteroid .  standard and temporal both  of course .    hansen stared and his china blue eyes grew round .   well  you may find this hard to believe  but do you know  i really couldn t tell you .    chapter    the asteroid that wasn t  lucky met his eye steadily .   that is hard to believe  mr .  hansen .  i should think you would know your coordinates as well as a planet dweller would know his home address .    the hermit looked at his toes and said mildly   i suppose so .  it is my home address  really .  yet i don t know it .    conway said   if this man is deliberately    lucky broke in .   now wait .  let s force patience on ourselves if we have to .  mr .  hansen must have some explanation .    they waited for the hermit to speak .   co ordinates of the various bodies in the galaxy were the lifeblood of space travel .  they fulfilled the same function that lines of latitude and longitude did on the two dimensional surface of a planet .  however  since space is three dimensional  and since the bodies in it move about in every possible way  the necessary coordinates are more complicated .   basically there is first a standard zero position .  in the case of the solar system  the sun was the usual standard .  based on that standard  three numbers are necessary .  the first number is the distance of an object or a position in space from the sun .  the second and third numbers are      lucky starr  two angular measurements indicating the position of the object with reference to an imaginary line connecting the sun and the center of the galaxy .  if three sets of such co ordinates are known for three different times  set well apart  the orbit of a moving body could be calculated and its position  relative to the sun  known for any given time .   ships could calculate their own co ordinates with respect to the sun or  if it were more convenient  with respect to the nearest large body  whatever it was .  on the lunar lines  for instance  of which vessels traveled from earth to the moon and back  earth was the customary  zero point .   the sun s own co ordinates could be calculated with respect to the galactic center and the galactic prime meridian  but that was only important in traveling between the stars .   some of all this might have been passing through the hermit s mind as he sat there with the three councilmen watching him narrowly .  it was hard to tell .   hansen said suddenly   yes  i can explain .     we re waiting   said lucky .    i ve never had occasion to use the co ordinates in fifteen years .  i haven t left my asteroid at all for two years and before that any trips i made  maybe one or two a year  were short ones to ceres or vesta for supplies of one sort or another .  when i did that  i used local coordinates which i always calculated out for the moment .  i never worked out a table because i didn t have to .    i d only be gone a day or two  three at the most  and my own rock wouldn t drift far in that time .  it travels with the stream  a little slower than ceres or vesta when  the asteroid that wasn t      it s further from the sun and a little faster when it s nearer .  when i d head back for the position i calculated  my rock might have drifted ten thousand or even a hundred thousand miles off its original spot  but it was always close enough to pick up with the ship s telescope .  after that  i could always adjust my course by eye .  i never used the solar standard co ordinates because i never had to  and there it is .     what you re saying   said lucky   is that you couldn t get back to your rock now .  or did you calculate its local co ordinates before you left .     i never thought to   said the hermit sadly  .  it s been so long since i left it that i never gave the matter a second s attention .  not until the minute you called me in here .    dr .  henree said   wait .  wait .   he had lit up a fresh pipeful of tobacco and was puffing strongly .   i may be wrong  mr .  hansen  but when you first took over ownership of your asteroid  you must have filed a claim with the terrestrial outer world bureau .  is that right .     yes   said hansen   but it was only a formality .     that could be .  i m not arguing that .  still  the coordinates of your asteroid would be on record there .    hansen thought a bit  then shook his head .   i m afraid not  dr .  henree .  they took only the standard co ordinate set for january   of that year .  that was just to identify the asteroid  like a code number  in case of disputed ownership .  they weren t interested in anything more than that and you can t compute an orbit from only one set of numbers .     but you yourself must have had orbital values .  lucky      lucky starr  told us that you first used the asteroid as an annual vacation spot .  so you must have been able to find it from year to year .     that was fifteen years ago  dr .  henree .  i had the values  yes .  and those values are somewhere in my record books on the rock  but they re not in my memory .    lucky  his brown eyes clouded  said   there s nothing else at the moment  mr .  hansen .  the guard will take you back to the room and we ll let you know when we need you again .  and  mr .  hansen   he added as the hermit rose   if you should happen to think of the co ordinates  let us know .     my word on that  mr .  starr   said hansen gravely .   the three were alone again .  lucky s hand shot out to the communi tube .   key me in for transmission   he said .   the voice of the man at central communications came back .   was the previous incoming message for you  sir .  i couldn t unscramble it so i thought        you did well .  transmission  please .    lucky adjusted a scrambler and used bigman s coordinates to zero in the sub etheric beam .    bigman   he said when the other s face appeared   open the logbook again .     do you have the co ordinates  lucky .     not yet .  have you got the logbook open .     yes .     is there a sheet of scrap paper somewhere in it .  loose  with calculations all over it .     wait .  yes .  here it is .    the asteroid that wasn t       hold it up in front of your transmitter .  i want to see it .    lucky pulled a sheet of paper before him and copied down the figuring .   all right  bigman  take it away .  now listen  stay put .  get me .  stay put  no matter what  till you hear from me .  signing off .    he turned to the two older men .   i navigated the ship from the hermit s rock to ceres by eye .  i adjusted course three or four times  using his ship s telescope and vernier instruments for observation and measurements .  these are my calculations .    conway nodded .   now  i suppose  you intend calculating backwards to find out the rock s co ordinates .     it can be done easily enough  particularly if we make use of the ceres observatory .    conway rose heavily .   i can t help but think you make too much of all this  but i ll follow your instinct for a while .  let s go to the observatory .           corridors and elevators took them close to ceres  surface  one half mile above the council of science offices on the asteroid .  it was chilly there  since the observatory made every attempt to keep the temperature as constant as possible and as near surface temperature as the human body could endure .   slowly and carefully a young technician was unraveling lucky s calculations  feeding them into the computer and controlling the operations .   dr .  henree  in a not too comfortable chair  huddled his thin body together and seemed to be trying to extract      lucky starr  warmth from his pipe  for his large knuckled hands hovered closely about its bowl .   he said   i hope this comes to something .    lucky said   it had better .   he sat back  his eyes fixed thoughtfully on the opposite wall .   look  uncle hector  you referred to my  instinct  a while back .  it isn t instinct  not any more .  this run of piracy is entirely different from that of a quarter century ago .     their ships are harder to catch or stop  if that s what you mean   said conway .    yes  but doesn t that make it all the stranger that their raids are confined to the asteroid belt .  it s only here in the asteroids that trade has been disrupted .     they re being cautious .  twenty five years ago  when their ships ranged all the way to venus  we were forced to mount an offensive and crush them .  now they stick to the asteroids and the government hesitates to take expensive measures .     so far  so good   said lucky   but how do they support themselves .  it s always been the assumption that pirates didn t raid for pure joy of it alone  but to pick up ships  food  water  and supplies .  you would think that now more than ever that was a necessity .  captain anton boasted to me of hundreds of ships and thousands of worlds .  that may have been a lie to impress me  but he certainly took time for the push gun duel  drifting openly in space for hours as though he had no fear whatever of government interference .  and hansen said  moreover  that the pirates had appropriated the various hermit worlds as stopping off places .  there are hundreds of hermit worlds .  if the pirates dealt with all of them  or  the asteroid that wasn t      even a good part of them  that also means a large organization .    now where do they get the food to support a large organization and at the same time mount fewer raids now than pirates did twenty five years ago .  the pirate crewman  martin maniu  spoke to me of wives and families .  he was a vat man  he said .  presumably he cultured yeast .  hansen had yeast foods on his asteroid and they weren t venus yeast .  i know the taste of venus yeast .    put it all together .  they grow their own food in small yeast farms distributed among asteroid caverns .  they can get carbon dioxide directly from limestone rocks  and water and extra oxygen from the jovian satellites .  machinery and power units may be imported from sirius or obtained by an occasional raid .  raids will also supply them with more recruits  both men and women .    what it amounts to is that sirius is building an independent government against us .  it s making use of discontented people to build a widespread society that will be difficult or impossible to crush if we wait too long .  the leaders  the captain antons  are after power in the first place and they re perfectly willing to give half the terrestrial empire to sirius if they themselves can keep the other half .    conway shook his head .   that s an awfully big structure for the small foundation of fact you have .  i doubt if we could convince the government .  the council of science can act by itself only so far  you know .  we don t have a fleet of our own  unfortunately .     i know .  that s exactly why we need more informa       lucky starr  tion .  if  while it is still early in the game  we can find their major bases  capture their leaders  expose their sirian connections        well .     why  it s my opinion the movement would be done with .  i m convinced that the average  man of the asteroids   to use their own phrase  has no idea he s being made a sirian puppet .  he probably has a grievance against earth .  he may think he s had a raw deal  resent the fact that he couldn t find a job or advancement  that he wasn t getting along as well as he should have .  he may have been attracted to what he thought would be a colorfyl life .  all that  maybe .  still  that s a long way from saying he d be willing to side with earth s worst enemy .  when he finds out that his leaders have been tricking him into doing just that  the pirate menace will fall apart .    lucky halted his intense whispering as the technician approached  holding a flexible transparent tape with the computer s code prickings upon it .    say   he said   are you sure these figures you gave me were right .    lucky said   i m sure .  why .    the technician shook his head .   there s something wrong .  the final co ordinates put your rock inside one of the forbidden zones .  that s allowing for proper motion  too .  i mean it can t be .    lucky s eyebrows lifted sharply .  the man was certainly right about the forbidden zones .  no asteroids could possibly be found within them .  those zones represented portions of the asteroid belt in which asteroids  if  the asteroid that wasn t      they had existed  would have had times of revolution about the sun that were an even fraction of jupiter s twelve year period of revolution .  that would have meant that the asteroid and jupiter would have continually approached  every few years  in the same portion of space .  jupiter s repeated pull would slowly move the asteroid out of that zone .  in the two billion years since the planets had been formed jupiter had cleared every asteroid out of the forbidden zones and that was that .    are you sure   lucky said   that your calculations are right .    the technician shrugged as though to say   i know my business .    but aloud he only said   we can check it by telescope .  the thousand incher is busy  but that s no good for close work anyway .  we ll get one of the smaller ones .  will you follow me  please .    the observatory proper was almost like a shrine  with the various telescopes the altars .  men were absorbed in their work and did not pause to look up when the technician and the three councilmen entered .   the technician led the way to one of the wings into which the huge  cavernous room was divided .    charlie   he said to a prematurely balding young man   can you swing bertha into action .     what for .   charlie looked up from a series of photographic prints  star speckled  over which he had been bending .    i want to check the spot represented by these coordinates .   he held out the computer film .   charlie glanced at it and frowned .   what for .  that s forbidden zone territory .        lucky starr   would you focus the point anyway .   asked the technician .   it s council of science business .     oh .  yes  sir .   he was suddenly far more pleasant .   it won t take long .    he closed a switch and a flexible diaphragm sucked inward high above  closing about the shaft of  bertha   a hundred twenty inch telescope used for close work .  the diaphragm made an air tight seal  and above it lucky could make out the smooth whir of the surface lock opening .  bertha s large eye lifted upward  the diaphragm clinging  and was exposed to the heavens .    mostly   explained charlie   we use bertha for photographic work .  ceres  rotation is too rapid for convenient optical observations .  the point you re interested in is over the horizon  which is lucky .    he took his seat near the eyepiece  riding the telescope s shaft as though it were the stiff trunk of a giant elephant .  the telescope angled and the young astronomer lifted high .  carefully he adjusted the focus .   he lifted out of his perch then and stepped down the rungs of a wall ladder .  at the touch of his finger a partition directly below the telescope moved aside to show a black lined pit .  into it a series of mirrors and lenses could focus and magnify the telescopic image .   there was only blackness .   charlie said   that s it .   he used a meter stick as a point .   that little speck is metis  which is a pretty big rock .  it s twenty five miles across  but it s millions of miles away .  here you have a few specks within a million miles of the point you re interested in  but they re to one side  outside the forbidden zone .  we ve got the stars  the asteroid that wasn t      blanked out by phase polarization or they d confuse everything .     thank you   said lucky .  he sounded stunned .    any time .  glad to help whenever i can .           they were in the elevator  headed downward  before lucky spoke again .  he said distantly   it can t be .     why not .   said henree .   your figures were wrong .     how could they be .  i got to ceres .     you may have intended one figure and put d wn another by mistake  then made a correction by eye and forgot to correct the paper .    lucky shook his head .   i couldn t have done that .     just don t    wait .  great galaxy .   he stared at them  wildly .    what s the matter  lucky .     it works out .  space  it fits in .  look  i was wrong .  it s not early in the game at all  it s darned late in the game .  it may be too late .  i ve underestimated them again .    the elevator had reached the proper level .  the door opened and lucky was out with a rapid stride .   conway ran after  seized his elbow  swung him about .   what are you talking about .     i m going out there .  don t even think of stopping me .  and if i don t come back  for earth s sake  force the government to begin major preparations .  otherwise the pirates may be in control of the entire system within a year .  perhaps sooner .     why .   demanded conway violently .   because you couldn t find an asteroid .     exactly   said lucky .   chapter     the asteroid that was  bigman had brought conway and henree to ceres on lucky s own ship  the shooting starr  and for that lucky was grateful .  it meant he could go out into space with it  feel its deck beneath his feet  hold its controls in his hands .   the shooting starr was a two man cruiser  built this last year after lucky s exploits among the farm boys of mars .  its appearance was as deceptive as modern science could make it .  it had almost the appearance of a space yacht in its graceful lines  and its extreme length was not more than twice that of hansen s little rowboat .  no traveler in space  meeting the shooting starr  would have estimated it to be anything more than a rich man s plaything  speedy perhaps but thin skinned and unequal to hard knocks .  certainly it would not have seemed the type of vessel to trust in the dangerous reaches of the asteroid belt .   an investigation of the interior of the vessel might have changed some of those notions  however .  the gleaming hyperatomic motors were the equal of those on armored space cruisers ten times the shooting starr s weight .  its energy reserve was tremendous and the capacity of its hysteretic shield was sufficient to stop the largest projectile that could be put out against it by any       lucky starr  thing short of a dreadnought .  offensively its limited mass prevented it from being first class  but weight for weight it could outfight any ship .          it was no wonder that bigman capered with delight once he had entered the air lock and thrown off his space suit .    space   bigman said   i m glad to get off that other tub .  what do we do with it .     i ll have them send up a ship from ceres to scoop it  .     in .   ceres was behind them  a hundred thousand miles away .  in appearance it was about half the diameter of the moon as seen from earth .   bigman said curiously   how about letting me in on all this  lucky .  why the sudden change of plans .  i was heading out all by myself  the last i heard .     there aren t any co ordinates for you to head to   said lucky .  grimly he told him the events of the last several hours .   bigman whistled .   then where are we going .     i m not sure   said lucky   but we begin by aiming at the place where the hermit s rock ought to be now .    he studied the dials  and added   and we leave here fast  too .    he meant fast .  acceleration on the shooting starr went high as velocity built up .  bigman and lucky were pinned back to their diamagnetically cushioned chairs and the growing pressure spread evenly over their entire body surfaces .  the oxygen concentration in the cabin was built up by the acceleration sensitive air purifier  the asteroid that was      controls and allowed shallower breathing without oxygen starvation .  the g harness  g being the usual scientific symbol for acceleration  they both wore was light and did not hamper their movements  but under the stress of increasing velocity it stiffened and protected the bones  particularly the spine  from breaking .  a nylotex mesh girdle kept the abdominal viscera from undue harm .   in every respect the cabin accessories had been designed by experts at the council of science to allow of twenty to thirty per cent greater acceleration on the shooting starr than on even the most advanced vessels of the fleet .   even on this occasion the acceleration  though high  was less than half of that of which the ship was capable .   when velocity leveled off  the shooting starr was five million miles from ceres  and  if lucky or bigman had been interested in looking for it  they would have found it to have become  in appearance  merely a speck of light  dimmer than many of the stars .   bigman said   say  lucky  i ve been wanting to ask you .  do you have your glimmer shield .    lucky nodded and bigman looked grieved .    well  you big dumb ox   the little fellow said   why in space didn t you take it with you when you went out pirate hunting then .     i did have it with me   said lucky calmly .   i ve had it with me since the day the martians gave it to me .    as lucky and bigman  but no one else in the galaxy  knew  the martians to whom lucky referred were not the farm boys and ranchers of mars .  they were rather a      lucky starr  race of immaterial creatures who were the direct descendants of the ancient intelligences that once inhabited the surface of mars in the ages before it had lost its oxygen and water .  excavating huge caverns below mars  surface by destroying cubic miles of rock  converting the matter so destroyed into energy and storing that energy for future use  they now lived in comfortable isolation .  abandoning their material bodies and living as pure energy  their existence remained unsuspected by mankind .  only lucky starr had penetrated their fastnesses and as the one souvenir of that eerie trip  he had obtained what bigman called the  glimmer shield .    bigman s annoyance increased .   well  if you had it  why didn t you use it .  what s wrong with you .     you have the wrong idea of the shield  bigman .  it won t do everything .  it won t feed me and wipe my lips when i m through .     i ve seen what it can do .  it can do plenty .     it can  in certain ways .  it can soak up all types of energy .     like the energy of a blaster bolt .  you re not going to kick about that  are you .     no  i admit i d be immune to blasters .  the shield would soak up potential energy  too  if the mass of a body weren t too great or too small .  for instance  a knife or an ordinary bullet couldn t penetrate  though the bullet might knock me down .  a good sledge hammer would swing right through the shield  though  and even if it didn t its momentum would crush me .  and what s more    see david starr  space ranger  doubleday   co .   inc .        .   the asteroid that was      molecules of air can go through the shield as if it weren t there because they re too small to be handled .  i m telling you this so that you ll understand that if i were wearing the shield and dingo had broken my face plate when we were both tangled up in space  i would have died anyway .  the shield wouldn t have prevented the air in my suit from scattering away in a split second .     if you had used it in the first place  lucky  you wouldn t have had any trouble .  don t i remember when you used it on mars .   bigman chuckled at the reminiscence .   it glimmered all over you  smoky like  only luminous  so you could just be seen in a haze .  all except your face anyway .  that was just a sheet of white light .     yes   said lucky dryly   i would have scared them .  they would have hit at me with blasters and i wouldn t have been hurt .  so they would have all high tailed it off the atlas  gone off about ten miles  and blasted the ship .  i would have been stone dead .  don t forget that the shield is only a shield .  it doesn t give me any offensive powers whatever .     aren t you ever going to use it again .   asked bigman .    when it s necessary .  not till then .  if i use it too much  the effect would be lost .  its weaknesses would be found out and i would be just a target for anyone i came up against .    lucky studied the instruments .  calmly he said   ready for acceleration again .    bigman said   hey       then  as he was pushed back into his seat  he found himself fighting for breath and could say nothing more .       lucky starr  the redness was rising to his eyes and he could feel the skin drawing backward as though it were trying to peel off his bones .   this time the shooting starrs acceleration was on full .   it lasted fifteen minutes .  toward the end bigman was scarcely conscious .  then it relaxed and life crept back .   lucky was shaking his head and panting for breath .   bigman said   hey  that wasn t funny .     i know   said lucky .    what s the idea .  weren t we going fast enough .     not quite .  but it s all right now .  we ve shaken them .     shaken whom .     whoever was following us .  we were being followed  bigman  from the minute you stepped foot on the deck of the old shooter .  look at the ergometer .    bigman did so .  the ergometer resembled the one on the atlas in name only .  the one on the atlas had been a primitive model designed to pick up motor radiation for the purpose of releasing the lifeboats .  that had been its only purpose .  the ergometer on the shooting starr could pick up the radiation pattern of a hyperatomic motor on ships no larger than an ordinary lifeboat and do it at a distance of better than two million miles .   even now the inked line on the graphed paper jiggled very faintly  but periodically .    that isn t anything   said bigman .    it was  a while ago .  look for yourself .   lucky unreeled the cylinder of paper that had already passed the needle .  the jigglings grew deeper  more characteristic .   see that  bigman .     it could be any ship .  it could be a ceres freighter .    the asteroid that was       no .  for one thing  it tried to follow us and did a good job of it  too  which means it had a pretty good ergom eter of its own .  besides that  did you ever see an energy pattern like this .     not exactly like this  lucky .     i did  you see  in the case of the ship that boarded the atlas .  this ergometer does a much better job of pattern analysis  but the resemblance is definite .  the motor of the ship that s following us is of sirian design .     you mean it s anton s ship .     that or a similar one .  it doesn t matter .  we ve lost them .            at the moment   said lucky   we re right where the hermit s rock should be  plus or minus  say  a hundred thousand miles .     nothing s here   said bigman .    that s right .  the gravities register no asteroidal mass anywhere near us .  we re in what the astronomers call a forbidden zone .     uh huh   said bigman wisely   i see .    lucky smiled .  there was nothing to see .  a forbidden zone in the asteroid belt looked no different from a portion of the belt that was thickly strewn with rocks  at least not to the naked eye .  unless an asteroid happened to be within a hundred miles or so  the view was the same .  stars or things that looked like stars filled the heavens .  if some of them were asteroids and not stars  there was no way of telling the difference short of watching intently for several hours to see which  stars  changed relative position  or using a telescope to begin with .       lucky starr  bigman said   well  what do we do .     look around the neighborhood .  it may take us a few days .    the path of the shooting starr grew erratic .  it headed outward from the sun  away from the forbidden zone and into the nearest constellation of asteroids .  the gravities jumped their needles at the pull of distant mass .   tiny world after tiny world slid into the field of the visiplate  was allowed to remain there while it rotated  and was then permitted to slip out .  the shooting starr s velocity had decelerated to a relative crawl  but the miles still passed by the hundreds of thousands and into the millions .  the hours passed .  a dozen asteroids came and went .    you better eat   said bigman .   but lucky contented himself with sandwiches and catnaps while he and bigman watched visiplate  gravities and ergometer in turn .   then  with an asteroid in view  lucky said in a strained voice   i m going down .    bigman was caught by surprise .   is that the asteroid .   he looked at its angularity .   do you recognize it .     i think i do  bigman .  in any case  it s going to be investigated .    it took half an hour to manipulate the ship into the asteroid s shadow .    keep it here    . lucky said .   someone s got to stay with the ship and you re the one .  don t forget it .  it can be detected  but if it s in the shadow  with the lights out and the motors at minimum  it will make it as hard as possible  the asteroid that was      for them .  according to the ergometer  there s no ship in space near us now .  right .     right .     the most important thing to remember is this  don t come down after me for any reason .  when i m through  i ll come up to you .  if i m not back in twelve hours and haven t called  either  back you go to ceres with a report  after taking photographs of this asteroid at every angle .    bigman s face grew sullenly stubborn .   no .     this is the report   said lucky calmly .  he withdrew a personal capsule from an inner pocket .   this capsule is keyed to dr .  conway .  he s the only one who can open it .  he s got to get the information  regardless of me .  do you understand .     what s in it .   asked bigman  making no move to take it .    just theories  i m afraid .  i ve told no one of them  because i ve come out here to try to get facts to back them up .  if i can t make it  the theories  at least  must get through .  conway may believe them and he may get the government to act upon them .     i won t do it   said bigman .   i won t leave you .     bigman  if i can t trust you to do what s right regardless of yourself and myself  you won t be much use to me after this if i come through safely .    bigman held out his hand .  the personal capsule was dropped into it .    all right   he said .          lucky dropped through vacuum to the asteroid s surface  hastening the drop by use of the suit s push gun .       lucky starr  he knew the asteroid to be about the right size .  it was roughly the shape he remembered it to be .  it was jagged enough and the sunlit portion looked the right color .  all that  however  might have held true for any asteroid .   but there was the other item .  that was not likely to be duplicated very often .   from his waist pouch he took out a small instrument that looked like a compass .  actually it was a pocket radar unit .  its enclosed emission source could put out radio short waves of almost any range .  certain octaves could be partially reflected by rock and partially transmitted through reasonable distances .   in the presence of a thick layer of rock the reflection of radiation activated a needle on the dial .  in the presence of a thin layer of rock  as  for instance  on a surface under which lay a cave or hollow  some radiation was reflected  but some penetrated into the hollow and was reflected from the further wall .  in this way a double reflection occurred  one component of which was much weaker than the second .  in response to such a double reflection the needle responded with a characteristic double quiver .   lucky watched the instrument as he leaped easily over the stony peaks .  the needle s smooth pulsing gained a quiver  and then a distinct subsidiary movement .  lucky s heart bounded .  the asteroid was hollow .  find where the subsidiary movements were strongest and there the hollow would be nearest the surface .  there would be the air lock .   for a few moments all of lucky s faculties were concentrated on the needle .  he was unaware of the mag   the asteroid that was      netic cable snaking its way toward him from the near horizon .   he was unaware of it until it snapped about him in coil after coil  clinging close  its momentum tossing his nearly weightless body first clear of the asteroid and then down to the rock  where he lay helpless .   chapter     at close quarters  three lights came over the horizon and toward the prostrate lucky .  in the darkness of the asteroid s night he could not see the figures that accompanied the lights .   then there was a voice in his ear and the voice was the well known hoarseness of the pirate  dingo .  it said   don t call your pal upstairs .  i ve got a jigger here that can pick up your carrier wave .  if you try to  i ll blast you out of your suit right now  nark .    he spat out the final word  the contemptuous term of all lawbreakers for those they considered to be spies of the law enforcement agencies .   lucky kept silent .  from the moment he had first felt the tremor of his suit under the lash of the magnetic cable he knew that he had fallen into a trap .  to call bigman before he knew more about the nature of the trap would have been putting the shooting starr into danger  and that without helping himself .   dingo stood over him  a foot on either side .  in the light of one of the flashes lucky caught a quick glimpse of dingo s face plate and of the stubby goggles that covered his eyes .  lucky knew those to be infrared translators  capable of converting ordinary heat radiation into visible light .  even without flashes and in the asteroid s  dark night they had been able to watch him by the energy of his own heaters .   dingo said   what s the matter  nark .  scared .   he lifted a bulky leg with its bulkier metal swathing and brought his heel down sharply in the direction of lucky s face plate .  lucky turned his head swiftly away to let the blow fall on the sturdier metal of the helmet  but dingo s heel stopped midway .  he laughed whoop   ingly .    you won t get it that easy  nark   he said .   his voice changed as he spoke to the other two pirates .   hop over the jag and get the air lock open .    for a moment they hesitated .  one of them said   but  dingo   the captain said you were too       dingo said   get going  or maybe i ll start with him and finish with you .    in the face of the threat the two hopped away .  dingo said to lucky   now suppose we get you to the air lock .    he was still holding the butt end of the magnetic cable .  with a flick at the switch he turned off its current and momentarily demagnetized it .  he stepped away and pulled it sharply toward himself .  lucky dragged along the rocky floor of the asteroid  bounced upward  and rolled partly out of the cable .  dingo touched the switch again and the remaining coils suddenly clung and held .   dingo flicked the whip upward .  lucky traveled with it  while dingo maneuvered skillfully to maintain his own balance .  lucky hovered in space and dingo walked with him as though he were a child s balloon at the end of a string .   at close quarters      the lights of the other two were visible again after five minutes .  they were shining into a patch of darkness of which regular boundaries were proof enough that it was an open air lock .   dingo called   watch out .  i ve got a package to deliver .    he demagnetized the cable again  and flicked it downward  rising six inches into the air as he did so .  lucky rotated rapidly  spinning completely out of the cable .   dingo leaped upward and caught him .  with the skill of a man long used to weightlessness  he avoided lucky s attempts to break his hold  and hurled him in the direction of the air lock .  he broke his own backward tumble by a quick double spurt of his suit s push gun and righted himself in time to see lucky enter the air lock cleanly .   what followed was clearly visible in the light of the pirates  flashes .  caught in the pseudo grav field that existed within the air lock  lucky was hurled suddenly downward  hitting the rocky floor with a clatter and force that knocked the breath out of him .  dingo s braying laughter filled his helmet .   the outer door closed  the inner opened .  lucky got to his feet  actually thankful for the normality of gravity .    get in  nark .   dingo was holding a blaster .   lucky paused as he entered the asteroid s interior .  his eyes shifted quickly from side to side while the frost gathered at the rims of his face plate .  what he saw was not the soft lit library of the hermit  hansen  but a tremendously long hallway  the roof of which was supported by a series of pillars .  he could not see to the other end .  openings to rooms pierced the wall of the corridors      lucky starr  regularly .  men hurried to and fro and there was the smell of ozone and machine oil in the air .  in the distance he could hear the characteristic drum drum of what must have been gigantic hyperatomic motors .   it was quite obvious that this was no hermit s cell  but a large industrial plant  inside an asteroid .   lucky bit his lower lip thoughtfully and wondered despondently if all this information would die with him now .   dingo said   in there  nark .  get in there .    it was a storeroom he indicated  its shelves and bins well filled  but empty of human beings other than themselves .    say  dingo   said one of the pirates nervously   why are we showing him all this .  i don t think     then don t talk   said dingo  and laughed .   don t worry  he won t tell anyone about anything he sees .  i guarantee that .  meanwhile i have a little something to finish with him .  get that suit off him .    he was removing his own suit as he spoke .  he stepped out  monstrously bulky .  one hand rubbed slowly over the hairy back of the other .  he was savoring the moment .   lucky said firmly   captain anton never gave you orders to kill me .  you re trying to finish a private feud and it will only get you into trouble .  i m a valuable man to the captain and he knows it .    dingo sat down on the edge of a bin of small metal objects  with a grin on his face .   to listen to you  nark  you d think you had a case .  but you didn t fool us  not for one minute .  when we left you on the rock with the hermit  what do you think we did .  we watched .  cap   at close quarters      tain anton s no fool .  he sent me back .  he said   watch that rock and report back .   i saw the hermit s dinghy leave .  i could have blasted you out of space then  but the order was to follow .    i stayed off ceres for a day and a half and spotted the hermit s dinghy hitting out for space again .  i waited some more .  then i caught this other ship coming out to meet it .  the man off the dinghy got on to the other ship and i followed you when you took off .    lucky could not help smiling .   tried to follow  you mean .    dingo s face turned a blotchy red .  he spat out   all right .  you were faster .  your kind is good at running .  what of it .  i didn t have to chase you .  i just came here and waited .  i knew where you were heading .  i ve got you  haven t i .    lucky said   all right  but what have you got .  i was unarmed on the hermit s rock .  i didn t have any weapons  while the hermit had a blaster .  i had to do what he said .  he wanted to get back to ceres and he forced me along so he could claim he was being kidnapped if the men of the asteroids stopped him .  you admit yourself that i got off ceres as fast as i could and tried to get back here .     in a nice  shiny government ship .     i stole it .  so .  it just means that you ve got another ship for your fleet .  and a good one .    dingo looked at the other pirates .   doesn t he throw the comet dust  though .    lucky said   i warn you again .  the captain will take anything that happens to me out on you .        lucky starr   no he won t   snarled dingo   because he knows who you are and so do i  mr .  david lucky starr .  come on  move out into the middle of the room .    dingo rose .  he said to his two companions   get those bins out of the way .  pull them over to one side .    they looked at his staring  blood congested face once and did as he said .  dingo s bulbously thickset body was slightly stooped  his head sank down into his bulging shoulders  and his thick  somewhat bandy  legs planted themselves firmly .  the scar on his upper lip was a vivid white .   he said   there are easy ways of finishing you and there are nice ways .  i don t like a nark and i especially don t like a nark who fouls me in a push gun fight .  so before i finish you  i m breaking you into little pieces .    lucky  looking tall and spindly in comparison with the other  said   are you man enough to take care of me alone  dingo  or will your two friends help you .     i don t need help  pretty boy .   he laughed nastily .   but if you try to run  they ll stop you  and if you keep on trying to run  they ve got neuronic whips that will really stop you .   he raised his voice .   and use them  you two  if you have to .    lucky waited for the other to make his move .  he knew that the one most nearly fatal tactic would be to try to mix it up at close quarters .  let the pirate enclose his chest in the hug of those enormous arms and broken ribs would be the nearly certain result .   dingo  right fist drawn back  ran forward .  lucky stood his ground as long as he dared  then stepped quickly to his right  seized his opponent s extended left arm  pulled  at close quarters      backward  taking advantage of the other s forward momentum  and caught the other s ankle against his foot .   dingo went sprawling forward and down heavily .  he was up immediately  however  one cheek scraped and little lights of madness dancing in his eyes .   he thundered toward lucky  who retired nimbly toward one of the bins lining the wall .   lucky seized the ends of the bin and swung his legs up and out .  dingo caught them in his chest  halted momentarily .  lucky whirled out of the way and was free in the center of the room again .   one of the pirates called out   hey  dingo  let s stop fooling around .    dingo panted   i ll kill him .  i ll kill him .    but he was more cautious now .  his little eyes were nearly buried in the fat and gristle that surrounded his eyeballs .  he crept forward  watching lucky  waiting for the moment he might strike .   lucky said   what s the matter  dingo .  afraid of me .  you get afraid very quick for such a big talker .    as lucky expected  dingo roared incoherently and dashed heavily and directly at him .  lucky had no trouble in evading the bull rush .  the side of his hand came sharply and swiftly down on the back of dingo s neck .   lucky had seen any number of men knocked unconscious by that particular blow  he had seen more than one killed .  but dingo merely staggered .  he shook it off and turned  snarling .   he walked flat footedly toward the dancing lucky .  lucky lashed out with his fist  which landed sharply on dingo s scraped cheek bone .  blood flowed  but dingo      lucky starr  did not so much as attempt to block the blow  nor did he blink when it landed .   lucky squirmed away and struck sharply twice more at the pirate .  dingo paid no attention .  he came forward  always forward .   suddenly  unexpectedly  he went down  apparently as a man who had stumbled .  but his arms shot out as he fell and one hand closed about lucky s right ankle .  lucky went down too .    i ve got you now   whispered dingo .   he reached up to catch lucky s waist and in a moment  fast locked  they were rolling across the floor .   lucky felt the growing  enclosing pressure and pain washed inward like an advancing flame .  dingo s fetid panting was in his ear .   lucky s right arm was free  but his left was enclosed in the numbing vise of the other s grip about his chest .  with the last of his fading strength  lucky brought his right fist up .  the blow traveled no more than four inches  catching the point where dingo s chin met his neck with a force that sent stabs of pain the length of lucky s arm .   dingo s grip loosened for a moment and lucky  writhing  flung himself out of the deadly embrace and onto his feet .   dingo got up more slowly .  his eyes were glassy  and fresh blood was trickling out the corner of his mouth .   he muttered thickly   the whip .  the whip .    unexpectedly he turned upon one of the pirates who had been standing there a frozen onlooker .  he wrested the weapon from the other s hand and send him sprawling .   lucky tried to duck  but the neurom c whip was up  at close quarters      and flashing .  it caught his right side and stimulated the nerves of the area it struck into a bath of pain .  lucky s body stiffened and went down again .   for a moment his senses recorded only confusion  and with what consciousness he possessed he expected death to be a second off .  dimly he heard a pirate s voice .    look  dingo  the captain said to make it look like an accident .  he s a council of science man and  .   .   .    it was all lucky heard .   when he swam back to consciousness with an excruciating tingle of pins and needles down the length of his side  he found himself in a space suit again .  they were just afyout to put on his helmet .  dingo  lips puffed  cheek and jaw bruised  watched malignantly .   there was a voice in the doorway .  a man was entering hurriedly  full of talk .   lucky heard him say    for post     .  it s getting so i can t keep track of all the requisitions .  i can t even keep our own orbit straight enough to keep up the co ordinate corrections of       the voice flickered out .  lucky twisted his head and caught sight of a small man with spectacles and gray hair .  he was just inside the doorway  looking with mingled astonishment and disbelief at the disorder that met his eyes .    get out   roared dingo .    but i ve got to have a requisition        later .    the little man left and the helmet was fitted over lucky s head .   they took him out again  through the air lock  to a      lucky starr  surface which was now in the feeble blaze of the distant sun .  a catapult waited on a relatively flat table of rock .  its function was no mystery to lucky .  an automatic winch was drawing back a large metal lever which bent more and more slowly till its original slant had strained back into a complete horizontal at the tip .  light straps were attached to the bent lever and then buckled about lucky s waist .    lie still   said dingo .  his voice was dim and scratchy in lucky s ear .  there was something wrong with the helmet receiver  lucky realized .   you re just wasting your oxygen .  just to make you feel better  we re sending ships up to blast your friend down before he can pick up speed  if he feels like running .    an instant after that lucky felt the sharp tingling vibration of the lever as it was released .  it sprang elas tically back into its original position with terrific force .  the buckles about him parted smoothly and he was cast off at a speed of a mile a minute or better  with no gravitational field to slow him .  there was one glimpse of the asteroid with the pirates looking up at him .  the whole was shrinking rapidly even as he watched .   he inspected his suit .  he already knew that his helmet radio had been maltreated .  sure enough  the sensitivity knob hung loose .  it meant his voice could penetrate no more than a few miles of space .  they had left him his space suit s push gun .  he tried it but nothing happened .  its gas stores had been drained .   he was quite helpless .  there were only the contents of one oxygen cylinder between himself and a slow  unpleasant death .   chapter     ship versus ship  with a clammy constriction of his chest lucky surveyed the situation .  he thought he could guess the pirates  plans .  on the one hand  they wished to get rid of him  since he obviously knew far too much .  on the other hand  they must want him to be found dead in such a way that the council of science would be unable to prove conclusively that his death was by pirate violence .   once before  pirates had made the mistake of killing an agent of the council and the resultant fury had been crushing .  they would be more cautious this time .   he thought  they ll rush the shooting starr  blanket it with interference to keep bigman from sending out a call for help .  then they can use a cannon blast on its hull .  it would make a good imitation of a meteorite collision .  they can make that look better by sending their own engineers on board to hocus the shield activators .  it would look as though a defect in the mechanism had prevented the shield from going up as the meteorite approached .   they would know his own course through space  lucky knew .  there would be nothing to deflect him from whatever his original angles of flight had been .  later  with him safely dead  they would pick him up and send him whirling in an orbit about the broken shooting      lucky starr  starr .  the discoverers  and perhaps one of their own ships would send in an anonymous report of the find  would reach an obvious conclusion .  bigman at the controls  maneuvering to the last  killed at his post .  lucky  on the other hand  scrambling into a suit  damaging the external sensitivity knob of the suit s radio in the excitement .  he would have been unable to call for help .  he would have expended his push gun s gas in a desperate and futile attempt to find a place of safety .  and he would have died .   it would not work .  neither conway nor henree could possibly believe that lucky would be concerned only with his own safety while bigman stuck loyally at the controls .  but then  the failure of the scheme  would be small satisfaction to a dead lucky starr .  worse yet  it would not only be lucky starr who would die  but all the information now locked in lucky starr s head .   for a moment he was sick with outrage at himself that he had not forced all his suspicions on conway and henree before leaving  that he had waited till he boarded the shooting starr before preparing the personal capsule .  then he gained control of himself .  no one would have believed him without facts .   for that very reason he would have to get back .   have to .   but how .  what good was  have to  when one was alone and helpless in space with a few hours  worth of oxygen and nothing else .   oxygen .   lucky thought  there s my oxygen .  anyone but dingo would have drained his cylinder of all but dregs  to let  ship versus ship      death come quickly .  but if lucky knew dingo  the pirate had sent him on his way with a loaded cylinder simply to prolong the agony .   good .  then he would reverse that .  he would use the oxygen otherwise .  and if he failed  death would come the sooner  despite dingo .   only he must not fail .   the asteroid had been crossing his line of vision periodically as he spun in space .  first  it was a shrinking rock  its sunlit highlights slanting jaggedly across the blackness of space .  then it had been a bright star and a single line of light .  the brightness was fading quickly now .  once the asteroid became dim enough to be simply one more in the myriad of stars  it was all over .  not many minutes were left before that would be the case .   his clumsy  metal covered fingers were already fumbling with the flexible tube that led from the air inlet just under the face plate to the oxygen cylinder in back .  he twisted strenuously at the bolt that held the air tube tightly fixed to the cylinder .   it gave .  he paused to fill his helmet and suit with oxygen .  ordinarily oxygen leaked slowly in from the cylinders at about the rate it was used up by human lungs .  the carbon dioxide and water formed as the result of respiration were mostly absorbed by the chemicals contained in the valved canisters affixed to the inner surface of the suit s chest plates .  the result was that oxygen was kept at a pressure one fifth that of earth s atmosphere .  this was exactly right  since four fifths of earth s atmosphere is nitrogen anyway  which is useless for breathing .       lucky starr  however  this left room for higher concentrations  up to somewhat more than normal atmospheric pressure  before there was danger of toxic effects .  lucky let the oxygen pour into his suit .   then  having done so  he closed the valve under his face plate entirely and removed the cylinder .   the cylinder was itself a sort of push gun .  it was an unusual push gun  to be sure .  for a person marooned in space to use the precious oxygen that stood between himself and death as motive power  to blow it into space  meant desperation .  or else  a firm resolution .   lucky cracked the reducing valve and let a blast of oxygen issue out .  there was no line of crystals this time .  oxygen  unlike carbon dioxide  froze at very low temperatures indeed and before it could lose sufficient heat to freeze  it had diffused out into space .  gas or solid  however  newton s third law of motion still held .  as the gas pushed out one way  lucky was pushed in the opposite direction by a natural counterpush .   his spinning slowed .  carefully he allowed the asteroid to come into full view before stopping the spin completely .   he was still receding from the rock .  it was no longer particularly brighter than the neighboring stars .  conceivably he had already mistaken his target  but he closed his mind against that uncertainty .   he fixed his eyes firmly on the spot of light he assumed to be the asteroid and let the cylinder blast in the opposite direction .  he wondered if he would have enough to reverse the direction of his travel .  there was no way of telling at the moment .   ship versus ship      in any case  he would have to save some gas .  he would need it to maneuver about the asteroid  get on its night side  find bigman and the ship  unless  .   .   .   unless the ship had already been driven away  or destroyed  by the pirates .   it seemed to lucky that the vibration of his hands  due to the escaping oxygen  was lessening .  either the cylinder was running low  or its temperature was dropping .  he was holding it away from his suit so it was no longer absorbing heat from it .  it was from the suit that oxygen cylinders gained enough heat to be breathable  and the carbon dioxide cylinders of the push guns gained enough heat to keep their contents gaseous .  in the vacuum of space heat could be lost only by radiation  a slow process  but  even so  the oxygen cylinder had had time to drop in temperature .   he encircled the cylinder in his arms  hugged it to his chest  and waited .   it seemed hours  but only fifteen minutes passed before it seemed to him that the asteroid was growing brighter .  was he approaching the rock again .  or was it imagination .  another fifteen minutes passed and it was distinctly brighter .  lucky felt a deep gratitude to the chance that had shot him out on the sunlit side of the rock so that he could see it plainly as a target .   it was getting harder to breathe .  there was no question of carbon dioxide asphyxiation .  that gas was removed as it was formed .  still  each breath also removed a small fraction of his precious oxygen .  he tried to breathe shallowly  close his eyes  rest .  after all  he could do nothing more until he had reached and passed the      lucky starr  asteroid .  there on the night side  bigman might still be waiting .   then  if he could get close enough to bigman  if he could call him on his limping radio before he passed out  there might yet be a chance .          the hours had passed slowly and torturously for bigman .  he longed to descend  but dared not .  he reasoned with himself that  if the enemy existed  he would have shown himself by now .  then he argued it out bitterly and came to the conclusion that the very silence and motionlessness of space meant a trap  and that lucky was caught .   he put lucky s personal capsule before him and wondered about its contents .  if only there were some way of bursting it  of reading the thin roll of microfilm within .  if he could do that  he could radio it to ceres  get it off his hands  and be free to go slamming down to the rock .  he would blast them all  drag lucky out of whatever mess he was in .   no .  in the first place he dared not use the sub etherics .  true  the pirates could not break the code  but they would detect the carrier wave and he had been instructed not to give away the location of the ship .   besides  what was the use of thinking of breaking into a personal capsule .  a solar furnace could melt and destroy it  an atom blast could disintegrate it  but nothing could open it and leave its message intact except the living touch of the person for which it had been  personalized .   that was that .   more than half of the twelve hour period had passed  ship versus ship      when the gravities gave their entirely distinctive warning .   bigman roused himself out of his frustrated reverie and stared with shocked surprise at the ergometer .  the pulsations of several ships were blending themselves into complicated curves that melted snakelike from one configuration to another .   the shooting starr s shield  which had been glimmering routinely at a strength sufficient to ward off casual  debris   the usual space term for wandering meteorites an inch or less in diameter  stiffened to maximum .  bigman heard the soft purr of the power output grow strident .  one by one  he let the short range visiplates glow into life  bank on bank of them .   his mind churned .  the ships were rising from the asteroid  since none could be detected further away .  lucky must be caught  then  dead  probably .  he didn t care now how many ships came at him .  he would get them all  every single one of them .   he sobered .  the first sun glint had caught in one of the visiplates .  he maneuvered the cross hairs and centered them .  he then depressed something that looked like a piano key and  caught in an invisible burst of energy  the pirate ship glowed .   the glow was not due to any action upon its hull  but was rather the result of the energy absorption of the enemy screen .  it glowed brightly and more brightly still .  then it dimmed as the enemy turned tail and put distance between them .   a second ship and a third were in view .  a projectile was making its way toward the shooting starr .  in the      lucky starr  vacuum of space there was no flash  no sound  but the sun caught it and it was a little sparking spot of light .  it became a little circle in the visiplate  then a larger one  until finally it moved out of the plate s field .   bigman might have dodged  flashed the shooter out of the way  but he thought  let it hit .  he wanted them to see what they were playing with .  the shooter might look like a rich man s toy  but they weren t going to put it out of action with a few slingshooters .   the projectile struck and slogged to a halt against the shooting starr s hysteretic shields  which  bigman knew  must have flashed momentarily into brilliance .  the ship itself moved smoothly  absorbing the momentum that had leaked past the shield .    let s return that   bigman muttered .  the shooting starr carried no projectiles  explosive or otherwise  but its store of energy projectors was varied and powerful .   his hand was hovering over the blaster controls when he saw in one of the visiplates something that brought a scowl to his small  determined face  something that looked like a man in a space suit .   it was strange that the space ship was more vulnerable to a man in a space suit than to the best weapons of another ship .  an enemy ship could be easily detected by gravities at a distance of miles and by ergometers at a distance of thousands of miles .  a single man in a space suit could only be detected by a gravitic at a hundred yards and by an ergometer not at all .   again  a hysteretic shield worked the more effectively the greater the velocity of the projectile .  huge lumps of metal tearing at miles per second could be stopped cold .   ship versus ship      one man  however  drifting along at ten miles an hour was not even aware of the existence of the shield except for a tiny warming of his suit .   let a dozen men creep toward a ship at once and only great skill could bring them all down .  if two or three penetrated and succeeded in blasting open the air lock with hand weapons  the ship they attacked was seriously crippled .   and now bigman caught the little speck that could only mean the advance guard of such a suicide squadron .  he brought one of the secondaries to bear .  the single figure was centered and bigman was ready to fire when his radio receiver sounded .   for a moment he was startled .  the pirates had attacked without warning and had not tried to communicate  to call for surrender  to offer terms  anything .  what now .   he hesitated and the sounding became a word  repeated twice   bigman  .   .   .  bigman  .   .   .  bigman  .   .   .    bigman jumped from his seat  ignoring the suited man  the battle  everything .   lucky .  is that you .     i m near the ship  .   .   .  space suit  .   .   .  air  .   .   .  nearly gone .     great galaxy .   bigman  white faced  maneuvered the shooting starr nearer the figure in space  the figure whom he had nearly destroyed .          bigman watched over lucky  who  helmet off  was still gulping air .   you d better get some rest  lucky .     later   said lucky .  he climbed out of his suit .   have they attacked yet .        lucky starr  bigman nodded .   it doesn t matter .  they re just breaking their teeth on the old shooter .     they ve got stronger teeth than any they ve shown   said lucky .   we ve got to get away and fast .  they ll be bringing out their heavy craft  and even our energy stores won t last forever .     where are they going to get heavy craft from .     that s a major pirate base down there .  the major base  perhaps .     you mean it isn t the hermit s rock .     i mean we ve got to get away .    he took the controls  face still pale from his ordeal .  for the first time the rock below them moved from its position on the screens .  even during the attack bigman had heeded lucky s parting order to stay put for twelve hours .   the rock grew larger .   bigman protested .   if we ve got to get away  why are we landing .     we re not landing .   lucky watched the screen intently  while one hand set the controls of the ship s heavy blaster .  deliberately he widened and softened the focus of the blaster till it could cover a broad area indeed  but at an energy intensity reduced to little more than that of an ordinary heat ray .   he waited  for reasons that the wondering bigman could not divine  and then fired .  there was a startling blazing brightness on the asteroid s surface which subsided almost instantly into a glowing redness that in a further minute or so blackened out .   ship versus ship       now let s go   said lucky  and  as new ships spiraled up from the pirate base  acceleration took hold .   half an hour later  with asteroid gone and any pursuing ships safely lost  he said   get ceres .  i want to speak to conway .     okay  lucky .  and listen  i ve got the co ordinates of that asteroid .  shall i send them along .  we can send a fleet back and     it won t do any good   said lucky   and it isn t necessary .    bigman s eyes widened .   you don t mean you destroyed the rock with that blaster bolt .     of course not .  i hardly touched it   said lucky .   have you got ceres .     i m having trouble   said bigman pettishly .  he knew lucky was in one of his tight mouthed moods and would  give no information .   wait  here it is  but  hey    they re  broadcasting a general alarm .    there was no need to explain that .  the call was strident and uncoded .   general call to all fleet units outside mars .  ceres under attack by enemy force  presumed pirates .   .   .   .  general call to all fleet units  .   .   .    bigman said   great galaxy .    lucky said tightly   they stay one step ahead of us  no matter what we do .  we ve got to get back .  quickly .    chapter     raid .   the ships came swarming out of space in perfect coordination .  an entire wing struck directly at the observatory .  in response to this  almost inevitably  the defending forces on ceres concentrated their power at that point .   the attack was not pressed full force .  ship after ship dived downward to launch energy beams at an obviously impregnable shield .  none took the risky step of trying to blast the underground power plants  the location of which they must have known .  government ships took to space and ground batteries opened up .  in the end two pirate ships were destroyed when their shields broke down and they flared into glowing vapor .  another one  its energy reserves down to a trickle  was almost captured in the eventual pursuit .  it was blown up at the last moment  probably by its own crew .   even during the attack some of the defenders suspected it to be a feint .  later  of course  they knew that for a fact .  while the observatory was engaged  three ships landed on the asteroid a hundred miles away .  pirates disembarked and with hand weapons and portable blasting cannon attacked the residential air locks from flitting  space sleds .    the locks were blasted open and space suited pirates      lucky starr  swarmed down the corridors from which air emptied .  the upper reaches of the corridors were factories and offices  the occupants of which had evacuated at the first alarm .  their place was taken by space suited members of the local militia who fought bravely  but were no match for the professionals of the pirate fleet .   in the lower depths  in the peaceful apartments of ceres  the noise of blasting battle sounded .  calls for help were sent out .  then  almost as suddenly as they came  the pirates retreated .   when they left  the men of ceres counted their casualties .  fifteen cereans were dead and many more hurt in one way or another  as against the bodies of five pirates .  damage to property was very high .    and one man   conway explained furiously to lucky when the latter arrived   is missing .  only he s not on the list of inhabitants and we ve been able to keep his name out of the news reports .           lucky found ceres the focus of almost hysterical excitement now that the raid was over .  it had been the first attack on an important terrestrial center by any enemy in a generation .  he had had to pass three inspections before being allowed to land .   he sat in the council office with conway and henree and said bitterly   so hansen is gone .  that s what it boils down to .     i ll say this for the old hermit   said henree .   he had guts .  when the pirates penetrated  he insisted on getting into a suit  grabbing up a blaster  and going up there with the militia .    raid .        we weren t short on militia   said lucky .   if he had stayed down here  he would have done us a much greater service .  how is it you didn t stop him .  under the circumstances was he a person to be allowed to do such a thing .   lucky starr s usually even voice contained a repressed anger .   conway said patiently   we weren t with him .  the guard we left in charge had to report for militia duty .  hansen insisted on joining him and the guard decided he could do both duties at once that way  fight the pirates and guard the hermit .     but he didn t guard the hermit .     under the circumstances he can scarcely be blamed .  the guard saw hansen last charging a pirate .  next thing he knew there was no one in sight and the pirates were retreating .  hansen s body hasn t been recovered .  the pirates must have him alive or dead .     so they must   said lucky .   now let me tell you something .  let me tell you exactly what a bad mistake this was .  i m certain that the whole attack on ceres was arranged simply to capture hansen .    henree reached for his pipe .   you know  hector   he said to conway   i m almost tempted to go along with lucky on that .  the attack on the observatory was a miserable one  an obvious false alarm to draw off our defenses .  getting hansen was the only thing they did accomplish .    conway snorted .   one possible information leak like the hermit isn t worth risking thirty ships .     that s the whole point   said lucky vehemently .   right now  it may be .  i told you about the asteroid i      lucky starr  was on  the kind of industrial plant it must have been .  suppose they re almost at the point where they re ready to make the big push .  suppose hansen knows the exact date for when the push is scheduled .  suppose he knows the exact method .     then why hasn t he told us .   demanded conway .    maybe   said henree   he s waiting to use it as material with which to buy his own immunity .  we never did have a chance really to discuss that question with him .  you ve got to admit  hector  that if he had that kind of key information  any number of ships would have been worth the risk .  and you ve got to admit lucky is probably right about their being ready for the big push .    lucky looked sharply from one to the other .   why do you say that  uncle gus .  what s happened .     tell him  hector   said henree .    why tell him anything   growled conway .   i m tired of his one man trips .  he ll be wanting to go to ganymede .     what s on ganymede .   asked lucky coldly .  as far as he knew  there was little or nothing on ganymede to interest anyone .  it was jupiter s largest moon  but the very nearness of jupiter made it difficult to maneuver space ships  so that space travel in its vicinity was unprofitable .    tell him   said henree .    look   said conway .   here it is .  we knew hansen was important .  the reason we didn t have him under tighter observation  the reason gus and i weren t there ourselves  was that two hours before the pirate attack a  raid .       report came in from the council to the effect that there was evidence that sirian forces had landed on ganymede .     what kind of evidence .     tight beam sub etheric signals had been penetrated .  it s a long story  but the nub of it was that  more by accident than by anything else  a few scraps of code were picked up .  the experts say it s a sirian code and certainly there isn t anything terrestrial on ganymede that s capable of putting out signals in a beam tliat tight .  gus and i were going to take hansen and return to earth when the pirates attacked  and that s it .  right now we ve still got to return to earth .  with sirius on the scene there may be war at any time .    lucky said   i see .  well  before we go to earth  there s one thing i would like to check on .  do we have motion pictures of the pirate attack .  i m supposing the defenses of ceres weren t so disorganized that pictures weren t taken .     they ve been taken .  how do you expect them to help .     i ll tell you after i ve seen them .           men in the uniform of the fleet  and wearing high rank insignia  projected the top secret motion pictures of what later became known in history as the  ceres raid .     twenty seven ships attacked the observatory .  is that right .   asked lucky    right   said a commander .   no more than that .     good .  now let s see if i have the rest of the facts straight .  two of the ships were accounted for during the      lucky starr  fight and a third during the pursuit .  the remaining twenty four got away  but you have one or more shots of each of them in retreat .    the commander smiled .   if you re implying that any of them landed on ceres and are still hidden here  you re quite wrong .     as far as those twenty seven ships are concerned  perhaps .  but three more ships did land on ceres and their crew attacked the massey air lock .  where are the pictures of those .     unfortunately we didn t get many of those   admitted the commander uncomfortably .   it was a case of complete surprise .  but we have pictures of them in retreat  too  and we showed you those .     yes  you did  and there were only two ships in those pictures .  eyewitnesses reported three as having landed .    the commander said stiffly   and three took off and retreated .  there s eyewitness evidence of that also .     but you have pictures of only two .     well  .   .   .  yes .     thank you .           back in the office conway said   now what was that all about  lucky .     i thought captain anton s ship might be in an interesting place .  the motion pictures proved it was .     where was it .     nowhere .  that was what was interesting .  his ship is the one pirate ship i would recognize  yet no ship faintly similar took part in the raid .  this is strange because anton must be one of their very best men or they  raid .       wouldn t have sent him out after the atlas .  or it would be strange if the truth wasn t that thirty ships attacked ceres and we had pictures of only twenty nine .  the missing thirtieth was anton .     i could figure that out too   said conway .   what of it .    lucky said   the attack on the observatory was a feint .  that s admitted even by the defending ships  now .  it was the three ships that attacked the air lock that were important and they were under anton s command .  two of those ships joined the rest of the squadron in their retreat  a feint within a feint .  the third ship  anton s own  the only one we didn t see  continued on with the main business of the day .  it left on an entirely different trajectory .  people saw it lift into space but it veered off so radically that our own ships  chasing the main body of enemy with all its might  never even caught it on film .    conway said unhappily   you re going to say that it s going to ganymede .     doesn t it follow .  the pirates  however well organized  can t attack earth and its dependencies on their own .  but they can put up an excellent diversionary fight .  they can keep enough terrestrial ships patrolling the endless asteroid belt to allow sirian fleets to defeat the remainder .  on the other hand  sirius can t safely conduct a war eight light years away from their own planet unless they can count on major help from the asteroids .  after all  eight light years amounts to forty five trillion miles .  anton s ship is speeding to ganymede to assure them of that help and to give the word to begin the war .  without warning  of course .        lucky starr   if only   muttered conway   we could have stumbled on their ganymede base sooner .     even with the knowledge of ganymede   said henree   we would not have known the seriousness of the situation without lucky s two trips into asteroid territory .     i know .  my apologies  lucky .  meanwhile we have very little time to do anything .  we ll have to strike at the heart instantly .  a squadron of ships sent to the key asteroid lucky has told us of     no   said lucky .   no good .     why do you say that .     we don t want to start a war  even if it s with a victory .  that s what they want to do .  look here  uncle hector  the pirate  dingo  might have burned me down right there on the asteroid .  instead  he had orders to set me adrift in space .  for a while i thought that was to make my death look like an accident .  now i feel it was intended to anger the council .  they were going to broadcast the fact they had killed a councilman  not hide it  goading us into a premature attack .  one of the reasons for the ceres raid might have been to insure an added provocation .     and if we do start the war with a victory .     here on this side of the sun .  and leave earth on the other side stripped of important units of the fleet .  with sirian ships waiting at ganymede  also on the other side of the sun .  i predict that it would be a very costly victory .  our best bet is not to start a war  but to prevent one .     how .     nothing will happen until anton s ship reaches gany   raid .       mede .  suppose we intercept him and prevent the meeting     interception is a long chance   said conway doubtfully .    not if z go .  the shooting starr is faster and has better ergometrics than any ship in the fleet .     you go .   cried conway .    it would be unsafe to send fleet units .  the sirians on ganymede would have no way of being certain an attack wasn t heading their way .  they d have to take counteraction and that would mean the very war we re trying to avoid .  the shooting starr would look harmless to them .  it would be one ship .  they d stay put .    henree said   you re overeager  lucky .  anton has a twelve hour head start .  even the shooting starr can t make that up .     you re wrong .  it can .  and once i catch them  uncle gus  i think i can force the asteroids into surrender .  without them sirius won t attack and there ll be no war .    they stared at him .   lucky said earnestly   i ve come back twice now .     each time by half a miracle   grumbled conway .    the other times i didn t know what i was tackling .  i had to feel my way .  this time i do know .  i know exactly .  look  i ll warm up the shooting starr and make the necessary arrangements with the ceres observatory while that s taking place .  you two can get on the sub ether to earth .  get the co ordinator to    conway said   i can take care of that  son .  i ve been dealing with government affairs before you were born .  and lucky  will you take care of yourself .        lucky starr   don t i always  uncle hector .  uncle gus .   he shook hands warmly and whirled away .          bigman scuffed the dust of ceres disconsolately .  he said   i ve got my suit on .  everything .     you can t go  bigman   said lucky .   i m sorry .     why not .     because i m taking a short cut to get to ganymede .     so what .  what kind of a short cut .    lucky smiled tightly .   i m cutting through the sun .    he walked out on to the field toward the shooting starr  leaving bigman standing there  mouth open .   chapter     to ganymede via the sun  a three dimensional map of the solar system would have the appearance of a rather flat plate .  in the center would be the sun  the dominant member of the system .  it is really dominant  since it contains    .    of all the matter in the solar system .  in other words  it weighs five hundred times as much as everything else in the solar system put together .   around the sun circle the planets .  all of them revolve in nearly the same plane  and this plane is called the ecliptic .   in traveling from planet to planet space ships usually follow the ecliptic .  in doing so they are within the main sub etheric beams of planetary communication and can most conveniently make intermediate stops on the way to their destination .  sometimes  when a ship is interested in speed or in escaping detection  it veers away from the ecliptic  particularly when it must travel to the other side of the sun .   this  lucky thought  might be what anton s ship was intending to do .  it would lift up from the  plate  that was the solar system  make a huge arc or bridge above the sun  and come down to the  plate  on the other side  in the neighborhood of ganymede .  certainly anton must have started in that direction  or the defending forces on      lucky starr  ceres wouldn t have missed filming him .  it was almost second nature for men to make all spationautical observations along the ecliptic first of all .  by the time they thought of turning away from the ecliptic  anton would have been too far away for observation .   but  thought lucky  the chances were that anton would not leave the ecliptic permanently .  he might have started out as though that would be the case  but he would return .  the advantages in a return would be many .  the asteroid belt extended completely about the sun  in the sense that asteroids were evenly distributed all the way around .  by keeping within the belt anton could remain among the asteroids all the way to within a hundred million miles or so of ganymede .  this would mean security for him .  the terrestrial government had virtually abdicated its power over the asteroids and  except for the routes to the four large rocks  government ships did not penetrate the area .  moreover  if one did  anton would always be in the position of being able to call for reinforcements from some nearby asteroidal base .   yes  thought lucky  anton would remain in the belt .  partly because he thought this  and partly because he had his own plans  lucky lifted the shooting starr out of the ecliptic in a shallow arc .   the sun was the key .  it was the key to the entire system .  it was a roadblock and a detour to every ship man could build .  to travel from one side of the system to another  a ship had to make a wide curve to avoid the sun .  no passenger ship approached closer than sixty million miles  the distance of venus from the sun .  even  to ganymede via the sun      there  cooling systems were imperative for the comfort of the passengers .   technical ships could be designed to make the trip to mercury  the distance of which from the sun varied from forty three million miles in some parts of its orbit to twenty eight million in others .  ships had to hit it at the furthest region of its retirement from the sun .  at closer than thirty million miles various metals melted .   still more specialized ships were sometimes built for close by solar observation .  their hulls were permeated by a strong electric field of peculiar nature which induced a phenomenon known as  pseudo liquefaction  in the outermost molecular skin .  heat reflection from such a skin was almost total  so that only a tiny fraction penetrated into the ship .  from outside such ships would appear perfect mirrors .  even so  enough heat penetrated to raise the temperature within the ship above the boiling point of water at distances of five million miles from the sun  the closest recorded approach .  even if human beings could survive such a temperature  they couldn t survive the short wave radiation that flooded out of the sun and into the ship at such distances .  it could kill anything living in seconds .   the disadvantage of the sun s position with respect to space travel was obvious in the present instance  in which ceres was on one side of the sun while earth and jupiter were almost diametrically opposed on the other side .  if one was in the asteroid belt  the distance from ceres to ganymede was about one billion miles .  if the sun could be ignored and a ship could cut straight across space through it  the distance would be only six      lucky starr  hundred million miles  a saving of about forty per cent .   this  as far as was possible  lucky intended to do .   he drove the shooting starr hard  virtually living in his g harness  eating and sleeping there  feeling the pressure of acceleration continuously .  he gave himself only fifteen minutes respite out of each hour .   he passed high above the orbits of mars and earth  but there was nothing to see there  not even with the ship s telescope .  earth was on the other side of the sun  and mars was at a position nearly at right angles to his own .   already the sun was at its normal size as seen from earth and he could view it only through the most strongly polarized visiplates .  a little more and he would have to use the stroboscopic attachments .   the radioactivity indicators began to chuckle occasionally .  within earth s orbit the density of short wave radiation started to reach respectable values .  inside venus s orbit special precautions would have to be taken  such as the wearing of lead impregnated semi space suits .   i  myself  thought lucky  would have to do better than lead .  at the approach to the sun that he would have to make  lead would not do .  nothing material would do .   for the first time since his adventure on mars the previous year lucky drew out of a special pouch glued to his waist  the flimsy  semitransparent object obtained from the martian energy beings .   he had long since abandoned any effort at speculation as to the method by which the object worked .  it was the development of a science that had continued for a mil   to ganymede via the sun      lion years longer than the science known to mankind and along alien paths .  it was as incomprehensible to him as a space ship would be to a cave man  and as impossible to duplicate .  but it worked .  that was what counted .   he slipped it on over his head .  it molded itself to his skull as though it carried a strange life of its own  and as it did so  light gleamed out all over him .  over his body it was a glimmer like a billion fireflies  and it was for that reason that bigman referred to it as a  glimmer shield .   over his face and head it was a solid sheet of brilliance that covered his features entirely  without  on the other hand  preventing light from reaching his eyes .   it was an energy shield  designed by the alien martians for lucky s needs .  that is  it was impervious to all forms of energy other than that required by his body  such as a certain intensity of visible light and a certain amount of heat .  gases penetrated freely  so that lucky could breathe  and heated gases  in passing  were robbed of their heat and came through cool .   when the shooting starr passed the orbit of venus  still heading in toward the sun  lucky put on his energy shield permanently .  while he wore it  he would not be able to eat or drink  but the enforced fast would not last for more than a day  at the outside .   he was now traveling at a terrific speed  far greater than any he had previously experienced .  in addition to the slugging pull of the hyperatomics of the shooting starr  there was the unimaginable attraction of the sun s giant gravitational field .  he was traveling at millions of miles an hour now .   he activated the electric field that rendered the outer      lucky starr  skin of the ship pseudo liquid and was grateful  as he did so  for the foresight that had made him insist on that accessory during the building of the shooting starr .  the thermocouple which had been registering temperatures above one hundred degrees began to show a drop .  the visiplates went dark as metal shields passed over the thick glassite to keep them from damage and from softening in the heat of the sun .   by the time mercury s orbit was reached the radiation counters had gone completely mad .  their chatter was continuous .  lucky placed a glimmering hand over their windows and their noise stopped .  down to the hardest gamma rays the radiation penetrating and filling the ship was stopped by the resistance of the insubstantial aura that surrounded his body .   the temperature which had reached a low of eighty  was climbing again  despite the mirror skin of the shooting starr .  it passed one hundred fifty and still went up .  the gravimetrics indicated the sun to be only ten million miles away .   a shallow dish of water  which lucky had placed upon the table  and which had been steaming for an hour past  was now bubbling outright .  the thermocouple reached the boiling point of water  two hundred and twelve degrees .   the shooting starr  whipping about the sun  was now five million miles away .  it would approach no closer .  actually it was inside the outermost wisps of the most rarefied portion of the sun s atmosphere  its corona .  since the sun was gaseous through and through  though most of it was a gas the like of which could not exist even un   to ganymede via the sun      der the most extreme laboratory conditions on earth   it had no surface  and its  atmosphere  was part of the very body of the sun .  by going through the corona  then  lucky was  in a way  going through the sun  as he had told bigman he would .   curiosity tugged at him .  no man had ever been this close to the sun .  no man  perhaps  ever would again .  certainly  any man who did  could not look at the sun with his unaided eyes .  the shortest possible glimpse of the sun s tremendous radiation at that distance would mean instant death .   but he was wearing the martian energy shield .  could it handle solar radiation at five million miles .  he felt he ought not take the chance and yet the impulse tugged desperately at him .  the ship s chief visiplate was outfitted with a stroboscopic outlet series  one which would expose  one by one  each of a series of sixty four outlets to the sun  each for a millionth of a second every four seconds .  to the eye  or to the camera   it would seem a continuous exposure  but actually any given piece of glass would only get one four millionth of the radiation the sun was emitting .  even that required specially designed  nearly opaque lenses .   lucky s fingers moved remorselessly  almost without conscious volition  to the controls .  he could not bear the thought of losing the chance .  he adjusted the plate direction toward the sun  using the gravimetrics as indicators .   then he turned his head away and plunged the contact home .  a second passed  then two seconds .  he imagined an increase in heat on the back of his neck  he half waited for radiation death .  nothing happened .       lucky starr  slowly he turned .   what he saw was to stay with him the rest of his life .  a bright surface  puckered and wrinkled  filled the visi plate .  it was a portion of the sun .  he could not see the whole  he knew  in the visiplate  for at his distance  the sun was twenty times as wide as it seemed from earth and covered four hundred times as much of the sky .   caught in the visiplate were a pair of sunspots  black against the brightness .  threads of glowing white curled into it and were lost .  they were heaving areas of activity that moved across the plate visibly as he watched .  this was not due to the sun s own motion of rotation  which  even at its equator  was not more than fourteen hundred miles an hour  but rather to the tremendous velocity of the shooting starr .   as he watched  gouts of red  naming gas shot up toward him  dim against the blazing background  and turning a smoky black as it receded from the sun and cooled .   lucky shifted the plate  catching a portion of the rim of the sun  and now the flaming gas  which were the so called  prominences   consisting of gigantic puffs of hydrogen gas  stood out sharply crimson against the black of the sky .  they spread outward in slow motion  thinning and taking on fantastic shapes .  lucky knew that each one of them could engulf a dozen planets the size of earth  and that the earth could be dropped into the sunspot he saw without even making a respectable splash .   he closed the stroboscopics with a sudden movement .  even though physically safe  no man could stare at the  to ganymede via the sun      sun from that distance without becoming oppressed by the insignificance of earth and all things earthly .          the shooting starr had whipped half around the sun and was now receding rapidly past the orbits of mercury and venus .  it was decelerating now .  the ship s prow opposed the direction of its flight and its powerful main engines were acting as brakes .   once past venus s orbit  lucky removed his shield and stowed it away .  the ship s cooling system strained to get rid of the excess heat .  drinking water was still uncomfortably hot and the canned foods bulged where liquid within had bubbled into gas .   the sun was shrinking .  lucky looked at it .  it was an even  glowing sphere .  its irregularities  its churning spots  and heaving prominences could no longer be seen .  only its corona  always visible in space  though visible on earth only during eclipses  thrust out in every direction for millions of miles .  lucky shuddered involuntarily to think that he had passed through it .   he passed within fifteen million miles of earth  and through his telescope he spied the familiar outlines of the continents peeping through the ragged white masses of cloud banks .  he felt a twinge of homesickness and then a new resolve to keep war away from the teeming  busy billions of human beings that inhabited that planet  which was the origin of all the men that now occupied the far flung star systems of the galaxy .   then the earth  too  receded .   past mars and back into the asteroid belt  lucky still aimed at the jovian system  that miniature solar system      lucky starr  within the greater one .  at its center was jupiter  larger than all the other planets combined .  about it swung four giant moons  three of them  lo  europa  and callisto  about the size of the earth s moon  and the fourth  ganymede  much larger .  ganymede  in fact  was larger than mercury  and almost as large as mars .  in addition there were dozens of moonlets  ranging from some hundreds of miles in diameter down to insignificant rocks .   in the ship s telescope jupiter was a growing yellow globe  marked with faintly orange stripes  one of which bellied out into what was once known as the  great red spot .   three of the main moons  including ganymede  were on one side  the fourth was on the other .   lucky had been in guarded communication with the council s main offices on the moon for the better part of a day now .  his ergometrics probed space with widely stretching fingers .  it detected many ships  but lucky watched only for the one with the sirian motor pattern which he would recognize with certainty the instant it appeared .   nor did he fail .  at a distance of twenty million miles  the first quiverings roused his suspicions .  he veered in the proper direction  and the characteristic curves grew more pronounced .   at one hundred thousand miles  his telescope showed it as a faint dot .  at ten thousand  it had form and shape and was anton s ship .   at a thousand miles  with ganymede still fifty million miles away from both ships   lucky sent out his first message  a demand that anton turn his ship back toward earth .   to ganymede via the sun      at one hundred miles lucky received his answer a blast of energy that made his generators whine and shook the shooting starr as though it had collided with another ship .   lucky s tired face took on a drawn look .   anton s ship was better armed than he had expected .   chapter     part of the answer  for an hour the maneuvers of both ships were indecisive .  lucky had the faster ship and the better  but captain anton had a crew .  each of anton s men could specialize .  one could focus and one could release  while a third could control the reactor banks and anton himseh  could direct operations .   lucky  trying to do everything at once and by himseh   had to rely heavily on words .    you can t get to ganymede  anton  and your friends won t dare tip their hand by coming out now before they know what s up .   .   .   .  you re all through  anton  we know all your plans .   .   .   .  there s no use trying to get a message through to ganymede  anton  we re blanketing the sub ether from you to jupiter .  nothing can get through .   .   .   .  government ships are coming  anton .  count your minutes .  you don t have many  unless you surrender .   .   .   .  give up  anton .  give up .    and all this while the shooting starr dodged through as concentrated a fire as lucky had ever seen .  nor were all the blasts successfully dodged .  the shooter s energy stores began to show the strain .  lucky would have liked to believe that anton s ship was suffering equally  but he himseh  was aiming few blasts at anton and landing virtually none .       lucky starr  he dared not take his eyes off the screen .  terrestrial ships  speeding to the scene  would not be there for hours .  in those hours  if anton beat down his energy banks  broke away  and made good head toward ganymede  while a limping shooting starr could only pursue  without catching  .  .  .  or if a pirate fleet suddenly sparkled on screen  .   .   .   lucky dared not follow those lines of thought further .  perhaps he had been wrong in not entrusting the interception to government ships in the first place .  no  he told himself  only the shooting starr could have caught anton still fifty million miles from ganymede  only the shooter s speed  more important still  only the shooter s er gometers .  at this distance from ganymede it was safe to call in units of the fleet for the kill .  closer to ganymede and fleet action would have been unsafe .   lucky s receiver  open all this time  was suddenly activated .  anton s face filled it  smiling and carefree .    you got away from dingo again  i see .    lucky said   again .  you re admitting he was working under orders in the push duel .    an energy feeler toward lucky s ship suddenly hardened into a beam of disruptive force .  lucky moved aside with an acceleration that wrenched him .   anton laughed .   don t watch me too closely .  we almost caught you then with a lulu .  certainly dingo was working under orders .  we knew what we were doing .  dingo didn t know who you really were  but i did .  nearly from the first .     too bad the knowledge didn t help you   said lucky .    it s dingo that it hasn t helped .  it may amuse you to  part of the answer      know that he has been  shall we say  executed .  it s bad to make mistakes .  but this kind of talk is out of place here .  i m only plating you to say that this has been fun  but i ll be going now .     you have nowhere to go   said lucky .    i ll try ganymede .     you ll be stopped .     by government ships .  i don t see them yet .  and there s not one that can catch me in time .     i can catch you .     you have caught me .  but what can you do with me .  from the way you re fighting  you must be the only man on board .  if i had known that from the beginning  i wouldn t have bothered with you as long as this .  you can t fight a whole crew .    lucky said in a low  intense voice   i can ram you .  i can smash you completely .     and yourself .  remember that .     that wouldn t matter .     please .  you sound like a space scout .  you ll be reciting the junior scout patrol oath next .    lucky raised his voice .   you men aboard the ship  listen .  if your captain tries to break away in the direction of ganymede  i will ram the ship .  it is certain death for all of you  unless you surrender .  i promise you all a fair trial .  i promise all of you the utmost consideration possible if you co operate with us .  don t let anton throw your lives away for the sake of his sirian friends .     talk on  government boy  talk on   said anton .   i m letting them listen .  they know what kind of a trial they can expect and they know what kind of consideration       lucky starr  too .  an injection of enzymic poison .   his fingers made the quick movements of someone inserting a needle into another s skin .   that s what they ll get .  they re not afraid of you .  good by  government boy .    the needles on lucky s gravimetrics wavered downward as anton s ship picked up speed and moved away .  lucky watched his visiplates .  where were the government ships .  blast all space  where were the government ships .   he let acceleration take hold .  gravimetric needles moved upward again .   the miles between the ships were sliced away .  anton s ship put on more speed  so did the shooting starr .  but the accelerative possibilities of the shooter were higher .   the smile on anton s face did not alter .   fifty miles away   he said .  then   forty five .   another pause .   forty .  have you said your prayers  government boy .    lucky did not answer .  for him there was no way out .  he would have to ram .  sooner than let anton get through  sooner than allow war to come to earth  he would have to stop the pirates by suicide  if there were no other way .  the ships were curving toward one another in a long  slow tangent .    thirty   said anton lazily .   you re not frightening anyone .  you ll look a fool in the end .  veer off and go home  starr .     twenty five   retorted lucky firmly .   you have fifteen minutes to surrender or die .   he himself  he reflected  had the same fifteen minutes to win or die .   a face appeared behind anton s in the visiplate .  it held a finger to pale  tight lips .  lucky s eyes might have flick   part of the answer       ered .  he tried to conceal that by looking away  then coming back .   both ships were at maximum acceleration .    what s the matter  starr .   asked anton .   scared .  heart beating fast .   his eyes were dancing and his lips were parted .   lucky had the sudden  sure knowledge that anton was enjoying this  that he considered it an exciting game  that it was only a device whereby he might demonstrate his power .  lucky knew at that moment that anton would never surrender  that he would allow himself to be rammed rather than back away .  and lucky knew that there was no escape from death .    fifteen miles   lucky said .   it was hansen s face behind anton .  the hermit s .  and there was something in his hand .    ten miles   said lucky .  then   six minutes .  i ll ram you .  by space  i ll ram you .    it was a blaster .  hansen held a blaster .   lucky s breath came tightly .  if anton turned  .   .   .   but anton was not going to miss a second of lucky s face if he could help it .  he was waiting to see the fright come and grow .  to lucky  that was plain as could be in the pirate s expression .  anton would not have turned for a much noisier event than the careful lifting of a blaster .   anton caught it in the back .  death came too suddenly for the eager smile to disappear from his face  and though life left it  the look of cruel joy did not .  anton fell forward across the visiplate and for a moment his face remained pressed there  larger than life size  leering at lucky out of dead eyes .       lucky starr  lucky heard hansen s shout   back  all of you .  do you want to die .  we re giving up .  come and get us  starr .    lucky veered the direction of acceleration by two degrees .  enough to miss .   his ergometers were registering the motors of approaching government ships strongly now .  they were coming at last .   the screens on anton s ship were glowing white as a sign of surrender .          it was almost an axiom that the fleet was never entirely pleased when the council of science interfered too much in what they considered to be the province of the military .  especially so when the interference was spectacularly successful .  lucky starr knew that well .  he was quite prepared for the admiral s poorly hidden disapproval .   the admiral said   dr .  conway has explained the situation adequately  starr  and we commend you for your actions .  however  you must realize that the fleet has been aware of the sirian danger for some time now and had a careful program of its own .  these independent actions on the part of the council can be harmful .  you might mention that to dr .  conway .  now i have been requested by the co ordinator to co operate with the council in the next stages of the fight against the pirates  but   he looked stubborn   i cannot agree to your suggestion that we delay an attack on ganymede .  i think the fleet is capable of making its own decisions where battle  and victory are concerned .    the admiral was in his fifties and unused to consulting  part of the answer      on equal terms with anyone  let alone a youngster of half his age .  his square cut face with its bristly gray mustache showed it .   lucky was tired .  the reaction  now that anton s ship had been taken in tow and its crew in custody  had set in .  he managed  however  to be very respectful .  he said   i think that if we mop up the asteroids first  the sirians on ganymede will automatically cease being a problem .     good galaxy  man  how do you mean  mop up .   we ve been trying to do that for twenty five years without success .  mopping up the asteroids is like chasing feathers .  as for the sirian base  we know where it is  and we have a good notion as to its strength .   he smiled briefly .   oh  it may be hard for the council to realize this  but the fleet is on its toes as well as they are .  perhaps even more so .  for instance  i know that the power at my command is enough to break their strength on ganymede .  we are ready for the battle .     i have no doubt that you are and that you can defeat the sirians .  but the ones on ganymede are not all the sirians there are .  you may be ready for a battle  but are you ready for a long and costly war .    the admiral reddened .   i have been asked to cooperate  but i cannot do so at the risk of earth s safety .  i can under no conditions lend my voice to a plan which involves dispersing our fleet among the asteroids  while a sirian expedition is in being in the solar system .     may i have an hour .   interrupted lucky .   one hour to speak with hansen  the cerean captive i had brought aboard this ship just before you boarded  sir .        lucky starr   how will that help .     may i have an hour to show you .    the admiral s lips pressed together .   an hour may be valuable .  it may be priceless .   .   .   .  well  begin  but quickly .  let s see how it goes .     hansen .   called lucky without taking his calm eyes from the admiral .   the hermit entered from the bunk room .  he looked tired  but managed a smile for lucky .  his stay on the pirate ship had apparently left his spirits unmarked .   he said   i ve been admiring your ship  mr .  starr .  it s quite a piece of metal .     look here   said the admiral   none of that .  get on with it  starr .  never mind your ship .    lucky said   this is the situation  mr .  hansen .  we ve stopped anton  with your invaluable help  for which i thank you .  that means we ve delayed the start of hostilities with sirius .  however  we need more than delay .  we must remove the danger completely  and as the admiral will tell you  our time is very short .     how can i help .   asked hansen .    by answering my questions .     gladly  but i ve told you all i know .  i m sorry that it turned out to be worth so little .     yet the pirates believed you to be a dangerous man .  they risked a great deal to get you out of our hands .     i can t explain that .     is it possible that you have a piece of knowledge without being aware of it .  something that could be deadly for them .     i don t see how .    part of the answer       well  they trusted you .  by the information you yourself gave me  you were rich  a man with good investments on earth .  certainly you were much better off than the average hermit .  yet the pirates treated you well .  or at least they didn t mistreat you .  they didn t rifle your belongings .  in fact  they left your very luxurious home completely in peace .     remember  mr .  starr  i helped them in return .     not very much .  you said that you allowed them to land on your rock  to leave people there sometimes and that s about all .  if they had simply shot you down  they could have had that and your quarters as well .  in addition  they would not have had to worry about your becoming an informer .  you eventually did become one  you know .    hansen s eyes shifted .   that s the way it was  though .  i told you the truth .     yes  what you told me was true .  it wasn t the whole truth  however .  i say that there must have been a good reason for the pirates to trust you so completely .  they must have known that it meant your life to go to the government .     i told you that   said hansen mildly .    you said that you had incriminated yourself by helping the pirates  but they trusted you when they first arrived  before you had begun helping them .  otherwise they would have blasted you to begin with .  now  let me guess .  i d say that once  before you became a hermit  you were a pirate yourself  hansen  and that anton and men like him knew about it .  what do you say .    hansen s face went white .       lucky starr  lucky said   what do you say  hansen .    hansen s voice was very soft .   you are right  mr .  starr .  i was once a member of the crew of a pirate ship .  that was a long time ago .  i have tried to live it down .  i retired to the asteroids and did my best to be dead as far as earth was concerned .  when a new group of pirates arose in the solar system and entangled me  i had no choice but to play along with them .    when you landed  i found my first chance to leave  my first chance to take the risk of facing the law .  twenty five years had passed  after all .  and i would have in my favor the fact that i had risked my life to save the life of a councilman .  that was why i was so anxious to fight the pirate raiders on ceres .  i wanted to make another point in my favor .  finally  i killed anton  saving your life a second time  and giving earth a breathing space  you tell me  in which a war may be prevented .  i was a pirate  mr .  starr  but that s gone  and i think i ve evened the score .     good   said lucky   as far as it goes .  now do you have any information for us that you didn t mention before .    hansen shook his head .   lucky said   you didn t tell us you were a pirate .     that was irrelevant  really .  and you found out for yourself .  i didn t try to deny it .     well  then let s see if we can find anything else which you won t deny .  you see  you still haven t told the whole truth .    hansen looked surprised .   what remains .     the fact that you ve never stopped being a pirate .   f  v  part of the answer      the fact that you are a person that was only mentioned  once in my hearing  and that by one of anton s crewmen    shortly after my push gun duel with dingo .  the fact  i that you are the so called boss .  you  mr .  hansen  are the  mastermind of the asteroid pirates .    chapter     all of the answer  hansen jumped out of his seat  and remained standing .  his breath whistled harshly through parted lips .   the admiral  scarcely less astonished  cried   great galaxy  man .  what is this .  are you serious .    lucky said   sit down  hansen  and let s try it on for size .  let s see how it sounds .  if i m wrong  there ll be a contradiction somewhere .  it begins with captain anton  landing on the atlas .  anton was an intelligent and capable man  even if his mind was twisted .  he mistrusted me and my story .  he took a trimensional photograph of me  that wouldn t be hard  even without my noticing  and sent it to the boss for instructions .  the boss thought he recognized me .  certainly  hansen  if you were the boss  that would follow  because as a matter of fact  when you saw me face to face later  you did recognize me .    the boss sent back a message to the effect that i was to be killed .  it amused anton to do that by sending me out in a push gun duel with dingo .  dingo was given definite instructions to kill me .  anton admitted that in our last conversation .  then  when i returned  with anton s word that i was to be given a chance to join the organization if i survived  you had to take over yourself .  i was sent to your rock .        lucky starr  hansen burst out   but this is mad .  i did you no harm .  i saved you .  i brought you back to ceres .     so you did  and came along with me  too .  now it had been my idea to get into the pirate organization  learn the facts from within .  you got the same idea in reverse and were more successful .  you brought me to ceres and came yourself .  you learned how unprepared we were and how we underestimated the pirate organization .  it meant you could go ahead at full speed .    the ceres raid makes sense now .  i imagine you got word to anton somehow .  pocket sub etherics are not unheard of and clever codes can be worked out .  you went up the corridors not to fight the pirates but to join them .  they didn t kill you  they  captured  you .  that was very queer .  if your story were true  you would have been a dangerous informer to them .  they should have blasted you the moment you came within range .  instead they did not harm you .  instead  they put you on anton s flagship and took you with them to ganymede .  you weren t even bound or under surveillance .  it was perfectly possible for you to move quietly behind anton and shoot him down .    hansen cried   but i did shoot him .  why in the name of earth would i have shot him if i were who you say i am .     because he was a maniac .  he was ready to let me ram him rather than back down or lose face .  you had greater plans and had no intention of dying to soothe his vanity .  you knew that even if we stopped anton from contacting ganymede  it would mean only a delay .  by attacking ganymede afterward  we would provoke the war  all of the answer      anyway .  then by continuing your role as hermit  you would eventually find a chance to escape and take on your real identity .  what was anton s life and the loss of one ship compared with all that .    hansen said   what proof is there to all this .  it s guesswork  that s all .  where s the proof .    the admiral  who had been looking from one to the other through all of this  bestirred himself .   look here  starr  this man s mine .  we ll get whatever truth is in him .     no hurry  admiral .  my hour isn t up .   .   .   .  guesswork  hansen .  let s go on .  i tried to get back to your rock  hansen  but you didn t have the co ordinates  which was strange  despite your painstaking explanations .  i calculated out a set of co ordinates from the trajectory we had taken going from your rock to ceres  and those turned out to be in a forbidden zone  where no asteroids could be in the ordinary course of nature .  since i was certain that my calculations were correct  i knew that your rock had been where it was against the ordinary course of nature .     eh .  what .   said the admiral .    i mean that a rock need not travel in its orbit if it s small enough .  it can be fitted with hyperatomic motors and can move out of its orbit like a space ship .  how else can you explain an asteroid being in a forbidden zone .    hansen said wildly   saying so doesn t make it so .  i don t know why you re doing this to me  starr .  are you testing me .  is it a trick .     no trick  mr .  hansen   said lucky .   i went back for your rock .  i didn t think you d move it far .  an asteroid      lucky starr  that can move has certain advantages .  no matter how often it is detected  its co ordinates noted and its orbit calculated  observers or pursuers can always be thrown off by movement out of the orbit .  still  a moving asteroid runs certain risks .  an astronomer at a telescope  happening to observe it at the time  might wonder why an asteroid should be moving out of the ecliptic or into a forbidden zone .  or  if he were close enough  he would wonder why an asteroid should have reactor exhaust glow at one end .    you had already moved once  i imagine  to meet anton s ship part way so that i could be landed on your rock .  i was certain you would not move very far so soon after .  perhaps just far enough to get into the nearest cluster of asteroids for camouflage purposes .  so i returned and searched among the asteroids nearest at hand for one that was the right size and shape .  i found it .  i found an asteroid that was actually a base  factory  and storehouse all at once  and on it i heard the sound of giant hyperatomics perfectly capable of moving it through space .  a sirian importation  i think .    hansen said   but that wasn t my rock .     no .  i found dingo waiting on it .  he boasted that he had had no need to follow me  that he knew where i was heading .  the only place to which he knew i was heading was your rock .  from that i conclude that one and the same rock had your living quarters at one end and the pirate base at the other .     no .  no   shouted hansen .   i leave it to the admiral .  there are a thousand asteroids the size and shape of  all of the answer       mine  and i m not responsible for some casual remark made by a pirate .     there s another piece of evidence that may sound better to you   said lucky .   on the pirate base was a valley between two outcroppings of rock  a valley full of used cans .     used cans .   shouted the admiral .   what in the galaxy has that to do with anything  starr .     hansen discarded his used cans into a valley on his own rock .  he said he didn t like his rock to be accompanied by its own garbage .  actually he probably didn t want it surrounding his rock and advertising it .  i saw the valley of the cans when we were leaving his rock .  i saw them again when i approached the pirate base .  it was the reason i chose that asteroid to reconnoiter and no other .  look at this man  admiral  and tell me whether you can doubt that i have the truth .    hansen s face was contorted with fury .  he was not the same man .  all trace of benevolence was gone .   all right .  what of it .  what do you want .     i want you to call ganymede .  i m sure you conducted previous negotiations with them .  they ll know you .  tell them that the asteroids are surrendering to earth and will join us against sirius if necessary .    hansen laughed .   why should i .  you ve got me  but you haven t got the asteroids .  you can t clean them out .     we can  if we capture your rock .  it has all necessary records on it  hasn t it .     try and find it   said hansen  hoarsely .   try to locate it in a forest of rocks .  you say yourself it can move .        lucky starr   it will be easy to find   said lucky .   your valley of cans  you know .     go ahead .  look at every rock till you find the valley .  it will take you a million years .     no .  only a day or so .  when i left the pirate base  i paused just long enough to burn the valley of cans with a heat beam .  i melted them and let them freeze back into a bumpy  angled sheet of fresh  gleaming metal .  there was no atmosphere to rust or corrode them  so its surface remains just like the metal foil goal posts used in a push gun duel .  it catches the sun and sends reflections glittering back in tight beams .  all ceres observatory has to do is quarter the heavens  looking for an asteroid about ten times as bright as it should be for its size .  i had them begin the search even before i left to intercept anton .      t .           it s a lie .    is it .  long before i reached the sun  i received a sub etheric message that included a photograph .  here it is .   lucky drew it out from under the blotter on the desk .   the bright dot with the arrow pointing to it is your rock .     do you think you re frightening me .     i should be .  council ships landed on it .     what .   roared the admiral .    there was no time to waste  sir   said lucky .   we found hansen s living quarters at the other end and we found the connecting tunnels between it and the pirate base .  i have here some sub etherized documents containing the co ordinates of your main subsidiary bases   all of the answer       hansen  and some photographs of the bases themselves .  the real thing  hansen .    hansen collapsed .  his mouth opened and hopeless sobbing sounds came out .   lucky said   i ve gone through all this  hansen  to convince you that you ve lost .  you ve lost completely and finally .  you have nothing left but your life .  i make no promises  but if you do as i say  you may end up by at least saving that .  call ganymede .    hansen stared helplessly at his fingers .   the admiral said with stunned anguish   the council cleaned out the asteroids .  they ve done the job .  they haven t consulted the admiralty .    lucky said   how about it  hansen .    hansen said   what s the difference now .  i ll do it .           conway  henree  and bigman were at the space port to greet lucky when he returned to earth .  they had dinner together in the glass room on the highest level of planet restaurant .  with the room s walls made of curving  clear one way glass  they could look out over the warm lights of the city  fading off into the level plains beyond .   henree said   it s fortunate the council was able to penetrate the pirate bases before it became a job for the fleet .  military action wouldn t have solved the matter .    conway nodded .   you re right .  it would have left the asteroids vacant for the next pirate gang .  most of those people there had no real knowledge that they were fighting alongside sirius .  they were rather ordinary people      lucky starr  looking for a better life than they had been experiencing .  i think we can persuade the government to offer amnesty to all but those who had actually participated in raids  and they weren t many .     as a matter of fact   said lucky   by helping them continue the development of the asteroids  by financing the expansion of their yeast farms  and supplying water  air  and power  we re building a defense for the future .  the best protection against asteroid criminals is a peaceful and prosperous asteroid community .  that way lies peace .    bigman said belligerently   don t kid yourself .  it s peace only till sirius decides to try again .    lucky put a hand to the little man s frowning face and shoved it playfully .   bigman  i think you re sorry we re short one nice war .  what s the matter with you .  can t you enjoy a little rest .    conway said   you know  lucky  you might have told us more at the time .     i would have liked to   said lucky   but it was necessary for me to deal with hansen alone .  there were important personal reasons involved .     but when did you first suspect him  lucky .  what gave him away .   conway wanted to know .   the fact that his rock had blundered into a forbidden zone .     that was the final straw   admitted lucky   but i knew he was no mere hermit within an hour after meeting him .  i knew from that time on that he was more important to me than anyone else in the galaxy .     how about explaining that .   conway sank his fork into the last of the steak and munched away contentedly .   all of the answer      lucky said   hansen recognized me as the son of lawrence starr .  he said he had met father once  and he must have .  after all  councilmen get no publicity and a personal greeting is necessary to explain the fact that he could see the resemblance in my face .    but there were two queer angles to the recognition .  he saw the resemblance most clearly when i grew angry .  he said that .  yet from what you tell me  uncle hector  and you  uncle gus  father hardly ever got angry .   laughing  is the adjective you usually use when you talk about father .  then  too  when hansen arrived on ceres  he recognized neither of you .  even hearing your names meant nothing .     what s wrong with that .   asked henree .    father and you two were always together  weren t you .  how could hansen have met father and not you two .  met my father  moreover  at a time when he was angry and under circumstances which fixed his face so firmly in hansen s mind that he could recognize me from the resemblance twenty five years later .    there s only one explanation .  my father was separated from you two only on his last flight to venus  and hansen had been in at the kill .  nor was he there as an ordinary crewman .  ordinary crewmen don t become rich enough to be able to build a luxurious asteroid and spend twenty five years after the government s raids on the asteroids building a new and bigger organization from scratch .  he must have been the captain of the attacking pirate ship .  he would have been thirty years old then  quite old enough to be captain .     great space .   said conway blankly .       lucky starr  bigman yelled indignantly   and you never shot him down .     how could i .  i had bigger affairs at hand than squaring a personal grudge .  he killed my father and mother  yes  but i had to be polite to him just the same .  at least for a while .    lucky lifted a cup of coffee to his lips and paused to look down at the city again .   he said   hansen will be in the mercury prison for the rest of his life  which is better punishment really than a quick  easy death .  and the sirians have left ganymede  so there ll be peace .  that s a better reward for me than his death ten times over  and a better offering to the memory of my parents .    the end
