.  harris  rob chilson  my wife diana gallagher wu  and of course isaac asimov for supporting the robot city project .       this novel is dedicated to  chelsea  with love      robots in combination  isaac asimov    i have been inventing stories about robots now for very nearly half a century .  in that time  i have rung almost every conceivable change upon the theme .   mind you  it was not my intention to compose an encyclopedia of robot nuances  it was not even my intention to write about them for half a century .  it just happened that i survived that long and maintained my interest in the concept .  and it also just happened that in attempting to think of new story ideas involving robots  i ended up thinking about nearly everything .   for instance  in this sixth volume of the robot city series  there are the    chemfets     which have been introduced into the hero    s body in order to replicate and  eventually  give him direct psycho electronic control over the core computer  and hence all the robots of robot city .   well  in my book foundation   s edge  doubleday         my hero  golan trevize  before taking off in a spaceship  makes contact with an advanced computer by placing his hands on an indicated place on the desk before him .      and as he and the computer held hands  their thinking merged .  .  .       .  .  . he saw the room with complete clarity   not just in the direction in which he was looking  but all around and above and below .      he saw every room in the spaceship  and he saw outside as well .  the sun had risen .  .  . but he could look at it directly without being dazzled .  .  .      he felt the gentle wind and its temperature  and the sounds of the world about him .  he detected the planet   s magnetic field and the tiny electrical charges on the wall of the ship .      he became aware of the controls of the ship .  .  . he knew .  .  . that if he wanted to lift the ship  or turn it  or accelerate  or make use of any of its abilities  the process was the same as that of performing the analogous process to his body .  he had but to use his will .      that was as close as i could come to picturing the result of a mind computer interface  and now  in connection with this new book  i can   t help thinking of it further .   i suppose that the first time human beings learned how to form an interface between the human mind and another sort of intelligence was when they tamed the horse and learned how to use it as a form of transportation .  this reached its highest point when human beings rode horses directly  and when a pull at a rein  the touch of a spur  a squeeze of the knees  or just a cry  could make the horse react in accordance with the human will .   it is no wonder that primitive greeks seeing horsemen invade the comparatively broad thessalian plains  the part of greece most suitable to horsemanship  thought they were seeing a single animal with a human torso and a horse   s body .  thus was invented the centaur .   again  there are    trick drivers .     there are expert    stunt men    who can make an automobile do marvelous things .  one might expect that a new guinea native who had never seen or heard of an automobile before might believe that such stunts were being carried through by a strange and monstrous living organism that had  as part of its structure  a portion with a human appearance within its stomach .   but a person plus a horse is but an imperfect fusion of intelligence  and a person plus an automobile is but an extension of human muscles by mechanical linkages .  a horse can easily disobey signals  or even run away in uncontrollable panic .  and an automobile can break down or skid at an inconvenient moment .   the fusion of human and computer  however  ought to be a much closer approach to the ideal .  it may be an extension of the mind itself as i tried to make plain in foundation   s edge .  a multiplication and intensification of sense perception  an incredible extension of the will .   under such circumstances  might not the fusion represent  in a very real sense  a single organism  a kind of cybernetic    centaur .     and once such a union is established  would the human fraction wish to break it .  would he not feel such a break to be an unbearable loss and be unable to live with the impoverishment of mind and will he would then have to face .  in my novel  golan trevize could break away from the computer at will and suffered no ill effects as a result  but perhaps that is not realistic .     another issue that appears now and then in the robot city series concerns the interaction of robot and robot .   this has not played a part in most of my stories  simply because i generally had a single robot character of importance in any given story and i dealt entirely with the matter of the interaction between that single robot and various human beings .   consider robots in combination .   the first law states that a robot cannot injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   but suppose two robots are involved  and that one of them  through inadvertence  lack of knowledge  or special circumstances  is engaged in a course of action  quite innocently  that will clearly injure a human being   and suppose the second robot  with greater knowledge or insight  is aware of this .  would he not be required by the first law to stop the first robot from committing the injury .  if there were no other way  would he not be required by the first law to destroy the first robot without hesitation or regret .   thus  in my book robots and empire  doubleday         a robot is introduced to whom human beings have been defined as those speaking with a certain accent .  the heroine of the book does not speak with that accent and therefore the robot feels free to kill her .  that robot is promptly destroyed by a second robot .   the situation is similar for the second law  in which robots are forced to obey orders given them by human beings provided those orders do not violate the first law .   if  of two robots  one through inadvertence or lack of understanding does not obey an order  the second must either carry through the order itself  or force the first to do so .   thus  in an intense scene in robots and empire  the villainess gives one robot a direct order .  the robot hesitates because the order may cause harm to the heroine .  for a while  then  there is a confrontation in which the villainess reinforces her own order while a second robot tries to reason the first robot into a greater realization of the harm that will be done to the heroine .  here we have a case where one robot urges another to obey the second law in a truer manner  and to withstand a human being in so doing .     it is the third law  however  that brings up the knottiest problem where robots in combination are concerned .   the third law states that a robot must protect its own existence  where that is consistent with the first and second laws .   but what if two robots are concerned .  is each merely concerned with its own existence  as a literal reading of the third law would make it seem .  or would each robot feel the need for helping the other maintain its own existence .   as i said  this problem never arose with me as long as i dealt with only one robot per story .   sometimes there were other robots but they were distinctly subsidiary characters   merely spear carriers  so to speak .    however  first in the robots of dawn  doubleday         and then in its sequel robots and empire  i had two robots of equal importance .  one of these was r .  daneel olivaw  a humaniform robot  who could not easily be told from a human being  who had earlier appeared in the caves of steel  doubleday         and in its sequel  the naked sun  doubleday        .  the other was r .  giskard reventlov  who had a more orthodox metallic appearance .  both robots were advanced to the point where their minds were of human complexity .   it was these two robots who were engaged in the struggle with the villainess  the lady vasilia .  it was giskard who  such were the exigencies of the plot  was being ordered by vasilia to leave the service of gladia  the heroine  and enter her own .  and it was daneel who tenaciously argued the point that giskard ought to remain with gladia .  giskard has the ability to exert a limited mental control over human beings  and daneel points out that vasilia ought to be controlled for gladia   s safety .  he even argues the good of humanity in the abstract     the zeroth law     in favor of such an action .   daneel   s arguments weaken the effect of vasilia   s orders  but not sufficiently .  giskard is made to hesitate  but cannot be forced to take action .   vasilia  however  decides that daneel is too dangerous  if he continues to argue  he might force giskard his way .  she therefore orders her own robots to inactivate daneel and further orders daneel not to resist .  daneel must obey the order and vasilia   s robots advance to the task .   it is then that giskard acts .  her four robots are inactivated and vasilia herself crumples into a forgetful sleep .  later daneel asks giskard to explain what happened .   giskard says     when she ordered the robots to dismantle you  friend daneel  and showed a clear emotion of pleasure at the prospect  your need  added to what the concept of the zeroth law had already done  superseded the second law and rivaled the first law .  it was the combination of the zeroth law  psychohistory  my loyalty to lady gladia  and your need that dictated my action .      daneel now argues that his own need  he being merely a robot  ought not to have influenced giskard at all .  giskard obviously agrees  yet he says      it is a strange thing  friend daneel .  i do not know how it came about .  .  . at the moment when the robots advanced toward you and lady vasilia expressed her savage pleasure  my positronic pathway pattern re formed in an anomalous fashion .  for a moment  i thought of you   as a human being   and i reacted accordingly .      daneel said     that was wrong .      giskard said     i know that .  and yet   and yet  if it were to happen again  i believe the same anomalous change would take place again .      and daneel cannot help but feel that if the situation were reversed  he  too  would act in the same way .   in other words  the robots had reached a stage of complexity where they had begun to lose the distinction between robots and human beings  where they could see each other as    friends     and have the urge to save each other   s existence .   there seems to be another step to take   that of robots realizing a kind of solidarity that supersedes all the laws of robotics .  i speculated about that in my short story    robot dreams     which was written for my recent book  robot dreams  berkley  ace        .   in it there was the case of a robot that dreamed of the robots as an enslaved group of beings whom it was his own mission to liberate .  it was only a dream and there was no indication in the story that he would be able to liberate himself from the three laws to the point of being able to lead a robot rebellion  or that robots  generally  could liberate themselves to the point of following him  .   nevertheless  the mere concept is dangerous and the robot dreamer is instantly inactivated .   william f .  wu   s robots have no such radical ideas  but they have formed a community that is concerned with the welfare of its members .  it is pleasant to have him take up such matters and apply his own imagination to the elaboration and resolution of the problems that are raised .     chapter l  the compass tower    derec stood on the high  flat top of the compass tower  looking down from the great pyramid at the endless geometric wonders of robot city beneath its blue and brilliant sky .  ariel leaned against him  still clutching his arm in both hands .  mandelbrot the robot and wolruf  the little caninoid sentient alien  waited behind them .      it   s changed so much     derec said quietly .  they had just teleported back to the planet by using their double key to perihelion .  mandelbrot had carried them all here .     keep the key .  it   ll be safest with you .         yes  derec     said mandelbrot .   derec turned around to gaze in the other direction .  the sight was the same  the lights and shapes of robot city  stretching to a skyline barely limned by the reflected sunlight against the blue horizon .  he could not escape it in any direction .  his destiny seemed to be here .      what   s changed .     ariel asked .  her voice was meek .  she had not recovered from her ordeal on earth .  a critical illness had reached fullness there  destroying her memories and her entire identity with them .  they had not been there by choice  but fortunately he had been able to place a new matrix of chemical memories into her mind .  they were to grow on the residue of her old memory  but they were still developing .  she had not had time to get used to them  to integrate them  to understand who she was .   derec squinted into the warm breeze that blew up the front face of the pyramid .  it tossed his sandy hair .  once brush cut  it had grown out to a golden shag .     they   ve done it .  the robots have built the city out in all directions .  it could cover the entire planet by now .         so it didn   t before .     she nodded  as if to herself  looking all around as he was .      no .  still  we aren   t exactly strangers here .  we know how to get along .  and if we   re lucky  we can get this trip over with and leave again before long .     derec turned to mandelbrot .     we have to find some shelter before we   re noticed .  can you still use your comlink to reach the city computer .         i will try .     mandelbrot hesitated a few seconds  quite a long time for a robot .     yes .  the city computer has changed the frequency it uses  but i have identified the new one by the simple expedient of starting with the original and sending a variety of signals that run up and down the entire range of    .         fine  excellent  thank you .     derec grinned at his enthusiasm  gesturing with his hands palm forward .     believe me  i trust your competence .  my next question is this  when ariel and i first came to robot city  i found an office in this pyramid  down below .  it had been recently occupied .  i think we can find dr .  avery there  but we have to be careful .  can you find out from the city computer if the office is still in use .         i will try .     mandelbrot then shook his head .     the computer will not reveal any information about the office .  it will not even confirm that the office still exists .         all right .      derec sighed .      what if it   s gone .     ariel asked .      i   d be very surprised     said derec .     avery just didn   t want his private office on file anywhere .  we   ll have to take our chances and just go right in if we can .       ariel held her hair out of her face .     just go in .  how .         the ceiling of the office had a trapdoor that opened right up into this platform we   re on .     he got down on his hands and knees .     come on  let   s find it .         derec .     ariel   s voice was a little stronger  showing some of her old spirit .     you   ve been growing weaker because of those .  .  . things dr .  avery forced into your body .  just be careful  will you .         can you find it .     he demanded irritably .     you   re not in the best condition of your life  either .         well  i   m not sick anymore .     she folded her arms .     i   m well now  at least physically .     she watched him for a moment .  then  as if to prove the point  she knelt down and started feeling around the surface of the platform herself .      you don   t even remember being here before  do you .     derec asked accusingly .  the tension was making him irritable .      do you .         yes .         well .  .  . you haven   t known who you are for the entire time i   ve known you .  you   ve had amnesia since .  .  .  .     she shook her head  shaking off the thought .     i may not have adjusted to everything  but at least i have something .     then she hesitated  searching his face .     i didn   t mean to say that .  not out loud  anyway .  did i get that right .  or did i remember wrong .      derec shook his head shortly and turned away .     that   s right .     she had even phrased it much the same way on earlier occasions .  he shifted around on his knees  feeling for an irregularity in the smooth surface .     mandelbrot  can you see anything .         here     said mandelbrot  walking to a far corner of the platform .     my vision has identified a small square outline that likely represents the opening .         good .     derec walked over to mandelbrot and knelt at the robot   s feet .  he slid his hands along the sides of a rectangular hairline break in the platform floor until he felt a small depression in the surface  no larger than a thumbhold .  he braced himself and started to slide it to one side .      allow me     said mandelbrot .      no  i got it       derec stopped  as the robot gently grasped his forearm and pulled it away .  he turned to look up .     mandelbrot  what are you doing .         how much have the chemfets in your body weakened you .     mandelbrot asked .      not that much .  now let   s quit talking and get down there .  avery put    em in me and he   s the only one who can get    em out .  come on .     derec pulled away from the robot again .      derec .     ariel said tentatively .      mandelbrot     said derec     carry wolruf and come down last .  help ariel over the           i cannot .  i must open it and go first .         what .         the first law of robotics     said mandelbrot mildly .     i can   t harm a human or let one come to harm           i know .     derec shouted angrily .     don   t you lecture me on the laws .  i put you together  remember .  i know those laws inside out  outside in  upside down           i said it for ariel   s benefit     said mandelbrot .     perhaps her memory of the laws is not clear .         i remember that one .     ariel looked embarrassed by the confrontation .     uh   is the second law the one that says a robot must obey orders from a human .         yes  unless the orders conflict with the first law .     mandelbrot nodded .      then the third law must be the one that says a robot can   t let itself come to harm or harm itself .          as long as this doesn   t conflict with the first or second laws     mandelbrot finished .     correct .      ariel smiled faintly .      let   s get going     said derec impatiently .  he reached for the thumbhold again  though he did not expect mandelbrot to let him open the door now  either .      i will determine this situation     said mandelbrot firmly .     with all due respect  the laws require it .         how do you figure that .     derec demanded .      your motor control of your own body is gradually failing because of the chemfets in your body .  ariel is disoriented because of her memory transfer  and wolruf   s body is unsuited to climbing down at this steep angle .  we are about to enter the office and possible temporary residence of your nemesis .  the likelihood of harm to you is high  therefore  i shall go first .      derec glared at him  unable to argue with his robotic logic .   wolruf looked up at him  cocking her doglike face to one side .     arr    u going to carry me down .         i will enter alone  first     said mandelbrot .     derec   s knowledge of robot city makes him the best able to handle unexpected developments  so he will follow me if the room offers no danger .  i will carry you down if we all go .      wolruf nodded assent .   derec watched mandelbrot in the faint light .  the robot hesitated just a moment  probably looking with infrared sensors and listening for signs of habitation or danger within .  then he bent down and slid the trapdoor open slightly .  after another pause  he opened the trap fully and climbed down a metal ladder inside the door .   derec waited  hardly daring to breathe .  avery could easily have a trap waiting for them .  wolruf moved to his side .  ariel stood quietly  but seemed relaxed  as though she did not understand the gravity of the situation .   after what seemed like a long time  a light came on in the room  throwing a cone of light upward .  mandelbrot called up softly .     it is here and unoccupied  apparently safe for everyone .      derec let out a breath of relief and took ariel   s arm .     you go next .  never mind what he said about me handling the unexpected  he can protect you better if anything happens .  and he   ll help you if you have trouble with the ladder .         all right .     ariel started climbing down carefully .   wolruf came to the edge of the opening and peeked down cautiously  being careful not to get in the way .   derec took the time to move with similar caution to the edge of the compass tower .  so far  he could see no changes down below that indicated an alert .   wolruf went next .  then derec started down  hoping his hands and feet would obey him .  he descended slowly into the room  holding the ladder tightly .  when he was fully inside  he slid the door shut over his head .   the ladder was firm and not difficult to negotiate .  just before he reached the floor  however  the muscles of his right leg failed to respond .  his foot slipped off the bottom rung and he stumbled back into the arms of mandelbrot .   derec pulled himself away  glaring at the others  who were all watching him .     i just slipped  all right .      none of them answered .      come on  come on .  let   s find out what we can .     derec moved past mandelbrot to pace around the office  looking around .   at first glance  it was just as he remembered .  the only other time he had been here  ariel had remained inside only a moment or two  so she would have few memories of the interior even at her best .  the other two had never been here at all .   the walls and the ceiling were entirely viewscreens  displaying a panoramic view of robot city at night on all sides .  it was nearly identical to the view derec had seen from the platform just above the room .  the buildings of robot city sparkled in all directions as far as he could see .  in the ceiling  they could see the blue sky still above them .   the office was furnished with real furniture  all brought from another planet  easy chairs  couch bed  and an iron alloy desk  instead of the simple utilitarian furniture made in robot city .  a blotter with paper and two zero g ink pens were on the desk .  as before  a small  airtight shelf full of tapes was intact .  they were separated by subject and then by planet  as he recalled  representing all fifty five spacer worlds .  if anyone had used them  they had all been replaced in order .  nothing seemed changed since his last visit until he turned and saw the plant .   before  an unfamiliar plant had been flourishing under a growth light .  the light was still in place  but the plant beneath it lay limp and dried in its pot .  its stalks were lavender  but he had no idea if that was a sign of recent dessication or its normal color in death .  he crumpled a dead leaf thoughtfully in one hand .      someone just let it die     said ariel  joining him .      i don   t think anyone   s been here     said derec .     mandelbrot  wolruf    does anyone see any sign of recent habitation here .      ariel looked around the room  and then down into a small waste basket .     this is empty .         someone has been here since i was here last  then     said derec .     but that was a long time ago .     he turned back to the desk with a sudden memory .  before  a holo cube with a picture of a mother and baby had been on it .  the cube was gone .      maybe rrobot emptied mash     said wolruf .      no .     derec shook his head .     the first time i was here  ariel and i were led here from the meeting room of the supervisors .  we had entered the compass tower from the ground below .  but we came the last part of the trip alone .  robots aren   t even allowed near this office .  i doubt that they have any idea what this room is .  entry would obviously be forbidden .         then except for dr .  avery himself     said ariel     this is an ideal hiding place .         if we can find a source of food for you three     said mandelbrot .     also  efforts to locate dr .  avery will involve inherent risk .         let me check something .     derec moved to the desk and opened the big well drawer on the right .  an active computer terminal was still housed within it .     ah .  this terminal has no blocks of any kind .  it   s where i first learned the causes behind the shapechanging mode of the city .     he sat down at the desk and entered the question     does this office have any sensors reporting to the outside .         negative .         order  do not leave any record of activity on this terminal in the city computer .         affirmed .          is there a source of human food available in this room .         affirmative .         where is it .         the control panel slides out from the underside of the desk surface where it overhangs this drawer .         is there a personal facility .         yes .         where is it .         the door is set into the viewscreen behind the ladder .  it is governed by the desk control panel also .      derec felt under the overhanging edge of the desk and slid out a wafer thin panel with raised studs .  he pushed the one marked    mealtime    and turned around at a faint hum from the wall .  near the ladder  a rectangular panel had moved out of the view screen on the wall to reveal the receptacle of a small chemical processor .  on the front of the drawer  the panel still showed its share of the outside view of robot city .   he let out a long breath  and grinned at ariel .     if it works  this buys us some time .  if the tank has no raw nutrients  it can   t help us at all .  i   ll try it .         no  let me .     ariel moved to the control panel quickly .     i can test my memory with stuff like this .  let   s see .  .  .  .     she punched a sequence of keys  paused to think  and hit another series .      okay     said derec .     what   s it going to be .         i   m not telling .  i want to see if you can recognize it .     she smiled impishly  but with a bit of worry  too .   derec punched another button on the control panel  and watched a narrow door slide open in the viewscreen  next to the chemical processor .  it was a very small personal  as clean and tidy as the rest of the office .  he closed the door again .   a few moments later  a small container slid into the food receptacle .  derec inhaled the aroma .     ha .  magellanic frettage again .  not bad .     he touched the container carefully .     and hot  too .  smells good .     he looked at her over his shoulder .     good job .      ariel smiled  wiping perspiration off her forehead with the back of one hand        ungrry  too  please     said wolruf politely .     of course .  coming up next     said ariel .   derec was starting to lift the dish out of the receptacle when he saw ariel blink quickly  repeatedly  and stagger backward .  she fell  and mandelbrot moved behind her just in time to catch her and lift her gently from the floor .  he turned and laid her carefully on the couch .     chapter    memories and chemfets    derec moved quickly to her side and knelt down .     ariel .     he said softly .   she was breathing in quick  shallow breaths and perspiring freely .  her eyes were closed .      mandelbrot .     derec said quietly .     have you got any idea what   s wrong with her .         no  derec .  my human medical knowledge is very limited .         maybe iss jusst tirred     wolruf said softly .     hass been verry sick .  needs resst .         i hope so     said derec .  he felt a deep sense of panic .  the ordeal she had undergone on earth had been extremely draining  and their landing back here must have caused her more stress than he had realized .     up till now  she was acting almost normal .      wolruf came to stand next to derec .  she looked at ariel   s face .     suggesst    u brring food .         mandelbrot     said derec .   the robot brought over the container of megallanic frettage and handed it to derec .  eating utensils were attached to the side of the container .  he simply held it  letting the aroma rise into the air near her .   nothing happened .      maybe this isn   t what she needs .  she isn   t responding at all .     he glanced at the others questioningly .      water .     wolruf suggested .      must find the stranger     ariel muttered .  her eyes were still closed  but she tossed restlessly .      what .     derec asked gently .     what stranger .         draw him to us .  aotta be hungry by now .     she squirmed  the sweat on her face shining in the light of the room .     have to make it better .  have to make him like it .  has to smell right .     she threw her head from side to side .      who .     derec insisted .     avery .  we   ll find him .  do you mean dr .  avery .     then he realized that she might be dreaming about jeff leong  the marooned stranger who had been turned into a cyborg when they were here before .  derec and his companions had helped capture him when the transformation had adversely affected leong   s mind  and had aided the robot in restoring him to human form .  they had sent him off the planet in a craft one of them could have used .      iss not hearing    u     said wolruf .     verry ssick .     derec stood up and set the container of food on the desk  still watching her .  she stopped talking  but her legs were moving slightly .  he had seen people move like that when they were dreaming .     i guess we   ll have to let her sleep .  maybe that   s all she needs .  i think i could use some rest  myself .      that couch can be unfolded into a bed     derec observed .     whatever is wrong with ariel is in her mind and memory  not her body .  she won   t be harmed if you will lift her for a moment .      mandelbrot bent down and gently lifted ariel in his robot arms as though she was a baby .  derec fumbled for a moment with the couch  then succeeded in pulling on a single strap that unfolded it to full size .  it was a simple  non powered device that was popular among frequent travelers because it did not force the owner to match power sources or worry about complicated repairs     all right     said derec .   mandelbrot laid her down just as carefully as before .  derec sat down beside her to loosen her clothing .  she was lying quietly now  as though she was sleeping .      i am aware     said mandelbrot     that a potential first law conflict may be developing .         what is it .     derec asked .  this did not seem like the time to hassle over the laws of robotics .        i recall from our presence here before that robot city possesses a very high level of human medical skill and technology .  the first law may demand that i put ariel in contact with the robot called human medical research    lest i allow her to come to harm through my inaction .     he trained his photosensors squarely on derec .      but you can   t .  we don   t dare  at least not right away .     derec jumped up and paced behind the desk .     they   re almost certain to alert dr .  avery  and then r ii be harmed through your action .  and so will she  probably .  the guy has to be crazy .         i know     mandelbrot said ruefully .     i also feel a resonance from the first law dilemma i faced in certain events before our recent return here .  i welcome suggestions that will avoid this contradiction .       derec stared at him .     suggestions .  hell  i don   t know .     he ran both hands through his hair and closed his eyes .     look  i   m tired  too .  suppose you stay in an alert mode  monitoring the city computer  while the rest of us get some sleep .         as you wish     said mandelbrot .     i will also turn out the light when you are ready .      wolruf was already settling comfortably into one of the chairs .  derec sat softly next to ariel  trying not to disturb her  and pulled off his boots .  moments later  he was stretched out in the sunlight  surrounded visually by the strange beauty of robot city .  he felt strangely naked without visible  opaque walls around him  despite the secrecy of this room and the efficiency of mandelbrot  who was a match for any other robot they might encounter .      mandelbrot     said derec .      yes .         see if you can figure out how to turn off these viewscreens .  that sunlight is bright  and we don   t exactly have curtains in here .         yes  derec .      derec was certain  the more he thought about it  that they would be safe here .  one of the few certainties about the mad genius named dr .  avery was that he was truly paranoid  and possibly becoming more so as time passed .  he surely knew that derec had been in this office once before  and he obviously knew that he had been in avery   s laboratory .  a true paranoid would not continue to use either one after his    opponent    had learned their locations .   his body was tired  more tired than it should have been .  he hated to admit it to himself  but his time to find dr .  avery was quickly growing shorter .  worst of all  he might reach the point where he could think clearly but would be unable to carry out any plans .  as sleep approached  his mind went to his basic problem  the chemfets in his body .   dr .  avery had captured him when they had been on robot city before .  at that time  however  ariel   s illness had been entering a critical phase .  derec had escaped and fled from robot city  hoping to find a cure for her disease .  they had wound up on earth .  only then had he realized what dr .  avery had done to him in the laboratory while he had been a prisoner .   the chemfets were microscopic circuit boards with biosensors that interfaced his body .  these tiny circuit boards were capable of preprogrammed growth and replication  and apparently dr .  avery had programmed them .  he had also planted a monitor in derec   s brain that told him what they were and what was happening now  a tiny robot city was growing inside his body .   derec had no idea why avery had done this to him  but the monitor had made one fact clear  the number of chemfets was growing  and some of them were joining together to grow larger .  they were already interfering with his ability to coordinate his movements normally  and they were going to kill him from the inside   paralyze him  he suspected   if he didn   t get rid of them .   only dr .  avery could do that .  derec had no idea how he could convince the man to do so .   derec woke up spontaneously  looking at a plain ceiling of light gray .  for a moment  he was completely disoriented .  then  remembering he was back in avery   s office  he sat up with a start of near panic and looked around .   ariel was sitting at the desk .  she flinched in response to his movement and looked at him .  her expression was at first blank  then relaxed to a shy smile .      ariel .  how are you feeling .     derec smiled in embarrassment himself at his sudden awakening  and ran a hand through his hair to brush it out of his eyes .      i feel all right .  i just .  .  . get confused sometimes .     her voice was apologetic .   derec swung his feet over the edge of the bed and looked around .  mandelbrot had found a way to opaque the walls  which were the same light gray as the ceiling  and now stood motionless with his back to derec .  wolruf was awake  sitting quietly in the chair where she had been when he had gone to sleep .      how are you .     ariel asked .     i   m able to get several decent dishes out of the chemical processor  by the way .  my memory was a little weak  but i learned some of it from scratch .  wolruf and i have eaten .  some of it is waiting for you .         thanks .  i   m okay     said derec .  he had benefited a great deal from the sleep .     a quick trip to the personal and i   ll be fine .      a moment later  he was standing in the cramped shower stall  letting steaming water massage his scalp with needle spray and run down his back .  he stood with his head down  eyes closed .  the heat made him feel better  telling him just how poorly he really felt .  it was loosening kinks in his neck that he had never had before .   they were all refreshed as though it were morning  which it could not be .  their biological clocks would adjust soon enough .   he forced himself to leave the shower and dress again .  if at all possible  he would disguise his ailments from his companions .  ariel and wolruf were counting on his knowledge of robot city to keep them safe and he would have to do that somehow until they located dr .  avery .  if mandelbrot knew how fast the chemfets were interfering with his health  the robot just might have to turn him and ariel over to the medical robots of robot city under the first law .  that would play right into dr .  avery   s hands .   he left the personal and forced a cheerful smile .      i   ve been reading up in the city computer     said ariel  nodding toward the terminal .     in particular  anything that we were involved in before .         really .  what have you found .         did you know that our visits to the key center are recorded here .  and this whole episode with jeff leong  the cyborg  when he was running amok .         were there any reviews of hamlet .     derec grinned .      not that i noticed .     she seemed to miss the joke .     oh  and of course the mystery of that wild  automatic shapechanging mode in the city  and how you stopped it .         i guess i hadn   t thought about being in the records much     said derec .     i   m not surprised  though .     he thought a moment  watching the cursor blink on the screen .     what is different from when we were here before is being able to get all the information you ask for .  have you been able to do that .         yes .  .  .  .     she looked at him thoughtfully .     i do remember  now .  .  . you had trouble getting your terminal to respond at times .      derec nodded .     there were blocks on other terminals  all right .  this terminal had no blocks  like i said last night .  still  that just refers to the ones avery deliberately installed in the rest of the system .  the problem with the city computer before was that so much information had entered during the fast pace of the shapechanging mode .  it was all in the computer somewhere  but the information wasn   t really organized anymore .         if you want to see what you can do here .  .  .  .     ariel started to get up and move away from the desk .      no  not yet .     derec tasted a bit of leftover breakfast and nodded appreciatively .     mandelbrot  have you found any blocks in the city computer yet .         no .     the robot   s voice was low in both pitch and volume .   derec and ariel both looked at him in surprise .  wolruf also studied his impassive face .      mandelbrot .     derec said .     come to think of it  you   ve been quiet since i woke up .  what   s wrong .         i have been unable to resolve the first law contradiction i described to you last night .  i am only functional now because i do not have complete information on which to base my judgments .      ariel looked back and forth between them .     what contradiction .  was that after i .  .  . fainted .         yes     said derec  ignoring a tightening in his stomach .     go on  mandelbrot .  can i give you instructions or explanations that will make a difference .         i do not see how .  ariel   s condition is a serious matter .  the robots at the human medical facility here demonstrated a potential that i must logically consider .         dr .  avery is crazy .  if he gets us in his power  that may threaten her life   all of ours .         it is possible  but so far his greatest interest has been in you .  the possible harm to her from dr .  avery is not greater than the clear harm that inaction may bring about .         are you approaching some kind of conclusion about this .     derec asked .      conclusion .     ariel cried .     how can you just sit calmly and talk about conclusions .  this isn   t a philosophy class .  he   s talking about turning us in to the enemy .        chapter    relapses    derec was quivering with tension  but he forced himself to stay clear headed .     mandelbrot .         i am finding it difficult to concentrate .  i am dwelling on this problem and going in circles .  if i enter a closed loop on the first law  i will be useless to you .         now listen to me .  before you go into any kind of closed loop  uh   okay  i   ve got it .  listen .     derec was talking fast  really before he had more to say .     urn .  .  .  .         i am listening     said mandelbrot .      maybe    u have more information to give    irn     wolruf suggested .  she got down from the chair and stood in front of mandelbrot  straining her neck to look up at him .      yes .  that   s it     said derec .     mandelbrot  we   re working with limited information on ariel .  the process she went through was experimental  but i think it worked .  i reprogrammed her memory myself .  we have to give it a chance .         people will have relapses     ariel pointed out  in a tightly controlled tone .  she was gripping the edge of the desk so hard that her fingertips were white .      these appear to be similar to a mechanical malfunction     said mandelbrot .     certainly medical care is a logical and customary treatment to facilitate healing .         no .     ariel wailed .     people don   t just fall apart in a straight line like machines .  i may be just fine .     her voice broke at the end  and she blinked back tears  turning away from mandelbrot .      i understand     said mandelbrot .     inaction may not necessarily cause further harm to you .         exactly .     derec let out a long sigh of relief and caught wolruf   s eyes .  she made a face that might have been her version of a wink and then hopped back up on the chair .      maybe we can build on that and find out something at the same time     said derec .     mandelbrot  i want to see if your attempts to get information through the city computer are blocked .  that will tell us just how special this terminal is .  can you concentrate now on a function of that kind .     distracting him wouldn   t hurt at the moment .      yes  derec .  i judge that the apparent first law contradiction is still incomplete .  the potential loop will close no further unless i receive more evidence that inaction could cause harm .         good .     derec sat down on the edge of the desk .     now  last night we found out that the computer would not admit the existence of this office to you .  i want to know if that has changed .  i ordered it to block all information about our presence here .  see if you can call up any hint of our using the facilities here .         i am trying several avenues     said mandelbrot .  his voice was returning to normal .     i   m asking for information about intruders  humans  and energy consumption or oxygen usage in the compass tower .         what do you get .         all is as you instructed     he answered promptly .     i am told that the office is not listed anywhere .  nor are the water or nutrient tanks in the chemical processor listed .  no alerts of any kind have been entered since our arrival .         good .     derec grinned .     so we really are safe here .  our next problem is to get a line on avery .  ariel  may i .     he slid off the desk and nodded toward the terminal .      of course .     she rose carefully  leaning her fingertips on the desk as though she was worried about her balance .      derec     said mandelbrot .     i suggest that we attempt parallel work with the city computer .  the result should confirm or disprove your suspicions .         good idea .  i   ll enter questions and tell you what i   m doing .     derec seated himself comfortably and started on the keyboard .     all right .  how many humans are on the planet of robot city right now .         i learn none     said mandelbrot .      ha .  i   ve got one     said derec triumphantly .     where is this human at the present time .         seated before this terminal     said the terminal .   derec smiled wryly despite his disappointment .     serves me right     he muttered .     wait a minute       he typed in the question     how do you know i   m human and not a robot .         the consumption of nutrients from the chemical processor  use of water in the personal  and changes in the composition of the air in the office indicate the presence of at least one human .  the probability of the presence of more than one human based on the amount of heat generated in the room is high .  combining this fact with the ability of robots to contact the city computer directly through their comlinks indicates the probability that you are human .      derec felt a twinge of panic .     so the use of this office has been recorded in the computer  after all .     his fingers fumbled on the keys  and he had to retype the question twice .      no .         explain your knowledge of this information  then .         information from this office is stored in local memory at this terminal .  it has not been sent to the city central computer  per your instruction .         is the information in your local memory available to anyone else  anywhere .         negative .      derec relaxed then  rubbing his fingertips against each other .  at some point  he would no longer be able to use the keys .  someone else could handle the keyboard if necessary  but that would mean admitting his disability .      what   s wrong .     ariel asked .      false alarm .     derec placed his fingers back on the keyboard and thought a moment .  then he entered     what other locations indicate similar evidence of human presence on this planet .         none .         i   m not surprised .     he looked at the others .     wherever our paranoid friend is hiding  he had the presence of mind to keep that information unavailable  even here .         maybe especially here     said ariel     if he was expecting us to search this office .         maybe    e lefft     suggested wolruf .     used a key to leave the planet entirrely .         oh  no .     ariel looked from her to derec .     you don   t think he left robot city  do you .  how can we find him then .      derec set his jaw grimly .     wherever he is  we have to pick up his trail here .         but if he has kept all the information out of the computer  we won   t have any to find .     ariel   s voice was cracking again .   wolruf moved to her side in a silent offer of moral support .      mandelbrot     said derec .     find out if any humans have been treated at that medical facility .  if you can think of any more avenues for reaching evidence of humans on the planet  go ahead and follow them .  and if you don   t get any results  let me try .         yes  derec .      derec put his hands on the keyboard again and missed the first two keys he tried .     wait a minute .  we can shortcut this .  mandelbrot  you sit down at this terminal and use it .     he got up carefully  looking at ariel and mandelbrot to see if they had noticed his mistakes on the keyboard .  if so  they did not show it .   wolruf was eyeing him closely  but she said nothing .  instead  she left ariel   s side and took a position where she could watch the screen as mandelbrot worked on it .      mandelbrot     said derec     turn on the viewscreens .     he turned to face one wall  hands on hips .   a moment later  the little office was flooded with light .  on all sides  robot city bustled on the ground far below them  stretching away until it vanished over the horizon .  above them  the sky shone down with brilliant sunlight .   ariel turned slowly  as though in awe .     i don   t recognize any of it     she said softly .   derec saw towers  spires  swirls  and loops in the architecture he had never seen here before  either .  humanoid and function robots moved about on the streets and on vehicles or machinery everywhere .  he remembered that single rnindedness  that sense of purpose  from the asteroid where he had first seen the avery robots .   circuit breaker  the distinctive structure that had revealed the ability of robot city robots to think and dream creatively  was gone .      the changes are extensive     said derec .     it   s not your memory at fault right now .         the shapechanging has to be stopped     said ariel .     it   s causing the massive rainstorms every night .         what .     derec turned to stare at her .   she clutched at his chest  looking over his shoulder at visions only she could see .     the floods .  they   re caused by the shapechanging mode in the city   s central core .  we must stop it .      mandelbrot had already left the terminal and was gently reaching out to pull ariel away from derec .      it   s just a temporary relapse     said derec quickly .     it doesn   t mean she   s getting worse .  understand .         i understand     said mandelbrot .  he was easing ariel into a sitting position on the bed .     you know  however  that discussing the shapechanging mode a short time ago did not trigger a relapse .  her condition is inconsistent at best .         apparently her memories aren   t anchored in a chronological perspective .     derec paused  still watching ariel .  his impulse to hold her  to protect her  was held in check by his fear of somehow making the relapse worse .   her eyes were closed and she was taking short  shallow breaths .  she was sitting up on her own  though .  gradually  her breathing slowed down and approached normal .   satisfied that she was out of immediate danger  derec continued with his thought .     something triggers a memory  and she relives it as a current experience .  or at least  it seems that way so far .         a bad experrience     said wolruf .   ariel seemed to be gaining her composure .  derec looked out at the city again .  he was sure that the unfamiliar skyline had not resulted from the old shapechanging mode  but was simply the result of constant refinement on the part of the robots .   suddenly he moved to the terminal and entered another question .  as before  he made a number of errors  far more than usual .  he slowed down and typed them correctly .     is the city functioning under any defensive overrides of the type represented by the shapechanging mode it once entered in response to parasites in human blood .         no .         is it operating under any overrides to basic programming .         no .      he stared at the screen  somewhat disappointed .     is something wrong .     mandelbrot asked .      not exactly .  i was just thinking that if the city was under an emergency of some sort  i might have been able to use it to our advantage somehow .         if dr .  avery is on the planet  he probably would have dealt with an emergency already     said the robot .      or maybe he left  but no crisis has arisen .     derec shook his head in resignation .     he could be literally anywhere  with a key to perihelion .  or with all the keys the robots could duplicate  for that matter .         it   s not shapechanging any more  is it .     ariel was gazing out at the city .   derec and mandelbrot both looked at her in some surprise .      no     derec said  relieved .     we ended it a long time ago .  that danger is passed .      she nodded  still gazing out at the city .   he watched her for a moment and decided that leaving her alone might do her more good than grilling her with questions .  she was self conscious enough already  though her quick recovery from this episode was encouraging .  he just hoped that he was right about her not needing treatment by the robots .  then he saw mandelbrot studying her  also .      mandelbrot     derec said firmly .     her relapse is over .         it may recur  i surmise .         another one may occur  but i don   t think the same one will .     derec hesitated  thinking about the two episodes he had seen since they had returned here .      we have compiled very little evidence for that conclusion     said mandelbrot .   derec shook his head .     i think that every time something of that sort happens  her memories are integrated just a little more afterward .  it   s part of the growth and replacement process that i didn   t recognize at first .         i understand the principle     said mandelbrot .     how certain of this theory are you .         uh       derec saw ariel watching him .   her face reflected more anxiety than he had ever seen her express  even at the worst of her disease .   he looked back at the robot and cleared his throat .     i   m sure of it .  remember  the growth of her memories and identity was intended all along .  these episodes are just .  .  . growing pains .      ariel closed her eyes in relief .   derec sighed .  he felt as though he was juggling too many lines of thought at once   ariel   s recovery  mandelbrot   s possible first law imperative regarding her  and his own failing condition .  what he really should be doing was finding dr .  avery .   he took a deep breath and tried to focus his thoughts once more .     all right .  we can figure that avery has hidden all direct evidence of his whereabouts from the central computer .  we   ll have to cast around for indirect evidence that he didn   t intend to leave .  anyone have any suggestions .      ariel looked at him for a moment and then returned her gaze to the viewscreens with a slight shake of her head .   mandelbrot stood quietly  apparently reviewing and rejecting possibilities .      we can   t find him by staying here in this room  can we .     derec spoke softly  admitting what none of them wanted to say .      the principle of identifying useful questions and seeking their answers through the central computer is sound     said mandelbrot .     theoretically  the search could be narrowed a great deal in this manner if we ask the right questions .         and if we can   t .     derec demanded irritably .     what then .  maybe we don   t have enough information to figure out the right questions  no matter how long we sit here .         leaving this office to explore the planet greatly increases the danger to you     said mandelbrot .      now don   t you start more first law objections .  sitting here doing nothing will eventually harm us the most .         i am not arguing against leaving itself     said mandelbrot calmly .     i do recommend a specific plan of action .      derec shrugged in agreement .     like what .         that has yet to be identified .         we   re going around in circles .     derec threw up his arms in frustration .  he banged one hand against the desk when he lowered it and grabbed it in surprise .   wolruf was watching him again .      i suggest that wolruf and i go out first     said mandelbrot .      how so .     derec rubbed his hand surreptitiously  pointedly ignoring wolruf .      consider this .  as a robot  i do not attract undue attention here .  on our first sojourn through robot city  wolruf was of no particular interest to the robots of this community .  we have the best chance of gathering information and returning here safely to report it .      derec thought a moment .     the terminal here confirmed your report that no special alerts are out .  so the robots aren   t on the lookout for humans  particularly .         the presence of humans  however  will at the very least trigger the applicability of the laws of robotics .  if their behavior is changed because of the laws  even in small ways  the shifts may be noted by the central computer and attract the notice of dr .  avery .         you mean if i instruct a robot to tell me something  he might be late fulfilling his duties or something .     derec nodded slowly .     with someone as paranoid as dr .  avery  i guess maybe those small variations might cause a review .  .  . if he noticed them .         i am calculating probabilities only  of course     said mandelbrot .     i am balancing potential benefit against possible danger .      derec realized  suddenly  that he welcomed the chance to rest .  he didn   t think of himself as a coward  or feel afraid .  in fact  the robot city he remembered had not been nearly as dangerous as aranimas  the pirate .  still  he just didn   t feel right .  maybe he should lie down .      all right  mandelbrot     he said .     you two go .  we   ll stay here .        chapter    priority   regional contingency power station    mandelbrot climbed up the ladder from the office to the top of the compass tower with wolruf clinging to his back .  they got through the trapdoor without incident .  then the robot began the long but simple task of descending the narrow line of footholds down the steep front face of the pyramid .   he almost certainly could have found his way down the labyrinth within the compass tower to the main entrance .  however  he did not want to be questioned by security robots about his presence if he was found there .  derec had pointed out that if he was questioned about climbing down the outside of the compass tower  he would not have to reveal his knowledge of a secret entrance .   derec had also told him of how he and ariel had painstakingly climbed down these small hand and footholds when they had first arrived on the planet .  they were only as large as a hand or foot might require  and the severe angle of the pyramid face offered little margin for error .  for a robot  of course  the descent presented no significant challenge .   mandelbrot spent the time of the descent considering how best to proceed .  when they reached the ground  wolruf let out a long sigh and collapsed in relief to the ground .      are you harmed .     mandelbrot asked her .      no .     the little alien shook her caninoid head back and forth .     don   t like rride .      mandelbrot looked around .  a number of humanoid robots were walking briskly on their way  among them  a much larger number of function robots  of all sizes and varied shapes  pursued their own duties .  in spite of the unfamiliar architecture  this was basically the robot city he remembered from his other visit here .      what arr    u going to do now .     wolruf inquired .      i must take a calculated risk     said mandelbrot .  in a space of time too quick for the alien even to notice  he made contact with the central computer and said     i am a humanoid robot requesting duty assignment in the city matrix .         what is your present assignment .         none .         what was your previous assignment .         none .         you are in error .  all robots in robot city have been assigned duties .  if you have recently been released from a repair facility  you should go through normal reassignment channels at that facility .          i have not been recently released from a repair facility .  i am prepared to undertake duty assignment .         what is your serial number .      mandelbrot invented one that fit the pattern of other serial numbers he had noticed on his last visit .      it is not on file .  are you a visitor to robot city .      that was the question for which mandelbrot was waiting .  the way the computer responded to his answer might determine whether or not he would become a fugitive .     you should have me on record .  i have past history on robot city .     it was not a falsehood  but it was deliberately misleading .  he didn   t add that he was on record by the names alpha and mandelbrot  not by the number he had just made up .  the need to protect himself and his human companions allowed him to feel comfortable with the misdirection .      your number is now on file .  you are now incorporated into the city matrix .  you are assigned to duty at the priority   regional contingency power station .  report immediately .     the computer proceeded to give city coordinates for its location .   mandelbrot waited to see if the computer would attempt a  shift in his programming  but it did not .  no matter how paranoid avery was  he had not programmed suspicion of unemployed robots into the central computer .  now mandelbrot was relieved .      i have been assigned a duty in the city matrix     he said to wolruf .     this will aid me in gathering information .     he was aware that the little alien had hardly had time to blink while he had conducted his exchange with the central computer .      wherr do we go .     she asked .      we are going to priority   regional contingency power station .  this way .         what is it .     wolruf asked as she ambled along beside him  gazing around at the sights .      i surmise from its name that it supplies power to a limited portion of the city in the event of a failure in the main system .  priority   suggests a relatively important part of the city .         long walk .         it is a greater distance than you would care to walk .  however  i believe we will find a tunnel stop shortly along this street .  certainly one will be near the compass tower .      mandelbrot did not want to consult the central computer again so soon for anything he could learn himself .  the current location of tunnel stops was an example .  every time he asked a question that a robot city robot should already know  he would increase the chances of being investigated or even forcibly repaired .   they located a tunnel stop promptly  and rode down the moving ramp into the tunnel itself .  mandelbrot again placed wolruf on his back  before stepping into the cramped platform booth .  there was just enough room for both of them .  he gave his destination to the console and let it figure out the nearest tunnel stop .  then they were off  riding the upright booth as it slid forward on the siding .   a moment later  the booth swung into one of the trunk lines with the other moving platforms .  humanoid robots rode with them on all sides  as motionless as mandelbrot within their booths .  the computer sped them up  slowed them down  and changed them from one parallel trunk line to another as the traffic flow changed as a result of some booths entering from sidings and others exiting onto them .   the booth they rode slowed smoothly  swung onto a siding  and glided to a stop .  mandelbrot stepped out and rode the ramp up to the street before setting wolruf down again .   this area of the city was not noticeably different from the one they had just left .  the city was too new to have old and new neighborhoods as such .  it was highly organized  of course  but much of the pattern was not readily visible  such as the power grid or the tunnel system .   mandelbrot oriented himself and led wolruf to the power station .  it was hardly more than a door in a very tall  narrow building wedged between others on three sides .  just as he entered  he used his comlink to report his assumed serial number  his name  and a request that communication be spoken aloud .  in work stations of this kind  robots in robot city often used their comlinks exclusively .      i am the station supervisor     said a humanoid robot inside the door .     my name is tamserole .  i was told to expect you  mandelbrot .  why do you wish to speak aloud .         i have a personal preference for this .     mandelbrot did not draw attention to wolruf by looking at her or mentioning her .  he knew she would listen carefully to any conversation .     what are my duties here .     he waited to see if tamserole would require the use of comlinks .      come with me .     tamserole had glanced at wolruf  but apparently had no interest in her .   mandelbrot and wolruf followed tamserole into the building .  the inside was quite narrow and its single impressive feature was a pillar of shiny metal alloy  one meter thick  rising into the ceiling .  a console of some kind was set into its base .      our task     said tamserole     is to make this unit fully automated so that l   and now you  of course   may discontinue our duties here and accept our migration programming .      mandelbrot had no idea what migration programming was  but tamserole obviously assumed he knew .  at the moment  mandelbrot did not dare reveal his ignorance .      i do not understand why i have been given an assistant by the central computer  when i have been told to reduce staff here to zero  not to increase it     said tamserole .     do you know why .         i believe so     said mandelbrot .     the central computer could not locate any past duty file on me .  i think it decided to give me a redundant position until i prove my efficiency .         that is logical enough     said tamserole .     i wish i had been informed  however .         what is my duty .     mandelbrot asked again .      i have been changing the procedure since learning you would join me     said tamserole .     until now  i have been programming the local memory of the central computer terminal in this console to make the judgements i have previously made myself .  i will now leave you here to familiarize yourself with what i have done .  improve on it if you can .         what is your new duty .         i located areas in the power system that can be streamlined .  i have already instructed function robots assigned to this station to meet me at certain areas of the city .  i will supervise their improvements and attempt to identify other potential ones on the spot .         very well .     mandelbrot moved to the console and began studying the various readouts . wolruf followed him unobtrusively .   tamserole left the station without further discussion .   mandelbrot first looked quickly through the information that told him the range and system that the station governed .  as he had surmised  this was a backup facility that only went on line when and if the main power system failed .  once he had learned some basic information about his new duty  he ignored his work in order to call up the central computer through the console .   questions posed through the console would initially be interpreted by the central computer as normal activity at the power station .  if they aroused enough suspicion  of course  the central computer would realize that they were irrelevant to station duty and might be coming from the same humanoid robot who could not explain his recent past .  mandelbrot could not  however  pass up this opportunity .   since the central computer had already refused to admit that dr .  avery was on the planet  he would have to begin with indirect approaches .  at least he had more information to work with than he had had in avery   s office .      what is migration programming .     he asked .      programming that instructs each humanoid robot to report to its assigned assembly point .         what is the purpose of this programming .         to insure that each robot arrives on schedule at its assigned assembly point .      that was no help .      what is the purpose of the assembly point .         it is a rendezvous site for migrating robots .         what will the robots do at their assembly points .         they will follow their programming .         what will their programming be at that time .         it will vary with each robot .      mandelbrot was about to ask for an example when the computer returned with its own question .      what is the purpose of your questions .      mandelbrot considered aborting the dialogue  but did not want to raise any further questions about his behavior .  he answered cautiously .     to learn why robots are migrating and what they will do at the assembly points .         your migration programming is sufficient information for you at this time .      mandelbrot did not dare reveal that he had not received such programming .  if the city realized that  it would almost certainly try to program him .  he might lose his independence in that event  and become an integral part of the city matrix .  he looked down at wolruf  who was waiting patiently .      i will fulfill my duties here for a time and try to gather more information     said mandelbrot .     do you feel safe in moving around on your own .         yess     said wolruf .     will walk around .  come back herr to meet u    .  okay .      mandelbrot considered the central computer .  if he inadvertently alerted it in some way and triggered an investigation  he would not want to remain here .     i prefer a neutral site .  can you get back to that tunnel stop we used to get here .         yess     wolruf hissed with her version of a grin .  she obviously thought it a silly question .         u say when .        derec was lying on the couch with his eyes closed  tossing fitfully .  he had eaten as much as he wanted  though he had had to force down enough to constitute even a small meal .  before  he had felt too weak to sit up  now  he was too restless to relax .      turn over     ariel said gently .      huh .     derec started to look up at her  but he felt her hands slide under his shoulders and push him carefully onto his other side .      lie face down     she said .   he welcomed the chance to follow directions instead of make decisions .  when he tried to push himself to roll over all the way  though  his hands kept slipping on the fabric .  both his arms flailed weakly  accomplishing nothing .  finally  her slender fingers groped under his arms for a moment and gripped him just enough to help him onto his front .   derec let out a long sigh and closed his eyes .  her fingertips began massaging the muscles of his upper back .  instantly  the tension began to break a little at a time .   as he relaxed  he concentrated more on the relief in his muscles that her massaging brought about .  he could feel tiny vibrations each time she pushed  as though very slight kinks were snapping .  it was like loosening any ordinary adhesion that might build up  such as a crick in one   s back  only they were very small .      is this helping .     she asked .      yes     he whispered  not wanting to put out the energy to speak aloud .     it   s wonderful .      she gradually worked her way downward .  he could feel her breaking these kinks all the while .  as more of his muscles were freed of them  he was able to relax a little more  and he became drowsy .   she continued for a time without speaking .      you really feel bad .     ariel spoke softly after a while .     i mean  you haven   t been awake that long .         sleepy     he whispered faintly .  her fingertips were a persistent  rhythmic source of pleasure .  they moved back up to his shoulder muscles again and broke more of the adhesions .   he stopped relaxing .  after a moment  he noticed it himself .  as he started to wake up again  he opened his eyes  wondering what had happened .      feeling better .     she asked cheerfully .      no .  not exactly .         what is it .  should i stop .         could you   i mean  would you mind doing my upper back again .  right away .         sure .     she returned her hands to the area where she had started  and where she had just kneaded a second time already .      thanks .     derec paid close attention this time .  the same kinks were loosened as before .  he felt the same vibrations  the little snappings that relieved him of tension in the muscle .   only those kinks had returned almost instantly .  not as many were back  at least not yet .  he felt fewer this time than either time before .  still  the pattern was clear .  the massages would have to be constant to do him any good .      is that better .         uh   it   s fine .  look  i don   t want you to tire yourself out .  thank you .  it does help .     that was true  but he couldn   t have her do so much work indefinitely for relief that lasted only a matter of seconds  or perhaps a few minutes .      i   m glad .     ariel quit  but remained sitting next to him  flexing her fingers .      could you help me turn over .         of course .      again  his arms were weak and rubbery when he tried to push himself onto one side .  she took his shoulders and brought him around in a kind of twist  where his pelvis and legs lay prone  but his upper body lay on one side .  then she moved to his legs and  with considerable effort  pulled him entirely onto his side .      there .     she let out a breath and smiled .   he looked up to study her face .  his secret hadn   t lasted very long .  he was clearly in serious trouble and worsening rapidly .      derec .  what is it .         i don   t see how i   m going to make it .         what .  what do you mean .         i   m so tired .  and weak .  you can see for yourself .  avery could be anywhere on the planet  and i don   t think i have much time .     even his tongue was slurring a little .      you shouldn   t talk like that .     her voice was sharp with some of her old spirit .     mandelbrot can do anything a robot can do  plus some extras .  and hasn   t wolruf proven herself many times over .         the time     said derec .  his anger flared  giving him energy .     we just don   t have much time .  sure  i think we   or they  anyhow   can find avery sooner or later .  but it may be too late for me .         after everything that   s happened to us .  you   re going to give up now .  come on .         well  what can i do .  just lie here .         maybe we can still think of something .  we got away from aranimas  didn   t we .  we got out of rockliffe station  and we solved the shapechanging and the murder mystery   or i should say  you did .  .  .  .     her voice trailed off .   he waited a moment  expecting her to continue .  when she didn   t  he looked up at her .   she was staring at him with horror on her face .  startled  he raised up enough to look himself over  but saw nothing unusual .  he passed his hand in front of her face but she did not react .      ariel     he said firmly .      it   s derec     she whispered .     he looks just like derec .  it   s impossible .     suddenly she turned and leaped off the bed  only to run into the desk almost immediately .  her legs buckled and she thumped hard on the floor  blinking rapidly .   derec forced himself up on one elbow and reached down to grip her arm .     ariel .  can you hear me .      she was looking around the room very slowly .  at first she didn   t seem to hear him  but then she nodded  almost imperceptibly .     you   re up     she said  surprised .      not very far .      she reached back with her hand and slapped him across the face hard  leaving his cheek stinging from the blow .   derec sat up straight  swinging his legs over the side of the bed .     are you crazy .  what           look at yourself .         myself .  what are you talking about .         you   re sitting up .  derec  you have to stay alert .  i don   t know if it   s the adrenaline or the fear or the  the .  .  . i don    t know what .  but when i went into a fugue state again  the emergency started bringing you back to normal .         and then you hit me .  .  . and i sat up .     derec nodded slowly .     i   m hardly back to normal  but i see what you mean .         don   t give in to it  derec  you have to fight it .         all right .  i get it .  it   s like cold when you   re in danger of freezing .  you have to move around and keep the blood circulating .  something like that .     he stood up  and winced at the stiffness in his joints .     i still hurt allover .      ariel rolled the desk chair into position for him .     come on .  back to the terminal .  the work will keep your mind busy  and maybe we   ll think of something useful .        chapter    euler    mandelbrot realized the time had come for him to rendezvous with wolruf .  since he might still benefit later from acting within the city matrix  he did not want simply to abandon his duty .  tamserole had not returned  so he took the greater risk again of reporting to the central computer .      this is the priority   regional contingency power station .  i am reporting a leave of duty because my supervisor is not present to receive it .         where is your supervisor .         i do not know .  he is fulfilling his duty elsewhere .         why are you leaving your duty .         i have an emergency .         explain it .         i do not have time .     mandelbrot broke the connection  hoping that he would be able to return to duty here later if it would be useful .  he did not have an explanation yet .  attempting to create one could wait until it was necessary .  considering the immense size of the central computer and its total data  the oddities of his behavior might still escape the notice of dr .  avery .   mandelbrot had spent his relatively brief time at the station actually performing his duty .  he had made some progress in creating an autonomous system that would free tamserole to activate migration programming  but he had not quite finished it .  if he had  he might have been able to leave without suspicion .  he was not certain .   one problem mandelbrot faced was that he was intellectually distinctive from the robots of robot city and at any time might reveal his differences by the questions he asked or the actions he took .   mandelbrot rode down the ramp of the tunnel stop and saw the little alien sitting calmly to one side of the loading area .  she was in a slight shadow  out of the way of robots getting on and off the platform booths .  when she saw him  she stood up impatiently .   mandelbrot did not speak right away .  instead  he lifted her onto his back and stepped into one of the booths  where they would not be overheard by accident .  the booth would not start until it had a destination  so he entered the one for the compass tower .  they could change their minds later if necessary .      have you learned something .     he asked once the booth was on its way .      yess     wolruf hissed eagerly .     robots moving everywherr .  change city so that fewer robots arr needed at each place .  then they leave theirr dutiess .         the migration programming .  do you have any clues about what that means .         no .         i don   t want to take the risk of asking the central computer myself or asking through the station terminal  for fear of attracting too much attention .  we   ll have to return to the office .         good     said wolruf  with her caninoid grin .     getting hungry now  anyway .        derec was forcing himself to sit up at the terminal despite the painful stiffness in his back .  he had been asking the central computer all kinds of questions  anything either he or ariel could think of  shooting wildly in the dark .  so far  they had not discovered anything that led them anywhere .   the blank screen shone patiently in his face .     any more ideas .     he asked her .      what about those robots at the key center .  if my memory serves       she smiled at the irony .     if it serves  they seemed to be chosen for their high quality .  what are they doing now .         good idea .  let   s see .     derec asked     what activities are underway at the key center .         none .      derec straightened in surprise .     where is keymo and the team of robots assigned to him .         keymo is at these coordinates .     the central computer gave some numbers .     no team is currently assigned to him .         what is he doing .         he is following his migration programming .         what are the other robots doing .         they are following their migration programming .         where are they .      the computer responded with a long list of coordinates .  they represented a very wide range of locations .  most of them were on parts of the planet far from here at the heart of robot city .  these locations had not even existed as part of the city when ariel and he had first arrived .  some coordinates  however  were listed more than once .  keymo   s location was included .      what pattern of significance do these coordinates represent .     derec asked .      they are precisely     .    kilometers apart .  the pattern covers all the land surface of the planet .         why .         this distance results in exactly the number of assembly points desired .      derec felt a surge of excitement .     desired by whom .         desired by the program .         what is the purpose of the program .         access denied .      derec slapped his hand on the desk .  he was too weak to hit it very hard .     so this terminal is blocked now  after all .  we just didn   t ask it the right questions before to turn up the blocks .      behind him  ariel said nothing .      i wonder .  if avery put some blocks on this terminal as a precaution before we got here .  .  . why didn   t he put the standard blocks in .  why did he ignore most of the blocks the other terminals have but leave some of them .      on the screen  the words    access denied    taunted him silently .  on the walls all around them  robot city bustled in the shining day .  the room was silent .      all right     derec said to himself .     maybe the block really isn   t on this terminal .  he   s set himself up somewhere else  of course  and he   s simply blocked whatever he   s done at that terminal .  that must be it .  he hasn   t thought to block this one .  makes sense  doesn   t it .      when ariel didn   t answer  he painfully looked back over his shoulder at her .     ariel .      she was standing motionless with her eyes open .  they seemed to be aimed at the floor just past the desk  but she was not blinking .  when he put his hand in front of her  she did not react .  he gently reached up to close her eyes with his fingertips .  they remained closed .      we can   t wait     he said quietly to himself as much as to her .     we can   t just sit here and try to think our way out of this .  we don   t have the time .      he stood up and carefully put one arm around her shoulders .  with gentle pressure  he was able to guide her to the couch .  she walked stiffly and slowly  with her eyes still closed .  he could not get her to sit until he sat down first and pulled her down into a sitting position next to him .      ariel .      he could see her eyes moving beneath her closed lids .  after the last few episodes he had seen like this  he didn   t dare try to bring her out of it himself .  he would probably just make her worse .   after a few minutes  he moved away from her a little bit and watched her .  she was sitting straight  rather primly  with her head up .  maybe she was reliving a trip in the seat of a spacecraft or something .  she offered no clues .   finally she inhaled sharply and blinked a couple of times .      ariel .      she looked at him and then at one of the viewscreens .      ariel  are you .  .  . with me again .         i did it again  didn   t i .     she reached for one of his hands .      it was different this time .  you weren   t shouting or anything .     he held her hand and put his other arm around her .      i was watching the play     she said softly .     it was real  wasn   t it .  you know the one i mean .  i don   t know what i   m doing .  i can   t even be sure where i am  or when i am .         slow down     he said patiently .     one question at a time .  you said the play .  you mean hamlet .      she nodded .     when we did it here .         did it come out any better this time .     he forced a smile  hoping to lighten her mood .   she shook her head  not responding to his humor .      all right .  look  i   ve decided something .  let   s go see avernus .  or euler .  or any of the supervisors .  they   re probably right here in the compass tower .         are you sure .         we   ve been stuck in here long enough .  come on .     he got up  wincing at the shooting pains in his legs .   she stood up reluctantly .  he pushed a button on the control panel on the desk  and a doorway opened in one of the viewscreens .  it was a black maw in the center of downtown robot city .      come on .     he edged carefully out the doorway  looking around .  all he saw was the short spiral staircase  maybe three meters or a little more  that he had come up when he had first found the office .  from here it led down to a closed door .     we won   t find any robots near here .  we   ll at least be safe until we get out of the taboo area .         all right .     she hadn   t moved from the couch .     but what if i .  .  . you know .  what if i go into one of my states right in the middle of everything .         we   ll just have to chance it .     he looked back and saw the reluctance on her face .     we   ve tried being cautious and we haven   t gotten anywhere .  we have to go .         i might foul you up  derec .  not knowing what   s going on and all .  if you want me to stay .  .  .  .         i may need you to save me  too .     he smiled wistfully .     we   re still a team  no matter what .      she relented  then .     no matter what .     she followed him to the door and gave his arm an affectionate squeeze .   derec clung to the rail of the spiral staircase all the way down .  his knees burned at every step .  he took a deep breath at the bottom  thankful for the rest as she came down behind him .  then he opened the door .   a short hallway extended ahead of them .  he recognized it and the gently glowing wall panels that provided light .  the end of this hallway marked the nearest limit to the office that robots were allowed to come .  past that point  he and ariel could encounter robots on their normal duties at any time .   he walked forward slowly  watching for shadows and listening for any sound that would mean unwanted company .  if they could get down to the meeting room of the supervisors  on a lower level  the robots might assume that they had entered from the street level .  he did not want them to suspect any other possibility .   ariel followed closely as he moved through the hallways .  these halls were narrow  but this level of the pyramid had very little floor surface .  in just a few moments  they came to an elevator .   he took a deep breath and pressed the single button on the wall panel .     about six floors down  if i remember right     he said quietly .     do you remember any of this .      she nodded .   they waited in a tense silence .  when the door began to open  he drew in a sharp breath and felt her grab a fistful of the back of his shirt .  it was empty  however  and they entered with embarrassed smiles of relief for each other .   he pressed the button for six levels down .  the elevator dropped precipitously  but slowed gently enough and came to a smooth stop .  again  they stood completely still while the door opened .   no robots were waiting outside the elevator  but for the first time they could hear sounds of activity .  the noises were not specific  perhaps they were no more than a variety of hums created by function robots cleaning the rooms and halls .  still  this level was clearly occupied .      we   re okay now     he said quietly .     in fact  we may want to meet a robot who can act as a guide .  just remember .  if a robot asks how we got in here  our story is that we came in the front door .         and got lost .     she grinned .      uh  yeah .      the halls were wider here  and the ceilings higher  to make the trip worse  the maze was far more intricate .  intersecting halls crossed the main hallways more and more frequently  and they could look down any of them to see further expansions of the labyrinth .  long ago  he had guessed that this level was roughly halfway up the pyramid .  the floor surface of this level was very large .      i just can   t remember     said derec  stopping at an intersection of halls .  he leaned against one of the glowing panels for support .     we could wander indefinitely .  i   ve been taking all the largest halls  but they still haven   t led anywhere .      ariel studied his face .     you   re in pain  aren   t you .         i can   t let that stop me  or we won   t get anywhere .         then quit dawdling and come on .     ariel pushed past him and started down the wider of the two hallways .   he smiled weakly as he followed her .  she was being brusque in the hope of angering him  and causing another brief remission of his condition .  it didn   t work because he recognized the effort  but he appreciated it as he forced his burning legs to follow her .   suddenly a rhythmic beeping sound echoed down the hall toward them .  a small function robot  only a meter high  rolled toward them with a blue light on its front .  a small scoop front functioned as a vacuum  and brushes on retracted tentacles betrayed its second duty as a sweeper .  its beeping recognition of strangers in the halls was probably a third function  nearly an afterthought .   derec and ariel stopped  watching it hurry forward .  it skidded to a halt in front of them  still beeping .   he laughed .     i guess that   s our alert .  i thought we   d rate a siren or two  at least .         it   s kind of cute .  i suppose it   s sending out another signal as well  huh .         i   m sure it is .  hey  there   s a familiar face   if you want to call that a face .     derec grinned .     euler .      the humanoid robot striding down the hall toward them was one of the first they had met on the planet .  euler was one of the seven supervisor robots whose brains together constituted one of the complex master computers of the city .  his head was molded to the human model  and he had glowing photocells for eyes .  to complete the pattern  he had a small round mesh screen in place of a mouth .      hey  euler .     derec repeated .     why isn   t he answering .  what   s wrong with him .      euler walked right up in front of them and stopped .  the little function robot whirred and rolled away  apparently in response to a comlink order .      greetings  derec .  you are not allowed here .  come with me .     euler stepped aside to let them go first .      what kind of a welcome is that .     derec demanded  walking forward reluctantly .     euler  it   s us .  we   re back .  and we need help and information .         i recognize you  derec and ariel .     the robot was walking just behind them both .   derec had the uneasy feeling that they were being guarded rather than accompanied in a friendly fashion .     you used to call me friend derec     he pointed out .      we are conducting urgent and important business     said euler .     you are acquainted with robot city and you know you will be safe here .  you must leave the compass tower .         i told you we need help .     derec shouted angrily .     the first law .  have you forgotten all about it        ariel tugged hard on his sleeve  slowing him down .  he shook her off  turning to stop and face euler eye to eye .      no     ariel insisted .     don   t give anything away .  something   s gone wrong .      derec froze in his angry posture  glaring at the impassive face of the supervisor .  he hesitated  absorbing the unexpected behavior of euler .  she was right .      what   s happened .     ariel asked euler .     why are you acting different now .         you are not allowed in the compass tower .         wait a minute     said derec .     what about your study of the laws of humanics .  remember those .  you need humans for that .         please continue forward .  you will be removed by unharmful force if necessary .         ha .     unharmful force    .  you don   t know how fragile we are  do you .     derec laughed derisively .      what   s happened since we were here last .     ariel asked .     have you changed your plans for the city .         come with me .     euler reached out with each pincer and took their arms .   even the gentle pressure caused a snapping of adhesions in derec   s arm .  he winced in surprise  though the feeling was partly one of relief .  the pincer immediately withdrew .      you hurt me .     derec shouted .     ariel  come on .     he grabbed her arm and started to run .     chapter    on the run    his legs burned painfully and his back felt oddly stiff as he tried to hurry down the hallway .  she was already ahead of him now and pulling him  rather than the reverse .  behind them  euler was hesitating  his decision making slowed by derec   s accusation .   ariel pulled derec around a corner and down another hallway .     they   ve been reprogrammed     derec called to her  panting .     they must have been .  if the robots had evolved new priorities themselves  they would still have the same personalities .         shut up and come on .     she turned another corner .   derec stumbled after her  forcing his legs to stretch out .     look for an elevator .      they skidded around another corner  trying to gain traction on the clean  polished floor .  her grip had slid to his hand  and their arms were fully outstretched as she pulled him along after her .  she turned another corner  continuing a zigzag pattern .      do you know where you    re going .     derec asked  as quietly as he could .   ariel slowed to a halt at another intersection of hallways .  no pursuit was evident yet  but in a building this size  the supervisors could certainly marshall a large number of function robots to detect their presence .  some humanoid robots would undoubtedly be around to join the chase  also .      no  i don   t know where i   m going     she said .   derec looked behind them and down the four halls that met where they were standing .     where is everybody .     he gritted his teeth against the pains shooting through his legs and his back .      come on .     ariel started again  then noticed he was still looking down the other hallways .  she leaned back to grab his hand and pull him after her .   they turned several more corners  always looking for doorways or main hallways .      there .     ariel shouted  as they rounded one corner .     isn   t that an elevator .         worth a try     he gasped  wheezing as his chest heaved for air .     hit the button .  i think we   re in real trouble .      they waited anxiously  looking behind them as they waited .  at last the door opened  and again the elevator was empty .  they got inside and ariel hit the bottom button .   derec fell back against the wall for support and closed his eyes .     i hope nobody   s waiting for us when the door opens .         what did you mean  we   re in real trouble .         two things .  the way euler acted  i think avery reprogrammed all the supervisors while we were gone .  that means the whole city is operating under different rules .  i   m also guessing that as soon as our presence was reported in euler   s positronic brain  the central computer reported right to avery  wherever he is .         then why isn   t anyone chasing us .         i   m afraid .  .  . he   s ordered hunter robots after us .  and the others are simply staying at their regular duties .      the elevator door opened into dim light .  no one was waiting for them  however .  derec stepped out first  looking around .   they appeared to be in a small tunnel stop .  in most of the others  the multiple tracks were visible from the loading area .  here  a wall isolated the siding  keeping it out of the sight of travelers passing on the main trunk .   derec edged toward the siding and looked around .  he could feel the rush of air moving past him from one side to the other as it blew in from the main tunnel .  ariel followed him .      i pushed the    wait    button     she said .     they won   t be able to call this elevator back up .      he nodded approval .     come on .      they crowded into the single platform booth waiting on the siding .  he started to punch a code into the console  then hesitated .      what   s wrong .  we have to get away from here as fast as we can .     she tugged on his arm .   he entered a code for a tunnel stop just a short distance away and the booth started to move .     the tunnel computer is a branch of the central computer .  as soon as someone asks  it will report our destination .         what .         that   s right .     he nodded grimly .     we have to get away from here and get out quick .  if we ride too long  we   ll have a welcoming committee by the time we stop .      the transparent booth followed the siding around a curve and onto one of the parallel tracks in the main tunnel .  derec looked around anxiously at the stolid robots riding nearby booths  but none showed any interest in them .  on the other hand  the robots presented their customary expressionless aspects while riding the booths  and if one was scared enough    as derec was now   they seemed stern .   a paranoid might easily imagine that they were secret escorts  not incidental travelers .   he shook his head angrily .  that line of thought would make him as crazy as avery .   suddenly the booth slowed and swung into another siding .  this was an ordinary stop  with a loading area fully visible from the main tunnel .  that stop under the compass tower was the only disguised one derec had ever seen .      nobody   s waiting for us     said ariel as the booth came to its carefully calculated stop .  she stepped out onto the empty loading platform .   he came out behind her .     if hunter robots are on the way  they may just be getting the coordinates now .  they can pick up our trail here  though  without going to the compass tower at all .  i   hey .         derec  what is it now .     she wailed .   he whirled and leaned back into the platform booth .  after a quick glance down the way they had come  he entered a series of further coordinates  punching codes as fast as he could remember them .      derec  let   s go .     she looked down the main tunnel anxiously herself .     what are you doing .         that   ll help .     he stepped out of the booth and it immediately took off down the siding .      what did you do .     she asked as they stepped onto the moving ascent ramp .      they   ll have to check all the destinations i entered .     he grinned  then winced at the pain in his legs .     maybe we got off here  maybe we rode on .  they can   t know .         do you think it   ll matter .  won   t they just call out more hunters to cover every stop .         maybe .     he shrugged .     if nothing else  it   ll spread out their resources some .      they rode up into the sunlight and stepped out onto the street .  he looked around  feeling totally exposed .  as the only humans on the planet except for avery  they could be spotted instantly virtually anywhere they were .      our only chance is if the hunters are the only ones alerted to the chase     he said  eyeing an approaching humanoid robot suspiciously .  it was alone  with a number of varied function robots moving about on the street near it .   ariel followed his gaze and lowered her voice .     when we were looking for jeff  the whole planet cooperated in the alert  didn   t they .         they had the first law giving them an extra push in that case     said derec .     in this case  i don   t know what they   ll do .  if even the supervisors have been reprogrammed  then new priorities may be in effect for the entire population .      the humanoid robot walked past them without interest .  down the block  a couple of others were crossing the street away from them .  they just didn   t react to derec and ariel   s presence .      shouldn   t we get out of here .     ariel looked back down the tunnel stop .     we   re just standing around .         i   m thinking .     derec whispered hoarsely .  his legs were throbbing painfully .     we have to know where we   re going .  we can   t just run down the sidewalk .  i won   t last .          i   ve got it .  come on .     she grabbed his hand and started pulling him again .   he clenched his teeth at the shooting pains in his back and his legs as he hurried after her .     mandelbrot was walking briskly down the sidewalk toward the compass tower with wolruf trotting alongside .  they were coming from the regular tunnel stop closest to the pyramid .  suddenly  ahead  the distinctive forms of two tall  powerful humanoid robots with multiple sensory apparati crossed an intersection in the distance on their way toward the compass tower .  they were hunter robots  programmed with a particularly high sensitivity to pattern recognition and detail .   mandelbrot stopped abruptly .      what iss the matter .     wolruf asked as she came to a belated halt and looked up at him .      hunters     said mandelbrot .     unless other intruders are present  our group is certainly their quarry .  and they are going right to the compass tower .     he accessed the central computer .     please inform me of any general alert that has been issued .         none     said the central computer .     please identify yourself and your duty task .         what is the current assignment of active hunter robots .     mandelbrot guessed that he could risk one suspicious question before the central computer would start a trace on his transmission .      identify yourself and your duty task     the central computer repeated .   mandelbrot broke the link .     i can   t get any significant information without endangering our position     he said to wolruf .     since no general alert has been made  only the hunters are a danger to us .         to uss .     wolruf asked .     or only to the    umanss .     she looked back toward the compass tower .     ssee hunterss now .  going away from uss to tower .         we   ll have to assume that the alert is for our entire group .  if derec and ariel have been identified  then we certainly were included .  if they have only been identified as intruders  we may not have been .     mandelbrot picked up wolruf and placed her on his back  where she clung by herself .      now what .     wolruf asked .      i must take one more risk     said mandelbrot .  he attempted to reach the terminal in the compass tower office .  no response came back of any kind .     puzzling     said mandelbrot .      what .         i think derec and ariel must have left the office even so  i would normally receive an acknowledgement of contact from the terminal and a request for a message .         perrhaps the offiss is different     said wolruf .     special arrangement forr averry .         that is probable     said mandelbrot .     in any case  they are not answering .  they have probably fled  which is fortunate .  we have no way to reach them through my comlink  however  and no way of knowing where they are .         follow hunterss     wolruf said softly .     iss only way .     mandelbrot nodded agreement .     as long as they do not become aware of us .       mandelbrot took wolruf to a slidewalk and they rode up to an overpass near the compass tower .  it gave them a view of the front of the compass tower and several of its many sides .  they could not watch every side  but this was a reasonable start .   before long  five hunter robots appeared from the front entrance of the compass tower .  two of them immediately headed for the tunnel stop that mandelbrot and wolruf had just used .  another pair mounted a slidewalk and took a path roughly at a right angle to the previous pair .  the last hunter remained on the stationary sidewalk  within the right angle formed by the routes of the two pairs .      good news     said mandelbrot .     they have not caught their quarry  nor are they confident of doing so immediately .         bad newss     hissed wolruf .     they know what direction to look in .  we musst    urry  or will lose them .         granted .     mandelbrot was already back on the moving slidewalk  keeping as many of the hunters in sight as long as he could .  the first pair was soon out of sight  down the tunnel stop .  the second pair was moving quickly on the slidewalk and was intermittently visible between various buildings .  mandelbrot and wolruf had now descended the overpass and were coming around a curve .  not too far ahead  the last hunter was just mounting the same segment of slidewalk .         ope    e doessn   t come thiss way     said wolruf .   the hunter did not .  it was going away from them and was clearly in a hurry .  instead of just standing  it was walking forward even as it rode and mandelbrot had to keep pace .      not too close     wolruf said .      nor can we afford to lose it .  further  i speculate that other hunters may have left the compass tower from exits out of our sight .  we must remain on the alert for others .  as we approach the humans  the hunters will all begin to converge .         then what do we do .     wolruf asked .      i don   t know .        chapter    the hunters    derec was hobbling painfully  slowed to a walk  as ariel finally dragged him to her destination .  it was a depot of the vacuum tube cargo transportation system .  he stopped when he saw it  pulling back on her arm .      wait a minute     he said .     they had humanoid robots staffing these depots .  they   ll report where we   ve gone .         not if no one asks .  come on .     she pulled harder than he had  and he allowed himself to follow .   as they came up on the loading dock  he saw that he was wrong .  a small function robot was alone here now  loading cargo without supervision .      what if it doesn   t let us get in .     he asked .      ignore it .     ariel pushed a small container aside  out of the reach of the function robot   s extended pincers .   the robot itself was a small ovoid shape with six tentacles ending in various gripping tools .  without a positronic brain  it would not interfere deliberately  or respond to the laws of robotics  either .  as it rolled forward after the small box  ariel climbed into the open  transparent capsule and reached out to help derec climb in .   reluctantly  he stepped over the side of the capsule  in extreme pain  and slowly stretched out inside it .      we have to go somewhere     he said .     this thing doesn   t have a console inside it .  it has to be programmed on the dock console  over there .     he pointed .   ariel hesitated while the function robot placed the small box inside the capsule between her feet and derec   s head .  she squatted down quickly and stretched out just as the function robot closed the trapdoor .      we   re going wherever this box is     she said .     the good thing is  we haven   t left any kind of trail .  that programming is completely independent of us .          yeah        his comment was cut short by the sudden acceleration of the capsule .  it moved forward on rollers to push through a door that gave under the pressure .  then they were in the vacuum tube itself  and the capsule really picked up speed .   as before  the momentum pushed both of them back against the rear of the capsule .  derec was too sore to brace himself with his arms  so his head and shoulder were jammed against the back surface .  they were rushing through darkness  blasted by the air that swept over them from unseen vents .   before  the flight from their pursuers had kept his adrenaline flowing  and he had experienced some remission of his stiffness .  now even the excitement of riding the vacuum tube was not enough to keep the symptoms from recurring .  his legs continued to throb painfully  and the shooting pains in his back seemed to settle in with the increasing stiffness he felt .   his one relief was that she was right .  they had not left a trail .   the tube curved upward .  he closed his eyes in anticipation of light  and brilliant sunlight flooded the capsule .  opening his eyes slowly so they could adjust  he took in the new scene around them .   this section of the transparent vacuum tube rose high above the ground and used the existing supports of various buildings to wind over the city .  at this altitude   and it was still rising   it would not interfere with earthbound priorities .  their capsule was shooting along the tube at high speed over what should have been a spectacular view .  he was in too much pain to enjoy it .   suddenly a thought struck him .      ariel     he said  with effort .     that entire staff at the key center has been reassigned .  but it was the key center that provided the vacuum to run this vacuum tube system .  that means the key center itself is still working .  what   s going on around here  anyway .      she didn   t answer .      ariel .     he called louder over the rushing air  but he knew what her silence meant .  with a sinking feeling  he turned his head to look at her  feeling more snappings in his neck .   she lay on her back  holding herself in position by pushing against the rear of the capsule with both hands .  her face  turned to the side  showed exhilaration and excitement as she gazed at the panorama of the city .  she did not seem to see him at all .   derec guessed that she was reliving their first wild ride in the vacuum tube  long ago .  it was a happier period in some ways  though they had felt burdens at the time .  at least he had been healthy  and she had been functionally so before her disease had really struck .   he turned his face away from her .  if she was reexperiencing those memories  she was probably more comfortable at the moment .  he could let her have that .  then  once they were safely out of this capsule  they could get their bearings .   the tube did not always go straight .  its various straightaways were broken with curves  loops  and changes in altitude .  these most often simply accommodated architecture that must have been already in place .  sometimes they brought the capsule to an intersection of tubes  where curves allowed it to change direction with minimal loss of speed .  occasionally the shifts in direction led by depot sidings that their capsule shot past .  every so often the tunnel dipped underground  and once it ran along the ceiling of the platform booth tunnel system for an extended period .   finally the capsule leveled off near the ground and decelerated sharply into a siding .  it stopped abruptly  sliding them both to the front of the tube with the small package .  derec lay panting on his back  looking up through the transparent capsule and tube at the impassive face of a hunter robot .     the slidewalk was the slowest of robot city   s powered transportation systems .  mandelbrot and wolruf followed the single hunter on it with increasing boldness .  the various hunters had obviously taken different assignments and they had no way of knowing what role this hunter actually had .      not too close     hissed wolruf softly over mandelbrot   s shoulder .         u will get itss attention  i tell    u .         i doubt it     said mandelbrot .     i now think it  as a hunter  maintains an awareness of everything around it .  it must have scanned us and rejected us as its quarry .         that iss sstupid     said wolruf .      eh .     mandelbrot said stiffly .      not    u .     im     she said patiently .     why would theirr order include derec and ariel but not us .         it does seem to be poor programming     said mandelbrot .     however  i do not judge it as stupidity .         then what .      up ahead  the hunter still advanced along the moving slidewalk .  it seemed to know where it was going .      derec often spoke of the single rnindedness of avery robots     mandelbrot explained .     their task orientation is narrow .  if the central computer or the supervisors  or even avery himself  learned of the presence of derec and ariel  perhaps the order to the hunters specifically named them and did not extend to anyone else .      wolruf shook her head at the hunter ahead of them .     iss stupid .  good for us  but still stupid .      ahead of them  the hunter moved on .  mandelbrot strode tirelessly after it .     derec and ariel were in no shape to protest as two hunter robots lifted them out of the capsule door .  the function robot on the dock waited until the humans were out before grabbing the small package that had been scheduled for the trip .  derec hurt allover and was simply too weak to struggle .   one hunter held him by the arm  and he actually leaned against the robot for support .  ariel was just now blinking at the hunter holding her .  he recognized that as one of the signs that she was coming back out of her latest memory fugue .      ariel     he said quietly .   she turned at the sound of his voice  then started at the sight of the hunters .     derec           they   ve got us     he muttered wearily .  he shook his head as the hunters turned and started for the nearest slidewalk  pulling them along in their inflexible grips .   derec still tried to think of a way out of this .  they were positronic robots and would respond to protests based on the laws .  from past experience  however  he also knew that they had been programmed to detain and arrest humans without harming them .  he could argue  but he didn   t know how to win .   besides  he was just too tired .  derec stumbled several times  forcing himself to keep up with the hunter .  finally the hunter lifted him bodily and carried him  not out of concern but for efficiency of travel .  the other hunter lifted ariel at the same time .   the hunters turned to ride the slidewalks and derec found himself facing ariel .      how did they get us .     she mouthed the words silently  with a quick glance at her captor   s head .      i don   t think they care if we talk     he said aloud .     i   m guessing now that some other hunters started by questioning the tunnel system computer .  that gave them the coordinates of the tunnel stop where we got off the platform booth  as i was afraid might happen .  from there they must have used heat sensors to track us along the street to the vacuum tube depot .         but the capsule in the vacuum tube goes so fast .  how did they get in front of us .         they must have found out which depot that package was going to and called ahead to have these guys waiting for us .         after that long ride     said ariel .     you make catching us sound so simple .         apparently it was     he said ruefully .      they   ve got us     she said  in a voice that cracked .     derec  look out .  they   re right behind us in the conduit        derec stared at her in a kind of resigned worry as she entered another displaced memory episode .  this one must be from the last time hunters had tracked them down and captured them  when they had tried to run away through the maze of underground conduits in the city .  the vacuum tube hadn   t worked any better .   he ached allover .  having the hunter carry him was almost a relief after the effort to escape .  ariel was squirming and protesting in the grasp of the other hunter  but she had no idea of where she was or what was happening now .  he closed his eyes and tried to relax .   the hunters only rode the slidewalks a short distance .  they were soon intercepted by a large function robot in the shape of a transport truck .  the hunters mounted the open back of the truck  still carrying derec and ariel .   the switch to the truck woke derec up  and he watched the city pass by as they rode .  ariel was now silent  her eyes closed .  the city streets seemed depopulated to him  at least compared to what he remembered from their previous visit to robot city .  maybe  he thought  the city had expanded faster than the robot population  causing the robots to spread themselves thinner over the whole planet .   he glanced at ariel periodically with growing concern .  her episodes seemed to occur more frequently under stress .  that might mean she was getting worse  not better .   the truck stopped several times to pick up other hunters from the slidewalks .  now that the search was over  they would probably be taken to a storage area or something .  they were all unusually tall for humanoid robots  with expansive torsos .  narrow benches molded from the truck bed itself provided seats for all of them along the side walls .  they sat with their knees drawn up and their waists level with the top of the walls  watching derec and ariel without a word spoken .   the truck slowed down as it approached one more lone hunter on a slidewalk .  two familiar shapes caught derec   s eye in the distance  and he stiffened .      ariel     he said quietly .   she didn   t answer .   he glanced over his shoulder at mandelbrot  who was standing on the stationary shoulder of the slidewalk just a few meters away .  wolruf had been with him a moment ago  but was now out of sight .  the hunter was climbing into the back of the truck  making a total of six .  derec reached over and shook ariel   s limp arm .      ariel .      she opened her eyes and looked at him  still partly disoriented .     what .  derec  where are we .      it was too late to get off the truck  even if the hunters could be distracted somehow .  the last hunter was on board and the truck started up .  then the engine began a high  irregular whine and the truck coasted back to a stop .   the hunters remained motionless for a short time .  then mandelbrot stepped forward .  derec was certain that they were all communicating through their comlinks .      what   s going on .     ariel whispered .      i   m not sure .      mandelbrot suddenly climbed onto the front of the truck and sat down .  derec had trouble seeing what he was doing  but a minute later the truck began to move forward  hunters and all .  apparently wolruf had sabotaged the function robot brain and mandelbrot had successfully volunteered to operate a manual override .  derec hoped wolruf was safe  wherever she was   most likely under the truck and hanging on precariously .   by now  ariel had also recognized mandelbrot .  she and derec exchanged puzzled glances  still in the firm grip of the silent hunters who had taken custody of them .  they watched the hunters carefully as the truck picked up speed and rolled along  but the robots seemed perfectly content with the situation .   soon mandelbrot had the truck up to a considerable velocity  much faster than the truck had driven itself .  the hunters gripped the sides of the truck to stabilize themselves .  derec did not feel any loosening of the hold on him  however .   mandelbrot was going to try something to free them .  derec tensed himself in anticipation .   he was not too surprised when the truck suddenly took a sharp left that sent everyone in the back sprawling .  with a hard  painful yank  he wrenched himself free of the hunter holding him  knelt on the bed of the truck  and got leverage under the robot .  he gave a heave and flipped the hunter clean out of the truck .   next to him  ariel had almost pulled free of the hunter holding her before it regained its balance .  all of them leaped to their feet to restore order  but derec shouldered another hunter into the one grappling with ariel .  the truck took another sharp turn and all the hunters stumbled again .  derec watched for anyone to become overbalanced toward the edge of the truck bed and managed to shove another one out of the truck .   their massive size and great strength had become a liability on the unstable truck bed .   the vehicle came to a sudden  screeching  careening halt that threw everyone in the back forward .  mandelbrot  who had been braced for the stop  leaped into the back of the truck and hoisted out another hunter who was still in the act of standing up again .  mandelbrot rolled one more out on top of that one and then pulled derec free of the one grappling with him .   mandelbrot   s great advantage became clear to derec .  the first priority programmed into the hunters was to find and detain the two humans .  the first law   s demand that they not harm the humans overrode the third law   s requirement that they protect themselves .   while the remaining two hunters grappled with derec and ariel  mandelbrot was able to get the right leverage under each hunter and lift them out of the truck .      hang on     mandelbrot called out in a remarkably calm voice .  he jumped back to the manual console in the front and drove off .   derec fell back on the bed of the truck  gritting his teeth in pain but relieved that they had escaped .  ariel scooted over to him and sat down  her hair blowing in the breeze .   she smiled faintly .     that was close .  how did they           look out .     he shouted .   behind her  over her head  one of the hunters was climbing up the side of the moving truck  where it had gotten hold before the truck had started again .  derec tried to stand  but the pain in his legs was too great .  his feet slipped and he fell back again .   the hunter was just climbing over the side when it suddenly vanished from sight and hit the street with a crash .   then wolruf   s head appeared over the side with her caninoid grin .     hunterr poorly balanced     she said  climbing over the side .   ariel jumped up to help her over .   mandelbrot turned another corner on the city street  then another .  after speeding quickly down another block and taking one more turn  he came to a stop  a smooth one this time .      what is it .     derec called  but he was too uncomfortable to get up .     ariel  find out what   s going on .         mandelbrot .     ariel said  standing .   derec could hear both their voices .      this vehicle has a comlink that must be fully disconnected     said mandelbrot .     wolruf successfully disconnected the function robot brain from the truck controls  but it still works  and the central computer may be able to locate our position through it .  however  as soon as i finish disabling it .  .  .  .  there .      derec heard a heavy object hit the pavement alongside the truck .      the truck is now comlink invisible     said mandelbrot .     we cannot be tracked through it .  we are free to move about .     he sat down at the console again and drove off .   derec let out a long sigh .     chapter    hideout    derec stared up at the bright sky overhead as the truck moved along .  now that the danger of the hunters was over for the moment  mandelbrot proved to be an efficient driver .  he took a number of turns  derec guessed to complicate the reports of robots who witnessed their passing .   the hunters would not have taken long to resume their single minded pursuit .  however  they would now have to follow the truck   s path .  they had no way of learning its destination and instructing others to lie in wait for it .   as far as derec knew  mandelbrot didn   t even have a destination .   ariel and wolruf sat quietly with derec  all three slumped so that they were not visible from the street  though any robot observing from the buildings above had a clear view of them if it looked .      that seemed awfully easy     said ariel .     i don   t understand how those big  strong robots with their positronic brains could let themselves be thrown overboard like that .      derec laughed in spite of the pain it caused in his ribs .     surprise  mostly .  robot drivers are always very careful .  those avery robots have never experienced a human driver speeding along recklessly .         but mandelbrot   s a robot .         yeah  but he was in the rescue business .  he must have weighed the relative danger to us from an accident against the certainty of danger if we were taken to avery  and decided to throw them off balance   literally .         that sounds like a touch of creative thinking  too     said ariel .     lucius  the cracked cheeks  all the other robots who were showing signs of    contagious    robot creativity .  poor lucius .  i wonder where the rest of them are now .         come back to prresent     said wolruf .     hunterrs won   t give up .  robotss learn fasst .  won   t fool them the same way again .      eventually  derec closed his eyes against the light .  they were safe for the moment and could relax .  he dozed  still vaguely aware of the stiffness in his legs and back and of the rhythmic motion of the truck .   he woke up in subdued light to the wonderful sensation of ariel massaging his back .  they were on a clean floor inside a large building .  the truck was nearby  also inside .  a large door  big enough to accommodate the truck  was in the front wall of the building .      what is this place .     he asked softly .      you   re awake .  how are you feeling .     she paused to ruffle his hair affectionately .      a little better .  sort of .  where are we .         i   m not sure .  mandelbrot can tell you .     she turned .     mandelbrot  he   s awake .         greetings  derec .     mandelbrot walked over and looked down at him .     we are temporarily safe .  the hunters will have to locate us by questioning witnesses along our route  and they became quite sparse after a time .  i used an evasive pattern that included doubling back and crisscrossing at random .  i cannot calculate how long we have .      wolruf joined them and sat down quietly .      you   re quite a truck driver  mandelbrot .     derec forced a smile .     thanks .         i had the vehicle under control at all times     said the robot .     the first law            i never doubted it  mandelbrot .  time to reconnoiter  though  i suppose .  what do we do now .     he tried to raise up on one elbow  but winced and lay down again .      i will bring you up to date     said mandelbrot .     this building houses fully automated  non positronic equipment that cannot identify and report us to the central computer .         you mean something actually happens here .  i thought it was a warehouse or something .     derec looked around at all the empty space .     avery robots don   t waste facilities like this .         the only functioning equipment is in the far comer from here .  it sends vibrations into the ground that report the firmness of pavement and building foundations within a certain radius .          that   s all .     derec laughed .     all this space for a systems maintenance sensor .      ariel shrugged .     you can see for yourself .  nothing else is here .  four walls  a ceiling  and a floor .         it follows some information wolruf and i were able to gather before the hunters prevented us from returning to the compass tower     said mandelbrot .     the robots here are under migration programming of some kind .         yes .  did you find out what that is .         not precisely     said mandelbrot .     it has caused a general instruction  however  to reduce the staffs allover robot city to skeleton level .         that   s something     said derec thoughtfully .      as an example     said mandelbrot     the size of this building implies equipment no longer present .  i surmise that the original functions taking place here were either discontinued or improved technologically to the point where humanoid robots became unnecessary .  at that point  the staff followed its migration programming and departed .       derec nodded .     without eliminating or modifying the building for greater efficiency .  this migration must have an extremely high priority .         and he told me that no general alert has gone out for us  as you guessed     said ariel .     that   s still the case  isn   t it .         yes     said mandelbrot .      something big has been going on here for a long time     said derec .     think about it .  this must be the robot city that dr .  avery actually envisioned .         what do you mean .     ariel asked .      when we first arrived  that wild shapechanging dominated the city .  the supervisors befriended us because they needed help and they wanted to serve humans .      ariel nodded cautiously .     and solve the mystery of that murder .  we never did figure out who the victim was .     she closed her eyes and shuddered .     who just happened to look exactly like you .      derec chose not to discuss that .  he was afraid of sending her into another displaced memory episode .     then  while the key center was in operation  the city was in a lull while a huge number of keys were being duplicated and stored .  we were treated with a kind of benign neglect  wouldn   t you say .         i guess you could call it that     she said .     but they were very cooperative in finding jeff leong  the cyborg .      he nodded .     temporarily a cyborg .  the laws of robotics required that .  now  though  everything seems to be changed .  and it happened after we left for earth and dr .  avery remained here .         so every robot here has been reprogrammed .         i think so .  the city has that same sense of obsessive purpose that i first saw on that asteroid .  and i haven   t seen any sign of the robot creativity we saw before we left here .      ariel tensed .     oh  no .  you mean you think it was programmed out of them .         it looks that way to me .  right now  mandelbrot may be the only robot on the planet who can think independently enough to do things like rescue us by driving crazily .         you said the local robots are now acting like the ones on the asteroid .  you mean the asteroid you were on right after you first woke up with amnesia  before we met .         yeah .         i agree     said mandelbrot .     the narrow focus of the hunters supports your conclusion  though now wolruf and i must have been added to the list of quarry .         we need a new plan of action     said derec .     and i   m getting sicker all the time .         at the moment  i suggest that you three remain here     said mandelbrot .     i must find a new food source for you .  also  while the hunters must now be looking for me also  i still blend the most with the native population .            u    ave no wherr to go     said wolruf .      good point     said derec .     maybe you can get a lead on that from the central computer without giving yourself away .  go ahead .         i can try .  and i still have the use of the truck .     mandelbrot walked to the far corner of the building and pushed a button to open the big door that led to the street .      does the equipment here include a terminal .     derec asked .      no .  i will have no way to contact you .     mandelbrot mounted the front of the truck and looked down at them .     we have been out of sight here for a while .  if the hunters have widened the radius of their search by this time  i may be able to avoid them .          good luck  mandelbrot     said ariel .     don   t take too many chances  all right .        mandelbrot drove out into the sunlight and turned onto the street .  someone closed the big door behind him .  as he drove  he kept watch for hunters  aware that they would recognize a function truck being driven by a humanoid robot before they would recognize him in particular .  he accessed the central computer .      transmit a topographical map of this planet with land use identified     he said .      what is your identity and your duty task .     the central computer asked .   he broke the link .  the central computer had not always required that information during every communication  but now it was asking him every time .  perhaps it was part of the new security system .  he accessed again  just to make sure .      give me the location of agricultural developments on this planet     he said .      what is your identity and your duty task .      he broke contact again .  identifying himself was too risky  and doing so still might not get him the information .  he would have to think of something else .   in the meantime  he drove .  he kept watch for any break in the grid of city streets and buildings that might indicate a change of land use  but that would only work if avery was growing food in the open .  .  . and doing it nearby .  mandelbrot also turned his attention to smells  in the hope of detecting chemical processing of edible substances .   far above the planet  a small spacecraft was just entering the atmosphere  still too distant to be visible from the ground .  it carried only one passenger .   his name was jeff leong  and he had come to repay a debt of gratitude .   jeff was entering the atmosphere of robot city in a hayashi smith  which was a small  discontinued model with facilities for ten people .  it bore the exotic name of minneapolis .  the ship computer was doing the flying .  jeff had managed to rent it with his father   s credit after persuading him that no one else could be trusted with the task of making this trip .      status report     jeff said to the computer  watching the screen that showed him white clouds ahead and the glittering pattern far below of urban development .      excellent     said the computer .     systems are operating efficiently and weather is optimal .  select landing site .         i don   t know where to land yet     said jeff .     i never really knew the geography of this place .  uh  scan for a big pyramid with a flat top  okay .  and i mean a .  big pyramid .         scanning .  this may require a prolonged period in very low orbit  depending on cloud cover .         whatever it takes .     jeff leaned back and relaxed .   this was much better than his last arrival on this planet .  that had been an emergency crash landing that had killed everyone else on board .  he shook his head to avoid the memories of that frantic descent .      computer     he said aloud .     while you   re scanning  keep watch for humans .  i   m looking for a couple of them .  and as far as i know  they   re the only humans here .         scanning modified .      the ship computer was not fully positronic  but it was efficient enough to accept jeff   s orders and translate them into ship controls .   he hoped that finding derec  ariel  mandelbrot  and wolruf would not take too long .  when he had left the planet in the only functioning spacecraft it had   a modified lifepod that supported only one passenger   he had promised to send help back if he could .  the craft had taken him to a space lane  and had remained there  sending out a distress signal while keeping him alive .   the ship that had rescued him had been jumping from star to star back to aurora  and he had yet to reach nexon  where he hoped to start college .  this rescue mission was an important matter of pride to him  since derec and ariel and the robot medical team had saved his life .  then derec and ariel had sent him away when each of them would have liked to use that ship personally .   he sighed and watched the screen .  he expected most of the problem to be in locating them .  the minneapolis was outfitted to take them all back to aurora together .      pyramid located     said the computer .     close up on screen .  please identify .      on the viewscreen  the compass tower shone in the sunlight .  the angle was from above  of course  and a little to one side .  at this distance  it looked like a flawless model on a design display .      that   s it     said jeff excitedly  sitting forward to look .     can you land near it somewhere without smashing up anything .         scanning for a low risk landing site in the area     said the computer .     to avoid all chance of damage to manufactured and constructed property  this craft requires more landing space than the area has so far offered .          show me the area as you scan it     said jeff .     just try to land as close as you can .         displaying .      jeff watched the screen closely as the view pulled back to a greater height and began to move quickly across the landscape .  at first he tried to recognize other places  such as a city plaza he remembered and the distinctive bronze dome of the key center .  he couldn   t find them .  then  as the camera continued to scan  he realized that they were covering a lot of area very quickly .      look for an open grassy region     he said .     it was just outside the city .  i   m sure it wasn   t more than a few kilometers from that tower .         perimeter of urban development not located .  scanning continues .      he watched as block after block of city passed beneath them .  the robots had continued building  much faster than he had ever imagined .  he couldn   t afford to land on the other side of the planet .  derec and ariel had lived close to the tower .      listen     he said .     most of this population is robots .  if they   re damaged  they can be repaired .  just don   t hit the buildings     cause we won   t survive  either .     he grinned at his own humor .      clarify .         we have to land around here somewhere .  try to avoid the robots  but give us priority .  watch out for humans  other than that  find a place in the city near that tower where we can land .  a park  a plaza  a big intersection .  something like that .         scanning modified for moderate risk landing site .  site selected .         good     said jeff .     that was quick .  see if you can reach the city   s central computer .  give it fair warning of our landing site so it can tell everybody to get out of the way .         link established .  warning sent and acknowledged .  current speed requires wide turn . prepare for landing in approximately twelve minutes .      jeff grinned .     good job .      eleven and a half minutes later  jeff stared in tense fascination at the screen as the small ship sliced through the atmosphere at a low angle and came shooting straight toward the skyline .  the minneapolis was versatile enough to act as both a shuttle and starship  which was why he had chosen it .  he trusted the computer  which would not allow him to come to harm if it could help it  despite being non positronic .  .  . and yet even the computer couldn   t prevent every malfunction .  after all  he had just barely survived one crash here .   he was gripping the sides of the chair and sweating freely as the screen showed a broad boulevard stretching straight ahead .  the ship was going to land along the pavement   did this thing have wheels .  in a panic  he couldn   t remember .   it must have  the computer wasn   t stupid .   the streetfronts of a thousand buildings shot by in a blur  first below and then on both sides .  the ship touched down and streaked along the empty street  suddenly decelerating sharply .   everyone was out of the way  the city   s central computer had done its part .  the boulevard was as flat and straight as only a city of robots would construct .  the ship came to a halt .     chapter    welcome back    jeff lay back in the chair panting heavily  with sweat running down his face and arms .  that was a lot more frightening than he had expected .  .  . but a lot better than last time .  the ship computer had been flawless .   next time  he   d shut off that stupid viewscreen .  who needed to see that  anyhow .      landing completed     said the computer cheerfully .      shut up     jeff muttered .   he didn   t want to stay in this can .  shakily  he got up and moved to the door .     exit access     he instructed .   the door unlatched and opened .  a flexible ladder extended from it .  jeff held the sides of the ladder firmly  turned  and climbed down .   on the street  he drew in a deep breath and looked around .  it was robot city  all right  it had the slidewalks  the tunnel stops  the clean  organized buildings and streets .  on the other hand  it was totally unfamiliar .   a couple of humanoid robots were just now coming into view ahead .  the central computer would have removed the alert  of course .  he turned and looked behind him .  a few more robots appeared  riding the slidewalks along the side of the boulevard .   the nearest robot approaching him was remarkably tall and full chested .      excuse me     said jeff .     i   m in need of assistance .      the hunter robot took him firmly by the upper arm .      hey .  wait a minute .  what are you doing .     he pulled back  but the robot didn   t let go .      i am detaining you     said the hunter .     you are in custody and will remain so at least until you have been positively identified .     it turned and began to walk .      i   m jeff leong .  that   s no mystery .     he hurried alongside  walking awkwardly  almost sideways .      i am programmed to locate and detain two humans among the four intruders known to be in robot city .  you will not be harmed .  however  you must come with me .         and if i don   t .     he demanded  looking up at the robot   s expressionless face .      you will come willingly or unwillingly .  you will not be harmed .  i prefer that you not resist .      the robot continued walking  dragging jeff along with it .  they stepped onto a slidewalk and went on walking .      who are you looking for .         the two humans named derec and ariel     said the hunter    also an alien robot named mandelbrot and a small living creature of undetermined type .         hold it .  you think i   m derec .  is that it .     jeff tried to pull back again  to no avail .      i am instructed to take you into custody pending identification     said the hunter impassively .      it   s not necessary .     jeff managed to turn enough so he could walk straight ahead  at least .     look  other robots know me .  contact the medical team .  what was their name .  some kind of hospital .  a human medical center  or something like that .  they can tell you who i am .  call them through the central computer .      the robot did not respond .      are you calling them .      it still did not respond .      not programmed for that  i suppose     said jeff .  he sighed .     welcome back to robot city  jeff .      they walked along the moving slidewalk for quite some time .  jeff   s belongings were still stashed in the ship  of course  he had intended to grab his personal luggage after getting directions to derec and ariel .  resigned to a long and probably frustrating interrogation by more robots  he marched along in step .   a certain amount of foot traffic and vehicular traffic went by  but jeff was sure that it was less than he remembered from his previous visit .  somewhat belatedly  he was recalling just how many unexplained oddities this city had had .  then  lost in thought  he was not paying particular attention to the details around him until he heard a screech of tires coming up right behind him .   jeff flinched and whirled around .  the hunter holding him turned its head but did not break stride .   a humanoid robot was just leaping out of the cab of a large  halted vehicle .      mandelbrot .     jeff shouted .     tell this robot who i am  will you .  it thinks        he was interrupted as the hunter spun completely around  at the same time yanking him to the side away from mandelbrot .  the robot   s hold on him did not loosen even for a moment .      you are harming the human     said mandelbrot to the hunter  in a remarkably unemotional voice .  he stepped onto the slidewalk and approached them .      i am not harming him .     the hunter   s voice was equally calm .  it stood still .   jeff understood that mandelbrot had spoken aloud so that he could hear .  apparently mandelbrot intended to rescue him   and that implied changes here in the city that were completely beyond jeff   s expectations .   jeff let out as loud and intense a scream as he could and dropped to his knees on the slidewalk  which was still moving .   the hunter still had him by the arm .      release him .     mandelbrot shouted  striding forward and lifting jeff in his own arms .     hunter  you are inefficient .  you are violating the first law .         you .  .  . are .  .  . mandelbrot .  .  . the fugitive robot     the hunter said slowly .  it was quivering slightly  its functioning impaired by the uncertainty that it might have harmed jeff .  yet it had not let go .   mandelbrot gripped the wrist of the hunter and gently held jeff   s captive arm  as well .     release him     he ordered again .     i will take him into custody .           you .  .  . are .  .  . not .  .  . fooling me     said the hunter .     step .  .  . away .      jeff could see that .  the hunter knew that mandelbrot himself was a fugitive from the central computer  so his words were all suspect .  however  the combination of his accusation and jeff   s play acting was enough to raise a reasonable doubt in its mind  and the force of the first law was so great that it was now hesitant to act .      mandelbrot  carry me     he pleaded  in as anxious a voice as he could muster .     he   s hurt me .      the hunter was in trouble  but not fully convinced .  mandelbrot did manage to force its grip open  however  and remove jeff   s arm .  then he picked up jeff around the waist  jumped off the slidewalk onto the stationary shoulder  and ran for his truck .      stop .     the hunter moved to action the moment jeff was free  though it was still not at full capacity .   jeff was facing backward as mandelbrot ran with him  and could see the hunter gradually entering a slow run after them .  the hunter   s instructions were still in effect .      it   s already sent out a call for other hunters     said mandelbrot  still running .     you will get an explanation at a safer time .  for now  when i hoist you into the back of this vehicle  lie down and hang on .  you will be safest that way .         uh   okay       jeff complied as mandelbrot jumped into the cab and drove off fast .     derec was awakened from a deep sleep by the sound of the big door opening .  light hit his closed eyelids and he reluctantly opened them with a squint .  so mandelbrot was back .  he took in a deep breath  hoping to wake up completely and find food being offered .   the vehicle entered the building and then ariel was already closing the door again .   mandelbrot turned in the cab and helped another figure in the back to his feet .      say .     ariel cried excitedly .     is that .  .  . that   s jeff .      amazed  derec forced himself up on one elbow .  his back and shoulders ached painfully .      hi  gang     said jeff .  he stood looking around at them all from the back of the truck .  then mandelbrot lifted him down .      jeff     said derec .  he grimaced as he sat up all the way .     what the .  .  . what are you doing here .      he gave an embarrassed shrug .     i came to get you .  to rescue you from robot city .      derec felt his jaw drop open .   ariel clapped both hands over her mouth .      ooooo     said wolruf .      oh  no .     derec rubbed his forehead  stifling an embarrassed smile of his own .      what is it .     jeff asked  looking at them all one after another .     what   s wrong .  don   t you want to leave any more .         jeff .     ariel went over to him and gave him a hug .     you actually came back for us .  that   s wonderful .  please don   t misunderstand .  it really means a great deal .  thank you .      jeff hugged her back lightly  clearly uncomfortable .     i don   t get it .  what   s going on .         jeff     said derec .     we can get off the planet now if we want .  in fact  we can travel pretty far   as far as earth and back .  we .  .  . i .  .  . have a different problem now .         you can travel now .         i   m afraid so     said derec .   jeff looked at ariel  who shrugged .  then he gave a short laugh  shaking his head .     mind if i sit down .     he collapsed on the floor where he was  not too far from derec .      i thought you were going to send someone else back     said derec .     i had no idea you   d come yourself .         how did you find it .     mandelbrot asked .     if you remember  i had no navigational data to give you .         i had a computer cross reference the aurora nexus route with what little i knew .  it worked .     jeff ran a hand through his black hair  staring at the floor .     i   m a little shocked .  but i   m glad you haven   t been stranded .         how did you get here .     derec asked .      i was picked up by a ship headed back to aurora .  once i got back there  i put together the location where i was picked up  the length of time it took me to get there  and the nearest stars .  a computer gave me the likely directions  but i had to try several before i got the right one .     he shrugged .     the hard part was getting my father to spring for the rental of a ship .  and now i have to tell him it was unnecessary .         well .  .  .  .     ariel started .   jeff turned to look at her .      we could still use some help     she said .     we have to find dr .  avery before his robots get ahold of us .         avery .  did you say dr .  avery .     jeff sat up straight .      you   ve heard of him .     ariel said  dropping down to sit next to him .     where .         mandelbrot  wolruf     said derec .     come closer and follow this .  it may turn out to be important .         well     said jeff .     i tried to explain to my father what i needed the ship for and he reminded me that this weird guy named avery once had some wild plans about a planet with a planned community sort of like this one .         wait a minute .  this was supposed to be a secret     said ariel .     my mother funded it .  how does your father know about it .         he doesn   t  really .  it   s just that dr .  avery gave away some hints when we met him .         met him .     derec and ariel cried in unison .      look  i don   t remember it very well           we   ve all had a few memory problems     ariel said with annoyance .     come on  this is important to us .         when .     derec demanded .     recently .  back on aurora .         no  no  no .  a long time ago .  a couple of years ago .      derec settled back .     what happened .         he was still planning then  i bet     said ariel .     considering how fast these robots work  that   s plenty of time .         he came to consult with my father     said jeff .     my father is a professor of spacer cultural studies .  his specialty is tracing the development and evolution of the various spacer communities .         what does that mean .     derec asked .      they   re comparative studies     said jeff .     what planets have in common and what they don   t .  how they   re organized .  how their values differ .  stuff like that .         your father must be an expert in that  huh .     ariel said .     that   s why avery sought him out .         i guess .     jeff shrugged .     anyhow  a couple of years ago  this dr .  avery asked to consult informally with him .  my father was real impressed with the guy .  he said avery was an eccentric genius  and made me tag along to meet him .         what did he want to talk about .     derec asked .      he was asking about social matrices     said jeff .     in particular  how my father would set up a utopia  if he could .         utopia .     derec exchanged a glance with ariel .     that   s how he viewed this experiment  isn   t it .      she nodded .     jeff .  we can use any clues you have to avery   s personality .         i can tell you what i remember .  why do you have to find him  anyway .         he implanted a kind of .  .  . well  sort of a disease in derec that only he can remove .  we have to figure out where he is on the planet .  can you tell us what he   s like .         i hate to tell you this  but i don   t remember him very well .     jeff looked at all of them apologetically .     i wasn   t that old  and i didn   t really care about seeing him .  i went because my father wanted me to meet this genius .  he said it would be a good experience for me .  the truth is  i didn   t get much out of it .         anything     said ariel .     just start talking .  maybe things will come back to you .         well .  .  . my father had a very high regard for him .  more than usual .  i mean  he   s surrounded by very capable people all the time .  they were pretty friendly for a while .         then what .     derec asked .     dr .  avery left aurora  i suppose .      jeff shook his head .     not right away .  that is  he came and went for a time .  my father had some sort of falling out with him  i think  but i never bothered to ask about it .         are you sure you don   t know why they stopped being friends .     ariel asked .     it might turn out to be important .         i think he was pretty egotistical .  i got that impression right away .  and he was definitely eccentric .  i guess my father just got tired of listening to him .         that fits my mother   s description     ariel said to derec .     can we use that somehow .         i don   t know .  we   ve all found dealing with him unpleasant .     derec shrugged .     mandelbrot  you can correlate data the best of us all .  what do you think .         we have information about robot city     said mandelbrot .     and we have information about dr .  avery .  however  we don   t have the necessary correlations to narrow the scope of his whereabouts .         what about our staying here .     derec asked .     are we safer staying here longer  or should we move .         i only have a guess     said the robot .     i again used an evasive route in returning here  but the fact that the truck vanished from sight in the same general area as last time will narrow the hunters    scope considerably .  on the other hand  traveling somewhere else clearly provides more data to the central computer of our whereabouts every time we are witnessed by any robot in the city .      derec sighed and rubbed the stiff muscles in his legs .     thank you for the lecture .  what   s your conclusion .         we are better off remaining here for the remainder of the day .  at nightfall  travel will be safer than staying here .  these are both calculated risks  not cert           i understand     said derec .  he gritted his teeth and lay down again .  normally he wanted to know how mandelbrot formed his judgments because the robot   s consistent logic could be informative .  now he was just too tired and in too much pain for that .      maybe we should all rest     said ariel .     if we   re going to go somewhere else after dark .         good idea     said wolruf .   derec closed his eyes .  he heard wolruf pad away  presumably to relax in a spot of her choosing .      i was planning to go out again to seek a food source     said mandelbrot     but i now consider it too risky .  all of you can remain healthy through the day without sustenance .  when we travel at night  we may find food in some way .  is this acceptable .         sure     derec muttered  without opening his eyes .      all right     said ariel .      you know     jeff said slowly     i have plenty of supplies on board the minneapolis .  i didn   t realize food was a problem for you .  the only question is how to get it .         i doubt it   s a simple question     said ariel .     it must be well guarded by now .      they could have dismantled it by now  derec thought  but he was too exhausted to speak up .      perhaps we can look into this     said mandelbrot .     though the risk is very high .         how about a review of the whole situation .     jeff asked .     i never did know the origin of this place .  would you mind giving me the entire story .  we apparently have the rest of the day .         you know  jeff     said ariel     you really don   t have to get mixed up in this .  if we can get you back on board your ship  you can get out of here again .         i   m ready to help .         i don   t think we can ask you to do that .     she lowered her voice .     you haven   t heard what dr .  avery has done to derec .         i   m staying     jeff said firmly .     i came here to repay a debt .  since you don   t need help getting off the planet anymore  i   ll repay it with help you do need .         maybe you should know what you   re getting involved in before you decide .         go ahead     said jeff .     but i   m staying  period .      derec drifted off to sleep to the sound of ariel   s voice recounting their story .     chapter     the minneapolis    he awoke again  much later  as strong arms slid under him and lifted him .     what   s happening .     his throat was rough and dry .  he cleared it  opening his eyes .   mandelbrot was carrying him to the back of the truck .      time to go  huh .     derec smiled weakly as he settled onto the truck bed .      we   re all here     said ariel  next to him .     mandelbrot   s in charge so far .  ready .         sure .  where are we going .         we   re going after my supplies     said jeff .      what .     derec struggled to sit up  looking at them in surprise .     that   s a perfect trap .  what   s the plan .         we don   t have one yet     said ariel .     mandelbrot couldn   t get any information about the ship through the central computer without giving himself away  so we don   t know what kind of security it has around it or anything .         i don   t like this at all     said derec .  he turned to mandelbrot  who was pushing the button on the wall to open the door .     mandelbrot  this sounds like walking into a trap to me .  have you considered that .         yes .     mandelbrot hurried back to the cab of the truck as the door began to open into a robot city twilight .      you have .  then why are we doing this .         the plan is flexible .  all i intend to do now is take an evasive route back to the landing site for observation .  we will not take unnecessary risks .         well .  .  . okay .     derec sat back against the wall of the truck .  if he could just feel better  he could be more persuasive .  or help make plans .  it was just so hard to concentrate .   the truck rolled out onto the empty street .  the robot population seemed to be getting thinner all the time .  that was good for his purposes  derec thought  but the mysteries remained .  what was the purpose of the robot assembly points .  .  . and where was dr .  avery .   robot city had street lights  but they were not as bright or as frequent as in other cities .  the robots    superior vision made more light unnecessary .  the entire planet was a city of technological marvels and striking robotic capabilities .      what did avery get from your father .     derec asked suddenly .     he   s called professor leong .  what have we seen in this city that professor leong provided .         i haven   t seen anything like that     said jeff .     he was talking about culture .  i   ve seen science  technology  and architecture taken to new heights  but that   s all .         the play     said ariel .     we had the robots do hamlet here after you left .  that is  derec chose it but the robots were ready for it .  some of them were involved with robot creativity .         the arts     said derec .     of course .  and maybe a system of ethics beyond the laws of robotics           the laws of humanics they used to talk about     ariel said excitedly .     some of this crazy stuff is starting to make sense now .         instead of being just oddities .     derec nodded .     robots are too logical to leave a lot of loose ends .         rrobot creativity     said wolruf .     came at ssame time dr .  averry returrned to robot city .         that   s right     said ariel .     and now  after he   s apparently reprogrammed all the robots  there   s no sign of it .         the creative impulse caused too much trouble     said derec .     but originally  he programmed some artistic abilities into his robots .  jeff  does this fit what you remember .         that   s along the right line  yeah .  and i remember now that he had one interest in particular .         really .  what was it .         cultures that could endure .         endure     said derec .     you mean like republics and empires and so on .  dynasties and stuff like that .      jeff shook his head in the darkening light as the truck slowed for an intersection  then speeded up again .     cultures .  they generally outlast politics .  they evolve in response to politics and economics and technology  but they have lives of their own .  my father called them the sum of all the disciplines .      the truck came to a halt  drawing their attention .  derec looked out and saw that they had stopped on an overpass .  the bright twinkling lights of robot city stretched in all directions  implying the shapes of buildings and streets by their patterns in swooping curves and mighty blocks and spiraling towers and a fully reliable grid on the ground .      down there     said jeff .     that   s the boulevard i landed on  running parallel with this one .  see between those buildings there .         i see it     said ariel .     just barely .         i dare not take the truck any closer     said mandelbrot  standing in the open cab to face them .     i can approach it on foot and survey the security measures .         hold it     said derec .     if they left it just sitting there  it has to be a trap .  mandelbrot  that means they   re ready for you  too  in some way .  they wouldn   t leave bait like that just waiting to be flown away .         too bad we can   t move it     said jeff .      wait a minute     said ariel .     maybe mandelbrot can communicate with its computer .         i doubt they left the ship operational     said derec .     that doesn   t make sense  either .         unless they   re overconfident of their security measures     said jeff .     mandelbrot  if you want to try  it   s a ten passenger hayashi smith named minneapolis .  it   s non positronic but it   s smart enough to handle the flight instructions i give it  which are pretty general .  that   s about all i know about it .         i am currently trying standard frequencies     said mandelbrot .     the customary range is small .  no response .         good     said derec .          what .     ariel demanded .      maybe we have a chance after all .         what do you mean .     jeff asked .      if we   re lucky  the only way they disabled the ship was to disconnect the computer .  mandelbrot  your comlink can send out the same impulses it did .         i might be able to start the ship     said mandelbrot     but i can   t fly it from here .  the boulevard is too narrow and i   m not familiar with the ship itself .          i can   t    elp    u  eitherr     said wolruf apologetically .     can navigate  but giving orrders to mandelbrot takess too long for shuttle takeoff .  and    ave no line of sight from herr  eitherr .         we don   t have to fly it     said derec .     the boulevard goes straight .  all we have to do is get it away from their security long enough to get inside and grab the supplies .         the robots would know that     said jeff .     don   t you think they must have accounted for that somehow .         maybe     said derec .     but remember how logical this place is .  the hunters don   t have much experience with devious thinking .         they were programmed by a paranoid     ariel pointed out .      it   s worth a shot     said derec .      i believe i can make it go straight     said mandelbrot .     i suggest  however  that we first take the truck to the rendezvous site so that we are waiting when it arrives .  it will not take the hunters long to catch up with it .      derec   s heart was pounding with excitement  and the adrenaline seemed to be loosening up his muscles .  he grinned .     let   s go .      mandelbrot drove the truck a much longer time than derec had expected  but the distance he covered made sense .  the fifteen kilometers the ship would travel down the boulevard to reach them was virtually nothing to it  even in its shuttle mode .  mandelbrot pulled the truck into a side street and brought it close to the intersection with the boulevard .  then he stopped the truck and sat motionless .      i guess he   s concentrating     said ariel .      they ought to rename this street minneapolis boulevard     said jeff  grinning .     if this works  anyhow .      derec was tingling with excitement .     wolruf  when you and mandelbrot are both inside  you can fly this thing  right .         rright .     a slash of street light cut across her face as she gave a nod and a caninoid grin .      here it comes     said jeff .   a high  even whine was coming toward them in the distance  growing louder as derec listened .  they sat motionless  unable to see around the corner of the nearest building .  only mandelbrot was visible  and derec watched his dark  motionless profile as the sound grew louder .   soon the sound was almost deafening .  the ship pulled into view in the intersection  seeming to loom over them in the garish light and deep shadows  both huge and wonderful .  then it stopped .   mandelbrot stood up and turned to help derec out of the truck .  the others took it as a signal to climb out themselves and run for the waiting ship .   mandelbrot picked up derec under one arm to save time by carrying him .  at the robot   s command  the door opened ahead of them and the ladder slid to the ground .  derec looked down the boulevard as mandelbrot ran with him .   a crowd of robots was rushing toward them in the far distance .  hunters were running along the moving slidewalks .  function robots of various sizes and shapes were rolling and driving down the boulevard .  they constituted the surprise element of the trap  now neutralized by the stealing of the bait .   the function robots did not have positronic brains to think with  but they could follow orders from the hunters to move in paths that would block or even ram the ship and the truck .  the fastest of them were coming on rapidly .   mandelbrot set derec down on the highest rung of the ladder that he could reach .  derec   s foot slipped on the ladder .  as he clung to the ladder with another nervous glance at the oncoming rush  he felt mandelbrot take him under his arms and lift him .  mandelbrot climbed the ladder  holding derec up until he could deposit him inside the ship .  jeff and ariel pulled him to one side as the robot entered last .   wolruf was already in the navigator   s seat looking at the override controls .  the ladder retracted and the door closed as mandelbrot took the pilot   s seat .      straight on down boulevarrd     said wolruf .     space is enough forr takeoff .       mandelbrot was reaching for the manual controls .     these will be safer than risking comlink control .  everyone  please strap in .         we   re all strapped into seats     said jeff .     i   m sure glad you can do this .  all i can do is tell the computer what i want .      just as the ship began to move forward  a heavy thump struck the rear of the ship .  the impact was faint but clearly noticeable .      damage insignificant     said wolruf .   the ship was picking up speed .  another crash against the rear of the ship swayed it crookedly for a moment before mandelbrot brought it back into line .  a horrible screeching sound raked along the left side .      they can   t do much     said derec .     the first law won   t let the hunters order anything that might cause a crash .  they must know by now they can   t stop the ship without knocking us out of control .         hope you   re right     jeff said grimly  as another thump shook the rear of the ship .   that was the last one  however .  the ship had left the last of the function robots behind and was angling steeply into the air .     chapter     in orbit       i have chosen to go into a low orbit     said mandelbrot .     this ship does .  not carry large amounts of fuel for shuttle mode and it will be needed for landing here and also for jeff   s eventual trip away from the planet .  however  as long as we are off the surface of the planet  we are safe from the robots of robot city .         that   s a relief     said derec .     unless they   ve developed a space program we don   t know about .         the navigational sensorrs indicate no ssign of that     said wolruf .     suggesst i take manual controls .  mandelbrot can reconnect ship computerr .         agreed     said mandelbrot .      the first law won   t let them shoot us down or anything like that     said ariel .     but they can monitor us  can   t they .  and have a welcoming committee anywhere we land .      mandelbrot now had a panel open by the controls and was studying the interior .     this craft is small and its shuttle mode offers high maneuverability .  we should be able to land with an evasive pattern that will make our site unpredictable until the last few seconds .         i   m glad to hear it     said jeff .     this planet is never dull  is it .         no     said derec     but it hasn   t always been this dangerous  either .  one time we had to solve a human murder  and another time we had to solve the apparent murder of a robot .  but it   s only recently that we   ve been anyone   s target .      jeff laughed .     last time i was here  they took my brain out of my head and stuck it in a robot .  that struck me as dangerous .      ariel laughed .  derec grinned in spite of the pain in his ribs when he started to laugh .  even wolruf glanced back over her shoulder with an amused look .      i   m glad you   re okay     said ariel .     and thanks again for coming back  even if it was under mistaken assumptions .      derec felt a twinge of jealousy but said nothing .  now that the crisis was over  his body was stiffening up rapidly again .  he reclined in his seat and felt the adhesions snapping in his back .      i believe this connection is now sufficient     said mandelbrot .     jeff  will you test the voicecommand .         hayashi smith minneapolis ship computer     said jeff .     please acknowledge .         standing by     said the computer .      can you assume flight duties .         affirmative .         do so  maintaining status quo .         flight duty assumed .         also record the following voices into your voicecommand and prepare to follow any of them .     jeff nodded to the others .   each of them spoke in turn to the computer .      what   s our next move .     derec asked .     we   re safe for the moment  but we aren   t any closer to dr .  avery  are we .         we know a little more about his aims for robot city     said ariel .     based on professor leong   s knowledge of him .         but we haven   t turned that into a clue to his location     said derec .     mandelbrot  any ideas .         one  derec     said the robot .     computer .  scan for any sign of large scale crop growth or organic chemical stores .         scanning     said the computer .      dr .  avery   s food source may not be in a quantity or storage facility that we can locate from here     said mandelbrot  with a humanlike shrug .     it is only a possibility .         are carbon compounds used for anything else here .     jeff asked  looking around at everyone .     besides that hospital place i was in  or whatever you called it .         i   m not sure     said derec .      we are safe in saying that the amounts are quite small     said mandelbrot .     in addition  the amount of food required for a single human is small  as well .  our best hope of finding a source in quantity is the chance that dr .  avery may wish to extend his interest in culture to the art of cuisine .         or at least  maybe he wants better food than those chemical processors give you     said ariel .     fresh produce  maybe .         hey .  speaking of which     said jeff     what did we grab this ship for in the first place .  come on  let   s eat .  ariel  the compartment   s next to you .      jeff distributed rations to everyone but mandelbrot  even locating some items wolruf could tolerate .      extensive agricultural growth located     said the computer .     coming on screen .         close up     ordered mandelbrot .     identify if possible .      everyone watched the screen .  a tiny dark spot rapidly grew into a green rectangle .  that rectangle  a moment later  was clearly a quilt of many different shades of green .  on extreme close up  the shapes of the plants came clear .      many crops are present .  they include corn  sorghum  wheat  and beets .  at first scan  auroran strains of earth native plants predominate .  many crops are unidentifiable at this height and angle .         maybe the robots bred some of them themselves     said ariel .     or they   re native here .         pull back the view     said mandelbrot .     show the surrounding geography .      the view drew back to show the spine of a mountain range .  it was geologically old  exhibiting the gentle edges and curves of long erosion .  the range was fully forested but occasionally dotted with buildings .  the agricultural park was nestled in a high altitude valley within the mountain range itself .      it   s not city     said jeff .     it   s the first place i   ve seen since coming back that isn   t all built up .         us  too     said ariel .      the robots are probably using the forests for lumber and the slopes for industrial power or something     said derec .     they don   t generally let anything go to waste .  but those crops are all food .  i think this is it .  mandelbrot .         the probability is extremely high that this is a human food source .  we must investigate it .  i remind everyone that dr .  avery himself is not necessarily present .          it   s a start     said jeff .     now what .         first we must find a place to land     said mandelbrot .     these mountains are unsuitable .  second  i suggest that wolruf and i scout the location alone .  third  the safest place for the rest of you to wait is in the air .         makes sense to me     said jeff .     you can use your comlink to reach us when necessary  and we can fly this thing ourselves again now .         derec .     ariel asked .      yeah  okay .     he shifted uncomfortably  angry that he couldn   t participate more .  still  this plan was simple enough .      computer     said mandelbrot .     scan for landing sites as close to the crop field as possible .         currently out of visual range     said the computer .     scanning will begin with the next orbital pass .         we   ll need multiple sites     said mandelbrot .     the hunters will undoubtedly secure the first one after we   ve used it .         computer     said derec  with effort .     don   t allow our orbital route to give away our interest in that area .         acknowledged .      derec collapsed again .  he wasn   t sleepy  but he was worn out .  the short period of excitement had revitalized him  but now he was paying the price .   everyone seemed to be unwinding from their escape in the ship .  derec lay with his eyes closed and he heard someone switch out the light directly over him .  the darkness on his lids was a relief .   no one spoke for some time .  then  quietly  he heard the computer again .      nearest landing sites to agricultural park coming on screen as follows  five within five kilometer radius  two more within ten kilometers  three more within twenty kilometers .          are any of them in relatively uninhabited areas .  especially away from urban streets .     mandelbrot asked .      displaying the five closest sites .  these are the only sites not using city pavement .      derec forced his eyes open .  he hated feeling left out .      it   s an ocean     said jeff  in surprise .      a stretch of beach     said ariel .   as they watched  five separate areas of beach on the screen were colored lightly by the computer .      these sites represent stretches of sand long enough and firm enough for a safe landing     said the computer .      for the purpose of evading the hunters  this might as well be one landing site     said mandelbrot .     when they see the first  they will find the others .         we   ll have to take the chance     said derec .     we   ll drop off you and wolruf as fast as we can and take off again .  then we   ll go back into orbit until we hear from you .         or until your fuel level reaches minimum     said mandelbrot .     i will alert the computer to warn you when you must land .      derec closed his eyes again .      all right     said jeff .      computer     said mandelbrot .     on the next orbit  take an evasive route down to the first of the landing sites .  avoid revealing our destination as long as you can .         acknowledged .      most of the next orbit was uneventful  but derec found the evasive maneuvers extremely unpleasant .  the ship descended  turned as sharply as it could  ascended again  turned again .  each change shifted his weight and pressed his aching muscles .  none of the others seemed to notice .   the changes began to include speed as the ship worked its crooked way down toward the planet .  derec gripped the strap holding him in both hands and clenched his teeth against the pain shooting through his back .  finally the descent smoothed out and he realized they were about to land .   the ship landed on a surface that listed somewhat to the left and halted so suddenly that everyone was thrown forward against their restraining straps .  the door opened automatically and the ladder extended .  mandelbrot and wolruf were ready to go .  moments later  the door closed again and the ship waited briefly for them to get a safe distance from the ship .      prepared for lift off as ordered     said the computer .     please instruct .         return to the same altitude we just left     said jeff .     uh  use evasive pattern and take a different orbit when we get there .         acknowledged .      the acceleration pressed derec back against his seat again .  he closed his eyes  resigned to the ride  and lay still .     chapter     deserted streets    mandelbrot and wolruf ran straight up the beach .  the sand was pale blue and packed hard all the way to the line where the ground cover began .  there they climbed up the dip between two high  rounded  grassy dunes .      careful     said mandelbrot .     the hunters will be on their way here already .      wolruf nodded .   they moved cautiously over the next rise and mandelbrot found the edge of the urban area .  the dunes were bordered by a curving boulevard .  ahead of them  a smaller street stretched away from them  lined with buildings on both sides .      no one is    err     said wolruf .   the streets were deserted in all directions .      we will be very easy to spot here     said mandelbrot .     i have no crowd to get lost in and you are now on the hunters    list .         should move .      mandelbrot looked toward the mountains that loomed over them slightly to the left .     the valley itself is no farther than five kilometers  but the mountains begin much closer .  the greatest danger to us is crossing the city to reach them .         greatest danger to us iss waiting    err     said wolruf .      agreed .  let   s go .     mandelbrot started across the boulevard  striding at a pace that was fast but dignified .   no robots were visible in either direction .  on the first city block  they stayed near the edges of the buildings themselves and glanced inside any doorways or windows that offered a view .  the city was functioning here without humanoid robots .      assembly points     said wolruf .     robots    err have already lefft .     she glanced behind them  over her shoulder .         unterss could come from any direction .         a tunnel stop would help us considerably     said mandelbrot .     if we stay on this street we will encounter one  if they were built with the same frequency in this area as in the area we are familiar with .     he paused to look inside a window .  inside  function robots were scuttling about on their duties .      maybe they didn   t build any    err at all     said wolruf as she trotted alongside to keep up .      that is possible .  if this portion of the city is built on sand  then tunneling is more difficult .  however  these robots do not seem to factor difficulty into their considerations .         therr     wolruf said emphatically  pointing ahead .   a humanoid robot was just disappearing from sight around a corner ahead of them .   mandelbrot reached down to lift wolruf  and began to run   not at full speed  but quickly enough to make up some ground .      careful     said wolruf  clutching him around the neck .      i believe that a hunter this close to us would have come in this direction     said mandelbrot .     however  i do not want to contact any robot without the chance to observe the situation first .  pursuit is the only recourse .      a moment later  they turned the corner after the other robot .  he was now riding a slidewalk  standing still as it carried him parallel to the mountain range .  mandelbrot hurried to the slidewalk and then walked slowly after him once they were on it .      i think i understand     he said quietly .     either this humanoid cannot be replaced here by function robots  or else he is one of the last  possibly the very last  in this area to follow his migration programming .         if that iss the case  we should forget about    im     said wolruf .     go to the mountains and    ide from    unters .  find avery .         we will be safer taking evasive action than simply racing the hunters to the mountains .  in fact  we should avoid indicating to them what our destination is  if possible .  i am hoping to find a group of humanoid robots to observe so that we can imitate their actions without being witnessed by them .         too late     said wolruf  looking back over his shoulder .         err come    unters .      mandelbrot turned to look .  one humanoid  clearly a hunter by his size and sensors  was riding a distant slidewalk toward the landing site .      good .  they intend to pick up our trail at the beach .  that gives us a little more time .     mandelbrot set wolruf on her feet .     i will try to manage among the robots .  see if you can reach the agricultural park .  i will attempt to meet you there .      wolruf hissed a kind of agreement and hopped off the slidewalk .  then she darted away .   mandelbrot considered a number of options for himself instantly and chose one .  he sent a distress alert to the robot ahead of him through his comlink .      i am in need of assistance     he said .   the other robot turned to face him  then stepped onto the stationary shoulder to wait for mandelbrot .     what is wrong .         i am on the verge of physically shutting down .     that was true  mandelbrot neglected to say that it was voluntary .     please take me to the nearest repair facility .  report me as a malfunctioned robot  failure unknown .         agreed .      mandelbrot froze in place but kept his positronic brain functioning .  he had deliberately avoided identifying himself .   this robot was complying with mandelbrot   s request under a subtle but real compulsion .  the third law of robotics required robots to avoid harm to themselves through action or inaction but did not specifically require them to keep other robots from harm .  however  in the robot society of robot city  mandelbrot had observed that such cooperation was common .  perhaps it was even programmed .  in any case  he knew he could count on another robot   s help  at least in the absence of more pressing problems .   the robot stepped back onto the slidewalk next to him .  apparently the nearest repair facility was in this direction .  at least it would offer a kind of camouflage from the hunters since he would not just be wandering around by himself or  worse  with a highly recognizable caninoid alien .   he hoped wolruf could make it to the mountains .  she was still of no interest to most robots  though they could act as witnesses to her presence and her direction for the hunters .  in the forested mountains she would have a better chance .   at present  the hunters would almost certainly be tracking them by infrared heat sensors .  when they had followed mandelbrot and wolruf to the point where they had mounted the slidewalk  they would ride it while scanning the shoulder for the spot or spots where their quarry had gotten off again .  he rode on .   finally the other robot lifted him and stepped off the slidewalk .  this kept mandelbrot   s robot body heat off the ground  the hunters would not be able to detect where he had left the slidewalk .  however  they would be on wolruf   s trail without a problem .     wolruf trotted down the empty sidewalk  alert on all sides for the sight  sound  or scent of humanoid robots .  the city here was as striking as ever  she passed a gigantic  many faceted dome glittering in the sunshine  a spiraling jade green skyscraper that resembled loosely twisted ribbons frozen in midfall  and a multitude of combined pyramidal  hexagonal  and conical shapes .  the quiet hum of machinery and the occasional function robots moving about told her that the city was still active here .   the absence of humanoids was eerie .  the city was just too big and elaborate to seem normal with deserted streets and nearly vacant buildings .  she felt exposed .   wolruf grinned to herself as she turned corners  circled blocks  doubled back  and then moved on  always working her way closer to the mountains that were so invitingly close .  as a navigator  she was no stranger to evasive maneuvers .  she had not usually conducted them on foot  however  or been limited to one plane .   she was not certain how successful these maneuvers would be .  if the hunters possessed heat sensors that could consistently choose the warmest trail  then she was not going to confuse them by crisscrossing her path .  instead  she was just wasting time and letting them get closer .  after she had done a little more of that  she resorted to a zigzag pattern that angled her toward the mountains more quickly .   when she reached the edge of the city  she stopped to consider her next move .  a long boulevard lined the base of the first foothill  beyond it  the forest began .  if she could disguise her point of entry into the mountains  it would help her a great deal .   she hopped onto the slidewalk that ran down the side of the boulevard  looking around .  the hunters could be right behind her or a long way back  she had no way of knowing without risking them seeing her .  she could be sure  however  that they were coming with that inexorable robot logic and single mindedness .   nor could she ride here indefinitely  she could be seen easily by anyone looking down the straightaway .  she jumped off again .   what she needed was a mobile function robot she could ride across the boulevard  or anything else that would keep moving after she left it  so that the traces of her body heat would be carried away .  with an anxious glance behind her  she turned a corner and looked down the street .   it was empty .   time was growing short .  she would either have to find a way to break her trail  or else leave a track into the mountains that any hunter could follow .   she started down the street  peering inside any windows she could reach .        orbit attained     said the ship computer .     please instruct .         maintain altitude     said jeff .     vary the route at random .         acknowledged .      jeff turned to look at derec .  he was reclining in his seat  eyes closed  jaw clenched .  jeff unstrapped and moved over to him .      what is it .     ariel asked .      these seats convert into berths .  if you   ll unstrap him  i   ll get the seat all the way down flat .  then flexible privacy walls pull down from the ceiling .          i see .      they worked in silence  watching derec .  he was clearly awake  but in no mood to converse .  when he was lying down comfortably  jeff pulled down the walls  leaving one open just enough for him to see out if he wished .   jeff and ariel sat down in the two control seats in the front .      can we do anything for him .     jeff asked .      no     ariel whispered .   he looked at her in surprise .   her eyes were wide and staring at the blank viewscreen on the console .      ariel .  what   s wrong .      she didn   t respond .   he took hold of her arm  gently  and moved his face in front of her unwavering gaze .     ariel .  can you see me .      her eyes were steady  open  and beginning to water .   jeff felt a tickle of fear along the back of his neck .  ariel had told him something of the chemfets in derec and her memory loss and regrowth .  however  he had had the impression that she was getting much better .  now he was alone in orbit with both of them and didn   t know if he should try to help or what he could do .      computer     he said .     review landing sites .  skip the ones on the beach .  they   ll be guarded .         landing sites coming on screen .         which one is the closest to the crops now .         it is marked in blue .         can you describe it .         it is a main thoroughfare in this part of the city  straight and of sufficient size for a safe landing .  the ship will halt approximately   .   kilometers from the agricultural field .         what are the chances that hunters will be waiting for us when we get there .         unknown  but very high .  they are certainly in the area and will see and hear the ship on its final approach .  if they are not waiting  they will converge quickly .         faster than last time .         definitely .      jeff looked at ariel again .  she hadn   t moved .  behind them  derec seemed to be asleep .  neither of them would run very far .     chapter     into the mountains    wolruf had been trotting up and down the blocks  growing more frantic in her search for a moving vehicle of some kind .  inside the buildings  most machinery ran smoothly without even the presence of function robots .  finally she spotted a small wheeled function robot rolling at a good clip along a side street .   she took off at a dead run for it .  oblivious to her  it turned a corner and disappeared from sight .  by the time she got there  it had gained more distance on her and was angling across a wide street .  none of the slidewalks would take her that way .   she was slowing down  about to give up  when it abruptly changed direction toward a doorway .  the door opened automatically  timed so that the function robot did not have to slow down at all .  she forced herself to hurry on .   wolruf was not in particularly good condition .  since joining derec  she had been starved on several occasions  overfed on others  injured  and   like all of them except mandelbrot   sometimes overworked and stressed to her limit .  she was now basically healthy  but she had not had exercise like this for a long time .   then she saw the function robot emerge from the doorway and zip across the boulevard again .  it mounted a slidewalk this time and actually came back toward her .  panting heavily  she turned and ran for the slidewalk  angling toward a likely intersection point with it as it rolled along the moving slidewalk .   she got a better look at it as she converged on it .  it was only about a meter square and two meters high .  the wheels  as she had first identified them  proved to be a bed of spheres that gave it the capacity to alter direction without turning its body .   the body of the little robot was smooth and featureless .  wolruf had no chance of catching it if it passed her again  considering how exhausted she was .  as she closed with it  she leaped  scrabbled for a hold  and managed to hang on .   the robot immediately slowed down .  it did not stop  however  so she clung to its body and rode .  at least her body heat had left the stationary surfaces on the ground .  now she had to catch her breath and hope this thing didn   t carry her right into the view of a hunter .   she realized that she had no idea what this was programmed to do .  from its size and what she had seen  she guessed it was a courier of some sort  perhaps for small parts and tools .  that might account for its slowing down in response to her weight  but not otherwise reacting .  right now  though  it was taking her away from the mountains that she desperately wanted to enter .   suddenly it moved onto the stationary shoulder  slowed down  and came to a halt .  she looked around  puzzled  and saw nothing .  then it started across the street .   she raised up and looked off to her side  which was now the way they were going .  a large hunter robot was striding down another slidewalk toward them .  when it had seen her  it had obviously instructed the function robot to move toward it .   wolruf jumped off the function robot and ran the other way  turning the first corner she reached .  a slidewalk here would carry her in the direction she wanted  so she mounted it and went into a trot .  at the next corner  she jumped off and turned another corner .  the hunter could move faster than she could  and she was tiring rapidly even after her brief rest riding the courier  or whatever that thing had been .   she had only moments left to think of something .   with no other recourse  she headed straight for the mountains  only a few blocks away .  another slidewalk would help  though of course the hunter could ride it  too .  as the boulevard bordering the foothills came into view  she looked behind her .   the hunter was in full view and running down the moving slidewalk toward her .   she glanced quickly in both directions as she crossed the boulevard .  the street was empty as far as she could see on both sides .  then she was across it  darting among the trunks of tall trees .   she climbed the slope as fast as she could  ducking under branches and dodging bushes .  the forest showed signs of the careful robot city planning  the types of trees and bushes varied with a certain regularity  as did their sizes .  planting had been done with the long view in mind  both of harvesting and of soil usage .   as she bent low to pass under the arching branches of a large bush shaped something like a simple water fountain  she realized that she just might gain some ground here .  her size was a considerable advantage in the close maze of growth .  as far as she had seen  the hunters were uniformly among the tallest and bulkiest of the humanoid robots .   if only she could gain enough time to rest .     derec awakened in the berth  at first puzzled by his surroundings .  then he remembered  vaguely  that jeff and ariel had somehow reclined his seat into an entirely flat position so that he could rest more comfortably .  he lay quietly for a while  staring at the ceiling .   thankfully  he had not experienced any of those wild dreams in some time .  their weirdness was frightening .  yet he felt worn out  even after sleeping .   maybe he had been having those nightmares and not remembering them .  the chemfets were growing inside him like an organic parasite .  their symptoms also evolved  like those of a disease .  not having those dreams  or at least not remembering them  was yet another sign of how far beyond the early stages his condition had advanced .   he reached over to one of the screens and sent it back up into the ceiling .  when he rose up on one shoulder to look around  he saw the silhouettes of jeff and ariel in the front of the ship .  they were turning around at the sound of the wall screens moving .      derec .     ariel said softly .     how are you feeling .      he cleared his throat and swung his legs over the side of the bed  hiding the pains in all his muscles .      derec .     she repeated  moving to him .      a little better     said derec .  he started to stand  then decided not to take the risk of falling .      i had one of my .  .  . memory fugues again .         really .  how bad was it .     he looked up at her in surprise .     you haven   t had one for some time .         i don   t know how bad it was .         what .         jeff told me i was just staring at nothing .  and i don   t remember it at all .         maybe you phased back to the time before i had your new memory developing again .  right into that empty period .  anyhow  it   s over .     he sighed .     as for me  my symptoms have been .  .  . changing .      she looked at him without speaking .   derec knew she understood that meant he was getting worse .      we have to land     said jeff  joining them .     i can   t do anything for either one of you if .  .  . if something happens again .         then you   ve heard from mandelbrot .     derec asked .      no .  we haven   t .  but our fuel is running low .         all we   re using here is enough for life support     said ariel .      and for evasive changes in direction .  landing and takeoff will also use a lot .     derec nodded .     all right .  do you have any plan of action .         yeah  but it   s not very good .  basically  we land on one of the big boulevards the ship computer has identified as a site and drive this thing to the edge of the mountains .  then we run for it .         i   m .  .  . not going to be running very fast .      jeff nodded .      and the central computer can study our final approach and tell the hunters where we   re likely to land .         the hunters will be waiting at the landing site     ariel agreed .     but we can gain some ground on them by taxiing in the ship right to the foothills .         and then .     derec said pointedly .   jeff and ariel just looked at each other .      all right     said derec .     we can   t stay up here .  we   ll have to take our chances .       wolruf darted under another of those thick  fountain shaped bushes and paused to rest .  she had had two glimpses of her pursuit down the slope  at least two hunters were now behind her .  though her crooked path had made calculating distance difficult  she did not think they had gained ground on her .   she continued to study the ground around her  as she did when fleeing .  finally  here  she located what she had expected to find all along .  the robots were too efficient and well organized to cultivate a forest without them .   a small metal stud protruded from the ground in front of her .  she studied it carefully  poking at it with her stubby  sausagelike fingers .  then she began to look around in the dirt again .   a high pitched whine caught her attention .  it was faint at first  but growing louder quickly  turning into a wail from the sky .  human ears could not have heard it at this distance  but she could  and that meant the robots easily could .  she could not see upward clearly from the forest floor  but the sound of the minneapolis in shuttle mode was unmistakable to her sensitive ears .   she waited  quivering with tension .  as she listened  the ship obviously came to land safely somewhere in the urban area .  then it grew so faint that she wasn   t sure if it had stopped or not .  after a moment  it began to grow louder again .   she understood that the humans had decided to risk getting to the crop field however they could .  that meant she could help them  if the hunters did not come upon her too soon .  she finally located a small rock in the dirt around her and began striking it against the little metal post with glancing blows .   at first she couldn   t hit it at the right angle .  then  even after she had produced a few sparks  she found all of them flying away from the metal .  eventually  however  one of the sparks fell back onto the small metal post itself .   instantly  one of the highly sensitive robot city sensors responded to the heat by producing a fine spray of water  no more than a meter high .  greater heat would undoubtedly have triggered a stronger spray  however  this would be good enough for her purposes .  the sprinklers would dampen the ground behind her  eliminating the body heat that the hunters had been tracking .   she looked around  blinking against the spray .  other sprinklers near her had also been triggered  as far as she could see .  as always  these robots had designed their system efficiently .   the minneapolis had come to a halt some distance to her left  according to the sound  at the bottom of the foothills .  she wanted to join the humans again  but did not dare .  they could lose their pursuit now in the sprinkled area  but the hunters behind her were too close .  she might just lead them right to the others .   she took a deep breath and darted away from the bush  looking for rocks  roots  and other hard surfaces to step on .  the hunters could no longer follow her heat  but they could see footprints .  she ran on up the slope  away from the crop field .     as wolruf had surmised  the minneapolis had landed safely at a site surrounded by hunter robots and had successfully driven through the crowd down the boulevard straight to the base of the mountains .  as soon as it had stopped  the door had opened and the ladder had extended .  jeff and ariel were helping derec out the door when he stopped on the top rung of the ladder .      hold it     said derec .     ship computer .         standing by .         you have a record of all the hunters who were waiting for us at the landing site just a minute ago .         affirmative .  all robots present at the site were recorded on the viewscreen tapes .         chase them     said derec .     as long as you can do so without endangering the ship .  pursue them up and down any boulevards big enough for you .         clarify .          make them think you   re going to run them down   in fact  do so if you can .  the third law requires them to take care of themselves  so keep as many of them distracted and out of the mountains as you can .  got it .     derec indulged in a grin     acknowledged .          let   s go .      jeff and ariel walked on each side of him  holding his arms draped over their shoulders as they hurried awkwardly to the edge of the forested hills .  all three of them had to watch the ground right in front of them and each other   s feet just to keep from stumbling .      this is insane     derec said through his teeth .     we can   t even outrun an auroran striped hastifer .  how are we going to get away from the hunters this way .         better than a crash landing with no fuel for shuttle mode     panted jeff .      it   s getting worse     said ariel .     yuck .  i   m getting wet .  it must be raining .      derec jerked his head up and looked at the brush and trees around them .     really .  no  it   s not raining .  .  .  . look   sprinklers .     he grinned .     sprinklers .         what       ariel paused to edge around the trunk of a tree  as she was still tangled in derec   s arm .     what are you so happy about .         the hunters have been using heat sensors to track us .  we have a chance now .         mud     said jeff .  he turned his head to one side and ducked under a branch .     that   s our next problem .  we have to watch our footsteps or they   ll just follow those .      derec pulled his arm free from ariel .     and i   ve got some adrenaline flowing again .  i   m loosening up .  come on   as long as i   m really worked up  i can move .     he pulled away from jeff  too  trying to hide the extreme pains he still felt .   jeff studied his face .     whatever you say .  but if you really need help  say so  all right .         yeah  yeah .  come on .      jeff led the way up the slope .  the forest grew thicker very quickly and then remained almost uniformly the same  probably the result of precise robot planting .  derec followed him  straining not to show how much difficulty he was having .  still  jeff tended to gain on him  while ariel was always moving up right behind him .   as derec struggled on  one fact kept returning to his thoughts .  dr .  avery had done this to him   and derec had never done anything to him .  his anger served to fire him  to keep him moving  to force him onward .  dr .  avery would not escape .   jeff stepped onto a ridge of white rock and stopped  breathing hard .  derec came up and joined him  but collapsed into a sitting position .  ariel stood next to him .      that agricultural park  or whatever you want to call it  is that way     said jeff  nodding at an angle over the mountains .     according to the viewscreen  there are passes on each side of us .      derec looked up at him  but was too out of breath to speak .  he just nodded .      it looks like these rocks extend across this foothill for some distance     jeff went on .     they   ll take us toward either pass .  i think we should stay on this ridge for as long as we can to avoid leaving footprints .         maybe the ship really slowed down a few hunters     ariel said when she had the breath .      we can hope so     said jeff .     but we   d better get going .      derec struggled to get up .     okay     he said huskily .   they started again  more slowly this time .     chapter     the agricultural park    twilight had fallen on the mountain pass by the time derec plodded after jeff and ariel to its far side .  they waited for him to catch up and he leaned an arm across ariel   s shoulders when he arrived .  together  the three of them looked out over the green valley below .   the valley was divided into many different fields  all of them tended by function robots .  the hoes were easily identified  even at this great distance .  there were others moving about  some clipping and spraying .  the lower slopes leading into the valley were terraced and cultivated  also .      this has to be the place     said derec .     robots just don   t need this stuff .         i agree     said jeff .     this is avery   s grocery store .  or at least  his produce market .  if he has livestock  they must be somewhere else .         they would require different care and processing .      derec nodded .     and these robots are too efficient to put this here and avery a thousand kilometers away .  i   m betting he   s in the neighborhood  someplace .         and we made it     said ariel .     this far  anyway .         we couldn   t help leaving a few footprints here and there     said jeff .     and those hunter robots may have sensors i can   t even imagine .  they don   t have to stop for the night  either .         they   ll spot all kinds of details we left behind     said derec .     broken branches and things like that .  as much as i hate to say this .  .  . we   d better move on .         some of them probably went to the other pass     ariel pointed out .     there won   t be as many behind us .         that pass leads to this valley  too     said jeff .     we might just meet them coming the other way .      ariel shook her head .     you   re so optimistic .  come on .      they started down the slope and soon entered the cultivated rows of some plant that none of them could identify .  it grew in a straight stalk with stiff  narrow leaves angling sharply upward  roughly three meters high .  the stalks were planted close together  forcing them to walk in single file between the rows .   jeff looked back over his shoulder nervously .     we   re leaving a track even i could follow .  look down .      derec looked .  the soil was freshly turned and damp .  their footprints were clear and deep .     these robots must hoe and water constantly .         it hasn   t gotten any darker     said ariel .  she looked up at the sky .     it should have by now .         lights must have come on     derec said .     i can   t tell from where  though .  the function robots here may need some to work at night .  or else this is growth light of some kind for the crops .      jeff was pushing experimentally between two stalks in one of the rows .     come on .  we can squeeze between these .  we have to break up our trail a little .      the others followed him through .  the next row was identical to the previous one as far as derec could see .  they walked down it for a while  then found another spot where they could push through into the next row down into the valley .      up there     said derec  pointing .     we have to catch it .  come on .      some distance ahead  a function robot was moving away from them at a moderate speed .  the body of this robot was roughly a cube two meters on a side .  it seemed to advance on a bed of vertical spikes that chewed into the ground as it walked forward  thereby hoeing the soil it covered .  at intervals  it stopped and sent tentacles out to each side that stabbed into the earth in the rows of crops and pulled out small plants into its own body .   jeff ran for it .  as ariel tried to help derec along  he glanced at the rows of crops as they passed .  apparently that stabbing motion cut the roots of unwanted plants that had grown up between the desired crops .  the weeds were drawn into the function robot  ground up  and deposited through the bottom to be left behind as instant compost .  he could see the tiny bits here and there in the soil now that he was looking .      i got it but i don   t see any way to stop it     jeff called .  he was now sitting on the body of the hoer  facing backward .      stupid thing     said ariel .     i wish it had a positronic brain so we could order it around .         no     said derec  struggling after her .     it could also report to the hunters  in that case .      the hoer would not wait for them  but every time it stopped to weed they gained on it a little .  at last they were able to climb on board with jeff  where they sat awkwardly on its crowded top .      now we just need some luck     said jeff .     if this thing stays out of the sight of the hunters until it takes a few turns here and there  they won   t be able to track us easily after all .  all the rows have the same appearance after these things go through them .         i can use the rest     said derec .     but we have to figure out where avery is while we can .  i didn   t see any buildings in this valley when we came in .         i didn   t either     said jeff  shaking his head .      then what else do you remember .     ariel asked .     from your father .  anything .         i thought about it while we were climbing up the mountain     said jeff .     but i didn   t have breath to talk .  you remember how i told you that avery wanted to know about cultures that could endure .      ariel nodded .  derec was alert but too tired to respond .      my father told him that two groups exist even now  in space  that are descended in a straight line from ancient earth .  both of them have continued to evolve in spacer communities  but their longevity really got avery   s attention .         what were they .     ariel asked .      one is the spacer minority culture descended from china through a couple of migrations on earth .  the other is the spacer jewish communities .         what did he want to know about them .     ariel made a face .     i don   t see how this is going to help us find him here .      jeff shrugged .     i do recall that he didn   t care about their details .  my father tried to tell him that both these cultures had continued to evolve in space .  he even said that in many ways they were totally unrecognizable from their ancestral earth cultures .  but all avery wanted to know was how they had survived as specific entities .      that was consistent  derec thought to himself .  the guy only cared about his own project and what he could do to improve it .      he was looking for clues for robot city     ariel said .     to make it endure across the centuries .  that   s what he was researching with professor leong .  he needed to program cultural values into the city .  but we haven   t really seen very much of that .      derec forced himself to speak .     i   m sure that he reprogrammed the city while we were on earth .  i think after the incidents surrounding the performance of hamlet  the robot creativity scared him .  he couldn   t have his robots committing crimes against each other .         the arts aren   t the only part of culture     said jeff .      what do you mean .     ariel asked .   derec shifted slightly so that he could hear jeff better .  the hoer moved right along  still hoeing and weeding .  the sky above them now looked dark  but a soft glow of light from somewhere illuminated the rows of crops .      my father gave avery two reasons for the cultural survival of those groups while they were on earth .  one is that the original cultures had very strong family units that passed values on .  the other is that  outside of their native countries  both groups on earth experienced limited assimilation as minorities and often faced prejudice from the majority culture .         but only on earth .     ariel said .      that   s right .  modem spacer families aren   t personally close the way families used to be  i guess .  and now the ethnicities are from one planet to another  or spacer versus earth .         my mother didn   t like solarians     said ariel .     they program their robots funny or something .     she smiled .     she told me a joke once that went           how could avery have used that information .     derec asked firmly  stopping her with a hand on her arm .      come to think of it     said ariel     how can these minorities still exist if the original reasons for their endurance no longer do .  that doesn   t make sense .         i   m not sure     said jeff .     but on aurora  i still look different .  that always kept me distinct .  and  you know  my father took more interest in me than my friends    fathers .  that   s why he dragged me out to meet avery  remember .         i think i see     said ariel .     maybe some of these tendencies still exist to a degree .         at least in comparison to the majority cultures on the planet .     jeff nodded .   they all clutched for a hold on the hoer as it reached a perpendicular row and made a right angle turn without slowing down .  it made another right turn at the next row and started down the direction it had just come on the previous one .  they could see a long way ahead of them .   so could the hunters  if they looked down the right row .   derec was uncomfortable with this talk of families and fathers and sons .  he hadn   t had any family to speak of since he had awakened with amnesia .      we still have to find avery in this valley or this mountain range or somewhere     said derec with annoyance .     what are we going to do about that .         just one more thing     said jeff .     my father told avery that two major events changed both these cultures in ancient times .  one was moving from the so called old world of earth to the united states .         what difference would that make .     ariel asked .     they were still on earth .         he said that while prejudice didn   t vanish there  these two cultures were part of a nation of immigrants and their descendants for the first time .  they were a fundamental part of these societies even while maintaining their identities .         what was the other event .     she asked .      going into space .  the same situation occurred again with the settling of spacer worlds .  being an auroran  say  is now more important than one   s earth ancestors .  as demonstrated by your mother   s attitude toward solarians .      ariel nodded thoughtfully .      so what does all this get us .     derec demanded .     robots never did have this kind of identity  anyhow .  what does this have to do with robot city .  and finding dr .  avery .         now  look .     jeff whirled on him .     you   re the one who started asking me what i remember .  i   m just telling you .  if you don   t want to hear it  don   t ask me .      ariel grabbed both their arms .     robots     she whispered .   far in the distance ahead of them  the silhouettes of humanoid robots were moving from right to left  down the valley slope  across their open row .     wolruf gathered her legs under her and leaped from a small rock to a fallen branch large enough to hold her .  she landed on it on all fours and hung on till she got her balance .  this forest had very few fallen branches  or loose matter of any kind .   the robots obviously cleared the forest floor frequently .  she had seen a few function robots in the distance but had kept clear of them .  she didn   t want the hunters sending any more orders to function robots that would help them capture her .   still  she had managed to minimize the footprints she left behind .  a fairly small area had been sprinkled by the sensor she had triggered and she had left it before the sprinklers quit operating .  she wondered how long they had continued to run .   she hoped they had remained on for some time .  if they had sprayed long enough  then the water eventually would not only have eliminated the body heat of her footprints on the ground  but also would have washed away the visual traces .   that and the difficulty the big hunters would have in moving through the crowded forest might account for their falling behind .  when they had lost her trail  they probably would have had to resort to a pattern search to pick it up again  and that would cost them time .   she stayed on the branch to catch her breath .  her memory of the terrain on the ship viewscreen was clear enough  but she wasn   t sure exactly where she was .  nor was she sure of what to do .   so far  she had been angling up the slope and away from the pass that the humans had been near  certain that they were heading there .  anything she could do to draw hunters away from them would be a contribution .  she also remembered that another pass led into the valley somewhere in this direction .   she was torn between two impulses  with no way to know which would better serve the cause of derec   s getting to avery before avery   s robots got to him .  if she got to the pass and joined the humans  they could work together as a team again and perhaps accomplish more .  however  that would mean leading the hunters following her right back toward them again .   this was not getting her anywhere .   she could not afford to rest anywhere too long  even now .  after balancing along the fallen branch as far as she could  she jumped off to a patch of ground that looked firm .  from there  she stepped on the top of an exposed tree root  grabbed a low hanging branch  and swung over to a small rock .   then she paused to look back  wondering if this was worth the effort .  if the hunters came up quickly  their heat sensors would tell them where she had been .  now  however  she was hoping that they were too far behind to use those sensors effectively .  if the traces of her body heat subsided before they arrived  minimizing her visual track could be critical .   she continued to move along this way .  it was a gamble  but probably worth it .  if she could actually lose the hunters  then she could look for the humans in the valley without endangering them further .  in order to know  however  she would have to double back at some point and actually watch the hunters in action .   that might be too risky .  still undecided  she fled on up the slope  still moving roughly in the direction of the pass .  once she got there  she could make her final decision on whether to enter it or not .     chapter     muggings    since the hoer was moving down the row toward the humanoid robots  its passengers had no choice but to get off and go the other way .  derec was surprised that the robots had not looked down the row already and spotted them  but apparently they had not .  as before  he followed jeff and preceded ariel  all three of them now crawling along the damp earth so that the body of the hoer would block them from view .   before long  they reached the perpendicular row they had seen a short time before .  it ran parallel with the one the humanoid robots were taking in single file to go farther down into the valley .  derec stopped there  breathing hard  unable to go on .      derec .     ariel crawled up beside him .     jeff  wait .      jeff looked back over his shoulder and then came back .  he watched derec for a minute and shook his head .     i don   t know what to do .  we can   t just stop .      derec coughed and shook his head in frustration .  he wanted to speak and didn   t have the breath for it yet .  quickly  he pointed in a stabbing motion in the direction of the humanoids .   ariel turned to look .     they aren   t coming yet .  at least  i don   t see anybody .         no     derec wheezed .     that   s not what i mean .     he paused again  still breathing hard .  his head was spinning dizzily .      we could try supporting you between us again     said jeff .     but we can only do that by standing up and walking .         wait  wait .     derec inhaled deeply and looked up at both of them .     those aren   t hunters .  i   m sure of it .         really .     ariel scooted closer to him .     derec  are you sure .  you   re not exactly in the best condition .         hunters wouldn   t just pass by like that without even looking down the row .  they can   t be hunters .          makes sense to me     said jeff slowly .     so who are they  then .  and what are they doing in this valley .         i was thinking about that  too     said derec .     i think they   re migrating .  they   re following that mysterious migration programming we told you we heard about .         so the only danger from them     said jeff     is that if they notice us  the hunters can ask them where we were .  otherwise they won   t bother us .         that   s right     said derec .     but we can also find out where they   re going   where their assembly point is .  and what this whole operation is for .         now .     ariel said  making a face .     derec  we don   t have much time left to find avery .  we can   t just go wandering off           no .  don   t you understand .  this migration thing is avery   s doing .  if we can figure it out  maybe we   ll find him .  he   s behind it all  and it   s obviously very important to him .         that sounds awfully risky     said jeff .      look at me .  risky .  i don   t have much time left .     derec spoke forcefully  but was too weak to speak loudly now .     i think we   ve talked long enough .  what are we going to do .         that row is full of robot footsteps  too     said ariel .     ours would be camouflaged some .         it is something to go on     jeff said slowly .      i wish mandelbrot was here     said ariel .     and poor wolruf  running around in robot city with him .  i wonder where they are .  i hope they   re all right .         we can   t worry about them     said derec .     we can   t help them directly now  anyway .  if we get to avery  we can make him ease up on them  too .  we have to concentrate on avery .         that   s right     said jeff .     the truth is  they can probably take care of themselves better then we can  especially mandelbrot .  and derec seems to be the one dr .  avery is after .         i   ve been putting some ideas together     said derec .     while we were crawling in the mud back there  just now .         all right     said jeff     let   s hear    em .  if they aren   t going to come after us  we have a few minutes .         unless the hunters get here too     added ariel .      listen     said derec .  .  . avery learned from professor leong that the two most important forces behind cultural longevity are passing on values and maintaining a distinct identity .  right .         sure     said jeff .      so passing values down is not a problem with robots  they   re just programmed .  they can process information much faster and keep more of it accessible than humans .         no argument there     said jeff .   ariel nodded .     and all along  we   ve seen that these avery robots are different from any other sort .  they behave in a different way .  their programming must have been special from the beginning .         exactly     said derec .     both of those facts fit perfectly .  and the isolation of robot city prevents it from being altered by cultures from the outside .       jeff nodded .     its location is still a secret .         so avery really took those two lessons to heart and used them to form robot city     said ariel .      one big question remains     said derec .     what values did he program into them .         efficiency     said jeff .      harmony     said ariel .     both of those .  a kind of idealism .  remember when they gave us their provisional laws of humanics  for ideal human behavior .  robot city was supposed to be a kind of utopia .  we already knew that .         but now we know what kind   on what basis .     derec nodded with excitement .  he now felt a surge of energy again that animated him once more .      i   m starting to get the idea     said jeff .     what do you want to do about it .          challenge the system     said derec .     force it to malfunction .  or at least make it look like it is .         to make avery show himself     ariel said .     all right .  i get it .  but     how .         we have to present the system   that is  the central computer   with irrational events     said derec .     look   the supervisors originally needed us to solve a crime against a human when we first arrived .  the system here has that weak point .         and we never did figure out who the victim was  either     said ariel .  she shivered .     he looked just like you .  that still gives me the creeps  even now .      derec said nothing .  when he had first entered avery   s office he had come across some mysterious information about the dead man that he had never shared with ariel .  this was no time to launch into that topic .   jeff looked at her in surprise .  they had never told him that part of their story .      well  for the moment  forget it     said derec sharply .     one crisis at a time .  the reason we arranged the hamlet performance was also to accomplish something that the robots weren   t ready to handle .         i see what you   re getting at     said jeff .     that   s a weak point in the system .  a utopia isn   t supposed to have crimes and these avery robots can   t really handle them .         exactly     said derec .     i think we have to commit a few crimes against humanoid robots .  we aren   t bound by the laws of robotics and mandelbrot isn   t around to interfere if a situation arose that involved the laws .      jeff grinned wryly .     okay .  .  . let   s become criminals .  what   ll we do first  boss .      derec grinned himself  despite his discomfort .     we have to incapacitate a robot .          murder one .     ariel shook her head .     i don   t see how .  those heads of theirs are as hard as a ship   s hull .  we could bonk them on the head and not even get their attention .      all three of them giggled nervously .  the tension was broken a little by the hope of taking aggressive action .      we can   t unfasten their bodies  either     said jeff  still grinning .     no tools .  otherwise  we could just sneak up behind them  power up the tools  and leave a little junkpile behind .         we could go into business later with used parts     said ariel .     discounted avery robot parts  cheap .         all right  all right .     derec shook his head .     we don   t actually need any physical violence .  the first thing we have to do is get over to that other row  so we can look for one robot walking alone .  let   s crawl back over there .      it was a very long crawl .  derec had to stop several times on the way to rest .  each time  he worried that the hunters were going to catch up to them before they could accomplish anything .   finally they reached the last few tall  leafy stalks before the break in the rows .  the three of them huddled at the corner of the row  where derec could lean forward and look up the slope .  jeff and ariel sat on his other side  both of them looking around anxiously for hunters coming from other directions .      nothing yet     said derec .     that gives me time to explain what i have in mind .         i hope more are coming this way     said ariel .     what if the bunch going to that assembly point is all there .         good point     said derec .     maybe we should follow them .  just keep a look out behind us           no good     said jeff .     these rows are absolutely straight .  if the hunters come along  they can look straight down the slope and spot us instantly even from the very opening of the pass .         we   d better stay here .     ariel settled into a comfortable position .     derec  tell us what you   re planning while we have a chance to talk it over .         you mentioned their laws of humanics .     derec nodded at ariel .      i don   t remember the exact wording  but their provisional first law of humanics was to the effect that humans wouldn   t injure another human or let one come to harm through inaction .         they just rewrote the first law of robotics .     jeff shrugged .      the second law of humanics might help us     said derec .     it says that humans must only give reasonable orders to a robot and not require anything that would distress it .  their third law of humanics is the best one for us  though .  it says that we must not harm a robot or let one come to harm through inaction  unless such harm is needed to help a human or allow a vital order to be carried out .         how do you want to use them .     ariel asked .      we need to violate the third law of humanics and maybe the second to prove that this isn   t a utopia even for robots .     derec looked at them both .     you follow me .         so far     said jeff .      how do we do that .     ariel asked .      basically  we have to convince our victim that my physical condition is his fault .          all right .     jeff nodded .     in other words  force it into shutting itself down because it thinks it has violated the first law .  that makes sense to me .  we have a better chance of that than of wrestling it to the ground .         how .     ariel demanded .     they aren   t exactly stupid .  they   ll know if they   ve harmed you or not .         we   ll have to play act a scene     said derec .     i haven   t really figured out the details .  maybe if it thinks it caused you two to attack me  or something like that .         i hear footsteps     said jeff .   derec got down low and carefully looked around the nearest plant  up the slope .  a lone humanoid robot was coming down the row .  derec gathered his feet under him and waited .      what are we supposed to do .     ariel whispered .      we   ll all have to improvise     he whispered back  gesturing with his hand .     quiet .      just as the robot reached him  derec threw himself forward to clutch at the robot   s legs .      stop .     derec called hoarsely  looking up at the robot   s face .  he didn   t have to fake his pain any  but he gave vent to it in his facial expression .     you hurt me .      the robot stopped  looking down at him .     if i did so  it was inadvertent .  i apologize .     the robot reached down to take derec under its arms and lift him .   at the contact  derec let out a scream and went limp .  he slid out of the robot   s grasp to lie on the ground face up .      you   ve killed him .     ariel screamed  jumping up .     you murderer  you   ve killed him .      derec struggled not to smile at her vehemence .  he lay with his eyes open  so he could follow what was happening .      looks that way     said jeff .     maybe you ought to shut down  pal .  you can   t go around violating the first law like that .      the robot was visibly quivering .     i did not harm him .  our contact was minimal and of very low impact .  this is a misunderstanding .  i will help him find care .         no .  don   t you touch him .     ariel shouted  waving her arms wildly .     you   ll do it again .         humans cannot die more than once     said     he robot .     besides  he is not dead .         he   s in very bad shape     said jeff .     it   s your fault .  do you understand that .      derec started grimacing and writhing in pain  with relatively little play acting required .      i .  .  . could .  .  . not have harmed him     the robot insisted .     my contact .  .  . with him .  .  . would not damage him .      the robot   s hesitation revealed his doubt .  derec was encouraged .  they just had to keep at it .      and no reporting to the central computer     jeff said suddenly .     i almost forgot .  you haven   t done that  have you .         no .  .  . i was .  .  . distracted .         well  don   t .  that   s an order .  second law .  got it .     jeff demanded  pointing a finger at him .      yes .  .  .  .         don   t you think you ought to shut down .     ariel said forcefully  her hands on her hips .     after doing this to him .         i am     not     convinced .         if you won   t shut down     said jeff     then we   ll have beat him up ourselves .  and that will definitely be your fault .         that .  .  . is illogical .         are you going to shut down or not .     ariel demanded .      no .  .  . i will not .  .  .  .         wait a minute     derec wheezed  trying to sound as injured as he could .     do you admit that you are in doubt about this .         yes .         then you should at least agree to come with us where we can discuss it further .         that   s right     said jeff .     you can   t argue that  can you .         good idea     said ariel  looking up the slope .     we  uh  don   t want to be interrupted .         carry me     derec said to the robot .     who are you  anyway .  and what do you do .         i .  .  . am pei     said the robot  with somewhat less hesitation .     my task is architectural designer .     he bent down and gently picked up derec .     where .  .  . shall we go .         we want to be out of sight of this row     said jeff .     but not too far .  uh  let   s cross that row and go to the other side .         very well     said pei .     however  we cannot go out of sight of this row unless we go some distance .  i see a slight dip in the row ahead that may suffice if we all sit on the ground .         perfect     said ariel .     c   mon  let   s hurry .      with pei carrying derec  the group moved quickly for the first time since they had left the minneapolis .  as they walked  derec relaxed a little and closed his eyes .  it was a relief to rest again  even for a few moments before they stopped .   pei set him down with extreme care .  then the others sat down around him on the damp  soft soil .      explain .  .  . my transgression .  .  . of the first law     said pei .  he began quivering a little more again .   derec  lying with eyes closed  felt guilty about distressing the robot this way .  he reminded himself  however  that the same robot was under avery programming .  he would turn them all in if the central computer or the hunters knew he was with them and instructed him to do so .   besides  he could be repaired or reprogrammed later with no lasting damage . l can   t  derec thought .  he opened his eyes .      you harmed me     derec asserted as firmly as he could .     shut yourself down .         at least for a while  you know  until you can be checked     said ariel .     that   s standard procedure  isn   t it .      her phrasing sounded lame to derec .  he realized that she felt guilty about this  too .      i .  .  . must be .  .  . convinced     said pei .     chapter     to challenge utopia    derec suddenly acted on another impulse .  with effort  he rolled onto his side and got his aching legs under him .  then he launched himself at jeff without warning  reaching for jeff   s throat as if he wanted to strangle him .   just as he got his hands around jeff   s neck  pei gently grasped his wrists .  even at the slight pressure  derec screamed and fell back  drawing his arms away with his hands limp .  then he collapsed to the ground with his eyes closed .      you did it again .     jeff cried  not too loudly .      you   ve really hurt him this time     said ariel .      this is an acceptable move     said pei .     i have prevented greater harm to this human by making a less harmful move to the one attacking him .  no violation of the first law has been made .     his confidence was returning .   derec opened his eyes  not otherwise moving .      uh .  .  .  .     jeff looked helplessly at ariel .      you overdid it     said ariel excitedly .     look at him .  that   s not called for .         that   s right     jeff declared .     stopping him with reasonable force is all right  but this is something else .      pei looked down at derec .     i .  .  . could not .  .  . have hurt him .  i .  .  . was .  .  . gentle .         not gentle enough     ariel wailed .     that   s twice you   ve hurt him .  you just don   t understand how fragile humans are .         that   s right     said jeff eagerly .     that   s the problem .  if you   ve never had contact with humans before  that explains it .  suppose you shut down till your judgement is fixed up .  or something .     he shrugged lamely at ariel .      it   s your judgement     ariel agreed     that must be faulty at the core  so to speak .  you can   t risk harming a human because of that  can you .         perhaps .  .  . you have .  .  . a point .     pei   s voice grew faint and he froze in place .      pei  are you awake .     ariel asked cautiously .      pei  if you can hear me  i order you to say so     said jeff .   when derec didn   t hear anything  he forced himself up on one elbow .     hey  it finally worked .         i guess it did     said ariel .      then it should work again     said jeff .     and now that we know what it takes  we can refine our scenario .         let   s get back over to that row they   re taking     said derec .     can you help me up .      yet again  jeff and ariel helped him to his feet and supported his arms over their shoulders .  the trio shuffled back to the one row that these humanoid robots were using for their trip down into the valley .  there derec once more sank to the ground .   jeff and ariel this time paced nervously between the high stalks on each side of the furrow .      maybe we ought to move on     said ariel .     isn   t one mugged robot enough .  i mean  one murdered human and one murdered robot caused major crises in robot city before .         that   s a good point     said jeff .     maybe we could drag him over here where the next migrating robot will be sure to find him .  but we could move on  keep ahead of the hunters .         i can   t help you drag him     said derec .     and he   s pretty big .  i doubt the two of you could get him all the way over here .      jeff ran a hand through his straight black hair and sighed .     you   re right .  it   s been a rough day already  and we may have a lot more running ahead .         one more robot     said derec .     that   s all we need .         what are you talking about .     ariel demanded .     if we just stand here and wait for the hunters  all this has been for nothing anyway .  we have to get out of here .           just one more robot .  instead of mugging it  we   ll just make sure it sees pei  back there .  then we   ll move on .         well .  .  . all right     said ariel .     we   ll wait a little while .  but if nothing comes before long  we   re leaving anyway .  agreed .         fair enough     said derec .     but remember  it has to be one robot walking alone .  i   m pretty sure that trying to fool more than one would be tougher because the others will observe and may spot the fraud .  let   s not chance that .      more robots did walk down the row before much time had passed  and all of them seemed to be migrating alone in the sense that they were not part of a crew or a team .  however  they often came down the row in sight of one or more robots behind them  and derec did not dare attempt their charade under those circumstances .      remember     said derec     not that much time has really passed for the hunters to get here .  it just seems longer to us than it has been because we   re scared .         here comes another one     said ariel  peeking around the leafy stalk on the corner of the row .     it looks good .  i don   t see anyone behind him yet .      jeff moved next to her to look .     hey  derec .  i think this is it .  we   ve got another one .         finally .  all right .  just before he gets here  i   ll throw myself on the ground and you jump on me .     he smiled wryly .     not too hard  okay .  i   m half dead already .         derec  don   t talk that way       ariel began .      hey   wait a minute     said jeff .     i know that robot .  it   s .  .  . what did i name him .  oh  yeah .  hey  can head .     jeff stepped out in front of the robot .   the robot stopped suddenly  looking at him in some surprise .     are you addressing me .         identify yourself     said jeff .      i am energy pack maintenance foreman          said the robot .     i am following migration programming .  please allow me to pass .         that sounds right .  i   m sure it   s you .     jeff nodded  studying the robot   s eyeslit and general shape .      jeff  what are you doing .     derec asked .      i knew this character     said jeff .     i even gave him a second name .  he was very cooperative .         they   ve all been reprogrammed     ariel said urgently .     we   re sure of it  remember .  he won   t retain anything from when you were here before .  let   s get on with it .         c   mon  pal  remember .     jeff grinned .     you will also answer to can head  won   t you .         yes .  i also answer to can head .      ariel laughed in surprise  stifling it with a hand over her mouth .      there .     jeff grinned at her and derec .   derec shrugged at ariel .      i   m the human who was in a robot body before     said jeff to can head .     i gave you that name and now i have further instructions .  first  don   t contact the central computer with any of this .  got it .     he winked down at derec .     i used to say that on my last trip here  too .         understood     said can head .      do you remember me .     jeff asked .      no .         you don   t .     jeff started .     then why do you still answer to can head .         i   ve got it     said derec .     all the robots of robot city were reprogrammed through the central core  but their identities and designations were not changed .  that would be counterproductive for avery because the central computer still has to be able to contact and recognize all the different robots .         i guess     said jeff .     i   m disappointed .  i thought i had an old friend  here .         that   s nothing     said derec .     you should have seen the greeting we got from euler  an old friend of ours .  he   s the one who sent the hunters after us .         anyhow  he   s being cooperative     said jeff .     maybe we don   t need our scenario .     he turned to can head .     we must show you something .  however  before we do  we request your help   no  we require your help under the first law .         how may i help .     can head asked .      this human is derec and he is extremely ill .  we           he looks it     said can head .      a comedian     derec muttered .      we need you to carry him for us for a while     said jeff .      why .         we .  .  . are being followed by those who would do further harm     said ariel  speaking slowly to get the right phrases .      exactly     said derec .      who are they .     can head asked .      we can   t say     said jeff .     but it doesn   t matter  does it .  harm is harm under the first law .         i am under high priority programming to migrate     said can head .     to violate it  i must understand the urgency of the potential harm .         hold it     said derec .     let   s combine the two .  look   you see where the ground dips over there .         yes .         an inactive humanoid robot is lying there .  after you take us to safety  we want you to report it to the central computer  but not before .  you understand .         so far     said can head .      before you do that  carry me and lead them on an evasive pattern toward your assembly point .  that will combine your programming with our needs under the first law .  can you do that .         my programming requires that i migrate directly     said can head .  he turned to look at the dip in the ground .     a humanoid robot has malfunctioned here .         sort of     said derec .     it   s more like he was mugged .         mugged .  in the sense of criminal violence .         that   s what i mean  yeah .      can head turned his eyeslit directly down at derec .     is this development directly related to the danger you are in .         uh   yes .  it is directly related     said derec .     but we don   t need to discuss how .  will you help us or not .         i believe this is sufficient reason to take you on an evasive pattern toward my assembly point .     can head leaned down and picked up derec with surprising gentleness  even for a robot .     follow me     he said to jeff and ariel .   derec let out a sigh of relief .  as long as they were moving ahead of the hunters  they had a chance  and an evasive pattern taken by a robot might at least be the equal of the hunters  ability to solve it .  it would be better than their own  at any rate .   he would instruct can head to drop them off before he reached his assembly point and to keep his contact with them secret .  at that time  he thought sleepily  he could cajole an explanation of the migration programming out of him .  right now  he was just so tired .  .  .  .   he was comforted by the strong  rhythmic stride of can head and by the sound of the footsteps of jeff and ariel right behind them .  news of the mugging of their victim was certain to reach dr .  avery .  what derec needed now was mandelbrot .  mandelbrot could contact the central computer and  unlike can head and the other avery robots  he could he trusted to help without these convoluted discussions of the laws .   mandelbrot .  .  . and wolruf .  he drifted off to sleep wondering what had happened to them .     mandelbrot was standing motionless in a repair facility .  the trip here had been a long one  covering a surprisingly long distance .  he had been deposited here just a moment before by the helpful robot .   he had successfully evaded the hunters behind him by dual moves .  the first was having that other robot carry him to eliminate his heat trail  and the second was being identified as a malfunctioning robot .  apparently the hunters  with no reason to believe he was in need of repair  were acting under the assumption that he was still in full flight .  he would have to move on before they thought of checking here .   mandelbrot also had to get out before the repair robots required his identification  and that would be any time now .   at first he had been surprised by being set down and left to wait .  the efficiency of the avery robots had led him to expect immediate handling .  as he observed the workings in the repair facility  however  he concluded that robot city was  as usual  functioning under its own distinctive style of efficiency .   the repair facility was processing a large number of damaged or malfunctioning robots .  mandelbrot guessed from the conversations he overheard through his comlink that migration programming had largely been completed .  apparently only skeleton staffs remained anywhere in robot city now .   for that reason  most repair facilities had also been shut down .  the robots being repaired here were either already assigned to those skeleton staffs or they were being reprogrammed .  those that entered with migration orders had them purged and were placed in a pool to act as reserves for the skeleton staffs instead .   so robot city intended to function without the migrating robots for an extended period .  further  any robot that did not reach its assembly point within a short time would be reassigned .  mandelbrot concluded that he could not afford to wait here longer at all  or he would risk being reprogrammed and so lost to the humans as a source of help .   mandelbrot was standing by four other robots .  two were sitting because of mechanical failures that impaired standing or walking .  the other two were standing  the extent of their malfunctions not visible .  all of them had managed to reach the repair facility alert and functioning just short of one hundred percent .   mandelbrot observed the entire room for a moment .  a couple of humanoid robots assigned to the facility supervised a large number of function robots doing the actual repair work .  one function robot was rolling down the row of waiting robots that mandelbrot was in  observing serial numbers or something with an eye on a long  flexible tentacle .   mandelbrot turned and walked quickly out of the building .  outside  he mounted a slidewalk and began to run on it toward the mountains  now invisible in the distance .  he knew their direction but had to follow his memory of the ship viewscreen for the best route .      stop     called a robot on his comlink .     you are malfunctioning and therefore endanger yourself by risking greater malfunctions .  this is a third law violation that requires you to shut down        mandelbrot broke his reception .  since he was in fine condition  none of that applied .  he had known they would see him take off  and he was gambling that they would not place as high a priority on catching him as the hunters had .  at worst  they would assign a hunter to catch him as a malfunctioned rogue instead of as an intruder involved with derec .   ahead  he saw a tunnel stop .  without looking back  he leaped off the slidewalk and ran down the moving ramp to the loading dock .  then he was inside a platform booth and had programmed it to go as close to the mountains as it could take him .   the trip would take some time .  he opened his comlink again to reconnoiter .   two general alerts were coming from the central computer with high priority codes .   one was that hunters were now seeking a malfunctioning robot who had apparently violated the third law by running away from a repair facility .  because the force of the laws was involved  all humanoid robots were ordered to watch for him .  his physical description was given .  since he had escaped from the repair facility before any scanning was done  they had no more to go on than that  but he was distinctive from the avery robots even by sight .   the second alert was that a mysteriously shut down humanoid robot had been found in the agricultural park .  nothing was known about the cause .  the supervisors entered an urgent order that any robots with information about this development report it immediately .   total malfunctions of this kind were extremely rare in robot city .  mandelbrot was sure that this one called up memories in the minds of the supervisors  and probably in avery himself  of the robot murder that derec had solved here .   mandelbrot  of course  was not bound by the instruction .  he was sure that his human friends were somehow responsible and he was also certain that the hunters would guess this  as well .  nevertheless  none of them had proof .   mandelbrot also figured that the hunters would guess that the rogue robot was the same one they were hunting .  it made no difference  since he had to avoid them either way .  he now felt the first law impetus pushing him on  since the hunters were likely to be closer to the humans than he was .   the platform booth continued to shoot down the tunnel toward the mountains .  it was the fastest transportation he had  and it seemed painfully slow .     chapter     jeff   s favor    derec heard ariel calling his name .  it came out of darkness  out of fog  out of chilly air .  .  . until he finally opened his eyes and found himself looking up at her with some thick  tall grass waving behind her in the dim glow suffusing the entire valley .  he said nothing at first  trying to remember where they were .  the surroundings were totally unfamiliar to him .      derec  please wake up .  we have to move again .     her voice was pleading .      come on .  i   ll help you .     jeff got an arm under derec and pulled him into a sitting position .      where are we .     derec asked  looking around .  his voice was dry and hoarse .     what   s happened .         you fell asleep while can head was carrying you     said ariel .     he   s gone now .         you   ve been asleep for some time     said jeff .     it must be the middle of the night by now .  it   s getting colder .      derec nodded  folding his arms and rubbing them .     but can head must have reported the mugged robot to the central computer  probably right after he left us .         as to where we are     said ariel     can head let us down through the valley floor  kind of zigzagging  and partway up the far slope .  i think we   re in a wheat field .      derec reluctantly let jeff pull him to his feet .  his whole body seemed to ache .  he leaned against jeff   s shoulder  breathing hard  trying to gain his balance .      we woke you up because we have to keep going     said ariel .     the hunters aren   t going to stop for the night .         have you got any more ideas  derec .     jeff asked .     avery should have heard about the mugging by now .      derec shook his head  still trying to wake up .     i don   t know what to expect .  i don   t know how long that news will take to have an effect  either .     he straightened up .     i meant to ask can head about the migration .  do you know where his assembly point is .         not really     said jeff .     he went sideways across the slope when he left  but i imagine he was heading back to that one thoroughfare they were all using .         we don   t dare try that     derec muttered to himself .   ariel suddenly clutched his arm .  she nodded toward something over his shoulder without speaking .   derec and jeff turned to look .  far across the same slope  a humanoid figure was just barely distinguishable in the distance  coming toward them .      let   s go     derec said  feeling a faint surge of excitement .     it   s not on the migration route  so it must be a hunter  and it   s sure to have seen us .  i   m afraid it won   t be long now .      the three of them started along the row in the opposite direction  but derec was just barely stumbling along .  as before  the others each supported one of his arms across their shoulders .  derec realized with frustration that he was now too far gone for even the adrenaline in his system to make much difference .   when they reached an intersecting row between the wheat field and a field of some low  bushy plants he could not recognize  jeff stopped and lowered derec   s arm .      look  we   ll have to split up .     he looked back at the hunter  which was still distant but visibly closer .      why bother .     derec said wearily .      maybe i can divert it somehow .  and if they get me first  i   m probably in the least danger from avery .  he doesn   t have any business with me .         he   s crazy     ariel said sharply .     you can   t expect rational behavior from him .         well  maybe not .  but splitting up is the best chance to keep derec away from him a little longer .  maybe avery will show himself in that extra time .      derec looked up to study his face .     you sure you want to take this much risk .      jeff grinned at him and shrugged .     hey  i said lowed you a favor  didn   t i .      derec gripped his arm for a moment in thanks  then turned and started up the slope .  ariel threw her arms around jeff in a brief hug and then hurried after derec .  jeff moved a few meters down the slope and then got down on all fours to crawl through the low bushes of the adjacent crop field .   derec leaned on ariel for support as they plodded slowly up the furrow between the fields .  in a moment  the tall green auroran bred wheat had hidden them from immediate view of the hunter  but it would have noted the trio   s movements and communicated them to the other hunters  wherever they were .     mandelbrot stood at the opening of one of the passes into the valley  looking out over the agricultural park .  it was dimly lit and he could just barely see  with his superior robot vision  tiny figures moving in the distance .  he paused to study the entire valley .   some of the taller and thicker crops blocked his sight  but he could see a couple of humanoid robots moving straight up a row on the far slope .  they were not behaving like hunters  and he suspected that they were migrating .  down in the valley floor  he saw two large robots moving systematically among the rows of the crops and was sure that they were hunters .   then  at another spot on the opposite slope  he saw a human figure crawling through one of the fields .  as he watched helplessly  a lone hunter ran up behind him and lifted the human off the ground .  from the lively struggle he saw he knew the human was not derec and he judged that ariel was smaller .   above the struggle a short distance  he located derec and ariel moving painfully and slowly as they wove their way among some short trees .   mandelbrot   s programming and his understanding of the dangers posed by dr .  avery placed derec at the highest of his priorities .  while the hunters were programmed with a narrow definition of duty that allowed them to detain humans without harming them  mandelbrot had a larger perspective and saw detention by the hunters as a first step toward virtually certain harm .  at the moment  he would have to ignore jeff   s capture and help derec and ariel if he could .  he noted the positions and current movements of the hunters he could see  and started quickly down the slope .     derec and ariel stumbled out of the far side of the fruit orchard onto a well traveled footpath headed straight up and down the slope .      i   m totally lost     derec wheezed .  he stopped  bending forward to lean on his knees .     but this must be the migration route again .  look at all the robot footprints .  this valley can   t have very much foot traffic .  and if it did  they would have paved this .      ariel nodded and prodded him up the slope  where the soft mud had been churned unevenly with the heavy use .  the irrigation was obviously turned on at regular intervals .     c   mon     she muttered breathlessly .   they had just started up the incline when a large figure stepped out of the crops above them .  it threw a massive shadow as it started down the slope toward them .  derec looked up at the great bulk of a hunter as it moved toward them carefully  watching its precarious balance on the poor footing .      come on .     ariel yanked him sideways back into the fruit orchard .     hurry .         i can   t     he whispered apologetically .     i   m too weak to hurry .     he followed her  though  until she halted abruptly a moment later .   another hunter was waiting for them in the trees ahead  a dark silhouette against the glow of light behind him .   they turned again and found two more hunters pushing through the trees  breaking branches and shaking leaves as they did so  coming right up the slope without bothering to follow any rows and furrows .  their very silence and dispassionate demeanor discouraged rebellion .   derec leaned wearily on ariel   s shoulders  unable to struggle .  she wrapped her amts around him  more for his sake  he guessed  than because she was scared .  he glared helplessly at the nearest hunter .   as he watched the hunter reaching for them he saw a weirdly flexible robot amt curl around the hunter   s neck from behind .  it made a couple of quick motions and the hunter froze  completely shut down .   derec blinked at it  too surprised to react .      run .     mandelbrot shouted  emerging from behind the hunter .  his cellular arm  which derec had long ago installed and ordered him to disguise as a normal robotic arm of the time  was just now stiffening back to normal .      come on .     ariel shoved derec past mandelbrot to put their protector between them and the hunters .   they began stumbling through the trees again  their hope renewed by mandelbrot .  ariel led him through a crooked trail  turning and twisting through the fruit trees in a clumsy  crashing route that ignored stealth entirely .  at one point derec got caught in a leafy branch and had to pause to get out .  he took the moment to peer back at mandelbrot .   four hunters had originally closed in on them .  mandelbrot had apparently pushed the controls on that first one to neutralize it and then had attacked the other three .  by attacking them  he brought the third law into effect  forcing the hunters to protect themselves .  this imperative overrode even the strongest programming  so that they could not continue their pursuit until they had subdued mandelbrot .   mandelbrot was outnumbered  but had the advantage of instructions to use his cellular arm .  further  in the close quarters among the trees  the greater size of the hunters impeded them .  the struggle continued  buying derec and ariel more time as they hurried on .   ariel led the way until finally he reached out and grabbed her  too out of breath to speak up .  she waited anxiously until he could  looking around fearfully .      where are we going .     he panted .      i don   t know .  anywhere .  just away .         mandelbrot can   t win that fight .  he can only slow them down .  then it   ll start allover again the same way .         have you got a better idea .     she demanded .   he nodded and got down on the ground among the trees .     i   ve been thinking about this park .  the way that robot path is chewed up by the footprints and all .  it means this park normally doesn   t have an erosion problem .         yeah  so .         so these crops still need water  and it   s obviously managed with their usual efficiency .  if this valley is irrigated by underground pipes or something  we   ve had it .  but i don   t think the robots would do that  because leaves need external moisture  too .         get to the point  will you .  or let   s go .         irrigation outlets .  this valley has to have them in some form .  if we turn them on  they   ll eliminate our heat trail .         well .  .  .  .     she knelt down beside him .     they could be anywhere .  and it   s dark .  besides  derec  this is a high altitude valley .  maybe the natural fog and rain take care of all that .         that would be leaving too much to chance .  we have to figure this out .         how .      he sat back and looked at her .  his legs no longer hurt  they were nearly numb .     all right .  instead of looking at random  we have to work it out logically  like the robots would .  where would you place irrigation outlets for the greatest efficiency .         how do i know .         well  i can hardly think at all .         all right  all right .  concentrate .  we   re on a slope .  .  .  .  derec  come on .  this way .      he nodded and forced himself after her  stumbling on feet he could hardly feel .   after a walk that seemed much longer than it could possibly have been  they stopped along a row between the trees that ran horizontally along the slope .  now derec was the one looking all around for hunters that could come from any direction .      they must use these furrows as a kind of terracing     said ariel .     i think we   re right in the middle of the vertical rows .  if they put the irrigation spigots near here  they would lose the least amount to runoff down the slope .  the same with fire control .         it sounds good to me     said derec  collapsing to the ground again .     let   s find it .         if it   s here     she added  joining him on the ground .      i got something .     derec   s hand had come across a small cylinder sticking up perhaps fifteen centimeters from the surface of the ground .  he got down low to look at it in the faint light .      now what .     ariel whispered  moving next to him .     it doesn   t have any controls or anything .  what if the sensors are somewhere else .         it   s possible     said derec slowly .     but look how high it is .  why would they do that .  they don   t do anything sloppily here  or without a reason .  they don   t waste material  either .         derec  we can   t just sit here and try to outguess them .  who knows .     she shook her head .     maybe we should just keep running  huh .      he shook his head .     this is the only real chance we have left .  come on  help me bury it .         what .         hurry .  why else would it be so tall .  this whole thing is its own sensor .  it probably judges air moisture and precipitation and who knows what .         how do you know .         i think they designed it at this height so it wouldn   t be covered by minor shifts in the soil during hoeing and other care .  if we cover it with dirt  it   ll stop sensing .  come on .     he was already scraping up the soft black soil  which the function robots seemed to keep turned constantly  and began packing it around the cylinder .   she joined him without further argument .  they found the soil damp enough to stick to the cylinder if they packed it hard  and before long it was covered .  derec wiped the dirt off his hands on some leaves .      now what .     she asked  wiping off her own hands .     nothing   s happening .        chapter     down a hole    at the far end of the valley  wolruf sat quivering in the chilly air .  she was huddled high in the mountains in a vertical crevice of rock .  this was the compromise she had reached for her conundrum  she was in the valley where she could try to observe the humans or even mandelbrot if they were here when day broke .  at the same time  she would not lead the hunters following her directly to them .   now she could not see any of them in the faint light down in the valley .  in the nearer regions below her  function robots were visible doing their regular chores among the crops .  her physiology kept her just warm enough at this altitude to remain for a while  but she was not comfortable .  nor did she have the energy left to run farther .   she waited patiently  reviewing the moves she had made to break her trail .  none of them could avoid a systematic search by the hunters if they were close enough to detect her heat .  also  the hunters probably had checked the pass at some point  because it was a bottleneck that could quickly tell them if she was inside the valley or out .   if her heat trail had faded before they had reached it  they still had physical signs to rely on .  she had been as careful as possible  but the robotic vision of the hunters could detect extreme detail .  the rest was up to them .   her ears perked up at the sound of footsteps on the rock fall below her .  with no more energy left for fleeing  she waited patiently .  the giant shape of a hunter emerged from the darkness  thrown into silhouette by the distant glow emanating from the crops below .  she knew it would not harm her  but it would take her prisoner and possibly deliver her to dr .  avery  who could certainly harm her if he wished .  she shivered as the hunter reached down to pick her up .     derec was staring disconsolately at the dirt covered sensor when it suddenly erupted in an uneven spray  knocking loose some of the dirt .  ariel and he both flinched .  all around them  other spigots were also spraying jets of fine mist into the air .      that   s it .     derec lifted his arms toward her .     let   s go .  can you help me up .      ariel took his arms and pulled .  his legs gave out under him .  she wasn   t strong enough to lift him .   she started to pull again .      i can   t walk any more .     his lower legs and feet had lost all feeling .      you can   t walk at all .     her shoulders slumped .      but i can crawl .  let   s go .         derec .  .  .  .         come on .     he started crawling through the soft earth  which was quickly turning to mud .   she stood and walked alongside him .     this is crazy .  we   re hardly getting anywhere .         we have a lot more time now .  the hunters can   t follow our heat trail so they   ll have to start a pattern search .  and at least one of them will have to carry mandelbrot after they   ve shut him down .         derec  you   ve only gone two meters .      he stopped  sighing  and looked ahead .  she was right .  he could barely move .     hey   what   s that thing .         what .     she looked  too .   some kind of large rectangular shape  at least a cubic meter in size  was emerging from the ground below the trees .      that .  .  . thing  there .  we haven   t seen one of those before .     he started crawling again .      there   s one behind us  too     she said .     and beyond that one .  they   re coming up all over .  they were completely hidden before .         we must have triggered them along with the irrigation .  go see what it is .      she hurried ahead and stopped in front of the object  bending low in front of it .  after a moment  she came back and knelt down .     i think we can get inside it .  it looks like a ventilation duct or something .      derec nodded .  he had stopped crawling to get his breath again .  his head was spinning dizzily .   when she got down on all fours and moved under him  he let her .  she gathered his arms around her neck and maneuvered under him .  then  supporting his weight  she began to crawl much faster than he had  carrying as much of his weight as she could .   he hung on with his arms and closed his eyes against the spray of water .      here     she said  after a few moments .   he opened his eyes into a gaping black opening with no other features .  as she eased out from under him  he reached inside and felt for the shape of the object .      it   s not a straight drop .     she helped him climb inside .     you can feel a gradual incline .      derec hesitated  too disoriented to speak but still reluctant to throw himself into an unknown hole .      go on  get in before the hunters see us .      he was losing all sense of his surroundings .  following directions was easier than arguing .  he worked his way inside the opening and then suddenly was sliding downward and accelerating .   all was in darkness .  he felt a rushing of air  the smooth pressure of the surface against his back as he slid  and ariel bumping against him from above as she slid with him .  vaguely  he realized he was too exhausted to feel any fear .   he should have been terrified of winding up in a moving fan blade  for instance  or in the workings of some mysterious robot creation that would convert them both to fertilizer .  apparently he had been on robot city too long for that .  the robots couldn   t allow that much danger to a human to exist here .   no  that wasn   t it  either .  the reason was even simpler .  nothing on this planet was more frightening than the chemfets destroying his body from the inside at this very moment .   the sensation of falling continued as they entered some turns  gradual curves  and finally reached a sudden upturn .   in the short ascent  gravity broke their momentum and then they slid backward again .  derec lay motionless  aware that they had stopped in the bottom of this thing  whatever it was .  no light reached them at all .   he felt ariel move a little  probably getting her bearings .      derec .     she said softly .     are you hurt .      a moment passed before he had the breath to answer .     no     he whispered .     but i   ve had it .         we   re safe now     she said  feeling for him and stroking his hair .     at least from the hunters .  i   m sure of it .  they   ll have to search the entire valley  and every one of these things .  and these were popping up every few meters  it looked like .  .  .  .  well  every fifty or sixty  anyhow .  without a heat trail to follow  it   ll take them forever .         i can   t do it .         but we   re onto him .  avery  i mean .  i   m sure of it .     she shuffled around and seemed to stand .     you know that upward curve at the end of our .  .  . little ride .  it   s here and not very high .  the duct continues on a level from here .  say  you know what else .  there are handholds of some kind on the side opposite the one we slid down .         maybe for service robots to make repairs down here .     he thought a moment .  the temptation to go on was strong .  confronting the crazy doctor after all the suffering he had endured .  .  . but he couldn   t move .  all he wanted to do was sleep .      i think you   re right     he said finally .     this is a ventilation duct .  from the size and number of them  it must lead to an immense living space .         avery   s home .  robots wouldn   t need it or the produce in the valley .  come on  let   s go .  i   ll help you up .         you   ll have to go on alone .  i honestly can   t move .      she was quiet a moment .     do you really want me to go on without you .         yes .         all right     she said slowly .  she waited  perhaps trying to think of something else to say .  then she got her arms around him and embraced him very hard  and held on .   he was too weak to respond .  after a moment  he felt her let go and stand up .  then she was climbing  and he heard her moving down the ventilation duct away from him .   he closed his eyes and slept .     ariel felt her way forward slowly with her hands as she crawled  not making any move until she knew what was ahead of her .  she was still in absolute darkness in some kind of giant tube that was so far stretching straight ahead on a level course .  with derec unable to move  she was painfully aware that she was the last of their group to have a chance at finding dr .  avery .   she was not exactly in top condition herself .  her hands and feet were painfully cold and she was drenched from the sprinklers .  she was worn out  too  though not sick like derec was .  the climb up the mountainside and down into the valley had taken a lot of energy out of her .   she hoped  with guarded optimism  that her memory was growing stronger .  those weird memory fugues had grown less frequent and she wished fervently that none would strike while she was alone in this thing  whatever it was .   she began to find branches and intersections in the passageway .  without any way to pick one direction over another  she attempted to go as straight as she could .  going in roughly one direction would at least prevent her from wandering hopelessly in circles .  she suspected that the intersecting tunnels represented those other openings on the surface they had seen .   after a while  she thought she had picked out a pattern .  from what she could feel  smaller tunnels seemed to converge more often and become larger ones consistently to her left .  she began to move leftward and discovered that the tunnels were now high enough for her to stand if she bent over .   now that she was moving in this direction  more tunnels converged around her all the time .  then they started branching out again  some of them splitting off above her .  finally she realized that she could see hints of shapes  dark spaces that represented openings one way  a faint reflection of an inner surface another way .   the traces of a light source shone from just one direction .   she dropped to all fours again to pursue the light source  now more concerned with making noise than with the height of the tunnel .   around a curve  she reached something recognizable  a covered opening into a room .  barely daring to breathe  she moved as quietly as she could toward it until she could peek through the opening .   it was nearly opaque .   the room was lit  but she couldn   t see much .  it was carpeted in brown .  nor could she hear anything .   after the silence had continued  she decided that she would have to risk entering the room .  she began studying the edge of the covering to see if she could get it loose .  in a moment  she found that pressure on the covering itself caused a hole to appear in the middle .  the substance  whatever it was  receded from the hole to fade outward into the surrounding wall until the vent was entirely open .   she let out a sigh of relief that the room was deserted .  it was still silent  as well .  after shifting around to get her feet out first  she dropped to the floor of the room and looked around .   it was a small room  perhaps only three meters cubed .  the brown carpeting went all the way up the walls and covered the ceiling as well .  the light came from a globe floating just under the center of the ceiling .   she looked again at the ceiling  then at the walls .  the room was not built on right angles .  the corners were slightly askew .   a couple of computer tapes were piled on the floor .  in one corner  a small stuffed animal of unrecognizable type lay on its side .  the room was not being used for anything that she could see .   this was not what ariel had expected from dr .  avery .   the door was closed .  she held her breath and pushed the stud on the wall next to it .  it slid open silently .   she remained where she was  waiting .  when nothing happened  she stuck her head out slowly .  she found a hallway extending maybe six meters one way and four the other .  the hallway itself was oddly shaped  but familiar   then she recognized it .  it was a hollow three dimensional rendition of the key to perihelion .   she stepped into the hallway .  the closed doors at each end of it were also shaped like the keys .  she chose one and walked toward it .   this one opened as she reached it .  she hesitated  then edged through .  her mouth dropped open in surprise .   this room reminded her of some ancient historical paintings she had seen .  the high vaulted ceiling was at least two stories high and hung with curtains of burgundy velvet .  imitation renaissance paintings in garish gold frames seemed to fit what she remembered of that period .  .  . or did they .  yet that furniture .  .  . was classic auroran design  developed many centuries later .  she looked up again  trying to orient herself .  .  . and shuffled quickly to one side to catch her balance .   this room was also askew .  worse than that  she guessed  it was not built on angles at all .  though the corners of the ceiling and walls were partly hidden by curtains  the whole room seemed oddly rounded  even twisted out of shape  as though the room had begun as a rectangle  had started to melt  and then had frozen again .   she started across the room to look more closely at the furniture .  after four steps  the floor gave out beneath her and she fell  sliding this time down a short  twisting chute .  she heard the trapdoor above her hiss closed again as she landed somewhere else with a thump .   this room was tiny  with just barely enough room for her to stand up .  it  too  was in the shape of the keys .  there was a door in each wall that was big enough  and nothing else .  the walls glowed with light  as in the compass tower .  she pressed a stud by one of the doors .   the door slid open to reveal a solid glowing wall .  she opened another one .  this door opened to reveal a dark  narrow hallway .  before trying it  she pushed another stud .   a weirdly sculptured face stared at her from an archaic red brick wall .  it had pointed ears  a long pointed face  and was laughing .  grimacing  she closed that one and tried another .   another dark hallway stretched in front of her .   she had to go somewhere .  with a glance at the other open doorway  she edged inside .  the walls here didn   t glow  and she slid her feet carefully along the floor before committing her weight forward .  after a few steps  the corridor began to curve .   a moment later  she had followed it right back to the same little room again .  ariel closed the doors to the circular hallway and stood inside the room .  it might not have an exit  of course  this was the work of a paranoid who   s tendencies had been openly revealed .  the room could just be a prison .      well  now what .     she said aloud .   a muffled response sounded behind one of the doors .  she pressed the stud and found herself looking at the grotesque sculptured face again .  all its features were exaggerated .      what did you say .     she demanded .      pull my nose     it said .      who are you .         pull my nose .         what happens when i do .         pull my nose .         is that all you can say .         pull my nose .      she watched it for a moment .     one  two  three .         pull my nose .      she figured it out  then .  this was a function robot without a positronic brain .  it had one line to say  triggered by any sound of human speech .   holding her breath  she pulled its nose .   the long  narrow nose stretched toward her and then suddenly snapped back  out of her grasp .  on impact  the entire sculpture collapsed into itself  inverted  and pushed itself out the other way .  then the brick wall broke into quarters and each piece receded sideways  carrying the inverted face with it .   she was looking down a short ramp into another corridor  this one lined with glowing stones cut in the shape of the keys but not in a smooth surface .  their corners protruded irregularly out of the wall to create a jagged  textured wall .  the entire shape of the corridor as she faced the opening was in the shape of the corridor as she faced the opening was in the shape of the keys  as well .   still stepping carefully  she ventured down the ramp .  after a moment  she realized that she was chillier than before   air was moving against her soaked clothing .  puzzled  she turned around   and found the walls  ceiling  and floor behind her converging to pinch off the corridor after she had passed .   she hurried forward a little  despite her caution  and came up against a stone wall at the end .  starting to panic  she ran her hands across the stones  feeling for a control of some kind .  she felt nothing and whirled around to look at the shrinking corridor .   suddenly something dropped from the ceiling in front of her and she flattened against the end wall  trying to see the object as it swayed before her face .  she recognized it as wolruf   s head  dangling on a long piece of rope tied into an ancient noose .   as she stared at it in horror  she realized that it was only a function robot rendered in realistic detail .      why arr    u    err .     the robot asked  in wolruf   s voice .   ariel   s spine prickled at the sound .  she glanced behind the hanging head .  the corridor had stopped closing behind her and now had left her in a very small dungeonlike space .      wrong answer     said the robot  though she hadn   t spoken .   suddenly the floor rose under ariel   s feet  pushing her up toward the ceiling .  the rope retracted with her  keeping the wolruf head level with her as she rose .  the ceiling opened and then the section of floor stopped  now flush with the floor just above the stone corridor .   the abrupt halt threw her off balance and she fell on a rich  gold carpet .  above her  five elaborate chandeliers sparkled and shone from a surprisingly low beamed ceiling .  she rose up on her elbows  looking around fearfully .   she was in a library .  shelves of antique books  not computer tapes  stretched around all the walls and were protected by a transparent barrier of some kind .  turning  she stepped off the lift platform away from the wolruf head .   a candelabra of some sort was on a shelf outside the transparent barrier that protected the books .  it stood inside a blue and white bowl  leaning to one side .  the candelabra was on a round base  with one central stem holding one candle and four branches arching upward on each side to total nine .  she had never seen one before  whatever it was  and thought it seemed out of place here  as though someone had set it down and forgotten it .   she stepped back and looked at the bowl .  it was large enough to serve four or five people plenty of food .  light blue designs danced around the white background on the outside .  it had never been meant to hold a candelabra  though .  someone had left these here carelessly .      what iss it .     the wolruf head asked .   ariel flinched at the sound and looked at the head .     a candleholder of some kind  obviously .         wrong again .      one of the shelved walls glided away soundlessly .  she stood where she was  eyeing the dark opening that appeared .  an animal   no  a function robot  almost certainly   stepped into a space where light fell on it .  it had wolruf   s caninoid body and ariel   s own face .      if you   re standing on the surface of the planet earth in webster groves  missouri     said the robot ariel     which way is robot city .      she stared at it hopelessly .     i   m no navigator .  not without some kind of information to use  anyway .      robot ariel cocked her head  turned  and trotted away .   the wall of shelves slid back into place .   ariel sank to the floor in a mixture of relief and despair .  she couldn   t just go on wandering aimlessly in the real life manifestation of one man   s insanity .  if this place offered a way out  she could figure it out .  if it didn   t  she might as well stay in this room instead of going forward into some dungeon cell or something worse .   as before  her knowledge of dr .  avery was the only source of clues she had  and she no longer had jeff   s memories or derec   s facility with robots to help .  all right .  basically  what did she know .   she knew he was a genius  that he was paranoid  that he wanted to create a perfect society .  but what did this crazy place have to do with order and rationality .  what was it doing on robot city .   everything she knew about robot city said that this place just didn   t belong here at all .  the more she thought about it  the more she realized that every line of thought brought her back to that one conclusion .     that   s it     she whispered to herself suddenly .     he   s gone over the edge .  he   s even crazier than before .      in the heart of a planet wide city based on logic and efficiency  its creator had lost his mind .   she smiled at the irony .  it wasn   t funny  exactly  but it was .  .  . funny .  somehow .   exhaustion and fear made her giddy .  she began to giggle .  the more she thought about this   about all their discussions of the laws of robotics and all their convoluted efforts to reason with the positronic brains of the robots   and how it had led to this .  .  .  . she really began to laugh .  she fell onto the floor on her back  laughing in the little room by herself .   the wall of shelves slid open again  apparently triggered by the sound of her laughter .   suddenly on guard again  she sat up and looked around .  the function robot with her face was back .      if you   re standing on the surface of the planet earth in webster groves  missouri     said the robot ariel again     which way is robot city .      ariel giggled again .     up  of course .     she laughed   and the floor gave way beneath her .   she was in one more chute  twisting in a tight downward spiral .  just as it began to level off  the dark space ahead of her irised open into light .  she spilled out onto a polished hardwood floor .   shaken by the ride  she lay still for a moment gazing at a very high beamed ceiling that was nearly lost in shadows .  she turned her head to the side and found walls of gray stone  precisely chiseled and fit again in the modular shape of the key to perihelion .  the room was huge  stretching meters on each side of her .   she raised onto her elbow  still getting her bearings .  the end of a large  intricately carved table was in front of her .  its legs and feet were sculpted in the shape of some furry  clawed animal she did not recognize .  it was made of a dark  deeply polished wood .   struggling to rise  she reached up and grabbed the edge of the table .  she pulled herself up to lean on it and then froze in surprise .  at the far end of the table  many meters away  a man sat in a high  straight backed chair with a gigantic fire blazing behind him in a stone fireplace twice her height .      welcome  ariel .  i am dr .  avery .      she stared at him with nothing to say .  after all the effort to find him  landing here like this was so unexpected that she hadn   t formed any plan of attack  any arguments to use with him .  she wasn   t ready to talk to him .      you are welcome to warm yourself by the fire     said her host .   she was willing to stay chilly to keep away from him  but she wanted to stall a little if she could  without getting too close .  slowly  she moved around the corner of the table and began to walk down the side of it .  dr .  avery seemed relaxed  even unconcerned  as he fingered some small object in front of him on the table .   the long  narrow table had all kinds of articles on it  flowers  dishes  trinkets  small sculptures .  she didn   t dare take the time to look .  her eyes remained on dr .  avery .   he was short .  looking especially so in the high backed chair .  his build was stocky .  wavy white hair framed his face  which was also adorned with a bushy mustache .  he looked friendly and benign .   his coat was too big  as she remembered from the other times she had seen him  and he still wore a white shirt with a ruffled collar .   he didn   t look crazy .   ariel stopped a good four meters away  still watching him .  what was a crazy man supposed to look like .      i was not expecting visitors  ariel     said dr .  avery .  he was still studying the object in front of him .     though i had warning that oddities  shall we say  were occurring in this vicinity .      he didn   t sound crazy  either .      ariel  you don   t remember me  do you .     his gaze remained on the table .      yes     she said timidly .      no  not really .  you remember me after the performance of hamlet and when the hunter robots located all of you in the passageways beneath the city and you remember me from when they brought you to me .  that   s all .         that   s when we met .      he smiled and picked up the little object .     automatic alarms were triggered tonight .  a couple of them  in fact .  when a man who enjoys his privacy feels it may be disturbed  he likes to have alarms installed .  did you trigger them  ariel .      she watched him silently  surprised by his changing subjects so quickly .      a humanoid robot mysteriously shut down completely just a short distance from here .  then a shift in the soil was reported .  did you do those  ariel .         kind of .  i guess .         you guess .  i guess  too .  violations of the provisional laws of humanics .  perhaps .  i haven   t yet investigated the details .  but how did you enter my abode .      derec was lying helpless along her route .  she didn   t dare answer that question .      one of the few weaknesses in my security here is in my emergency ventilation system .  it opens when unexplained malfunctions occur in this valley .     he sighed .     i could have had the robots make it entry proof  but it happens to represent my escape routes  as well .  if no one could get in that way  then i couldn   t get out that way  could i .         what do you want .     she demanded  hoping to get him off that subject .     what is all this about  anyway .         of course  i do have a maze that one must negotiate .  it acts as a buffer zone .  perhaps you managed that .      she was shaking with tension  unable to get a handle on a conversation that kept jumping topics .      by the way  i   ve misplaced a couple of items .  have you seen them .  one is an antique menorah crafted in the ancient earth empire of the czars .  the other is a ming dynasty bowl .      she stared at him  vaguely remembering a fancy bowl .      you really don   t remember me  do you  ariel .         why do you keep saying that .         you have new memories now  clearly .  you are not the ariel i last saw .  you are again the real ariel  if you only knew it .  a few more accurate memories will trigger the rest  i believe .         what are you talking about .         your memories now are accurate .  it is the real you .  the one you thought was you .  .  . no .  you never knew a spacer who contaminated you .  you never had a disease .  you will  i sadly suppose  recall the name .  .  . david avery .     for the first time  then  he looked up and met her eyes .   david avery .  david .  derec .  .  .  .   suddenly memories did come flooding back .     david .  derec is david .  and you hated me .         oh  now  now .  what i attempted with you failed .  bygones are bygones  eh .         you .  .  . what have you done .     she was horrified  yet fascinated .  finally  after such a long time  the mysteries were being answered .     oh  no .  wait a minute .  is derec really david .  .  . or what about the corpse .  was that david .  did you kill him .     she was nearly hysterical  partly from the shock of understanding .      no  no  of course not .     he waved a hand in dismissal .     the corpse  as you call it  was merely a synthetic physical imitation of david .  a good one  of course  that used genuine human blood .  i used him in a dry run test of david   s encounter with robot city .      ariel  still quivering with tension but now composed again  leaned against the table for support .     so you planted memory chemfets and disease in me a long time ago to give me a false memory .  memories of events that never existed to replace my memories of real life .  and .  .  . derec is david .         and you were his lover .  oh  by the way  didn   t you ever wonder what happened to the corpse .  the cleaning robots recognized it as nothing more than waste material and hauled it away .         you destroyed my memory     she said again  slowly .     and his .  the amnemonic plague was artificial  created by chemfets .  it was you .  to separate david and me .  you must have given him his amnesia for the same reason .         i always knew you had intelligence .  my son   s taste was always exceptional .         and ever since my memory returned on earth  i withheld telling derec the truth because i was afraid these memories might not be correct .  all this time  i could have put his mind at ease if i had only trusted my memories .         a compliment .  consider my actions a compliment .  breaking your hold on my son   s will required extreme measures .  judge it as the extent to which he cares about you .     he leaned back in his chair  holding the little item he had been playing with .     cared  i should say .  he doesn   t remember even now  of course .  .  . but he does seem to have formed an affection for you allover again  seen by the way you two have remained a team .         you practically destroyed two people just to keep them apart .     her anger was mixed with sheer astonishment .      ah  no .  sorry .  you are not so important as you think .  my other motive was to test my son   s resourcefulness .  you see  if he succeeded in manipulating and controlling robot city  then he was truly worthy of my final plan for him .         final plan .  .  .  .  do you mean to say     she said slowly     that you wiped his memory and placed him on that asteroid as a test .         it is what i mean to say and what i have said .     he sat up and for the first time his face reflected enthusiasm .     you see  robot city has been finished .  now each of the humanoid robots here has had implanted in his body .  .  . one or two duplicate keys to perihelion .  even now  they are marching to predetermined sites around this planet from which they will launch themselves to different galaxies .  in each galaxy  they will begin replication of themselves and construction of more robot cities .  and david  my son who has now earned the right to act as my son  will control each and every robot in every robot city .  .  . making him the most powerful man in the universe .         he what .  how .         the chemfets  my dear .  the memory chemfets in his body .  you see  a tiny robot city is growing inside him .  .  . and when it matures  his mere thoughts will control every avery robot in the universe .         oh  no .  .  . you are insane .  you don   t know what   s happened to him .         of course i do .  the chemfets develop slowly and cause certain physical disabilities .  i know that .  they behave like a disease and can even cause the formation of antibodies in the bloodstream .         you   re murdering him .  he   s almost dead now .         oh  nonsense .  the chemfets didn   t kill you  did they .  i wouldn   t kill him  would i .  after all this .  why would i throw away all this effort .         but you   re wrong .  your chemfets for me were much simpler .  he   s dying .         where is he .      she paused  suddenly realizing the dilemma that derec and she had never solved .  they could not force dr .  avery to cooperate .  he had to be convinced .      the central computer is calling .  for several moments now  i have ignored a little light on my table here .  i have done so because i know what it signifies  i believe .  excuse me  will you .      ariel stared at him  amazed at his composure and his refusal to believe her .   a small section of the table in front of dr .  avery swiveled to reveal a computer console on what had been the underside of the table .     would you like to hear .     he pushed a button .     i   ll set it on voice  which i usually find intrusive .  report     he said into the console .      hunters report apprehension of human named derec .         thought so     said dr .  avery pleasantly .     report status of hunter project .         the following have been apprehended and are held on the north slope of the valley  derec  jeff leong  mandelbrot  wolruf .  still missing  ariel welsh .      dr .  avery laughed casually .     now  who would have thought i could outperform my own team of hunter robots .      ariel   s heart was pounding with tension .  if derec was already in avery   s control  very little risk was left .     dr .  avery .  will you agree to a test .         eh .  what kind of test .  haven   t we had enough testing around here for a while .         have the robots check david and see if he is in danger from the chemfets .  they   ll tell you .         a party     said dr .  avery .     an excellent idea .  i   ll have the hunters bring everyone .  we   ll have a party .     he tossed the object in his hand over his shoulder into the fire .   ariel saw it clearly for the first time .  it was a small model of a humanoid robot .     chapter     to rule in robot city    ariel watched the gray stones  or whatever they were  in the wall dissolve into air for a moment and the hunters brought in their captives through the opening .  the first one carried derec gently in his arms as though he were a giant baby  but limp and unconscious .  the second entered holding jeff leong firmly by one upper arm as they walked .  the third held wolruf cradled on one elbow and the fourth marched in with mandelbrot lying over his shoulder  completely shut down .   the stone wall reformed behind them .      clear the table     said dr .  avery .     don   t worry about where the stuff goes .      the hunter carrying mandelbrot laid him down on the floor and then extended his arm along the full width of the table at the far end .  he then walked down the length of the table as his arm knocked everything it struck onto the floor .  by the time he had reached the near end  dr .  avery had himself swept aside the items within his own reach .   ariel watched in horror .  she had never seen a humanoid robot act so messily  even destructively  on a casual instruction .  this one must have known that dr .  avery wanted to be taken literally and did not want him to remove the items on the table with any care .      put him down .     dr .  avery nodded to the hunter holding derec .  then he waved at the one carrying mandelbrot .     and turn him on  will you .  this won   t be much of a party with so many people feeling unsociable .      ariel felt some relief as the hunter located mandelbrot   s controls and activated him again .     mandelbrot  tell him .  tell dr .  avery what   s happening to derec .      mandelbrot scanned the room quickly .  his observation probably told him as much about the current situation as ariel already knew .     dr .  avery     he said clearly .     derec has undergone extreme physical debilitation that continues to increase .  he believes that the chemfets you placed in his body are killing him .  my observation of his symptoms confirms that likelihood .         doesn   t anybody here want to have a party .     dr .  avery sighed .     everyone is so morbid .  say  mr .  leong .  haven   t we met before .  not lately and not on this planet  however .         that   s right     jeff said sullenly .     you were more sociable in those days  yourself .      dr .  avery pushed back his chair and stood up .  trailing the fingers of one hand along the table  he walked down its length looking at the motionless figure of derec .     he has done very well .  i have not given him any challenge he cannot surmount .         till now .     ariel insisted .     how can you take a risk like this .  even your own robots wouldn   t risk his life for a test .      jeff  wolruf  and mandelbrot all looked at her in surprise .     oh  i don   t think he   ll have any trouble .  he   ll be fine .     dr .  avery nodded to himself .      aren   t you even going to test him .  check him out in your laboratory .     she cried .      he   ll be fine .  let   s have a party .     dr .  avery turned to the hunter who had brought derec in .     take him to one of the guest rooms  though .  we can   t have a party with a guest lying motionless on the dining table  can we .         hold it .     ariel got between derec and that hunter .     can   t you understand that he   s dying .         pick him up     dr .  avery ordered .   the hunter gently but firmly moved ariel aside and lifted derec .  she threw her arms around derec   s shoulders and hung on .     wait .  mandelbrot  they   re letting him die .      mandelbrot was standing by the hunter who had brought him in .  that hunter  however  had one hand resting on mandelbrot   s open control panel .  at the slightest resistance from mandelbrot  the hunter would shut him down again .   the next sequence of events took place very quickly  some of it timed by the speed of positronic brains .   suddenly jeff  who was still held by one hunter  reached over and started grabbing mandelbrot   s hunter by the neck  feeling around quickly for his controls .  the hunter  required by the third law to protect himself  grasped jeff   s arm in his other hand .  in the tiny fraction of a second that the third law imperative was foremost in the hunter   s mind  mandelbrot stepped away and closed his own control panel with his flexible cellular arm .   from the moment mandelbrot was free  the battle was on .  his belief that derec   s life was in danger forced him under the first law to take ariel   s anxiety seriously .  at the same time  the hunters believed dr .  avery   s declaration that derec was not in danger  so under the second law they followed their orders from him to detain and control the others .   mandelbrot also shot out an array of information through his comlink to the hunters .  he told them of derec   s delicate condition  of ariel   s memory failures  of their physical hardships .  in the tiny instant it required  he demanded that they back away from derec and ariel immediately or risk major violations of the first law .   he did not know if it would work  but even the slightest hesitation and doubt on their part would help .   even as mandelbrot sent these signals  he moved toward derec .  ariel let go of derec to grab the hunter holding him  knowing that the hunter would be impeded by the necessity of not harming derec or her .  in a couple of quick moves  mandelbrot   s flexible arm had shut down this hunter in a motionless standing position  still holding derec .  mandelbrot and ariel lifted derec and placed him back on the table .   one hunter had now taken wolruf and jeff under each arm and had lifted them into the air where they squirmed helplessly .      you   re hurting me .     jeff shouted .     first law violation .      the hunter was not convinced .      stop them .     dr .  avery screamed .     don   t hurt them  but stop them .  and don   t collide with david .  his condition is too fragile .         you   ve got to believe us .     ariel shouted  turning to plead with him .     you don   t want him hurt  either .  just test him .      they stood face to face now and ariel saw a strangely twisted expression on his face .  it was an angry smile of triumph .  for the first time since meeting him  she understood that he truly was crazy   and beyond persuasion by reason .      you did this .     dr .  avery hissed in her face .     without you  these extremes would not have been necessary .  leave him alone .         how dare you blame this on me .     she screamed  and in a mixture of frustration  rage  and exhaustion she lost her temper completely .  unbound by any laws except her conscience  she launched herself at him angrily  grabbing his sideburns in both hands .   one of the four hunters had been shut down .  another was holding jeff and wolruf away from mandelbrot .  mandelbrot was trying to reach the unguarded control panel of this one with his flexible arm while using his other arm to grapple with the other two hunters .  with all the robots    attention focused on each other across the room  they did not notice or respond to the potential harm ariel and dr .  avery might do to each other .   dr .  avery grimaced in pain and growled at her as they shuffled around in a tight struggle .     deep in the darkness of derec   s mind  robots marched .  he was lying on his back in darkness as robots stepped in rhythmic time with a precision only robots could maintain .  they strode by him in files that split at his feet and tramped past him on either side  their heavy feet pounding by his head .  he was ignored  insignificant  not even present in their positronic awareness .   out of darkness  the robots marched .  a slight glow of skyline shone behind them but mostly he could see only a bloodred sky above  one that had never really existed  where space stretched endlessly beyond the planet .  still the robots streamed past  intent on their destination with that single mindedness so evident in the avery creations .   avery .  avery .  avery .  the beat of pounding feet seemed to take on the name .  it was name of his enemy  the name of .  .  .  of .  .  .   his dream shifted .  even as the robots continued to march  he watched strange green shapes  some cubic and some pyramidal  rising in the air around him .  when he reached for them  missing  he floated up after them .  they turned  light shining off their different facets as they rose .  he snagged one and it became a computer console under his hands .   he was floating higher in the air now .  the blood night of robot city threw its myriad streets into a golden glow without logic or explanation  and    still the robots marched .  his fingers seemed to type without thought from his mind     stop them .         no     answered the central computer .      stop the city .         no .         why not .         who are you .         i am i am i am .  .  . who am i .         where are you .         i am .  .  . robot city .         error .  i am robot city     said the central computer .     who are you .         who am i .         you are david avery .         i am david avery .     derec stared at the name on the dream console .  the dream console was green  made of a floating pyramid like a tiny compass tower .  .  . made of a chemfet .   he looked around .  this wasn   t the real central computer .  the blood red sky told him how small he was .  he was floating in his own bloodstream  watching chemfets and robot city grow inside him .  .  .      i am david avery     he typed .     i am david avery .  this is my bloodstream  my body  my .  .  . robot city .         acknowledged     said the central computer .   the robots stopped marching .  he floated in the air high above them now and looked down on the endless rows of robots .  every single avery robot on the planet raised its head to await derec   s commands .   he raised his head and shouted     robot city is mine .  i am david avery and i am robot city .      at his shout  the sky split .  the scene dissipated .  he blinked and gradually heard more yells and scraping sounds around him .  a chandelier was blazing over him .  he took in a deep breath   and realized that  for the first time in a very long time  his body felt normal .   his mind was clearing slowly as he came awake .  his body was tired  and cold with dampness  but the weird stiffness was gone .  he was no longer in physical danger .      derec .     ariel yelled .     you   re awake .  tell him .  tell avery what   s happening to you .      avery .  with a surge of fear and anger  derec sat up and found himself on a long table .  he turned .  ariel and his father  dr .  avery  were scuffling around in a circle .      i   m all right     derec said hoarsely .      what .     ariel looked at him in surprise .     then help me .         no .     dr .  avery roared .     no .  this is not right .  you must help me .         help you .     derec shouted angrily .     you   re crazy .         kill them .     dr .  avery screamed at the hunters .     kill them .  you must kill them or everything will be for naught .      ariel pulled free of him and turned toward the two hunters who were still functioning  mandelbrot had succeeded in shutting down a second one .     dr .  avery is mad .  you understand .  he   s .  .  . he   s malfunctioned .  you remember the laws of humanics that the supervisors were trying to devise .      dr .  avery had backed away toward the fireplace .     you must save us .     he shouted at the hunters .     kill them .         listen to him     ariel called out  now more in control .     his orders violate the first law .  you can   t trust his orders any more .  orders that violate the laws of robotics also violate the second law of humanics  which says humans will not give robots unreasonable orders .  listen to him  and you   ll understand that he can   t be followed anymore .     if the hunters had learned how she and jeff and derec had shut down pei  they wouldn   t listen to her  either .   the remaining hunters had not moved .  one held jeff and wolruf .  the other was in a stand off with mandelbrot  as each tried to reach the manual controls of the other to shut him down .      acknowledged     said the hunter holding jeff and wolruf .     dr .  avery   s instructions cannot be followed .  however  the central computer also directs us .  we are still under orders to detain the members of your group without harming them .      dr .  avery had cowered into a corner  still shouting .      i am robot city now     said derec .     the chemfets in my body have matured and i have reprogrammed them .     he visualized the computer console in his mind .  maybe he wouldn   t always have to do that  but right now it made the task easier .     central computer     he thought .     eliminate the orders to the hunter robots regarding derec or david avery  ariel welsh  the robot mandelbrot  and the caninoid alien wolruf .  then notify all pertinent robots of the change .     then aloud he said     hunters .  a new order should come through to you           acknowledged     said the hunter in front of mandelbrot .  he straightened  dropping his guard     acknowledged     echoed the other hunter  releasing jeff and wolruf .      i received it also     said mandelbrot .      now  then     said derec  turning to dr .  avery .   dr .  avery was standing in the corner of the room to one side of the giant fireplace .  as the others turned to watch him  he drew himself up .     consider what you have accomplished  my son     he said .     think of it .  everything i envisioned to this point has come to pass as i intended .  well  almost   never mind this young woman .  you rule in robot city .  soon you will rule in every robot city  in thousands of them throughout all the galaxies .      a stinging sadness came over derec  draining his anger .     you   re .  .  . not right .  not right in the head .  you started out seeking a utopia and instead you   ve gotten sidetracked .  this has become a springboard for power  not for good .  maybe if you took it easy for a while  got some professional advice .  .  .         you dare to order me .     dr .  avery yelled .     no .  you join me .  i order it .         i   m not a robot .  you can   t order me .     derec turned to the hunters .     please detain my .  .  . detain dr .  avery without harming him .      the two hunters started forward .   with a twisted sneer  dr .  avery lifted a small object in one hand  a key to perihelion .  he laughed derisively and then vanished .   derec walked slowly to the head of the table  still looking at the space where dr .  avery had stood .  his relief was tinged with melancholy at understanding his father   s condition .   everyone was watching him .   he turned at his father   s chair  resting one hand on the back of it .     mandelbrot  please put those items on the floor back on the table .  hunters  your task is over .  please return to your holding area  or wherever you normally reside .      the robots obeyed .      are you really okay .     ariel asked  moving toward him .     david .      he grinned and put his arm around her .     i guess so .  david seems to be okay  and so is derec .         i seem to be okay  too .     she put her arms around him and they embraced .     none of them wanted to split up for the night or go exploring for bedrooms in the avery estate .  as tired as they were  derec  ariel  jeff  and wolruf were able to sleep by the fire even on the hard floor .  derec knew that dr .  avery might have transported elsewhere on the planet and could still pose a danger  but he doubted any threat would be immediate .  just before going to sleep  he gave a general order throughout robot city that all robots were to remain where they were until further notice  except for minimal activities to keep the city operating .  that way he would have time later to figure out exactly what status the city was in and how to return the robots from their assembly points to normal duties .  with mandelbrot standing by and robot city under his own mental control  he fell into a genuine sleep .   the next morning  ariel pointed out the table console to derec in case he had a use for it .  he really didn   t  finding that he was able to contact any branch of the computer system on the planet with his mind .  this morning he started with the one in dr .  avery   s kitchen .   the entire group  including mandelbrot  sat at the long table with a real breakfast served by two kitchen robots .  it included fresh produce and dishes processed from produce instead of from limited nutrient tanks .  derec and ariel shared their separate adventures with everyone  then wolruf and jeff gave their stories .  since mandelbrot had been shut down for much of the time they had been separated  he had little to tell .   when the anecdotes had ended  derec sat at the head of the table in an upbeat mood  thinking over his new responsibilities .      i guess i can have the central computer worry about the particulars of what i have to do     he mused .     if i instruct the central computer to return all the robots to their normal duties  it will do all the organization itself .         but you can really control it with your mind .     ariel asked .     and you can program robots mentally  too .         apparently i can .  i   m still getting used to the idea myself .         to all your human attributes     said mandelbrot     you have now added some of the advantages of a robot .       jeff laughed .     without the liabilities  if you know what i mean .     he winked .   while the others laughed  derec was aware of a message in his mind from the central computer  answering a question he had posed .      no evidence of dr .  avery on the planet has been reported     said the central computer .   if dr .  avery was here at all  derec realized  he now had all the disadvantages they had had while on the run from him .  they now had all the resources he had used .  even more  considering that they were not burdened by insanity .   considering dr .  avery   s paranoia  derec felt certain that he had left the planet .  maybe he had gone home to aurora .  perhaps he had returned to his apartment on earth  or had other hideaways in reserve  as well .      thank    u     said wolruf .     good brreakfasst .  could sleep morr now .         i believe we can locate comfortable sleeping rooms here     said mandelbrot .     the luxury of this room and this meal imply similar luxury elsewhere in this residence .         i   ll find a way to shut down the booby traps and riddles     said derec  grinning at ariel .   she laughed .     it   s hard to believe .  for the first time  robot city will be at peace  running smoothly  and no longer full of mystery .         and you have plenty of keys to perihelion with which to travel     said mandelbrot .     perhaps wolruf can be sent home .      she shrugged her caninoid shoulders .     resst first .         i wonder what kind of shape the ship is in     said jeff .     i only rented it .         don   t worry     said derec .     i   ll have the minneapolis fully repaired  cleaned  polished  and outfitted for you .  we   re more than square for any debt you felt you owed us .  but you   re welcome to stay as long as you want .         thanks     said jeff .  he shook his head  grinning .     robot city .  it   s never been a dull town .      when everyone had finished breakfast  jeff and wolruf excused themselves to accompany mandelbrot in further exploration of dr .  avery   s immense quarters .   later  after function robots had cleared the table and derec and ariel were alone in the great hall  he stood gazing into the fire that continued to blaze .  he still felt melancholy .      is something wrong .     ariel asked quietly .      oh .  .  . i was just thinking about dr .  avery .  how his wonderful plans got all twisted .  and how after researching cultures with professor leong and all  he just seemed to drop that subject after a certain point .  he is obviously a brilliant man  yet he threw so much away .     he looked up at her .     i found out something  too .         what .         i   m not sure we stopped him in time after all .  from what i can get out of the central computer  i think some of the robots may have launched themselves from their assembly points before i cancelled that instruction .      ariel drew in a quick breath .     if that   s true  then they will be building more robot cities  just as dr .  avery wanted .  and who knows what precise orders he gave them .         i may be able to find that out in the computer     said derec .     maybe i can even call them back somehow  i won   t know till i spend some time on it .  but there   s something else .         what .  what   s wrong .         i have my identity back  but .  .  . i still have amnesia .  i don   t have all my memory back .     he turned to look at her .     finding my father wasn   t exactly constructive .         maybe you could .  .  . oh  i don   t know .  perhaps locating your mother would help .  or some of the avery robots might know of a way to help .  just think how much help you might get from robot city and even the robots that may have left .      derec nodded .     i haven   t given up .  don   t worry about that .     he grinned .     that isn   t me .  and from what i   ve seen  it isn   t you  either .         it certainly isn   t .  .  . david .      ariel laughed  looked into his eyes  and tossed her hair back .  on an impulse  he slid his arms around her waist and drew her close .  then he kissed her waiting lips and felt her arms tighten around his neck .       isaac asimov s robot city continues with robot city      in which derec is summoned to a distant planet and encounters a robotic experiment fantastically different from anything he has seen on robot city .     data bank    cargo robot  not all of the robots of robot city are positronic in nature .  many of those whose jobs are especially simple have been equipped with brains that are more like computers than like robot brains .  these function robots are analogous to the tools used by positronic robots .  they are incapable of real thought  they are also not bound by the three laws of robotics .   the cargo robot is one example of a non positronic function robot .  programmed with a map of robot city and its transport systems  it is essentially a container that can load and unload itself and move along preset paths .  it has just enough intelligence to avoid obstacles and decide which cargoes should be loaded in the internal compartment and which should be carried on the forklift like arms .        courier robot  another function robot is the courier .  smaller than a cargo robot  it is faster and more maneuverable .  since all mail in robot city   in fact all communications except face to face speech   is routed electronically through the main computer  the courier robot   s primary job is the delivery of tools and unique artifacts .   like the cargo robot  the courier robot   s lack of positronic intelligence makes it an optional means of covert transportation  since it cannot recognize when it is being used as such .         observation robot  the observation robot is a reading and recording device .  it is used mostly for taking inventories  where it will simply take down the serial numbers of collections of objects  such as robots awaiting repair  and report the details to the positronic robot commanding it .  in such cases  it is programmed with the location of the serial number .  it can also be used in quality control and diagnosis  though .  when it is doing that  it is programmed with an image of the correct appearance of the object under consideration  and it records and reports any discrepancies .         priority   regional contingency power station  the major source of energy for robot city is the fusion pack .  one small micropack can power an industrial robot for over a year before needing to be replaced or refueled  a series of larger packs can provide all the necessary energy for a part of the city .  although fusion packs are extremely safe and reliable  the first law has compelled the robot supervisors of robot city to allow for the possibility of a power failure .   should the centrally controlled power system of robot city break down  a series of regional contingency power stations would come on line .  although the goal of the designers was to make any shift in power sources undetectably smooth to human inhabitants  it was necessary to assign priorities to different areas of the city .  this station serves a high priority neighborhood .         the minneapolis  most interstellar ships are clumsy  at best  once they reach a planetary atmosphere .  they are capable of landing very gently at prepared spaceports  but in an emergency they are likely to hit the surface with a noticeable impact .  the hayashi smith space shuttle model  however  has complete ground to space capability .   in deep space the minneapolis uses a standard hyperdrive .  within solar systems  she maneuvers with normal impulse engines .  however  she can also fly within an atmosphere  making use of an aerodynamic design and ramjet engines .  this makes it possible for her to put down safely on any sufficiently long  flat surface .   in shuttle mode  the interior of the minneapolis is usually set up with seating for ten .  the cabin can be rearranged  however  so that each seat becomes a bunk .  this is not a luxurious arrangement for longer  that is  interstellar  trips  but it is satisfactory .         dr .  avery   s lair  deep beneath the surface of robot city  dr .  avery   s hidden refuge is a reflection of his own psychology .  inspired  secretive  confusing and confused  and utterly mad  it is a maze of the symbols and themes that form his obsessions .   some of the rooms take the shape of the key to perihelion  others are decorated with the shape .  many of the objects that are scattered through the complex of rooms come from cultures that represent permanence and persistence to dr .  avery .   the weird shapes of some of the rooms  and the mixtures of ancient and modern  purely decorative and strictly utilitarian  even the echoes in some of the collected objects of circuit breaker  are all signs of the infolding of a great architect   s mind .  as his consciousness descended into obsession and paranoia  he withdrew into the mazelike warren of his hideaway .        william f .  wu    william f .  wu is a five time nominee for the hugo  nebula  and world fantasy awards .  he is the author of the novel master play  about computer wargamers
