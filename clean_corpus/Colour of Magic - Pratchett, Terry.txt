foreword     if i had a penny for every time someone asked me where i got the idea of the discworld  i   d have   hang on a moment       .    .   anyway  the answer is that it was lying around and didn   t look as though it belonged to anyone .   the world rides through space on the back of a turtle .  it   s one of the great ancient myths  found wherever men and turtles were gathered together  the four elephants were an indo european sophistication .  the idea has been lying in the lumber rooms of legend for centuries .  all i had to do was grab it and run away before the alarms went off .   since this is a reprint by popular demand   gosh   of the first book in a series that will  eventually  contain at least ten  there   s a very good chance that you already know what happens after this book  which is more than i did when i wrote it .   the discworld is not a coherent fantasy world .  its geography is fuzzy  its chronology unreliable .  a small traveling circle of firelight in a chilly infinity has turned out to be the home of defiant jokes and last chances .   there are no maps .  you can   t map a sense of humor .  anyway  what is a fantasy map but a space beyond which there be dragons .  on the discworld we know that there be dragons everywhere .  they might not all have scales and forked tongues  but they be here all right  grinning and jostling and trying to sell you souvenirs .   enjoy .       terry pratchett  october           the color of magic      prologue   in a distant and secondhand set of dimensions  in an astral plane that was never meant to fly  the curling star mists waver and part     see     great a   tuin the turtle comes  swimming slowly through the interstellar gulf  hydrogen frost on his ponderous limbs  his huge and ancient shell pocked with meteor craters .  through sea sized eyes that are crusted with rheum and asteroid dust he stares fixedly at the destination .   in a brain bigger than a city  with geological slowness  he thinks only of the weight .   most of the weight is of course accounted for by berilia  tubul  great t   phon and jerakeen  the four giant elephants upon whose broad and star tanned shoulders the disc of the world rests  garlanded by the long waterfall at its vast circumference and domed by the baby blue vault of heaven .   astropsychology has been  as yet  unable to establish what they think about .   the great turtle was a mere hypothesis until the day the small and secretive kingdom of krull  whose rim most mountains project out over the rimfall  built a gantry and pulley arrangement at the tip of the most precipitous crag and lowered several observers over the edge in a quartz windowed brass vessel to peer through the mist veils .   the early astrozoologists  hauled back from their long dangle by enormous teams of slaves  were able to bring back much information about the shape and nature of a   tuin and the elephants but this did not resolve fundamental questions about the nature and purpose of the universe .   for example  what was a   tuin   s actual sex .  this vital question  said the astrozoologists with mounting authority  would not be answered until a larger and more powerful gantry was constructed for a deep space vessel .  in the meantime they could only speculate about the revealed cosmos .   there was  for example  the theory that a   tuin had come from nowhere and would continue at a uniform crawl  or steady gait  into nowhere  for all time .  this theory was popular among academics .   an alternative  favored by those of a religious persuasion  was that a   tuin was crawling from the birthplace to the time of mating  as were all the stars in the sky which were  obviously  also carried by giant turtles .  when they arrived they would briefly and passionately mate  for the first and only time  and from that fiery union new turtles would be born to carry a new pattern of worlds .  this was known as the big bang hypothesis .   thus it was that a young cosmochelonian of the steady gait faction  testing a new telescope with which he hoped to make measurements of the precise albedo of great a   tuin   s right eye  was on this eventful evening the first outsider to see the smoke rise hubward from the burning of the oldest city in the world .   later that night he became so engrossed in his studies he completely forgot about it .  nevertheless  he was the first .   there were others         the sending of eight      prologue   the discworld offers sights far more impressive than those found in universes built by creators with less imagination but more mechanical aptitude .   although the disc   s sun is but an orbiting moonlet  its prominences hardly bigger than croquet hoops  this slight drawback must be set against the tremendous sight of great a   tuin the turtle  upon whose ancient and meteor riddled shell the disc ultimately rests .  sometimes  in his slow journey across the shores of infinity  he moves his country sized head to snap at a passing comet .   but perhaps the most impressive sight of all   if only because most brains  when faced with the sheer galactic enormity of a   tuin  refuse to believe it   is the endless rimfall  where the seas of the disc boil ceaselessly over the edge into space .  or perhaps it is the rimbow  the eight colored  world girdling rainbow that hovers in the mist laden air over the fall .  the eighth color is octarine  caused by the scatter effect of strong sunlight on an intense magical field .   or perhaps  again  the most magnificent sight is the hub .  there  a spire of green ice ten miles high rises through the clouds and supports at its peak the realm of dunmanifestin  the abode of the disc gods .  the disc gods themselves  despite the splendor of the world below them  are seldom satisfied .  it is embarrassing to know that one is a god of a world that only exists because every improbability curve must have its far end  especially when one can peer into other dimensions at worlds whose creators had more mechanical aptitude than imagination .  no wonder  then  that the disc gods spend more time in bickering than in omnicognizance .   on this particular day blind io  by dint of constant vigilance the chief of the gods  sat with his chin on his hand and looked at the gaming board on the red marble table in front of him .  blind io had got his name because  where his eye sockets should have been  there were nothing but two areas of blank skin .  his eyes  of which he had an impressively large number  led a semi independent life of their own .  several were currently hovering above the table .   the gaming board was a carefully carved map of the discworld  overprinted with squares .  a number of beautifully modeled playing pieces were now occupying some of the squares .  a human onlooker would  for example  have recognized in two of them the likenesses of bravd and the weasel .  others represented yet more heroes and champions  of which the disc had a more than adequate supply .   still in the game were io  offler the crocodile god  zephyrus the god of slight breezes  fate  and the lady .  there was an air of concentration around the board now that the lesser players had been removed from the game .  chance had been an early casualty  running her hero into a full house of armed gnolls  the result of a lucky throw by offler  and shortly afterward night has cashed his chips  pleading an appointment with destiny .  several minor deities had drifted up and were kibitzing over the shoulders of the players .   side bets were made that the lady would be the next to leave the board .  her last champion of any standing was now a pinch of potash in the ruins of still smoking ankh morpork  and there were hardly any pieces that she could promote to first rank .   blind io took up the dice box  which was a skull whose various orifices had been stoppered with rubies  and with several of his eyes on the lady he rolled three fives .   she smiled .  this was the nature of the lady   s eyes  they were bright green  lacking iris or pupil  and they glowed from within .   the room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and  from the very bottom  produced a couple that she set down on the board with two decisive clicks .  the rest of the players  as one god  craned forward to peer at them .      a wenegade wiffard and fome fort of clerk     said offler the crocodile god  hindered as usual by his tusks .     well  weally .     with one claw he pushed a pile of bone white tokens into the center of the table .   the lady nodded slightly .  she picked up the dice cup and held it as steady as a rock  yet all the gods could hear the three cubes rattling about inside .  and then she sent them bouncing across the table .   a six .  a three .  a five .   something was happening to the five  however .  battered by the chance collision of several billion molecules  the die flipped onto a point  spun gently and came down a seven .   blind io picked up the cube and counted the sides .      come on     he said wearily .     play fair .               the color of magic     fire roared through the bifurcated city of ankh morpork .  where it licked the wizards    quarter it burned blue and green and was even laced with strange sparks of the eighth color  octarine  where its outriders found their way into the vats and oil stores all along merchant street it progressed in a series of blazing fountains and explosions  in the streets of the perfume blenders it burned with a sweetness  where it touched bundles of rare and dry herbs in the storerooms of the drugmasters it made men go mad and talk to god .   by now the whole of downtown morpork was alight  and the richer and worthier citizens of ankh on the far bank were bravely responding to the situation by feverishly demolishing the bridges .  but already the ships in the morpork docks   laden with grain  cotton and timber  and coated with tar   were blazing merrily and  their moorings burnt to ashes  were breasting the river ankh on the ebb tide  igniting riverside palaces and bowers as they drifted like drowning fireflies toward the sea .  in any case  sparks were riding the breeze and touching down far across the river in hidden gardens and remote rickyards .   the smoke from the merry burning rose miles high  in a wind sculpted black column that could be seen across the whole of the discworld .   it was certainly impressive from the cool  dark hilltop a few leagues away  where two figures were watching with considerable interest .   the taller of the pair was chewing on a chicken leg and leaning on a sword that was only marginally shorter than the average man .  if it wasn   t for the air of wary intelligence about him it might have been supposed that he was a barbarian from the hubland wastes .   his partner was much shorter and wrapped from head to toe in a brown cloak .  later  when he has occasion to move  it will be seen that he moves lightly  catlike .   the two had barely exchanged a word in the last twenty minutes except for a short and inconclusive argument as to whether a particularly powerful explosion had been the oil bond store or the workshop of kerible the enchanter .  money hinged on the fact .   now the big man finished gnawing at the bone and tossed it into the grass  smiling ruefully .      there go all those little alleyways     he said .     i liked them .         all the treasure houses     said the small man .  he added thoughtfully     do gems burn .  i wonder .     tis said they   re kin to coal .         all the gold  melting and running down the gutters     said the big one  ignoring him .     and all the wine  boiling in the barrels .         there were rats     said his brown companion .      rats  i   ll grant you .         it was no place to be in high summer .         that  too .  one can   t help feeling  though  a   well  a momentary        he trailed off  then brightened .     we owed old fredor at the crimson leech eight silver pieces     he added .  the little man nodded .   they were silent for a while as a whole new series of explosions carved a red line across a hitherto dark section of the greatest city in the world .  then the big man stirred .      weasel .         yes .         i wonder who started it .      the small swordsman known as the weasel said nothing .  he was watching the road in the ruddy light .  few had come that way since the deosil gate had been one of the first to collapse in a shower of white hot embers .   but two were coming up it now .  the weasel   s eyes  always at their sharpest in gloom and half light  made out the shapes of two mounted men and some sort of low beast behind them .  doubtless a rich merchant escaping with as much treasure as he could lay frantic hands on .  the weasel said as much to his companion  who sighed .      the status of footpad ill suits us     said the barbarian     but  as you say  times are hard and there are no soft beds tonight .      he shifted his grip on his sword and  as the leading rider drew near  stepped out onto the road with a hand held up and his face set in a grin nicely calculated to reassure yet threaten .      your pardon  sir       he began .   the rider reined in his horse and drew back his hood .  the big man looked into a face blotched with superficial burns and punctuated by tufts of singed beard .  even the eyebrows had gone .      bugger off     said the face .     you   re bravd the hublander   aren   t you .      bravd became aware that he had fumbled the initiative .      just go away  will you .     said the rider .     i just haven   t got time for you  do you understand .      he looked around and added     that goes for your shadow loving fleabag partner  too  wherever he   s hiding .      the weasel stepped up to the horse and peered at the disheveled figure .      why  it   s rincewind the wizard  isn   t it .     he said in tones of delight  meanwhile filing the wizard   s description of him in his memory for leisurely vengeance .     i thought i recognized the voice .      bravd spat and sheathed his sword .  it was seldom worth tangling with wizards  they so rarely had any treasure worth speaking of .      he talks pretty big for a gutter wizard     he muttered .      you don   t understand at all     said the wizard wearily .     i   m so scared of you my spine has turned to jelly  it   s just that i   m suffering from an overdose of terror right now .  i mean  when i   ve got over that then i   ll have time to be decently frightened of you .      the weasel pointed toward the burning city .      you   ve been through that .     he asked .   the wizard rubbed a red raw hand across his eyes .     i was there when it started .  see him .  back there .     he pointed back down the road to where his traveling companion was still approaching  having adopted a method of riding that involved falling out of the saddle every few seconds .      well .     said weasel .      he started it     said rincewind simply .   bravd and weasel looked at the figure  now hopping across the road with one foot in a stirrup .      fire raiser  is he .     said bravd at last .      no     said rincewind .     not precisely .  let   s just say that if complete and utter chaos were lightning  then he   d be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armor and shouting    all gods are bastards .     got any food .         there   s some chicken     said weasel .     in exchange for a story .         what   s his name .     said bravd  who tended to lag behind in conversations .      twoflower .         twoflower .     said bravd .     what a funny name .         you     said rincewind  dismounting     do not know the half of it .  chicken  you say .         deviled     said weasel .  the wizard groaned .      that reminds me     added the weasel  snapping his fingers     there was a really big explosion about  oh  half an hour ago           that was the oil bond store going up     said rincewind  wincing at the memory of the burning rain .   weasel turned and grinned expectantly at his companion  who grunted and handed over a coin from his pouch .  then there was a scream from the roadway  cut off abruptly .  rincewind did not look up from his chicken .      one of the things he can   t do  he can   t ride a horse     he said .  then he stiffened as if sandbagged by a sudden recollection  gave a small yelp of terror and dashed into the gloom .  when he returned  the being called twoflower was hanging limply over his shoulder .  it was small and skinny  and dressed very oddly in a pair of knee length britches and a shirt in such a violent and vivid conflict of colors that weasel   s fastidious eye was offended even in the half light .      no bones broken  by the feel of things     said rincewind .  he was breathing heavily .  bravd winked at the weasel and went to investigate the shape that they assumed was a pack animal .      you   d be wise to forget it     said the wizard  without looking up from his examination of the unconscious twoflower .     believe me .  a power protects it .         a spell .     said weasel  squatting down .      no oo .  but magic of a kind  i think .  not the usual sort .  i mean  it can turn gold into copper while at the same time it is still gold  it makes men rich by destroying their possessions  it allows the weak to walk fearlessly among thieves  it passes through the strongest doors to leach the most protected treasuries .  even now it has me enslaved   so that i must follow this madman willynilly and protect him from harm .  it   s stronger than you  bravd .  it is  i think  more cunning even than you  weasel .         what is it called then  this mighty magic .      rincewind shrugged .     in our tongue it is called reflected sound as of underground spirits .  is there any wine .         you must know that i am not without artifice where magic is concerned     said weasel .     only last year did i   assisted by my friend there   part the notoriously powerful archmage of ymitury from his staff  his belt of moon jewels and his life  in that approximate order .  i do not fear this reflected sound of underground spirits of which you speak .  however     he added     you engage my interest .  perhaps you would care to tell me more .      bravd looked at the shape on the road .  it was closer now  and clearer in the pre dawn light .  it looked for all the world like a        a box on legs .     he said .      i   ll tell you about it     said rincewind .     if there   s any wine  that is .      down in the valley there was a roar and a hiss .  someone more thoughtful than the rest had ordered to be shut the big river gates that were at the point where the ankh flowed out of the twin city .  denied its usual egress  the river had burst its banks and was pouring down the fire ravaged streets .  soon the continent of flame became a series of islands  each one growing smaller as the dark tide rose .  and up from the city of fumes and smoke rose a broiling cloud of steam  covering the stars .  weasel thought that it looked like some dark fungus or mushroom .      the twin city of proud ankh and pestilent morpork  of which all the other cities of time and space are  as it were  mere reflections  has stood many assaults in its long and crowded history and has always risen to flourish again .  so the fire and its subsequent flood  which destroyed everything left that was not flammable and added a particularly noisome flux to the survivors    problems  did not mark its end .  rather it was a fiery punctuation mark  a coal like comma  or salamander semicolon  in a continuing story .   several days before these events a ship came up the ankh on the dawn tide and fetched up  among many others  in the maze of wharves and docks on the morpork shore .  it carried a cargo of pink pearls  milk nuts  pumice  some official letters for the patrician of ankh  and a man .   it was the man who engaged the attention of blind hugh  one of the beggars on early duty at pearl dock .  he nudged cripple wa in the ribs  and pointed wordlessly .   now the stranger was standing on the quayside  watching several straining seamen carry a large  brass bound chest down the gangplank .  another man  obviously the captain  was standing beside him .  there was about the seamen   every nerve in blind hugh   s body  which tended to vibrate in the presence of even a small amount of impure gold at fifty paces  screamed into his brain   the air of one anticipating imminent enrichment .   sure enough  when the chest had been deposited on the cobbles  the stranger reached into a pouch and there was the flash of a coin .  several coins .  gold .  blind hugh  his body twanging like a hazel rod in the presence of water  whistled to himself .  then he nudged wa again  and sent him scurrying off down a nearby alley into the heart of the city .   when the captain walked back onto his ship  leaving the newcomer looking faintly bewildered on the quayside  blind hugh snatched up his begging cup and made his way across the street with an ingratiating leer .  at the sight of him the stranger started to fumble urgently with his money pouch .      good day to thee  sire     blind hugh began  and found himself looking up into a face with four eyes in it .  he turned to run .       .     said the stranger  and grabbed his arm .  hugh was aware that the sailors lining the rail of the ship were laughing at him .  at the same time his specialized senses detected an overpowering impression of money .  he froze .  the stranger let go and quickly thumbed through a small black book he had taken from his belt .  then he said    hallo .         what .     said hugh .  the man looked blank .      hallo .     he repeated  rather louder than necessary and so carefully that hugh could hear the vowels tinkling into place .      hallo yourself     hugh riposted .  the stranger smiled widely fumbled yet again in the pouch .  this time his hand came out holding a large gold coin .  it was in fact slightly larger than an       dollar ankhian crown and the design on it was unfamiliar  but it spoke inside hugh   s mind in a language he understood perfectly .  my current owner  it said  is in need of succor and assistance  why not give it to him  so you and me can go off somewhere and enjoy ourselves .   subtle changes in the beggar   s posture made the stranger feel more at ease .  he consulted the small book again .      i wish to be directed to a hotel  tavern  lodging house  inn  hospice  caravanserai     he said .      what  all of them .     said hugh  taken aback .       .     said the stranger .   hugh was aware that a small crowd of fishwives  shellfish diggers and freelance gawpers were watching them with interest .      look     he said     i know a good tavern  is that enough .     he shuddered to think of the gold coin escaping from his life .  he   d keep that one  even if ymor confiscated all the rest .  and the big chest that comprised most of the newcomer   s luggage looked to be full of gold  hugh decided .   the four eyed man looked at his book .      i would like to be directed to a hotel  place of repose  tavern  a           yes  all right .  come on then     said hugh hurriedly .  he picked up one of the bundles and walked away quickly .  the stranger  after a moment   s hesitation  strolled after him .   a train of thought shunted its way through hugh   s mind .  getting the newcomer to the broken drum so easily was a stroke of luck  no doubt of it  and ymor would probably reward him .  but for all his new acquaintance   s mildness there was something about him that made hugh uneasy  and for the life of him he couldn   t figure out what it was .  not the two extra eyes  odd though they were .  there was something else .  he glanced back .   the little man was ambling along in the middle of the street  looking around him with an expression of keen interest .   something else hugh saw nearly made him gibber .   the massive wooden chest  which he had last seen resting solidly on the quayside  was following on its master   s heels with a gentle rocking gait .  slowly  in case a sudden movement on his part might break his fragile control over his own legs  hugh bent slightly so that he could see under the chest .   there were lots and lots of little legs .   very deliberately  hugh turned around and walked very carefully toward the broken drum .         odd     said ymor .      he had this big wooden chest     added cripple wa .      he   d have to be a merchant or a spy     said ymor .  he pulled a scrap of meat from the cutlet in his hand and tossed it into the air .  it hadn   t reached the zenith of its arc before a black shape detached itself from the shadows in the corner of the room and swooped down  taking the morsel in midair .      a merchant or a spy     repeated ymor .     i   d prefer a spy .  a spy pays for himself twice  because there   s always the reward when we turn him in .  what do you think  withel .      opposite ymor the second greatest thief in ankh morpork half closed his one eye and shrugged .      i   ve checked on the ship     he said .     it   s a freelance trader .  does the occasional run to the brown islands .  people there are just savages .  they don   t understand about spies and i expect they eat merchants .         he looked a bit like a merchant     volunteered wa .     except he wasn   t fat .      there was a flutter of wings at the window .  ymor shifted his bulk out of the chair and crossed the room  coming back with a large raven .  after he   d unfastened the message capsule from its leg it flew up to join its fellows lurking among the rafters .  withel regarded it without love .  ymor   s ravens were notoriously loyal to their master  to the extent that withel   s one attempt to promote himself to the rank of greatest thief in ankh morpork had cost their master   s right hand man his left eye .  but not his life  however .  ymor never grudged a man his ambitions .      b       said ymor  tossing the little phial aside and unrolling the tiny scroll within .      gorrin the cat     said withel automatically .     on station up in the gong tower at the temple of small gods .         he says hugh has taken our stranger to the broken drum .  well  that   s good enough .  broadman is a   friend of ours  isn   t he .         aye     said withel .     if he knows what   s good for trade .           among his customers has been your man gorrin     said ymor pleasantly     for he writes here about a box on legs  if i read this scrawl correctly .     he looked at withel over the top of the paper .   withel looked away .     he will be disciplined     he said flatly .  wa looked at the man leaning back in his chair  his black clad frame resting as nonchalantly as a rimland puma on a jungle branch  and decided that gorrin atop small gods temple would soon be joining those little deities in the multifold dimensions of beyond .  and he owed wa three copper pieces .   ymor crumpled the note and tossed it into a corner .     i think we   ll wander along to the drum later on  withel .  perhaps  too  we may try this beer that your men find so tempting .      withel said nothing .  being ymor   s right hand man was like being gently flogged to death with scented bootlaces .      the twin city of ankh morpork  foremost of all the cities bounding the circle sea  was as a matter of course the home of a large number of gangs  thieves    guilds  syndicates and similar organizations .  this was one of the reasons for its wealth .  most of the humbler folk on the widdershin side of the river  in morpork   s mazy alleys  supplemented their meager incomes by filling some small role for one or other of the competing gangs .  so it was that by the time hugh and twoflower entered the courtyard of the broken drum the leaders of a number of them were aware that someone had arrived in the city who appeared to have much treasure .  some reports from the more observant spies included details about a book that told the stranger what to say  and a box that walked by itself .  these facts were immediately discounted .  no magician capable of such enchantments ever came within a mile of morpork docks .   it still being that hour when most of the city was just rising or about to go to bed there were few people in the drum to watch twoflower descend the stairs .  when the luggage appeared behind him and started to lurch confidently down the steps the customers at the rough wooden tables  as one man  looked suspiciously at their drinks .   broadman was browbeating the small troll who swept the bar when the trio walked past him .     what in hell   s that .     he said .      just don   t talk about it     hissed hugh .  twoflower was already thumbing through his book .      what   s he doing .     said broadman  arms akimbo .      it tells him what to say .  i know it sounds ridiculous     muttered hugh .      how can a book tell a man what to say .         i wish for an accommodation  a room  lodgings  the lodging house  full board  are your rooms clean  a room with a view  what is your rate for one night .     said twoflower in one breath .   broadman looked at hugh .  the beggar shrugged .      he   s got plenty money     he said .      tell him it   s three copper pieces  then .  and that thing will have to go in the stable .          .     said the stranger .  broadman held up three thick red fingers and the man   s face was suddenly a sunny display of comprehension .  he reached into his pouch and laid three large gold pieces in broadman   s palm .   broadman stared at them .  they represented about four times the worth of the broken drum  staff included .  he looked at hugh .  there was no help there .  he looked at the stranger .  he swallowed .      yes     he said  in an unnaturally high voice .     and then there   s meals  o   course .  uh .  you understand  yes .  food .  you eat .  no .     he made the appropriate motions .      fut .     said the little man .      yes     said broadman  beginning to sweat .     have a look in your little book  i should .      the man opened the book and ran a finger down one page .  broadman  who could read after a fashion  peered over the top of the volume .  what he saw made no sense .      fooood     said the stranger .     yes .  cutlet  hash  chop  stew  ragout  fricassee  mince  collops  souffl    dumpling  blancmange  sorbet  gruel  sausage  not to have a sausage  beans  without a bean  kickshaws  jelly  jam .  giblets .     he beamed at broadman .      all that .     said the innkeeper weakly .      it   s just the way he talks     said hugh .     don   t ask me why .  he just does .      all eyes in the room were watching the stranger   except for a pair belonging to rincewind the wizard  who was sitting in the darkest corner nursing a mug of very small beer .   he was watching the luggage .   watch rincewind .   look at him .  scrawny  like most wizards  and clad in a dark red robe on which a few mystic sigils were embroidered in tarnished sequins .  some might have taken him for a mere apprentice enchanter who had run away from his master out of defiance  boredom  fear and a lingering taste for heterosexuality .  yet around his neck was a chain bearing the bronze octagon that marked him as an alumnus of unseen university  the high school of magic whose time and space transcendent campus is never precisely here or there .  graduates were usually destined for mageship at least  but rincewind   after an unfortunate event   had left knowing only one spell and made a living of sorts around the town by capitalizing on an innate gift for languages .  he avoided work as a rule  but had a quickness of wit that put his acquaintances in mind of a bright rodent .  and he knew sapient pearwood when he saw it .  he was seeing it now  and didn   t quite believe it .   an archmage  by dint of great effort and much expenditure of time  might eventually obtain a small staff made from the timber of the sapient pear tree .  it grew only on the sites of ancient magic .  there were probably no more than two such staffs in all the cities of the circle sea .  a large chest of it   rincewind tried to work it out  and decided that even if the box were crammed with star opals and sticks of auricholatum the contents would not be worth one tenth the price of the container .  a vein started to throb in his forehead .   he stood up and made his way to the trio .      may i be of assistance .     he ventured .      shove off  rincewind     snarled broadman .      i only thought it might be useful to address this gentleman in his own tongue     said the wizard gently .      he   s doing all right on his own     said the innkeeper  but took a few steps backward .   rincewind smiled politely at the stranger and tried a few words of chimeran .  he prided himself on his fluency in the tongue  but the stranger only looked bemused .      it won   t work     said hugh knowledgeably .     it   s the book  you see .  it tells him what to say .  magic .      rincewind switched to high borogravian  to vanglemesht  sumtri and even black oroogu  the language with no nouns and only one adjective  which is obscene .  each was met with polite incomprehension .  in desperation he tried heathen trob  and the little man   s face split into a delighted grin .      at last .     he said .     my good sir .  this is remarkable .      although in trob the last word in fact became    a thing which may happen but once in the usable lifetime of a canoe hollowed diligently by ax and fire from the tallest diamondwood tree that grows in the noted diamondwood forests on the lower slopes of mount awayawa  home of the firegods or so it is said .          what was all that .     said broadman suspiciously .      what did the innkeeper say .     said the little man .   rincewind swallowed .     broadman     he said .     two mugs of your best ale  please .         you can understand him .         oh  sure .         tell him   tell him he   s very welcome .  tell him breakfast is   uh   one gold piece .     for a moment broadman   s face looked as though some vast internal struggle was going on  and then he added with a burst of generosity     i   ll throw in yours  too .         stranger     said rincewind levelly .     if you stay here you will be knifed or poisoned by nightfall .  but don   t stop smiling  or so will i .         oh  come now     said the stranger  looking around .     this looks like a delightful place .  a genuine morporkean tavern .  i   ve heard so much about them  you know .  all these quaint old beams .  and so reasonable  too .      rincewind glanced around quickly  in case some leakage of enchantment from the magician   s quarter across the river had momentarily transported them to some other place .  no   this was still the interior of the drum  its walls stained with smoke  its floor a compost of old rushes and nameless beetles  its sour beer not so much purchased as merely hired for a while .  he tried to fit the image around the word    quaint     or rather the nearest trob equivalent  which was    that pleasant oddity of design found in the little coral houses of the sponge eating pigmies on the orohai peninsular .      his mind reeled back from the effort .  the visitor went on     my name is twoflower     and extended his hand .  instinctively  the other three looked down to see if there was a coin in it .      pleased to meet you     said rincewind .     i   m rincewind .  look  i wasn   t joking .  this is a tough place .         good .  exactly what i wanted .         eh .         what is this stuff in the mugs .         this .  beer .  thanks  broadman .  yes .  beer .  you know .  beer .         ah .  the so typical drink .  a small gold piece will be sufficient payment  do you think .  i do not want to cause offense .      it was already half out of his purse .      yarrt     croaked rincewind .     i mean  no  it won   t cause offense .         good .  you say this is a tough place .  frequented  you mean  by heroes and men of adventure .      rincewind considered this .     yes .     he managed .      excellent .  i would like to meet some .      an explanation occurred to the wizard .     ah     he said .     you   ve come to hire mercenaries     warriors who fight for the tribe with most milknut meal     .         oh no .  i just want to meet them .  so that when i get home i can say that i did it .      rincewind thought that a meeting with most of the drum   s clientele would mean that twoflower never went home again  unless he lived downriver and happened to float past .      where is your home .     he inquired .  broadman had slipped away into some back room  he noticed .  hugh was watching them suspiciously from a nearby table .      have you heard of the city of bes palargic .         well  i didn   t spend much time in trob .  i was just passing through  you know           oh  it   s not in trob .  i speak trob because there are many betrobi sailors in our ports .  bes palargic is the major seaport of the agatean empire .         never heard of it  i   m afraid .      twoflower raised his eyebrows .     no .  it is quite big .  you sail turnwise from the brown islands for about a week and there it is .  are you all right .      he hurried around the table and patted the wizard on the back .  rincewind choked on his beer .   the counterweight continent .      three streets away an old man dropped a coin into a saucer of acid and swirled it gently .  broadman waited impatiently  ill at ease in a room made noisome by vats and bubbling beakers and lined with shelves containing shadowy shapes suggestive of skulls and stuffed impossibilities .      well .     he demanded .      one cannot hurry these things     said the old alchemist peevishly .     assaying takes time .  ah .     he prodded the saucer  where the coin now lay in a swirl of green color .  he made some calculations on a scrap of parchment .      exceptionally interesting     he said at last .      is it genuine .      the old man pursed his lips .     it depends on how you define the term     he said .     if you mean  is this coin the same as  say  a fifty dollar piece  then the answer is no .         i knew it     screamed the innkeeper  and started toward the door .      i   m not sure that i   m making myself clear     said the alchemist .  broadman turned around angrily .      what do you mean .         well  you see  what with one thing and another our coinage has been somewhat watered  over the years .  the gold content of the average coin is barely four parts in twelve  the balance being made up of silver  copper           what of it .         i said this coin isn   t like ours .  it is pure gold .      after broadman had left  at a run  the alchemist spent some time staring at the ceiling .  then he drew out a very small piece of thin parchment  rummaged for a pen amongst the debris on his workbench  and wrote a very short  small  message .  then he went over to his cages of white doves  black cockerels and other laboratory animals .  from one cage he removed a glossy coated rat  rolled the parchment into the phial attached to a hind leg  and let the animal go .   it sniffed around the floor for a moment  then disappeared down a hole in the far wall .   at about this time a hitherto unsuccessful fortune teller living on the other side of the block chanced to glance into her scrying bowl  gave a small scream and  within the hour  had sold her jewelry  various magical accoutrements  most of her clothes and almost all her other possessions that could not be conveniently carried on the fastest horse she could buy .  the fact that later on  when her house collapsed in flames  she herself died in a freak landslide in the morpork mountains  proves that death  too  has a sense of humor .      also at about the same moment as the homing rat disappeared into the maze of runs under the city  scurrying along in faultless obedience to an ancient instinct  the patrician of ankh morpork picked up the letters delivered that morning by albatross .  he looked pensively at the topmost one again  and summoned his chief of spies .   and in the broken drum rincewind was listening open mouthed as twoflower talked .      so i decided to see for myself     the little man was saying .     eight years    saving up  this has cost me .  but worth every half rhinu .  i mean  here i am .  in ankh morpork .  famed in song and story  i mean .  in the streets that have known the tread of heric whiteblade  hrun the barbarian  and bravd the hublander and the weasel   it   s all just like i imagined  you know .      rincewind   s face was a mask of fascinated horror .      i just couldn   t stand it any more back in bes pelargic     twoflower went on blithely     sitting at a desk all day  just adding up columns of figures  just a pension to look forward to at the end of it   where   s the romance in that .  twoflower  i thought  it   s now or never .  you don   t just have to listen to stories .  you can go there .  now   s the time to stop hanging around the docks listening to sailors    tales .  so i compiled a phrase book and bought a passage on the next ship to the brown islands .         no guards .     murmured rincewind .      no .  why .  what have i got that   s worth stealing .      rincewind coughed .     you have  uh  gold     he said .      barely two thousand rhinu .  hardly enough to keep a man alive for more than a month or two .  at home  that is .  i imagine they might stretch a bit further here .         would a rhinu be one of those big gold coins .     said rincewind .      yes .     twoflower looked worriedly at the wizard over the top of his strange seeing lenses .     will two thousand be sufficient  do you think .         yarrrt     croaked rincewind .     i mean  yes   sufficient .         good .         um .  is everyone in the agatean empire as rich as you .         me .  rich .  bless you  whatever put that idea into your head .  i am but a poor clerk .  did i pay the innkeeper too much  do you think .     twoflower added .      uh .  he might have settled for less     rincewind conceded .      ah .  i shall know better next time .  i can see i have a lot to learn .  an idea occurs to me .  rincewind  would you perhaps consent to be employed as a  i don   t know  perhaps the word    guide    would fit the circumstances .  i think i could afford to pay you a rhinu a day .      rincewind opened his mouth to reply but felt the words huddle together in his throat  reluctant to emerge in a world that was rapidly going mad .  twoflower blushed .      i have offended you     he said .     it was an impertinent request to make of a professional man such as yourself .  doubtless you have many projects you wish to return to   some works of high magic  no doubt           no     said rincewind faintly .     not just at present .  a rhinu  you say .  one a day .  every day .         i think perhaps in the circumstances i should make it one and one half rhinu per day .  plus any out of pocket expenses  of course .      the wizard rallied magnificently .     that will be fine     he said .     great .      twoflower reached into his pouch and took out a large round gold object  glanced at it for a moment  and slipped it back .  rincewind didn   t get a chance to see it properly .      i think     said the tourist     that i would like a little rest now .  it was a long crossing .  and then perhaps you would care to call back at noon and we can take a look at the city .         sure .         then please be good enough to ask the innkeeper to show me to my room .      rincewind did so  and watched the nervous broadman  who had arrived at a gallop from some back room  lead the way up the wooden steps behind the bar .  after a few seconds the luggage got up and pattered across the floor after them .   then the wizard looked down at the six big coins in his hand .  twoflower had insisted on paying his first four days    wages in advance .   hugh nodded and smiled encouragingly .  rincewind snarled at him .   as a student wizard rincewind had never achieved high marks in precognition  but now unused circuits in his brain were throbbing and the future might as well have been engraved in bright colors on his eyeballs .  the space between his shoulder blades began to itch .  the sensible thing to do  he knew  was to buy a horse .  it would have to be a fast one  and expensive   offhand  rincewind couldn   t think of any horse dealer he knew who was rich enough to give change out of almost a whole ounce of gold .   and then  of course  the other five coins would help him set up a useful practice at some safe distance  say two hundred miles .  that would be the sensible thing .   but what would happen to twoflower  all alone in a city where even the cockroaches had an unerring instinct for gold .  a man would have to be a real heel to leave him .      the patrician of ankh morpork smiled  but with his mouth only .      the hub gate  you say .     he murmured .   the guard captain saluted smartly .     aye  lord .  we had to shoot the horse before he would stop .         which  by a fairly direct route  brings you here     said the patrician  looking down at rincewind .     and what have you got to say for yourself .      it was rumored that an entire wing of the patrician   s palace was filled with clerks who spent their days collating and updating all the information collected by their master   s exquisitely organized spy system .  rincewind didn   t doubt it .  he glanced toward the balcony that ran down one side of the audience room .  a sudden run  a nimble jump   a sudden hail of crossbow quarrels .  he shuddered .   the patrician cradled his chins in a beringed hand  and regarded the wizard with eyes as small and hard as beads .      let me see     he said .     oathbreaking  the theft of a horse  uttering false coinage   yes  i think it   s the arena for you  rincewind .      this was too much .      i didn   t steal the horse .  i bought it fairly .         but with false coinage .  technical theft  you see .         but those rhinu are solid gold .         rhinu .     the patrician rolled one of them around in his thick fingers .     is that what they are called .  how interesting .  but  as you point out  they are not very similar to dollars           well  of course they   re not           ah .  you admit it  then .      rincewind opened his mouth to speak  thought better of it  and shut it again .      quite so .  and on top of these there is  of course  the moral obloquy attendant on the cowardly betrayal of a visitor to this shore .  for shame  rincewind .      the patrician waved a hand vaguely .  the guards behind rincewind backed away  and their captain took a few paces to the right .  rincewind suddenly felt very alone .   it is said that when a wizard is about to die death himself turns up to claim him  instead of delegating the task to a subordinate  such as disease or famine  as is usually the case  .  rincewind looked around nervously for a tall figure in black  wizards  even failed wizards  have in addition to rods and cones in their eyeballs the tiny octagons that enable them to see into the far octarine  the basic color of which all other colors are merely pale shadows impinging on normal four dimensional space .  it is said to be a sort of fluorescent greenish yellow purple  .   was that a flickering shadow in the corner .      of course     said the patrician     i could be merciful .      the shadow disappeared .  rincewind looked up  an expression of insane hope on his face .      yes .     he said .   the patrician waved a hand again .  rincewind saw the guards leave the chamber .  alone with the overlord of the twin cities  he almost wished they would come back .      come hither  rincewind     said the patrician .  he indicated a bowl of savories on a low onyx table by the throne .     would you care for a crystallized jellyfish .  no .         um     said rincewind     no .         now i want you to listen very carefully to what i am about to say     said the patrician amiably     otherwise you will die .  in an interesting fashion .  over a period .  please stop fidgeting like that .      since you are a wizard of sorts  you are of course aware that we live upon a world shaped  as it were  like a disc .  and that there is said to exist  toward the far rim  a continent which though small is equal in weight to all the mighty land masses in this hemi circle .  and that this  according to ancient legend  is because it is largely made of gold .      rincewind nodded .  who hadn   t heard of the counterweight continent .  some sailors even believed the childhood tales and sailed in search of it .  of course  they returned either empty handed or not at all .  probably eaten by giant turtles  in the opinion of more serious mariners .  because  of course  the counterweight continent was nothing more than a solar myth .      it does  of course  exist     said the patrician .     although it is not made of gold  it is true that gold is a very common metal there .  most of the mass is made up by vast deposits of octiron deep within the crust .  now it will be obvious to an incisive mind like yours that the existence of the counterweight continent poses a deadly threat to our people here       he paused  looking at rincewind   s open mouth .  he sighed .  he said     do you by some chance fail to follow me .         yarrg     said rincewind .  he swallowed  and licked his lips .     i mean  no .  i mean   well  gold           i see     said the patrician sweetly .     you feel  perhaps  that it would be a marvelous thing to go to the counterweight continent and bring back a shipload of gold .      rincewind had a feeling that some sort of trap was being set .      yes .     he ventured .      and if every man on the shores of the circle sea had a mountain of gold of his own .  would that be a good thing .  what would happen .  think carefully .      rincewind   s brow furrowed .  he thought .     we   d all be rich .      the way the temperature fell at his remark told him that it was not the correct one .      i may as well tell you  rincewind  that there is some contact between the lords of the circle sea and the emperor of the agatean empire  as it is styled     the patrician went on .     it is only very slight .  there is little common ground between us .  we have nothing they want  and they have nothing we can afford .  it is an old empire  rincewind .  old and cunning and cruel and very  very rich .  so we exchange fraternal greetings by albatross mail .  at infrequent intervals .      one such letter arrived this morning .  a subject of the emperor appears to have taken it into his head to visit our city .  it appears he wishes to look at it .  only a madman would possibly undergo all the privations of crossing the turnwise ocean in order to merely look at anything .  however .      he landed this morning .  he might have met a great hero  or the cunningest of thieves  or some wise and great sage .  he met you .  he has employed you as a guide .  you will be a guide  rincewind  to this looker  this twoflower .  you will see that he returns home with a good report of our little homeland .  what do you say to that .         er .  thank you  lord     said rincewind miserably .      there is another point  of course .  it would be a tragedy should anything untoward happen to our little visitor .  it would be dreadful if he were to die  for example .  dreadful for the whole of our land  because the agatean emperor looks after his own and could certainly extinguish us at a nod .  a mere nod .  and that would be dreadful for you  rincewind  because in the weeks that remained before the empire   s huge mercenary fleet arrived certain of my servants would occupy themselves about your person in the hope that the avenging captains  on their arrival  might find their anger tempered by the sight of your still living body .  there are certain spells that can prevent the life departing from a body  be it never so abused  and   i see by your face that understanding dawns .         yarrg .         i beg your pardon .         yes  lord .  i   ll  er  see to it  i mean  i   ll endeavor to see  i mean  well  i   ll try to look after him and see he comes to no harm .     and after that i   ll get a job juggling snowballs through hell  he added bitterly in the privacy of his own skull .      capital .  i gather already that you and twoflower are on the best of terms .  an excellent beginning .  when he returns safely to his homeland you will not find me ungrateful .  i shall probably even dismiss the charges against you .  thank you  rincewind .  you may go .      rincewind decided not to ask for the return of his five remaining rhinu .  he backed away  cautiously .      oh  and there is one other thing     the patrician said  as the wizard groped for the door handles .      yes  lord .     he replied  with a sinking heart .      i   m sure you won   t dream of trying to escape from your obligations by fleeing the city .  i judge you to be a born city person .  but you may be sure that the lords of the other cities will be appraised of these conditions by nightfall .         i assure you the thought never even crossed my mind  lord .         indeed .  then if i were you i   d sue my face for slander .         rincewind reached the broken drum at a dead run  and was just in time to collide with a man who came out backward  fast .  the stranger   s haste was in part accounted for by the spear in his chest .  he bubbled noisily and dropped dead at the wizard   s feet .   rincewind peered around the doorframe and jerked back as a heavy throwing ax whirred past like a partridge .   it was probably a lucky throw  a second cautious glance told him .  the dark interior of the drum was a broil of fighting men  quite a number of them   a third and longer glance confirmed   in bits .  rincewind swayed back as a wildly thrown stool sailed past and smashed on the far side of the street .  then he dived in .   he was wearing a dark robe  made darker by constant wear and irregular washings .  in the raging gloom no one appeared to notice a shadowy shape that shuffled desperately from table to table .  at one point a fighter  staggering back  trod on what felt like fingers .  a number of what felt like teeth bit his ankle .  he yelped shrilly and dropped his guard just sufficiently for a sword  swung by a surprised opponent  to skewer him .   rincewind reached the stairway  sucking his bruised hand and running with a curious  bent over gait .  a crossbow quarrel thunked into the banister rail above him  and he gave a whimper .   he made the stairs in one breathless rush  expecting at any moment another  more accurate shot .   in the corridor above he stood upright  gasping  and saw the floor in front of him scattered with bodies .  a big black bearded man  with a bloody sword in one hand  was trying a door handle .      hey .     screamed rincewind .  the man looked around and then  almost absentmindedly  drew a short throwing knife from his bandolier and hurled it .  rincewind ducked .  there was a brief scream behind him as the crossbow man  sighting down his weapon  dropped it and clutched at his throat .   the big man was already reaching for another knife .  rincewind looked around wildly  and then with wild improvisation drew himself up into a wizardly pose .   his hand was flung back .     asoniti .  kyorucha .  beazleblor .      the man hesitated  his eyes flicking nervously from side to side as he waited for the magic .  the conclusion that there was not going to be any hit him at the same time as rincewind  whirring wildly down the passage  kicked him sharply in the groin .   as he screamed and clutched at himself the wizard dragged open the door  sprang inside  slammed it behind him and threw his body against it  panting .   it was quiet in here .  there was twoflower  sleeping peacefully on the low bed .  and there  at the foot of the bed  was the luggage .   rincewind took a few steps forward  cupidity moving him as easily as if he were on little wheels .  the chest was open .  there were bags inside  and in one of them he caught the gleam of gold .  for a moment greed overcame caution  and he reached out gingerly   but what was the use .  he   d never live to enjoy it .  reluctantly he drew his hand back  and was surprised to see a slight tremor in the chest   s open lid .  hadn   t it shifted slightly  as though rocked by the wind .   rincewind looked at his fingers  and then at the lid .  it looked heavy  and was bound with brass bands .  it was quite still now .   what wind .      rincewind .      twoflower sprang off the bed .  the wizard jumped back  wrenching his features into a smile .      my dear chap  right on time .  we   ll just have lunch  and then i   m sure you   ve got a wonderful program lined up for this afternoon .         er           that   s great .      rincewind took a deep breath .     look     he said desperately     let   s eat somewhere else .  there   s been a bit of a fight down below .         a tavern brawl .  why didn   t you wake me up .         well  you see  i   what .         i thought i made myself clear this morning  rincewind .  i want to see genuine morporkian life   the slave market  the whore pits  the temple of small gods  the beggars    guild   and a genuine tavern brawl .     a faint note of suspicion entered twoflower   s voice .     you do have them  don   t you .  you know  people swinging on chandelier  swordfights over the table  the sort of thing hrun the barbarian and the weasel are always getting involved in .  you know   excitement .      rincewind sat down heavily on the bed .      you want to see a fight .     he said .      yes .  what   s wrong with that .         for a start  people get hurt .         oh  i wasn   t suggesting we get involved .  i just want to see one  that   s all .  and some of your famous heroes .  you do have some  don   t you .  it   s not all dockside talk .     and now  to the wizard   s astonishment  twoflower was almost pleading .      oh  yeah .  we have them all right     said rincewind hurriedly .  he pictured them in his mind  and recoiled from the thought .   all the heroes of the circle sea passed through the gates of ankh morpork sooner or later .  most of them were from the barbaric tribes nearer the frozen hub  which had a sort of export trade in heroes .  almost all of them had crude magic swords  whose unsuppressed harmonics on the astral plane played hell with any delicate experiments in applied sorcery for miles around  but rincewind didn   t object to them on that score .  he knew himself to be a magical dropout  so it didn   t bother him that the mere appearance of a hero at the city gates was enough to cause retorts to explode and demons to materialize all through the magical quarter .  no  what he didn   t like about heroes was that they were usually suicidally gloomy when sober and homicidally insane when drunk .  there were too many of them  too .  some of the most notable questing grounds near the city were a veritable hubbub in the season .  there was talk of organizing a rota .   he rubbed his nose .  the only heroes he had much time for were bravd and the weasel  who were out of town at the moment  and hrun the barbarian  who was practically an academic by hub standards in that he could think without moving his lips .  hrun was said to be roving somewhere turnwise .  .      look     he said at last .     have you ever met a barbarian .      twoflower shook his head .      i was afraid of that     said rincewind .     well  they   re        there was a clatter of running feet in the street outside and a fresh uproar from downstairs .  it was followed by a commotion on the stairs .  the door was flung open before rincewind could collect himself sufficiently to make a dash for the window .   but instead of the greed crazed madman he expected  he found himself looking into the round red face of a sergeant of the watch .  he breathed again .  of course .  the watch were always careful not to intervene too soon in any brawl where the odds were not heavily stacked in their favor .  the job carried a pension  and attracted a cautious  thoughtful kind of man .   the sergeant glowered at rincewind  and then peered at twoflower with interest .      everything all right here  then .     he said .      oh  fine     said rincewind .     got held up  did you .      the sergeant ignored him .     this the foreigner  then .     he inquired .      we were just leaving     said rincewind quickly  and switched to trob .     twoflower  i think we ought to get lunch somewhere else .  i know some places .      he marched out into the corridor with as much aplomb as he could muster .  twoflower followed  and a few seconds later there was a strangling sound from the sergeant as the luggage closed its lid with a snap  stood up  stretched  and marched after them .   watchmen were dragging bodies out of the room downstairs .  there were no survivors .  the watch had ensured this by giving them ample time to escape via the back door  a neat compromise between caution and justice that benefited all parties .      who are all these men .     said twoflower .      oh  you know .  just men     said rincewind .  and before he could stop himself some part of his brain that had nothing to do took control of his mouth and added     heroes  in fact .         really .      when one foot is stuck in the grey miasma of h   rull it is much easier to step right in and sink rather than prolong the struggle .  rincewind let himself go .      yes  that one over there is erig stronginthearm  over there is black zenell           is hrun the barbarian here .     said twoflower  looking around eagerly .  rincewind took a deep breath .      that   s him behind us     he said .   the enormity of this lie was so great that its ripples did in fact spread out one of the lower astral planes as far as the magical quarter across the river  where it picked up tremendous velocity from the huge standing wave of power that always hovered there and bounced wildly across the circle sea .  a harmonic got as far as hrun himself  currently fighting a couple of gnolls on a crumbling ledge high in the caderack mountains  and caused him a moment   s unexplained discomfort .   twoflower  meanwhile  had thrown back the lid of the luggage and was hastily pulling out a heavy black cube .      this is fantastic .     he said .     they   re never going to believe this at home .         what   s he going on about .     said the sergeant doubtfully .      he   s pleased you rescued us     said rincewind .  he looked sidelong at the black box  half expecting it to explode or emit strange musical tones .      ah     said the sergeant .  he was staring at the box  too .   twoflower smiled brightly at them .      i   d like a record of the event     he said .     do you think you could ask them all to stand over by the window  please .  this won   t take a moment .  and  er  rincewind .         yes .      twoflower stood on tiptoe to whisper .      i expect you know what this is  don   t you .      rincewind stared down at the box .  it had a round glass eye protruding from the center of one face  and a lever at the back .      not wholly     he said .      it   s a device for making pictures quickly     said twoflower .     quite a new invention .  i   m rather proud of it but  look  i don   t think these gentlemen would   well  i mean they might be   sort of apprehensive .  could you explain it to them .  i   ll reimburse them for their time  of course .         he   s got a box with a demon in it that draws pictures     said rincewind shortly .     do what the madman says and he will give you gold .      the watch smiled nervously .      i   d like you in the picture  rincewind .  that   s fine .     twoflower took out the golden disc that rincewind had noticed before  squinted at its unseen face for a moment  muttered    thirty seconds should about do it     and said brightly     smile please .         smile     rasped rincewind .  there was a whirr from the box .      right .         high above the disc the second albatross soared  so high in fact that its tiny mad orange eyes could see the whole of the world and the great  glittering  girdling circle sea .  there was a yellow message capsule strapped to one leg .  far below it  unseen in the clouds  the bird that had brought the earlier message to the patrician of ankh morpork flapped gently back to its home .      rincewind looked at the tiny square of glass in astonishment .  there he was  all right   a tiny figure  in perfect color  standing in front of a group of watchmen whose faces were each frozen in a terrified rictus .  a buzz of wordless terror went up from the men around him as they craned over his shoulder to look .   grinning  twoflower produced a handful of the smaller coins rincewind now recognized as quarter rhinu .  he winked at the wizard .      i had similar problems when i stopped over in the brown islands     he said .     they thought the iconograph steals a bit of their souls .  laughable  isn   t it .         yarg     said rincewind and then  because somehow that was hardly enough to keep up his side of the conversation  added     i don   t think it looks very like me  though .         it   s easy to operate     said twoflower  ignoring him .     look  all you have to do is press this button .  the iconograph does the rest .  now  i   ll just stand over here next to hrun  and you can take the picture .      the coins quietened the men   s agitation in the way that gold can  and rincewind was amazed to find  half a minute later  that he was holding a little glass portrait of twoflower wielding a huge notched sword and smiling as though all his dreams had come true .      they lunched at a small eating house near the brass bridge  with the luggage nestling under the table .  the food and wine  both far superior to rincewind   s normal fare  did much to relax him .  things weren   t going to be too bad  he decided .  a bit of invention and some quick thinking  that was all that was needed .   twoflower seemed to be thinking too .  looking reflectively into his wine cup he said     tavern fights are pretty common around here  i expect .         oh  fairly .         no doubt fixtures and fittings get damaged .         fixt   oh  i see .  you mean like benches and whatnot .  yes  i suppose so .         that must be upsetting for the innkeepers .         i   ve never really thought about it .  i suppose it must be one of the risks of the job .      twoflower regarded him thoughtfully .      i might be able to help there     he said .     risks are my business .  i say  this food is a bit greasy  isn   t it .         you did say you wanted to try some typical morporkean food     said rincewind .     what was that about risks .         oh  i know all about risks .  they   re my business .         i thought that   s what you said .  i didn   t believe it the first time either .         oh  i don   t take risks .  about the most exciting thing that happened to me was knocking some ink over .  i assess risks .  day after day .  do you know what the odds are against a house catching fire in the red triangle district of bes pelargic .  five hundred and thirty eight to one .  i calculated that     he added with a trace of pride .      what       rincewind tried to suppress a burp      what for .     scuse me .     he helped himself to some more wine .      for       twoflower paused .     i can   t say it in trob     he said .     i don   t think the betrobi have a word for it .  in my language we call it       he said a collection of outlandish syllables .      inn sewer ants     repeated rincewind .     tha   s a funny word .  wossit mean .         well  suppose you have a ship loaded with  say  gold bars .  it might run into storms or  or be taken by pirates .  you don   t want that to happen  so you take out an inn sewer ants polly sea .  i work out the odds against the cargo being lost  based on weather reports and piracy records for the last twenty years  then i add a bit  then you pay me some money based on those odds              and the bit       rincewind said  waggling a finger solemnly .         and then  if the cargo is lost  i reimburse you .         reeburs .         pay you the value of your cargo     said twoflower patiently .      i get it .  it   s like a bet  right .         a wager .  in a way  i suppose .         and you make money at this inn sewer ants .         it offers a return on investment  certainly .      wrapped in the warm yellow glow of the wine  rincewind tried to think of inn sewer ants in circle sea terms .      i don   t think i unnerstan    this inn sewer ants     he said firmly  idly watching the world spin by .     magic  now .  magic i unnerstan    .      twoflower grinned .     magic is one thing  and reflected sound of underground spirits is another     he said .      wha    .         what .         that funny wor    you used     said rincewind impatiently .      reflected sound of underground spirits .         never heard o    it .      twoflower tried to explain .   rincewind tried to understand .      in the long afternoon they toured the city turnwise of the river .  twoflower led the way  with the strange picture box slung on a strap around his neck .  rincewind trailed behind  whimpering at intervals and checking to see that his head was still there .   a few others followed  too .  in a city where public executions  duels  fights  magical feuds and strange events regularly punctuated the daily round the inhabitants had brought the profession of interested bystander to a peak of perfection .  they were  to a man  highly skilled gawpers .  in any case  twoflower was delightedly taking picture after picture of people engaged in what he described as typical activities  and since a quarter rhinu would subsequently change hands    for their trouble    a tail of bemused and happy nouveauxriches was soon following him in case this madman exploded in a shower of gold .   at the temple of the seven handed sek a hasty convocation of priests and ritual heart transplant artisans agreed that the hundred span high statue of sek was altogether too holy to be made into a magic picture  but a payment of two rhinu left them astoundedly agreeing that perhaps he wasn   t as holy as all that .   a prolonged session at the whore pits produced a number of colorful and instructive pictures  a number of which rincewind concealed about his person for detailed perusal in private .  as the fumes cleared from his brain he began to speculate seriously as to how the iconograph worked .   even a failed wizard knew that some substances were sensitive to light .  perhaps the glass plates were treated by some arcane process that froze the light that passed through them .  something like that  anyway .  rincewind often suspected that there was something  somewhere  that was better than magic .  he was usually disappointed .   however  he soon took every opportunity to operate the box .  twoflower was only too pleased to allow this  since that enabled the little man to appear in his own pictures .  it was at this point that rincewind noticed something strange .  possession of the box conferred a kind of power on the wielder   which was that anyone  confronted with the hypnotic glass eye  would submissively obey the most peremptory orders about stance and expression .   it was while he was thus engaged in the plaza of broken moons that disaster struck .   twoflower had posed alongside a bewildered charm seller  his crowd of newfound admirers watching him with interest in case he did something humorously lunatic .   rincewind got down on one knee  the better to arrange the picture  and pressed the enchanted lever .   the box said     it   s no good .  i   ve run out of pink .      a hitherto unnoticed door opened in front of his eyes .  a small  green and hideously warty humanoid figure leaned out  pointed at a color encrusted palette in one clawed hand  and screamed at him .      no pink .  see .     screeched the homunculus .     no good you going on pressing the lever when there   s no pink  is there .  if you wanted pink you shouldn   t of took all those pictures of young ladies  should you .  it   s monochrome from now on  friend .  all right .         all right .  yeah  sure     said rincewind .  in one dim corner of the little box he thought he could see an easel  and a tiny unmade bed .  he hoped he couldn   t .      so long as that   s understood     said the imp  and shut the door .  rincewind thought he could hear the muffled sound of grumbling and the scrape of a stool being dragged across the floor .      twoflower       he began  and looked up .   twoflower had vanished .  as rincewind stared at the crowd  with sensations of prickly horror traveling up his spine  there came a gentle prod in the small of his back .      turn without haste     said a voice like black silk .     or kiss your kidneys goodbye .      the crowd watched with interest .  it was turning out to be quite a good day .   rincewind turned slowly  feeling the point of the sword scrape along his ribs .  at the other end of the blade he recognized stren withel   thief  cruel swordsman  disgruntled contender for the title of worst man in the world .      hi     he said weakly .  a few yards away he noticed a couple of unsympathetic men raising the lid of the luggage and pointing excitedly at the bags of gold .  withel smiled .  it made an unnerving effect on his scar crossed face .      i know you     he said .     a gutter wizard .  what is that thing .      rincewind became aware that the lid of the luggage was trembling slightly  although there was no wind .  and he was still holding the picture box .      this .  it makes pictures     he said brightly .     hey  just hold that smile  will you .     he backed away quickly and pointed the box .   for a moment withel hesitated .     what .     he said .      that   s fine  hold it just like that       said rincewind .   the thief paused  then growled and swung his sword back .   there was a snap  and a duet of horrible screams .  rincewind did not glance around for fear of the terrible things he might see  and by the time withel looked for him again he was on the other side of the plaza  and still accelerating .      the albatross descended in wide  slow sweeps that ended in an undignified flurry of feathers and a thump as it landed heavily on its platform in the patrician   s bird garden .   the custodian of the birds  dozing in the sun and hardly expecting a long distance message so soon after this morning   s arrival  jerked to his feet and looked up .   a few moments later he was scuttling through the palace   s corridors holding the message capsule and   owing to carelessness brought on by surprise   sucking at the nasty beak wound on the back of his hand .      rincewind pounded down an alley  paying no heed to the screams of rage coming from the picture box  and cleared a high wall with his frayed robe flapping around him like the feathers of a disheveled jackdaw .  he landed in the forecourt of a carpet shop  scattering the merchandise and customers  dived through its rear exit trailing apologies  skidded down another alley and stopped  teetering dangerously  just as he was about to plunge unthinkingly into the ankh .   there are said to be some mystic rivers one drop of which can steal a man   s life away .  after its turbid passage through the twin cities the ankh could have been one of them .   in the distance the cries of rage took on a shrill note of terror .  rincewind looked around desperately for a boat  or a handhold up the sheer walls on either side of him .   he was trapped .   unbidden  the spell welled up in his mind .  it was perhaps untrue to say that he had learned it  it had learned him .  the episode had led to his expulsion from unseen university  because  for a bet  he had dared to open the pages of the last remaining copy of the creator   s own grimoire  the octavo  while the university librarian was otherwise engaged  .  the spell had leapt out of the page and instantly burrowed deeply into his mind  whence even the combined talents of the faculty of medicine had been unable to coax it .  precisely which one it was they were also unable to ascertain  except that it was one of the eight basic spells that were intricately interwoven with the very fabric of time and space itself .   since then it had been showing a worrying tendency  when rincewind was feeling rundown or especially threatened  to try to get itself said .   he clenched his teeth together but the first syllable forced itself around the corner of his mouth .  his left hand raised involuntarily and  as the magical force whirled him around  began to give off octarine sparks     the luggage hurtled around the corner  its several hundred knees moving like pistons .   rincewind gaped .  the spell died  unsaid .   the box didn   t appear to be hampered in any way by the ornamental rug draped roguishly over it  nor by the thief hanging by one arm from the lid .  it was  in a very real sense  a dead weight .  farther along the lid were the remains of two fingers  owner unknown .   the luggage halted a few feet from the wizard and  after a moment  retracted its legs .  it had no eyes that rincewind could see  but he was nevertheless sure that it was staring at him .  expectantly .      shoo     he said weakly .  it didn   t budge  but the lid creaked open  releasing the dead thief .   rincewind remembered about the gold .  presumably the box had to have a master .  in the absence of twoflower  had it adopted him .   the tide was turning and he could see debris drifting downstream in the yellow afternoon light toward the river gate  a mere hundred yards downstream .  it was the work of a moment to let the dead thief join them .  even if it was found later it would hardly cause comment .  and the sharks in the estuary were used to solid  regular meals .   rincewind watched the body drift away  and considered his next move .  the luggage would probably float .  all he had to do was wait until dusk  and then go out with the tide .  there were plenty of wild places downstream where he could wade ashore  and then   well  if the patrician really had sent out word about him then a change of clothing and a shave should take care of that .  in any case  there were other lands and he had a facility for languages .  let him but get to chimera or gonim or ecalpon and half a dozen armies couldn   t bring him back .  and then   wealth  comfort  security     there was  of course  the problem of twoflower .  rincewind allowed himself a moment   s sadness .      it could be worse     he said by way of farewell .     it could be me .      it was when he tried to move that he found his robe was caught on some obstruction .   by craning his neck he found that the edge of it was being gripped firmly by the luggage   s lid .         ah  gorphal     said the patrician pleasantly .     come in .  sit down .  can i press you to a candied starfish .         i am yours to command  master     said the old man calmly .     save  perhaps  in the matter of preserved echinoderms .      the patrician shrugged  and indicated the scroll on the table .      read that     he said .   gorphal picked up the parchment and raised one eyebrow slightly when he saw the familiar ideograms of the golden empire .  he read in silence for perhaps a minute  and then turned the scroll over to examine minutely the seal on the obverse .      you are famed as a student of empire affairs     said the patrician .     can you explain this .         knowledge in the matter of the empire lies less in noting particular events than in studying a certain cast of mind     said the old diplomat .     the message is curious  yes  but not surprising .         this morning the emperor instructed     the patrician allowed himself the luxury of a scowl     instructed me  gorphal  to protect this twoflower person .  now it seems i must have him killed .  you don   t find that surprising .         no .  the emperor is no more than a boy .  he is   idealistic .  keen .  a god to his people .  whereas this afternoon   s letter is  unless i am very much mistaken  from nine turning mirrors  the grand vizier .  he has grown old in the service of several emperors .  he regards them as a necessary but tiresome ingredient in the successful running of the empire .  he does not like things out of place .  the empire was not built by allowing things to get out of place .  that is his view .         i begin to see       said the patrician .      quite so .     gorphal smiled into his beard .     this tourist is a thing that is out of place .  after acceding to his master   s wishes nine turning mirrors would  i am quite sure  make his own arrangements with a view to ensuring that one wanderer would not be allowed to return home bringing  perhaps  the disease of dissatisfaction .  the empire likes people to stay where it puts them .  so much more convenient  then  if this twoflower disappears for good in the barbarian lands .  meaning here  master .         and your advice .     said the patrician .   gorphal shrugged .      merely that you should do nothing .  matters will undoubtedly resolve themselves .  however     he scratched an ear thoughtfully     perhaps the assassins    guild    .         ah yes     said the patrician .     the assassins    guild .  who is their president at the moment .         zlorf flannelfoot  master .         have a word with him  will you .         quite so  master .      the patrician nodded .  it was all rather a relief .  he agreed with nine turning mirrors   life was difficult enough .  people ought to stay where they were put .      brilliant constellations shone down on the discworld .  one by one the traders shuttered their shops .  one by one the ganefs  thieves  finewirers  whores  illusionists  backsliders and second story men awoke and breakfasted .  wizards went about their polydimensional affairs .  tonight saw the conjunction of two powerful planets  and already the air over the magical quarter was hazy with early spells .      look     said rincewind     this isn   t getting us anywhere .     he inched sideways .  the luggage followed faithfully  lid half open and menacing .  rincewind briefly considered making a desperate leap to safety .  the lid smacked in anticipation .   in any case  he told himself with sinking heart  the damn thing would only follow him again .  it had that dogged look about it .  even if he managed to get to a horse  he had a nasty suspicion that it would follow him at its own pace .  endlessly .  swimming rivers and oceans .  gaining slowly every night  while he had to stop to sleep .  and then one day  in some exotic city and years hence  he   d hear the sound of hundreds of tiny feet accelerating down the road behind him        you   ve got the wrong man .     he moaned .     it   s not my fault .  i didn   t kidnap him .      the box moved forward slightly .  now there was just a narrow strip of greasy jetty between rincewind   s heels and the river .  a flash of precognition told him that the box would be able to swim faster than he could .  he tried not to imagine what it would be like to drown in the ankh .      it won   t stop until you give in  you know     said a small voice conversationally .   rincewind looked down at the iconograph  still hanging around his neck .  its trapdoor was open and the homunculus was leaning against the frame  smoking a pipe and watching the proceedings with amusement .      i   ll take you in with me  at least     said rincewind through gritted teeth .   the imp took the pipe out of his mouth .     what did you say .     he said .      i said i   ll take you in with me  dammit .         suit yourself .     the imp tapped the side of the box meaningfully .     we   ll see who sinks first .      the luggage yawned  and moved forward a fraction of an inch .      oh  all right     said rincewind irritably .     but you   ll have to give me time to think .      the luggage backed off slowly .  rincewind edged his way back onto reasonably safe land and sat down with his back against a wall .  across the river the lights of ankh city glowed .      you   re a wizard     said the picture imp .     you   ll think of some way to find him .         not much of a wizard  i   m afraid .         you can just jump down on everyone and turn them into worms     the imp added encouragingly  ignoring his last remark .      no .  turning to animals is an eighth level spell .  i never even completed my training .  i only know one spell .         well  that   ll do .         i doubt it     said rincewind hopelessly .      what does it do  then .         can   t tell you .  don   t really want to talk about it .  but frankly     he sighed     no spells are much good .  it takes three months to commit even a simple one to memory  and then once you   ve used it  poof .  it   s gone .  that   s what   s so stupid about the whole magic thing  you know .  you spend twenty years learning the spell that makes nude virgins appear in your bedroom  and then you   re so poisoned by quicksilver fumes and half blind from reading old grimoires that you can   t remember what happens next .         i never thought of it like that     said the imp .      hey  look   this is all wrong .  when twoflower said they   d got better kind of magic in the empire i thought   i thought        the imp looked at him expectantly .  rincewind cursed to himself .      well  if you must know  i thought he didn   t mean magic .  not as such .         what else is there  then .      rincewind began to feel really wretched .     i don   t know     he said .     a better way of doing things  i suppose .  something with a bit of sense in it .  harnessing   harnessing the lightning  or something .      the imp gave him a kind but pitying look .      lightning is the spears hurled by the thunder giants when they fight     it said gently .     established meteorological fact .  you can   t harness it .         i know     said rincewind miserably .     that   s the flaw in the argument  of course .      the imp nodded  and disappeared into the depths of the iconograph .  a few moments later rincewind smelled bacon frying .  he waited until his stomach couldn   t stand the strain anymore  and rapped on the box .  the imp reappeared .      i   ve been thinking about what you said     it said before rincewind could open his mouth .     and even if you could get a harness on it  how could you get it to pull a cart .         what the hell are you talking about .         lightning .  it just goes up and down .  you   d want it to go along  not up and down .  anyway  it   d probably burn through the harness .         i don   t care about the lightning .  how can i think on an empty stomach .         eat something  then .  that   s logic .         how .  every time i move that damn box flexes its hinges at me .      the luggage  on cue  gaped widely .      see .         it   s not trying to bite you     said the imp .     there   s food in there .  you   re no use to it starved .      rincewind peered into the dark recesses of the luggage .  there were indeed  among the chaos of boxes and bags of gold  several bottles and packages in oiled paper .  he gave a cynical laugh  mooched around the abandoned jetty until he found a piece of wood about the right length  wedged it as politely as possible in the gap between the lid and the box  and pulled out one of the flat packages .   it held biscuits that turned out to be as hard as diamondwood .         loody    ell     he muttered  nursing his teeth .      captain eightpanther   s travelers    digestives  them     said the imp from the doorway to his box .     saved many a life at sea  they have .         oh  sure .  do you use them as a raft  or just throw them to the sharks and sort of watch them sink .  what   s in the bottles .  poison .         water .         but there   s water everywhere .  why   d he want to bring water .         trust .         trust .         yes .  that   s what he didn   t  the water here .  see .      rincewind opened a bottle .  the liquid inside might have been water .  it had a flat  empty flavor  with no trace of life .     neither taste nor smell     he grumbled .   the luggage gave a little creak  attracting his attention .  with a lazy air of calculated menace it shut its lid slowly  grinding rincewind   s impromptu wedge like a dry loaf .      all right  all right     he said .     i   m thinking .         ymor   s headquarters were in the leaning tower at the junction of rime street and frost alley .  at midnight the solitary guard leaning in the shadows looked up at the conjoining planets and wondered idly what change in his fortunes they might herald .   there was the faintest of sounds  as of a gnat yawning .   the guard glanced down the deserted street  and now caught the glimmer of moonlight on something lying in the mud a few yards away .  he picked it up .  the lunar light gleamed on gold  and his intake of breath was almost loud enough to echo down the alleyway .   there was a slight sound again  and another coin rolled into the gutter on the other side of the street .   by the time he had picked it up there was another one  a little way off and still spinning .  gold was  he remembered  said to be formed from the crystallized light of stars .  until now he had never believed it to be true  that something as heavy as gold could fall naturally from the sky .   as he drew level with the opposite alley mouth some more fell .  it was still in its bag  there was an awful lot of it  and rincewind brought it down heavily onto his head .   when the guard came to he found himself looking up into the wild eyed face of a wizard  who was menacing his throat with a sword .  in the darkness  too  something was gripping his leg .   it was the disconcerting sort of grip that suggested that the gripper could grip a whole lot harder  if he wanted to .      where is he  the rich foreigner .     hissed the wizard .     quickly .         what   s holding my leg .     said the man  with a note of terror in his voice .  he tried to wriggle free .  the pressure increased .      you wouldn   t want to know     said rincewind .     pay attention  please .  where   s the foreigner .         not here .  they   ve got him at broadman   s place .  everyone   s looking for him .  you   re rincewind  aren   t you .  the box   the box that bites people   ononono   pleasssse        rincewind had gone .  the guard felt the unseen leg gripper release his   or  as he was beginning to fear  its   hold .  then  as he tried to pull himself to his feet  something big and heavy and square cannoned into him out of the dark and plunged off after the wizard .  something with hundreds of tiny feet .      with only his homemade phrase book to help him  twoflower was trying to explain the mysteries of inn sewer ants to broadman .  the fat innkeeper was listening intently  his little black eyes glittering .   from the other end of the table ymor watched with mild amusement  occasionally feeding one of his ravens with scraps from his plate .  beside him withel paced up and down .      you fret too much     said ymor  without taking his eyes from the two men opposite him .     i can feel it  stren .  who would dare attack us here .  and the gutter wizard will come .  he   s too much of a coward not to .  and he   ll try to bargain .  and we shall have him .  and the gold .  and the chest .      withel   s one eye glared  and he smacked a fist into the palm of a black gloved hand .      who would have thought there was so much sapient pearwood in the whole of the disc .     he said .     how could we have known .         you fret too much  stren .  i   m sure you can do better this time     said ymor pleasantly .   the lieutenant snorted in disgust  and strode off around the room to bully his men .  ymor carried on watching the tourist .   it was strange  but the little man didn   t seem to realize the seriousness of his position .  ymor had on several occasions seen him look around the room with an expression of deep satisfaction .  he had also been talking for ages to broadman  and ymor had seen a piece of paper change hands .  and broadman had given the foreigner some coins .  it was strange .   when broadman got up and waddled past ymor   s chair the thiefmaster   s arm shot out like a steel spring and grabbed the fat man by his apron .      what was that all about  friend .     asked ymor quietly .      n nothing  ymor .  just private business  like .         there are no secrets between friends  broadman .         yar .  well  i   m not sure about it myself  really .  it   s a sort of bet  see .     said the innkeeper nervously .     inn sewer ants  it   s called .  it   s like a bet that the broken drum won   t get burned down .      ymor held the man   s gaze until broadman twitched in fear and embarrassment .  then the thiefmaster laughed .      this worm eaten old tinder pile .     he said .     the man must be mad .         yes  but mad with money .  he says now he   s got the   can   t remember the word  begins with a p  it   s what you might call the stake money   the people he works for in the agatean empire will pay up .  if the broken drum burns down .  not that i hope it does .  burn down .  the broken drum  i mean .  i mean  it   s like a home to me  is the drum           not entirely stupid  are you .     said ymor  and pushed the innkeeper away .   the door slammed back on its hinges and thudded into the wall .      hey  that   s my door .     screamed broadman .  then he realized who was standing at the top of the steps  and ducked behind the table a mere shaving of time before a short black dart sped across the room and thunked into the woodwork .   ymor moved his hand carefully  and poured out another flagon of beer .      won   t you join me  zlorf .     he said levelly .     and put that sword away  stren .  zlorf flannelfoot is our friend .      the president of the assassins    guild spun his short blowgun dexterously and slotted it into its holster in one smooth movement .      stren .     said ymor .   the black clad thief hissed  and sheathed his sword .  but he kept his hand on the hilt  and his eyes on the assassin .   that wasn   t easy .  promotion in the assassins    guild was by competitive examination  the practical being the most important   indeed  the only   part .  thus zlorf   s broad  honest face was a welt of scar tissue  the result of many a close encounter .  it probably hadn   t been all that good looking in any case   it was said that zlorf had chosen a profession in which dark hoods  cloaks and nocturnal prowlings figured largely because there was a day fearing trollish streak in his parentage .  people who said this in earshot of zlorf tended to carry their ears home in their hats .   he strolled down the stairs  followed by a number of assassins .  when he was directly in front of ymor he said     i   ve come for the tourist .         is it any of your business  zlorf .         yes .  grinjo  urmond   take him .      two of the assassins stepped forward .  then stren was in front of them  his sword appearing to materialize an inch from their throats without having to pass through the intervening air .      possibly i could only kill one of you     he murmured     but i suggest you ask yourselves   which one .         look up  zlorf     said ymor .   a row of yellow  baleful eyes looked down from the darkness among the rafters .      one step more and you   ll leave here with fewer eyeballs than you came with     said the thiefmaster .     so sit down and have a drink  zlorf  and let   s talk about this sensibly .  i thought we had an agreement .  you don   t rob   i don   t kill .  not for payment  that is     he added after a pause .   zlorf took the proferred beer .      so .     he said .     i   ll kill him .  then you rob him .  is he that funny looking one over there .         yes .      zlorf stared at twoflower  who grinned at him .  he shrugged .  he seldom wasted time wondering why people wanted other people dead .  it was just a living .      who is your client  may i ask .     said ymor .   zlorf held up a hand .     please .     he protested .     professional etiquette .         of course .  by the way           yes .         i believe i have a couple of guards outside           had .         and some others in the doorway across the street           formerly .         and two bowmen on the roof .      a flicker of doubt passed across zlorf   s face  like the last shaft of sunlight over a badly plowed field .   the door flew open  badly damaging the assassin who was standing beside it .      stop doing that .     shrieked broadman  from under his table .   zlorf and ymor stared up at the figure on the threshold .  it was short  fat and richly dressed .  very richly dressed .  there were a number of tall  big shapes looming behind it .  very big  threatening shapes .      who   s that .     said zlorf .      i know him     said ymor .     his name   s rerpf .  he runs the groaning platter tavern down by brass bridge .  stren   remove him .      rerpf held up a beringed hand .  stren withel hesitated halfway to the door as several very large trolls ducked under the doorway and stood on either side of the fat man  blinking in the light .  muscles the size of melons bulged in forearms like floursacks .  each troll held a double headed ax .  between thumb and forefinger .   broadman erupted from cover  his face suffused with rage .      out .     he screamed .     get those trolls out of here .      no one moved .  the room was suddenly quiet .  broadman looked around quickly .  it began to dawn on him just what he had said  and to whom .  a whimper escaped from his lips  glad to be free .   he reached the doorway to his cellars just as one of the trolls  with a lazy flick of one ham sized hand  sent his ax whirling across the room .  the slam of the door and its subsequent splitting as the ax hit it merged into one sound .      bloody hell .     exclaimed zlorf flannelfoot .      what do you want .     said ymor .      i am here on behalf of the guild of merchants and traders     said rerpf evenly .     to protect our interests  you might say .  meaning the little man .      ymor wrinkled his brows .      i   m sorry     he said .     i thought i heard you say the guild of merchants .         and traders     agreed rerpf .  behind him now  in addition to more trolls  were several humans that ymor vaguely recognized .  he had seen them  maybe  behind counters and bars .  shadowy figures  usually   easily ignored  easily forgotten .  at the back of his mind a bad feeling began to grow .  he thought about how it might be to be  say  a fox confronted with an angry sheep .  a sheep  moreover  that could afford to employ wolves .      how long has this   guild   been in existence  may i ask .     he said .      since this afternoon     said rerpf .     i   m vice guildmaster in charge of tourism  you know .         what is this tourism of which you speak .         uh   we are not quite sure       said rerpf .  an old bearded man poked his head over the guildmaster   s shoulder and cackled     speaking on behalf of the winesellers of morpork  tourism means business .  see .         well .     said ymor coldly .      well     said rerpf     we   re protecting our interests  like i said .         thieves out  thieves out .     cackled his elderly companion .     several others took up the chant .  zlorf grinned .     and assassins     chanted the old man .  zlorf growled .      stands to reason     said rerpf .     people robbing and murdering all over place  what sort of impression are visitors going to take away .  you come all the way to see our fine city with its many points of historical and civic interest  also many quaint customs  and you wake up dead in some back alley or as it might be floating down the ankh  how are you going to tell all your friends what a great time you   re having .  let   s face it  you   ve got to move with the times .      zlorf and ymor met each other   s gaze .      we have  have we .     said ymor .      then let us move  brother     agreed zlorf .  in one movement he brought his blowgun to his mouth and sent a dart hissing toward the nearest troll .  it spun around  hurling its ax  which whirred over the assassin   s head and buried itself in a luckless thief behind him .   rerpf ducked  allowing a troll behind him to raise its huge iron crossbow and fire a spear length quarrel into the nearest assassin .  that was the start        it has been remarked before that those who are sensitive to radiations in the far octarine   the eighth color  the pigment of the imagination   can see things that others cannot .   thus it was that rincewind  hurrying through the crowded  flare lit evening bazaars of morpork with the luggage trundling behind him  jostled a tall dark figure  turned to deliver a few suitable curses  and beheld death .   it had to be death .  no one else went around with empty eye sockets and  of course  the scythe over one shoulder was another clue .  as rincewind stared in horror a courting couple  laughing at some private joke  walked straight through the apparition without appearing to notice it .   death  insofar as it was possible in a face with no movable features  looked surprised .   rincewind .  death said  in tones as deep and heavy as the slamming of leaden doors  far underground .      um     said rincewind  trying to back away from that eyeless stare .   but why are you here .   boom  boom went crypt lids  in the worm haunted fastnesses under old mountains         um  why not .     said rincewind .     anyway  i   m sure you   ve got lots to do  so if you   ll just        i was surprised that you jostled me  rincewind  for i have an appointment with thee this very night .      oh no  not        of course  what   s so bloody vexing about the whole business is that i was expecting to meet thee in psephopololis .      but that   s five hundred miles away .      you don   t have to tell me .  the whole system   s got screwed up again  i can see that .  look  there   s no chance of you    .   rincewind backed away  hands spread protectively in front of him .  the dried fish salesman on a nearby stall watched this madman with interest .      not a chance .      i could lend you a very fast horse .      no .      it won   t hurt a bit .      no .     rincewind turned and ran .  death watched him go  and shrugged bitterly .   sod you  then  death said .  he turned  and noticed the fish salesman .  with a snarl death reached out a bony finger and stopped the man   s heart  but he didn   t take much pride in it .   then death remembered what was due to happen later that night .  it would not be true to say that death smiled  because in any case his features were perforce frozen in a calcareous grin .  but he hummed a little tune  cheery as a plague pit  and   pausing only to extract the life from a passing mayfly  and one ninth of the lives from a cat cowering under the fish stall  all cats can see into the octarine    death turned on his heel and set off toward the broken drum .      short street  morpork  is in fact one of the longest in the city .  filigree street crosses its turnwise end in the manner of the crosspiece of a t  and the broken drum is so placed that it looks down the full length of the street .   at the furthermost end of short street a dark oblong rose on hundreds of tiny legs  and started to run .  at first it moved at no more than a lumbering trot  but by the time it was halfway up the street it was moving arrow fast     a darker shadow inched its way along one of the walls of the drum  a few yards from the two trolls who were guarding the door .  rincewind was sweating .  if they heard the faint clinking of the specially prepared bags at his belt     one of the trolls tapped his colleague on the shoulder  producing a noise like two pebbles being knocked together .  he pointed down the starlit street     rincewind darted from his hiding place  turned  and hurled his burden through the drum   s nearest window .      withel saw it arrive .  the bag arced across the room  turning slowly in the air  and burst on the edge of a table .  a moment later gold coins were rolling across the floor  spinning  glittering .   the room was suddenly silent  save for the tiny noises of gold and the whimpers of the wounded .  with a curse withel dispatched the assassin he had been fighting .     it   s a trick .     he screamed .     no one move .      three score men and a dozen trolls froze in mid grope .   then  for the third time  the door burst open .  two trolls hurried through it  slammed it behind them  dropped the heavy bar across it and fled down the stairs .   outside there was a sudden crescendo of running feet .  and  for the last time  the door opened .  in fact it exploded  the great wooden bar being hurled far across the room and the frame itself giving way .   door and frame landed on a table  which flew into splinters .  it was then that the frozen fighters noticed that there was something else in the pile of wood .  it was a box  shaking itself madly to free itself of the smashed timber around it .   rincewind appeared in the ruined doorway  hurling another of his gold grenades .  it smashed into a wall  showering coins .      down in the cellar broadman looked up  muttered to himself  and carried on with his work .  his entire spindlewinter   s supply of candles had already been strewn on the floor  mixed with his store of kindling wood .  now he was attacking a barrel of lamp oil .      inn sewer ants     he muttered .  oil gushed out and swirled around his feet .   withel stormed across the floor  his face a mask of rage .  rincewind took careful aim and caught the thief full in the chest with a bag of gold .   but now ymor was shouting  and pointing an accusing finger .  a raven swooped down from its perch in the rafters and dived at the wizard  talons open and gleaming .   it didn   t make it .  at about the halfway point the luggage leapt from its bed of splinters  gaped briefly in midair  and snapped shut .   it landed lightly .  rincewind saw its lid open again  slightly .  just far enough for a tongue  large as a palm leaf  red as mahogany  to lick up a few errant feathers .   at the same moment the giant candlewheel fell from the ceiling  plunging the room into gloom .  rincewind  coiling himself like a spring  gave a standing jump and grasped a beam  swinging himself up into the relative safety of the roof with a strength that amazed him .      exciting  isn   t it .     said a voice by his ear .   down below  thieves  assassins  trolls and merchants all realized at about the same moment that they were in a room made treacherous of foothold by gold coins and containing something  among the suddenly menacing shapes in the semidarkness  that was absolutely horrible .  as one they made for the door  but had two dozen different recollections of its exact position .   high above the chaos rincewind stared at twoflower .      did you cut the lights down .     he hissed .      yes .         how come you   re up here .         i thought i   d better not get in everyone   s way .      rincewind considered this .  there didn   t seem to be much he could say .  twoflower added     a real brawl .  better than anything i   d imagined .  do you think i ought to thank them .  or did you arrange it .      rincewind looked at him blankly .     i think we ought to be getting down now     he said hollowly .     everyone   s gone .      he dragged twoflower across the littered floor and up the steps .  they burst out into the tail end of the night .  there were still a few stars but the moon was down  and there was a faint gray glow to rimward .  most important  the street was empty .   rincewind sniffed .      can you smell oil .     he said .   then withel stepped out of the shadows and tripped him up .      at the top of the cellar steps broadman knelt down and fumbled in his tinderbox .  it turned out to be damp .      i   ll kill that bloody cat     he muttered  and groped for the spare box that was normally on the ledge by the door .  it was missing .  broadman said a bad word .   a lighted taper appeared in midair  right beside him .   here  take this .      thanks     said broadman .   don   t mention it .   broadman went to throw the taper down the steps .  his hand paused in midair .  he looked at the taper  his brow furrowing .  then he turned around and held the taper up to illuminate the scene .  it didn   t shed much light  but it did give the darkness a shape        oh  no       he breathed .   but yes  said death .      rincewind rolled .   for a moment he thought withel was going to spit him where he lay .  but it was worse than that .  he was waiting for him to get up .      i see you have a sword  wizard     he said quietly .     i suggest you rise  and we shall see how well you use it .      rincewind stood up as slowly as he dared  and drew from his belt the short sword he had taken from the guard a few hours and a hundred years ago .  it was a short blunt affair compared to withel   s hair thin rapier .      but i don   t know how to use a sword     he wailed .      good .         you know that wizards can   t be killed by edged weapons .     said rincewind desperately .   withel smiled coldly .     so i have heard     he said .     i look forward to putting it to the test .     he lunged .   rincewind caught the thrust by sheer luck  jerked his hand away in shock  deflected the second stroke by coincidence  and took the third one through his robe at heart height .   there was a clink .   withel   s snarl of triumph died in his throat .  he drew the sword out and prodded again at the wizard  who was rigid with terror and guilt .  there was another clink  and gold coins began to drop out of the hem of the wizard   s robe .      so you bleed gold  do you .     hissed withel .     but have you got gold concealed in that raggedy beard  you little        as his sword went back for his final sweep the sullen glow that had been growing in the doorway of the broken drum flickered  dimmed  and erupted into a roaring fireball that sent the walls billowing outward and carried the roof a hundred feet into the air before bursting through it  in a gout of red hot tiles .   withel stared at the boiling flames  unnerved .  and rincewind leapt .  he ducked under the thief   s sword arm and brought his own blade around in an arc so incompetently misjudged that it hit the man flat first and jolted out of the wizard   s hand .  sparks and droplets of flaming oil rained down as withel reached out with both gauntleted hands and grabbed rincewind   s neck  forcing him down .      you did this .     he screamed .     you and your box of trickery .      his thumb found rincewind   s windpipe .  this is it  the wizard thought .  wherever i   m going  it can   t be worse than here        excuse me     said twoflower .   rincewind felt the grip lessen .  and now withel was slowly getting up  a look of absolute hatred on his face .   a glowing ember landed on the wizard .  he brushed it off hurriedly  and scrambled to his feet .   twoflower was behind withel  holding the man   s own needle sharp sword with the point resting in the small of the thief   s back .  rincewind   s eyes narrowed .  he reached into his robe  then withdrew his hand bunched into a fist .      don   t move     he said .      am i doing this right .     asked twoflower anxiously .      he says he   ll skewer your liver if you move     rincewind translated freely .      i doubt it     said withel .      bet .         no .      as withel tensed himself to turn on the tourist rincewind lashed out and caught the thief on the jaw .  withel stared at him in amazement for a moment  and then quietly toppled into the mud .   the wizard uncurled his stinging fist and the roll of gold coins slipped between his throbbing fingers .  he looked down at the recumbent thief .      good grief     he gasped .   he looked up and yelled as another ember landed on his neck .  flames were racing along the rooftops on either side of the street .  all around him people were hurling possessions from windows and dragging horses from smoking stables .  another explosion in the white hot volcano that was the drum sent a whole marble mantelpiece scything overhead .      the widdershin gate   s the nearest .     rincewind shouted above the crackle of collapsing rafters .     come on .      he grabbed twoflower   s reluctant arm and dragged him down the street .      my luggage           blast your luggage .  stay here much longer and you   ll go where you don   t need luggage .  come on .     screamed rincewind .   they jogged on through the crowd of frightened people leaving the area  while the wizard took great mouthfuls of cool dawn air .  something was puzzling him .      i   m sure all the candles went out     he said .     so how did the drum catch fire .         i don   t know     moaned twoflower .     it   s terrible  rincewind .  we were getting along so well  too .      rincewind stopped in astonishment  so that another refugee cannoned into him and spun away with an oath .      getting on .         yes  a great bunch of fellows  i thought   language was a bit of a problem  but they were so keen for me to join their party  they just wouldn   t take no for an answer   really friendly people  i thought        rincewind started to correct him  then realized he didn   t know how to begin .      it   ll be a blow for old broadman     twoflower continued .     still  he was wise .  i   ve still got the rhinu he paid as his first premium .      rincewind didn   t know the meaning of the word premium  but his mind was working fast .      you inn sewered the drum .     he said .     you bet broadman it wouldn   t catch fire .         oh yes .  standard valuation .  two hundred rhinu .  why do you ask .      rincewind turned and stared at the flames racing toward them  and wondered how much of ankh morpork could be bought for two hundred rhinu .  quite a large piece  he decided .  only not now  not the way those flames were moving     he glanced down at the tourist .      you       he began  and searched his memory for the worst word in the trob tongue  the happy little betrobi didn   t really know how to swear properly .      you     he repeated .  another hurrying figure bumped into him  narrowly missing him with the blade over its shoulder .  rincewind   s tortured temper exploded .      you little  such a one who  while wearing a copper nose ring  stands in a footbath atop mount raruaruaha during a heavy thunderstorm and shouts that alohura  goddess of lightning  has the facial features of a diseased uloruaha root  .      just doing my job  said the figure  stalking away .   every word fell as heavily as slabs of marble  moreover  rincewind was certain that he was the only one who heard them .   he grabbed twoflower again .      let   s get out of here .     he suggested .      one interesting side effect of the fire in ankh morpork concerns the inn sewer ants policy  which left the city through the ravaged roof of the broken drum  was wafted high into the discworld   s atmosphere on the ensuing thermal  and came to earth several days and a few thousand miles away on an uloruaha bush in the betrobi islands .  the simple  laughing islanders subsequently worshipped it as a god  much to the amusement of their more sophisticated neighbors .  strangely enough the rainfall and harvests in the next few years were almost supernaturally abundant  and this led to a research team being dispatched to the islands by the minor religions faculty of unseen university .  their verdict was that it only went to show .      the fire  driven by the wind  spread out from the drum faster than a man could walk .  the timbers of the widdershin gate were already on fire when rincewind  his face blistered and reddened from the flames  reached them .  by now he and twoflower were on horseback   mounts hadn   t been that hard to obtain .  a wily merchant had asked fifty times their worth  and had been left gaping when one thousand times their worth had been pressed into his hands .   they rode through just before the first of the big gate timbers descended in an explosion of sparks .  morpork was already a cauldron of flame .   as they galloped up the red lit road rincewind glanced sideways at his traveling companion  currently trying hard to learn to ride a horse .   bloody hell  he thought .  he   s alive .  me too .  who   d have thought it .  perhaps there is something in this reflected sound of underground spirits .  it was a cumbersome phrase .  rincewind tried to get his tongue around the thick syllables that were the word in twoflower   s own language .      ecolirix .     he tried .     ecro gnothics .  echo gnomics .      that would do .  that sounded about right .      several hundred yards downriver from the last smoldering suburb of the city a strangely rectangular and apparently heavily waterlogged object touched the mud on the widdershin bank .  immediately it sprouted numerous legs and scrabbled for a purchase .   hauling itself to the top of the bank the luggage   streaked with soot  stained with water and very  very angry   shook itself and took its bearings .  then it moved away at a brisk trot  the small and incredibly ugly imp that was perching on its lid watching the scenery with interest .      bravd looked at the weasel and raised his eyebrows .      and that   s it     said rincewind .     the luggage caught up with us  don   t ask me how .  is there any more wine .      the weasel picked up the empty wineskin .      i think you have had just about enough wine this night     he said .   bravd   s forehead wrinkled .      gold is gold     he said finally .     how can a man with plenty of gold consider himself poor .  you   re either poor or rich .  it stands to reason .      rincewind hiccupped .  he was finding reason rather difficult to hold on to .     well     he said     what i think is  the point is  well  you know octiron .      the two adventurers nodded .  the strange iridescent metal was almost as highly valued in the lands around the circle sea as sapient pearwood  and was about as rare .  a man who owned a needle made of octiron would never lose his way  since it always pointed to the hub of the discworld  being acutely sensitive to the disc   s magical field  it would also miraculously darn his socks .      well  my point is  you see  that gold also has its sort of magical field .  sort of financial wizardry .  echo gnomics .     rincewind giggled .   the weasel stood up and stretched .  the sun was well up now  and the city below them was wreathed in mists and full of foul vapors .  also gold  he decided .  even a citizen of morpork would  at the very point of death  desert his treasure to save his skin .  time to move .   the little man called twoflower appeared to be asleep .  the weasel looked down at him and shook his head .      the city awaits  such as it is     he said .     thank you for a pleasant tale  wizard .  what will you do now .     he eyed the luggage  which immediately backed away and snapped its lid at him .      well  there are no ships leaving the city now     giggled rincewind .     i suppose we   ll take the coast road to chirm .  i   ve got to look after him  you see .  but look  i didn   t make it           sure  sure     said the weasel soothingly .  he turned away and swung himself into the saddle of the horse that bravd was holding .  a few moments later the two heroes were just specks under a cloud of dust  heading down toward the charcoal city .   rincewind stared muzzily at the recumbent tourist .  at two recumbent tourists .  in his somewhat defenseless state a stray thought  wandering through the dimensions in search of a mind to harbor it  slid into his brain .      here   s another fine mess you   ve got me into     he moaned  and slumped backward .         mad     said the weasel .  bravd  galloping along a few feet away  nodded .      all wizards get like that     he said .     it   s the quicksilver fumes .  rots their brains .  mushrooms  too .         however       said the brown clad one .  he reached into his tunic and took out a golden disc on a short chain .  bravd raised his eyebrows .      the wizard said that the little man had some sort of golden disc that told him the time     said the weasel .      arousing your cupidity  little friend .  you always were an expert thief  weasel .         aye     agreed the weasel modestly .  he touched the knob at the disc   s rim  and it flipped open .   the very small demon imprisoned within looked up from its tiny abacus and scowled .     it lacks but ten minutes to eight of the clock     it snarled .  the lid slammed shut  almost trapping the weasel   s fingers .   with an oath the weasel hurled the time teller far out into the heather  where it possibly hit a stone .  something  in any event  caused the case to split  there was a vivid octarine flash and a whiff of brimstone as the time being vanished into whatever demonic dimension it called home .      what did you do that for .     said bravd  who hadn   t been close enough to hear the words .      do what .     said the weasel .     i didn   t do anything .  nothing happened at all .  come on   we   re wasting opportunities .      bravd nodded .  together they turned their steeds and galloped toward ancient ankh  and honest enchantments .            the sending of eight     the road from ankh morpork to chirm is high  white and winding  a thirty league stretch of potholes and half buried rocks that spirals around mountains and dips into cool green valleys of citrus trees  crosses liana webbed gorges on creaking rope bridges and is generally more picturesque than useful .   picturesque .  that was a new word to rincewind the wizard  b .  mgc .   unseen university  failed   .  it was one of a number he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of ankh morpork .  quaint was another one .  picturesque meant   he decided after careful observation of the scenery that inspired twoflower to use the word   that the landscape was horribly precipitous .  quaint  when used to describe the occasional village through which they passed  meant fever ridden and tumbledown .   twoflower was a tourist  the first ever seen on the discworld .  tourist  rincewind had decided  meant    idiot .      as they rode leisurely through the thyme scented  bee humming air  rincewind pondered on the experiences of the last few days .  while the little foreigner was obviously insane  he was also generous and considerably less lethal than half the people the wizard had mixed with in the city .  rincewind rather liked him .  disliking him would be like kicking a puppy .   currently twoflower was showing a great interest in the theory and practice of magic .      it all seems  well  rather useless to me     he said .     i always thought that  you know  a wizard just said the magic words and that was that .  not all this tedious memorizing .      rincewind agreed moodily .  he tried to explain that magic had indeed once been wild and lawless  but had been tamed back in the mists of time by the olden ones  who had bound it to obey among other things the law of conservation of reality  this demanded that the effort needed to achieve a goal should be the same regardless of the means used .  in practical terms this meant that  say  creating the illusion of a glass of wine was relatively easy  since it involved merely the subtle shifting of light patterns .  on the other hand  lifting a genuine wineglass a few feet in the air by sheer mental energy required several hours of systematic preparation if the wizard wished to prevent the simple principle of leverage flicking his brain out through his ears .   he went on to add that some of the ancient magic could still be found in its raw state  recognizable   to the initiated   by the eightfold shape it made in the crystalline structure of space time .  there was the metal octiron  for example  and the gas octogen .  both radiated dangerous amounts of raw enchantment .      it   s all very depressing     he finished .      depressing .      rincewind turned in his saddle and glanced at twoflower   s luggage  which was currently ambling along on its little legs  occasionally snapping its lid at butterflies .  he sighed .      rincewind thinks he ought to be able to harness the lightning     said the picture imp  who was observing the passing scene from the tiny doorway of the box slung around twoflower   s neck .  he had spent the morning painting picturesque views and quaint scenes for his master  and had been allowed to knock off for a smoke .      when i said harness i didn   t mean harness     snapped rincewind .     i meant  well  i just meant that   i dunno  i just can   t think of the right words .  i just think the world ought to be more sort of organized .         that   s just fantasy     said twoflower .      i know .  that   s the trouble .     rincewind sighed again .  it was all very well going on about pure logic and how the universe was ruled by logic and the harmony of numbers  but the plain fact of the matter was that the disc was manifestly traversing space on the back of a giant turtle and the gods had a habit of going around to atheists    houses and smashing their windows .   there was a faint sound  hardly louder than the noise of the bees in the rosemary by the road .  it had a curiously bony quality  as of rolling skulls or a whirling dice box .  rincewind peered around .  there was no one nearby .   for some reason that worried him .   then came a slight breeze  that grew and went in the space of a few heartbeats .  it left the world unchanged save in a few interesting particulars .   there was now  for example  a five meter tall mountain troll standing in the road .  it was exceptionally angry .  this was partly because trolls generally are  in any case  but it was exacerbated by the fact that the sudden and instantaneous teleportation from its lair in the rammerorck mountains three thousand miles away and a thousand yards closer to the rim had raised its internal temperature to a dangerous level  in accordance with the laws of conservation of energy .  so it bared its fangs and charged .      what a strange creature     twoflower remarked .     is it dangerous .         only to people .     shouted rincewind .  he drew his sword and  with a smooth overarm throw  completely failed to hit the troll .  the blade plunged on into the heather at the side of the track .   there was the faintest of sounds  like the rattle of old teeth .   the sword struck a boulder concealed in the heather   concealed  a watcher might have considered  so artfully that a moment before it had not appeared to be there at all .  it sprang up like a leaping salmon and in mid ricochet plunged deeply into the back of the troll   s gray neck .   the creature grunted  and with one swipe of a claw gouged a wound in the flank of twoflower   s horse  which screamed and bolted into the trees at the roadside .  the troll spun around and made a grab for rincewind .   then its sluggish nervous system brought it the message that it was dead .  it looked surprised for a moment  and then toppled over and shattered into gravel  trolls being silica ceous life forms  their bodies reverted instantly to stone at the moment of death  .      aaargh     thought rincewind as his horse reared in terror .  he hung on desperately as it staggered two legged across the road and then  screaming  turned and galloped into the woods .   the sound of hoofbeats died away  leaving the air to the hum of bees and the occasional rustle of butterfly wings .  there was another sound  too  a strange noise for the bright time of noonday .   it sounded like dice .         rincewind .      the long aisles of trees threw twoflower   s voice from side to side and eventually tossed it back to him  unheeded .  he sat down on a rock and tried to think .   firstly  he was lost .  that was vexing  but it did not worry him unduly .  the forest looked quite interesting and probably held elves or gnomes  perhaps both .  in fact on a couple of occasions he had thought he had seen strange green faces peering down at him from the branches .  twoflower had always wanted to meet an elf .  in fact what he really wanted to meet was a dragon  but an elf would do .  or a real goblin .   his luggage was missing  and that was annoying .  it was also starting to rain .  he squirmed uncomfortably on the damp stone  and tried to look on the bright side .  for example  during its mad dash his plunging horse had burst through some bushes and disturbed a she bear with her cubs  but had gone on before the bear could react .  then it had suddenly been galloping over the sleeping bodies of a large wolf pack and  again  its mad speed had been such that the furious yelping had been left far behind .  nevertheless  the day was wearing on and perhaps it would be a good idea   twoflower thought   not to hang about in the open .  perhaps there was a   he racked his brains trying to remember what sort of accommodation forests traditionally offered   perhaps there was a gingerbread house or something .   the stone really was uncomfortable .  twoflower looked down and  for the first time  noticed the strange carving .   it looked like a spider .  or was it a squid .  moss and lichens rather blurred the precise details .  but they didn   t blur the runes carved below it .  twoflower could read them clearly  and they said  traveler  the hospitable temple of bel shamharoth lies one thousand paces hubward .  now this was strange  twoflower realized  because although he could read the message the actual letters were completely unknown to him .  somehow the message was arriving in his brain without the tedious necessity of passing through his eyes .   he stood up and untied his now biddable horse from a sapling .  he wasn   t sure which way the hub lay  but there seemed to be an old track of sorts leading away between the trees .  this bel shamharoth seemed prepared to go out of his way to help stranded travelers .  in any case  it was that or the wolves .  twoflower nodded decisively .   it is interesting to note that  several hours later  a couple of wolves who were following twoflower   s scent arrived in the glade .  their green eyes fell on the strange eight legged carving   which may indeed have been a spider  or an octopus  or may yet again have been something altogether more strange   and they immediately decided that they weren   t so hungry  at that .      about three miles away a failed wizard was hanging by his hands from a high branch in a beech tree .   this was the end result of five minutes of crowded activity .  first  an enraged she bear had barged through the undergrowth and taken the throat out of his horse with one swipe of her paw .  then  as rincewind had fled the carnage  he had run into a glade in which a number of irate wolves were milling about .  his instructors at unseen university  who had despaired of rincewind   s inability to master levitation  would have then been amazed at the speed with which he reached and climbed the nearest tree  without apparently touching it .   now there was just the matter of the snake .   it was large and green  and wound itself along the branch with reptilian patience .  rincewind wondered if it was poisonous  then chided himself for asking such a silly question .  of course it would be poisonous .      what are you grinning for .     he asked the figure on the next branch .   i can   t help it  said death .  now would you be so kind as to let go .  i can   t hang around all day .      i can     said rincewind defiantly .   the wolves clustered around the base of the tree looked up with interest at their next meal talking to himself .   it won   t hurt  said death .  if words had weight  a single sentence from death would have anchored a ship .   rincewind   s arms screamed their agony at him .  he scowled at the vulturelike  slightly transparent figure .      won   t hurt .     he said .     being torn apart by wolves won   t hurt .      he noticed another branch crossing his dangerously narrowing one a few feet away .  if he could just reach it     he swung himself forward  one hand outstretched .   the branch  already bending  did not break .  it simply made a wet little sound and twisted .   rincewind found that he was now hanging onto the end of a tongue of bark and fiber  lengthening as it peeled away from the tree .  he looked down  and with a sort of fatal satisfaction realized that he would land right on the biggest wolf .   now he was moving slowly as the bark peeled back in a longer and longer strip .  the snake watched him thoughtfully .   but the growing length of bark held .  rincewind began to congratulate himself until  looking up  he saw what he had hitherto not noticed .  there was the largest hornets    nest he had ever seen  hanging right in his path .   he shut his eyes tightly .   why the troll .  he asked himself .  everything else is just my usual luck  but why the troll .  what the hell is going on .   click .  it may have been a twig snapping  except that the sound appeared to be inside rincewind   s head .  click  click .  and a breeze that failed to set a single leaf atremble .   the hornets    nest was ripped from the branch as the strip passed by .  it shot past the wizard   s head and he watched it grow smaller as it plummeted toward the circle of upturned muzzles .   the circle suddenly closed .   the circle suddenly expanded .   the concerted yelp of pain as the pack fought to escape the furious cloud echoed among the trees .  rincewind grinned inanely .   rincewind   s elbow nudged something .  it was the tree trunk .  the strip had carried him right to the end of the branch .  but there were no other branches .  the smooth bark beside him offered no handholds .   it offered hands  though .  two were even now thrusting through the mossy bark beside him  slim hands  green as young leaves .  then a shapely arm followed  and then the hamadryad leaned right out and grasped the astonished wizard firmly and  with that vegetable strength that can send roots questing into rock  drew him into the tree .  the solid bark parted like a mist  closed like a clam .   death watched impassively .   he glanced at the cloud of mayflies that were dancing their joyful zigzags near his skull .  he snapped his fingers .  the insects fell out of the air .  but  somehow  it wasn   t quite the same .      blind io pushed his stack of chips across the table  glowered through such of his eyes that were currently in the room  and strode out .  a few demigods tittered .  at least offler had taken the loss of a perfectly good troll with precise  if somewhat reptilian  grace .   the lady   s last opponent shifted his seat until he faced her across the board .      lord     she said  politely .      lady     he acknowledged .  their eyes met .   he was a taciturn god .  it was said that he had arrived in the discworld after some terrible and mysterious incident in another eventuality .  it is of course the privilege of gods to control their apparent outward form  even to other gods  the fate of the discworld was currently a kindly man in late middle age  graying hair brushed neatly around features that a maiden would confidently proffer a glass of small beer to  should they appear at her back door .  it was a face a kindly youth would gladly help over a stile .  except for his eyes  of course .   no deity can disguise the manner and nature of his eyes .  the nature of the two eyes of the fate of the discworld was this  that while at a mere glance they were simply dark  a closer look would reveal   too late .    that they were but holes opening onto a blackness so remote  so deep that the watcher would feel himself inexorably drawn into the twin pools of infinite night and their terrible  wheeling stars     the lady coughed politely  and laid twenty one white chips on the table .  then from her robe she took another chip  silvery and translucent and twice the size of the others .  the soul of a true hero always finds a better rate of exchange  and is valued highly by the gods .   fate raised an eyebrow .      and no cheating  lady     he said .      but who could cheat fate .     she asked .  he shrugged .      no one .  yet everyone tries .         and yet  again  i believe i felt you giving me a little assistance against the others .         but of course .  so that the endgame could be the sweeter  lady .  and now        he reached into his gaming box and brought forth a piece  setting it down on the board with a satisfied air .  the watching deities gave a collective sigh .  even the lady was momentarily taken aback .   it was certainly ugly .  the carving was uncertain  as if the craftsman   s hands were shaking in horror of the thing taking shape under his reluctant fingers .  it seemed to be all suckers and tentacles .  and mandibles  the lady observed .  and one great eye .      i thought such as he died out at the beginnings of time     she said .      mayhap our necrotic friend was loath even to go near this one     laughed fate .  he was enjoying himself .      it should never have been spawned .         nevertheless     said fate gnomically .  he scooped the dice into their unusual box  and then glanced up at her .      unless     he added     you wish to resign    .      she shook her head .      play     she said .      you can match my stake .         play .         rincewind knew what was inside trees  wood  sap  possibly squirrels .  not a palace .   still   the cushions underneath him were definitely softer than wood  the wine in the wooden cup beside him was much tastier than sap  and there could be absolutely no comparison between a squirrel and the girl sitting before him  clasping her knees and watching him thoughtfully  unless mention was made of certain hints of furriness .   the room was high  wide and lit with a soft yellow light which came from no particular source that rincewind could identify .  through gnarled and knotted archways he could see other rooms  and what looked like a very large winding staircase .  and it had looked a perfectly normal tree from the outside  too .   the girl was green   flesh green .  rincewind could be absolutely certain about that  because all she was wearing was a medallion around her neck .  her long hair had a faintly mossy look about it .  her eyes had no pupils and were a luminous green .  rincewind wished he had paid more attention to anthropology lectures at university .   she had said nothing .  apart from indicating the couch and offering him the wine she had done no more than sit watching him  occasionally rubbing a deep scratch on her arm .   rincewind hurriedly recalled that a dryad was so linked to her tree that she suffered wounds in sympathy        sorry about that     he said quickly .     it was just an accident .  i mean  there were these wolves  and           you had to climb my tree  and i rescued you     said the dryad smoothly .     how lucky for you .  and for your friend  perhaps .         friend .         the little man with the magic box     said the dryad .      oh  sure  him     said rincewind vaguely .     yeah .  i hope he   s okay .         he needs your help .         he usually does .  did he make it to a tree  too .         he made it to the temple of bel shamharoth .      rincewind choked on his wine .  his ears tried to crawl into his head in terror of the syllables they had just heard .  the soul eater .  before he could stop them the memories came galloping back .  once  while a student of practical magic at unseen university  and for a bet  he   d slipped into the little room off the main library   the room with walls covered in protective lead pentagrams  the room no one was allowed to occupy for more than four minutes and thirty two seconds  which was a figure arrived at after two hundred years of cautious experimentation     he had gingerly opened the book  which was chained to the octiron pedestal in the middle of the rune strewn floor not lest someone steal it  but lest it escape  for it was the octavo  so full of magic that it had its own vague sentience .  one spell had indeed leapt from the crackling pages and lodged itself in the dark recesses of his brain .  and  apart from knowing that it was one of the eight great spells  no one would know which one until he said it .  even rincewind did not .  but he could feel it sometimes  sidling out of sight behind his ego  biding its time     on the front of the octavo had been a representation of bel shamharoth .  he was not evil  for even evil has a certain vitality   bel shamharoth was the flip side of the coin of which good and evil are but one side .      the soul eater .  his number lyeth between seven and nine  it is twice four     rincewind quoted  his mind frozen with fear .     oh no .  where   s the temple .         hubward  toward the center of the forest     said the dryad .     it is very old .         but who would be so stupid as to worship bel   him .  i mean  devils yes  but he   s the soul eater           there were   certain advantages .  and the race that used to live in these parts had strange notions .         what happened to them  then .         i did say they used to live in these parts .     the dryad stood up and stretched out her hand .     come .  i am druellae .  come with me and watch your friend   s fate .  it should be interesting .         i   m not sure that       began rincewind .   the dryad turned her green eyes on him .      do you believe you have a choice .     she asked .      a staircase broad as a major highway wound up through the tree  with vast rooms leading off at every landing .  the sourceless yellow light was everywhere .  there was also a sound like   rincewind concentrated  trying to identify it   like far off thunder  or a distant waterfall .      it   s the tree     said the dryad shortly .      what   s it doing .     said rincewind .      living .         i wondered about that .  i mean  are we really in a tree .  have i been reduced in size .  from outside it looked narrow enough for me to put my arms around .         it is .         um  but here i am inside it .         you are .         um     said rincewind .   druellae laughed .      i can see into your mind  false wizard .  am i not a dryad .  do you not know that what you belittle by the name tree is but the mere four dimensional analogue of a whole multidimensional universe which   no  i can see you do not .  i should have realized that you weren   t a real wizard when i saw you didn   t have a staff .         lost it in a fire     lied rincewind automatically .      no hat with magic sigils embroidered on it .         it blew off .         no familiar .         it died .  look  thanks for rescuing me  but if you don   t mind i think i ought to be going .  if you could show me the way out        something in her expression made him turn around .  there were three he dryads behind him .  they were as naked as the woman  and unarmed .  that last fact was irrelevant  however .  they didn   t look as though they would need weapons to fight rincewind .  they looked as though they could shoulder their way through solid rock and beat up a regiment of trolls into the bargain .  the three handsome giants looked down at him with wooden menace .  their skins were the color of walnut husks  and under it muscles bulged like sacks of melons .   he turned around again and grinned weakly at druellae .  life was beginning to take on a familiar shape again .      i   m not rescued  am i .     he said .     i   m captured  right .         of course .         and you   re not letting me go .     it was a statement .   druellae shook her head .     you hurt the tree .  but you are lucky .  your friend is going to meet bel shamharoth .  you will only die .      from behind two hands gripped his shoulders in much the same way that an old tree root coils relentlessly around a pebble .      with a certain amount of ceremony  of course     the dryad went on .     after the sender of eight has finished with your friend .      all rincewind could manage to say was     you know  i never imagined there were he dryads .  not even in an oak tree .      one of the giants grinned at him .   druellae snorted .     stupid .  where do you think acorns come from .      there was a vast empty space like a hall  its roof lost in the golden haze .  the endless stair ran right up through it .   several hundred dryads were clustered at the other end of the hall .  they parted respectfully when druellae approached  and stared through rincewind as he was propelled firmly along behind .   most of them were females  although there were a few of the giant males among them .  they stood like god shaped statues among the small  intelligent females .  insects  thought rincewind .  the tree is like a hive .   but why were there dryads at all .  as far as he could recall  the tree people had died out centuries before .  they had been out evolved by humans  like most of the other twilight peoples .  only elves and trolls had survived the coming of man to the discworld  the elves because they were altogether too clever by half  and the trollen folk because they were at least as good as humans at being nasty  spiteful and greedy .  dryads were supposed to have died out  along with gnomes and pixies .   the background roar was louder here .  sometimes a pulsing golden glow would race up the translucent walls until it was lost in the haze overhead .  some power in the air made it vibrate .      o incompetent wizard     said druellae     see some magic .  not your weasel faced tame magic  but root and branch magic  the old magic .  wild magic .  watch .      fifty or so of the females formed a tight cluster  joined hands and walked backward until they formed the circumference of a large circle .  the rest of the dryads began a low chant .  then  at a nod from druellae  the circle began to spin widdershins .   as the pace began to quicken and the complicated threads of the chant began to rise rincewind found himself watching  fascinated .  he had heard about the old magic at university  although it was forbidden to wizards .  he knew that when the circle was spinning fast enough against the standing magical field of the discworld itself in its slow turning  the resulting astral friction would build up a vast potential difference which would earth itself by a vast discharge of the elemental magical force .   the circle was a blur now  and the walls of the tree rang with the echoes of the chant     rincewind felt the familiar sticky prickling in the scalp that indicated the build up of a heavy charge of raw enchantment in the vicinity  and so he was not utterly amazed when  a few seconds later  a shaft of vivid octarine light speared down from the invisible ceiling and focused  crackling  in the center of the circle .   there it formed an image of a storm swept  tree girt hill with a temple on its crest .  its shape did unpleasant things to the eye .  rincewind knew that if it was a temple to bel shamharoth it would have eight sides .   eight was also the number of bel shamharoth  which was why a sensible wizard would never mention the number if he could avoid it .  or you   ll be eight alive  apprentices were jocularly warned .  bel shamharoth was especially attracted to dabblers in magic who  by being as it were beachcombers on the shores of the unnatural  were already half enmeshed in his nets .  rincewind   s room number in his hall of residence had been  a .  he hadn   t been surprised .       rain streamed off the black walls of the temple .  the only sign of life was the horse tethered outside  and it wasn   t twoflower   s horse .  for one thing  it was too big .  it was a white charger with hooves the size of meat dishes and leather harness aglitter with ostentatious gold ornamentation .  it was currently enjoying a nosebag .   there was something familiar about it .  rincewind tried to remember where he had seen it before .   it looked as though it was capable of a fair turn of speed  anyway .  a speed which  once it had lumbered up to it  it could maintain for a long time .  all rincewind had to do was shake off his guards  fight his way out of the tree  find the temple and steal the horse out from under whatever it was that bel shamharoth used for a nose .      the sender of eight has two for dinner  it seems     said druellae  looking hard at rincewind .     who does that steed belong to  false wizard .         i   ve no idea .         no .  well  it does not matter .  we shall see soon enough .      she waved a hand .  the focus of the image moved inward  darted through a great octagonal archway and sped along the corridor within .   there was a figure there  sidling along stealthily with its back against one wall .  rincewind saw the gleam of gold and bronze .   there was no mistaking that shape .  he   d seen it many times .  the wide chest  the neck like a tree trunk  the surprisingly small head under its wild thatch of black hair looking like a tomato on a coffin   he could put a name to the creeping figure  and that name was hrun the barbarian .   hrun was one of the circle sea   s more durable heroes  a fighter of dragons  a despoiler of temples  a hired sword  the kingpost of every street brawl .  he could even   and unlike many heroes of rincewind   s acquaintance   speak words of more than two syllables  if given time and maybe a hint or two .   there was a sound on the edge of rincewind   s hearing .  it sounded like several skulls bouncing down the steps of some distant dungeon .  he looked sideways at his guards to see if they had heard it .   they had all their limited attention focused on hrun  who was admittedly built on the same lines as themselves .  their hands were resting lightly on the wizard   s shoulders .   rincewind ducked  jerked backward like a tumbler  and came up running .  behind him he heard druellae shout  and he redoubled his speed .   something caught the hood of his robe  which tore off .  a he dryad waiting at the stairs spread his arms wide and grinned woodenly at the figure hurtling toward him .  without breaking his stride rincewind ducked again  so low that his chin was on a level with his knees  while a fist like a log sizzled through the air by his ear .   ahead of him a whole spinney of the tree men awaited .  he spun around  dodged another blow from the puzzled guard  and sped back toward the circle  passing on the way the dryads who were pursuing him and leaving them as disorganized as a set of skittles .   but there were still more in front  pushing their way through the crowds of females and smacking their fists into the horny palms of their hands with anticipatory concentration .      stand still  false wizard     said druellae  stepping forward .  behind her the enchanted dancers spun on  the focus of the circle was now drifting along a violet lit corridor .   rincewind cracked .      will you knock that off .     he snarled .     let   s just get this straight  right .  i am a real wizard .     he stamped a foot pettulantly .      indeed .     said the dryad .     then let us see you pass a spell .         uh       began rincewind .  the fact was that  since the ancient and mysterious spell had squatted in his mind  he had been unable to remember even the simplest cantrap for  say  killing cockroaches or scratching the small of his back without using his hands .  the mages at unseen university had tried to explain this by suggesting that the involuntary memorizing of the spell had  as it were  tied up all his spellretention cells .  in his darker moments rincewind had come up with his own explanation as to why even minor spells refused to stay in his head for more than a few seconds .   they were scared  he decided .      um       he repeated .      a small one would do     said druellae  watching him curl his lips in a frenzy of anger and embarrassment .  she signaled  and a couple of he dryads closed in .   the spell chose that moment to vault into the temporarily abandoned saddle of rincewind   s consciousness .  he felt it sitting there  leering defiantly at him .      i do know a spell     he said wearily .      yes .  pray tell     said druellae .   rincewind wasn   t sure that he dared  although the spell was trying to take control of his tongue .  he fought it .      you thed you could read by bind     he said indistinctly .     read it .      she stepped forward  looking mockingly into his eyes .   her smile froze .  her hands raised protectively  she crouched back .  from her throat came a sound of pure terror .   rincewind looked around .  the rest of the dryads were also backing away .  what had he done .  something terrible  apparently .   but in his experience it was only a matter of time before the normal balance of the universe restored itself and started doing the usual terrible things to him .  he backed away  ducked between the still spinning dryads who were creating the magic circle  and watched to see what druellae would do next .      grab him     she screamed .     take him a long way from the tree and kill him .      rincewind turned and bolted .   across the focus of the circle .   there was a brilliant flash .   there was a sudden darkness .   there was a vaguely rincewind shaped violet shadow  dwindling to a point and winking out .   there was nothing at all .      hrun the barbarian crept soundlessly along the corridors  which were lit with a light so violet that it was almost black .  his earlier confusion was gone .  this was obviously a magical temple  and that explained everything .   it explained why  earlier in the afternoon  he had espied a chest by the side of the track while riding through this benighted forest .  its top was invitingly open  displaying much gold .  but when he had leapt off his horse to approach it the chest had sprouted legs and had gone trotting off into the forest  stopping again a few hundred yards away .   now  after several hours of teasing pursuit  he had lost it in these hell lit tunnels .  on the whole  the unpleasant carvings and occasional disjointed skeletons he passed held no fears for hrun .  this was partly because he was not exceptionally bright while being at the same time exceptionally unimaginative  but it was also because odd carvings and perilous tunnels were all in a day   s work .  he spent a great deal of time in similar situations  seeking gold or demons or distressed virgins and relieving them respectively of their owners  their lives and at least one cause of their distress .   observe hrun  as he leaps cat footed across a suspicious tunnel mouth .  even in this violet light his skin gleams coppery .  there is much gold about his person  in the form of anklets and wristlets  but otherwise he is naked except for a leopardskin loincloth .  he took that in the steaming forests of howondaland  after killing its owner with his teeth .   in his right hand he carries the magical black sword kring  which was forged from a thunderbolt and has a soul but suffers no scabbard .  hrun had stolen it only three days before from the impregnable palace of the archmandrite of b   ituni  and he was already regretting it .  it was beginning to get on his nerves .      i tell you it went down that last passage on the right     hissed kring in a voice like the scrape of a blade over stone .      be silent .         all i said was           shut up .         and twoflower     he was lost  he knew that .  either the building was much bigger than it looked  or he was now on some wide underground level without having gone down any steps  or   as he was beginning to suspect   the inner dimensions of the place disobeyed a fairly basic rule of architecture by being bigger than the outside .  and why all these strange lights .  they were eight sided crystals set at regular intervals in the walls and ceiling  and they shed a rather unpleasant glow that didn   t so much illuminate as outline the darkness .   and whoever had done those carvings on the wall  twoflower thought charitably  had probably been drinking too much .  for years .   on the other hand  it was certainly a fascinating building .  its builders had been obsessed with the number eight .  the floor was a continuous mosaic of eight sided tiles  the corridor walls were angled to give the corridors eight sides if the walls and ceilings were counted and  in those places where part of the masonry had fallen in  twoflower noticed that even the stones themselves had eight sides .      i don   t like it     said the picture imp  from his box around twoflower   s neck .      why not .     inquired twoflower .      it   s weird .         but you   re a demon .  demons can   t call things weird .  i mean  what   s weird to a demon .         oh  you know     said the demon cautiously  glancing around nervously and shifting from claw to claw .     things .  stuff .      twoflower looked at him sternly .     what things .      the demon coughed nervously  demons do not breathe  however  every intelligent being  whether it breathes or not  coughs nervously at some time in its life .  and this was one of them as far as the demon was concerned  .      oh  things     it said wretchedly .     evil things .  things we don   t talk about is the point i   m broadly trying to get across  master .      twoflower shook his head wearily .     i wish rincewind was here     he said .     he   d know what to do .         him .     sneered the demon .     can   t see a wizard coming here .  they can   t have anything to do with the number eight .     the demon slapped a hand across his mouth guiltily .   twoflower looked up at the ceiling .      what was that .     he asked .     didn   t you hear something .         me .  hear .  no .  not a thing .     the demon insisted .  it jerked back into its box and slammed the door .  twoflower tapped on it .  the door opened a crack .      it sounded like a stone moving     he explained .  the door banged shut .  twoflower shrugged .      the place is probably falling to bits     he said to himself .  he stood up .      i say .     he shouted .     is anyone there .      air  air  air  replied the dark tunnels .      hullo .     he tried .   lo  lo  lo .      i know there   s someone here  i just heard you playing dice .      ice  ice  ice .      look  i had just        twoflower stopped .  the reason for this was the bright point of light that had popped into existence a few feet from his eyes .  it grew rapidly  and after a few seconds was the tiny bright shape of a man .  at this stage it began to make a noise  or  rather  twoflower started to hear the noise it had been making all along .  it sounded like a sliver of a scream  caught in one long instant of time .   the iridescent man was doll sized now  a tortured shape tumbling in slow motion while hanging in midair .  twoflower wondered why he had thought of the phrase    a sliver of a scream      and began to wish he hadn   t .   it was beginning to look like rincewind .  the wizard   s mouth was open  and his face was brilliantly lit by the light of   what .  strange suns  twoflower found himself thinking .  suns men don   t usually see .  he shivered .   now the turning wizard was half man size .  at that point the growth was faster  there was a sudden crowded moment  a rush of air  and an explosion of sound .  rincewind tumbled out of the air  screaming .  he hit the floor hard  choked  then rolled over with his head cradled in his arms and his body curled up tightly .   when the dust had settled twoflower reached out gingerly and tapped the wizard on the shoulder .  the human ball rolled up tighter .      it   s me     explained twoflower helpfully .  the wizard unrolled a fraction .      what .     he said .      me .      in one movement rincewind unrolled and bounced up in front of the little man  his hands gripping his shoulders desperately .  his eyes were wild and wide .      don   t say it .     he hissed .     don   t say it and we might get out .         get out .  how did you get in .  don   t you know           don   t say it .      twoflower backed away from this madman .      don   t say it .         don   t say what .         the number .         number .     said twoflower .     hey  rincewind           yes  number .  between seven and nine .  four plus four .         what  ei        rincewind   s hands clapped over the man   s mouth .     say it and we   re doomed .  just don   t think about it  right .  trust me .         i don   t understand .     wailed twoflower .  rincewind relaxed slightly  which was to say that he still made a violin string look like a bowl of jelly .      come on     he said .     let   s try and get out .  and i   ll try and tell you .         after the first age of magic the disposal of grimoires began to become a severe problem on the discworld .  a spell is still a spell even when imprisoned temporarily in parchment and ink .  it has potency .  this is not a problem while the book   s owner still lives  but on his death the spell book becomes a source of uncontrolled power that cannot easily be defused .   in short  spell books leak magic .  various solutions have been tried .  countries near the rim simply loaded down the books of dead mages with leaden pentalphas and threw them over the edge .  near the hub less satisfactory alternatives were available .  inserting the offending books in canisters of negatively polarized octiron and sinking them in the fathomless depths of the sea was one  burial in deep caves on land was earlier ruled out after some districts complained of walking trees and five headed cats  but before long the magic seeped out and eventually fishermen complained of shoals of invisible fish or psychic clams .   a temporary solution was the construction  in various centers of magical lore  of large rooms made of denatured octiron  which is impervious to most forms of magic .  here the more critical grimoires could be stored until their potency had attenuated .   that was how there came to be at unseen university the octavo  greatest of all grimoires  formerly owned by the creator of the universe .  it was this book that rincewind had once opened for a bet .  he had only a second to stare at a page before setting off various alarm spells  but that was time enough for one spell to leap from it and settle in his memory like a toad in a stone .         then what .     said twoflower .      oh  they dragged me out .  thrashed me  of course .         and no one knows what the spell does .      rincewind shook his head .      it   d vanished from the page     he said .     no one will know until i say it .  or until i die  of course .  then it will sort of say itself .  for all i know it stops the universe  or ends time  or anything .      twoflower patted him on the shoulder .      no sense in brooding     he said cheerfully .     let   s have another look for a way out .      rincewind shook his head .  all the terror had been spent now .  he had broken through the terror barrier  perhaps  and was in the dead calm state of mind that lies on the other side .  anyway  he had ceased to gibber .      we   re doomed     he stated .     we   ve been walking around all night .  i tell you  this place is a spiderweb .  it doesn   t matter which way we go  we   ll end up in the center .         it was kind of you to come looking for me  anyway     said twoflower .     how did you manage it exactly .  it was very impressive .         oh  well     began the wizard awkwardly .     i just thought    i can   t leave old twoflower there    and           so what we   ve got to do now is find this bel shamharoth person and explain things to him and perhaps he   ll let us out     said twoflower .   rincewind ran a finger around his ear .      it must be the funny echoes in here     he said .     i thought i heard you use words like find and explain .         that   s right .      rincewind glared at him in the hellish purple glow .      find bel shamharoth .     he said .      yes .  we don   t have to get involved .         find the soul render and not get involved .  just give him a nod  i suppose  and ask the way to the exit .  explain things to the sender of eignnnngh     rincewind bit off the end of the word just in time and finished     you   re insane .  hey .  come back .      he darted down the passage after twoflower  and after a few moments came to a halt with a groan .   the violet light was intense here  giving everything new and unpleasant colors .  this wasn   t a passage  it was a wide room with walls to a number that rincewind didn   t dare to contemplate  and ei   and  a passages radiating from it .   rincewind saw  a little way off  a low altar with the same number of sides as four times two .  it didn   t occupy the center of the room  however .  the center was occupied by a huge stone slab with twice as many sides as a square .  it looked massive .  in the strange light it appeared to be slightly tilted  with one edge standing proud of the slabs around it .   twoflower was standing on it .      hey .  rincewind .  look what   s here .      the luggage came ambling down one of the other passages that radiated from the room .      that   s great     said rincewind .     fine .  it can lead us out of here .  now .      twoflower was already rummaging in the chest .      yes     he said .     after i   ve taken a few pictures .  just let me fit the attachment           i said now        rincewind stopped .  hrun the barbarian was standing in the passage mouth directly opposite him  a great black sword held in one ham sized fist .      you .     said hrun uncertainly .      ahaha .  yes     said rincewind .     hrun  isn   t it .  long time no see .  what brings you here .      hrun pointed to the luggage .      that     he said .  this much conversation seemed to exhaust hrun .  then he added  in a tone that combined statement  claim  threat and ultimatum     mine .         it belongs to twoflower here     said rincewind .     here   s a tip .  don   t touch it .      it dawned on him that this was precisely the wrong thing to say  but hrun had already pushed twoflower away and was reaching for the luggage        which sprouted legs  backed away  and raised its lid threateningly .  in the uncertain light rincewind thought he could see rows of enormous teeth  white as bleached beech wood .      hrun     he said quickly     there   s something i ought to tell you .      hrun turned a puzzled face to him .      what .     he said .      it   s about numbers .  look  you know if you add seven and one  or three and five  or take two from ten  you get a number .  while you   re here don   t say it  and we might all stand a chance of getting out of here alive .  or merely just dead .         who is he .     asked twoflower .  he was holding a cage in his hands  dredged from the bottommost depths of the luggage .  it appeared to be full of sulking pink lizards .      i am hrun     said hrun proudly .  then he looked at rincewind .      what .     he said .      just don   t say it  okay .     said rincewind .   he looked at the sword in hrun   s hand .  it was black  the sort of black that is less a color than a graveyard of colors  and there was a highly ornate runic inscription up the blade .  more noticeable still was the faint octarine glow that surrounded it .  the sword must have noticed him  too  because it suddenly spoke in a voice like a claw being scraped across glass .      strange     it said .     why can   t he say eight .      eight  hate  ate said the echoes .  there was the faintest of grinding noises  deep under the earth .   and the echoes  although they became softer  refused to die away .  they bounced from wall to wall  crossing and recrossing  and the violet light flickered in time with the sound .      you did it .     screamed rincewind .     i said you shouldn   t say eight .      he stopped  appalled at himself .  but the word was out now  and joined its colleagues in the general susurration .   rincewind turned to run  but the air suddenly seemed to be thicker than treacle .  a charge of magic bigger than he had ever seen was building up  when he moved  in painful slow motion  his limbs left trails of golden sparks that traced their shape in the air .   behind him there was a rumble as the great octagonal slab rose into the air  hung for a moment on one edge  and crashed down on the floor .   something thin and black snaked out of the pit and wrapped itself around his ankle .  he screamed as he landed heavily on the vibrating flagstones .  the tentacle started to pull him across the floor .   then twoflower was in front of him  reaching out for his hands .  he grasped the little man   s arms desperately and they lay looking into each other   s faces .  rincewind slid on  even so .      what   s holding you .     he gasped .      n nothing .     said twoflower .     what   s happening .         i   m being dragged into this pit  what do you think .         oh  rincewind  i   m sorry           you   re sorry        there was a noise like a singing saw and the pressure on rincewind   s legs abruptly ceased .  he turned his head and saw hrun crouched by the pit  his sword a blur as it hacked at the tentacles racing out toward him .   twoflower helped the wizard to his feet and they crouched by the altar stone  watching the manic figure as it battled the questing arms .      it won   t work     said rincewind .     the sender can materialize tentacles .  what are you doing .      twoflower was feverishly attaching the cage of subdued lizards to the picture box  which he had mounted on a tripod .      i   ve just got to get a picture of this     he muttered .     it   s stupendous .  can you hear me  imp .      the picture imp opened his tiny hatch  glanced momentarily at the scene around the pit  and vanished into the box .  rincewind jumped as something touched his leg  and brought his heel down on a questing tentacle .      come on     he said .     time to go zoom .     he grabbed twoflower   s arm  but the tourist resisted .      run away and leave hrun with that thing .     he said .   rincewind looked blank .     why not .     he said .     it   s his job .         but it   ll kill him .         it could be worse     said rincewind .      what .         it could be us     rincewind pointed out logically .     come on .      twoflower pointed .     hey .     he said .     it   s got my luggage .      before rincewind could restrain him twoflower ran around the edge of the pit to the box  which was being dragged across the floor while its lid snapped ineffectually at the tentacle that held it .  the little man began to kick at the tentacle in fury .   another one snapped out of the melee around hrun and caught him around the waist .  hrun himself was already an indistinct shape amid the tightening coils .  even as rincewind stared in horror the hero   s sword was wrenched from his grasp and hurled against a wall .      your spell .     shouted twoflower .   rincewind did not move .  he was looking at the thing rising out of the pit .  it was an enormous eye  and it was staring directly at him .  he whimpered as a tentacle fastened itself around his waist .   the words of the spell rose unbidden in his throat .  he opened his mouth as in a dream  shapping it around the first barbaric syllable .   another tentacle shot out like a whip and coiled around his throat  choking him .  staggering and gasping  rincewind was dragged across the floor .   one flailing arm caught twoflower   s picture box as it skittered past on its tripod .  he snatched it up instinctively  as his ancestors might have snatched up a stone when faced with a marauding tiger .  if only he could get enough room to swing it against the eye        the eye filled the whole universe in front of him .  rincewind felt his will draining away like water from a sieve .   in front of him the torpid lizards stirred in their cage on the picture box .  irrationally  as a man about to be beheaded notices every scratch and stain on the executioner   s block  rincewind saw that they had overlarge tails that were bluish white and  he realized  throbbing alarmingly .   as he was drawn toward the eye the terror struck rincewind raised the box protectively  and at the same time heard the picture imp say     they   re about ripe now  can   t hold them any longer .  everyone smile  please .      there was a        flash of light so white and so bright        it didn   t seem like light at all .   bel shamharoth screamed  a sound that started in the far ultrasonic and finished somewhere in rincewind   s bowels .  the tentacles went momentarily as stiff as rods  hurling their various cargoes around the room  before bunching up protectively in front of the abused eye .  the whole mass dropped into the pit and a moment later the big slab was snatched up by several dozen tentacles and slammed into place  leaving a number of thrashing limbs trapped around the edge .   hrun landed rolling  bounced off a wall and came up on his feet .  he found his sword and started to chop methodically at the doomed arms .  rincewind lay on the floor  concentrating on not going mad .  a hollow wooden noise made him turn his head .   the luggage had landed on its curved lid .  now it was rocking angrily and kicking its little legs in the air .   warily  rincewind looked around for twoflower .  the little man was in a crumpled heap against the wall  but at least he was groaning .   the wizard pulled himself across the floor  painfully  and whispered     what the hell was that .         why were they so bright .     muttered twoflower .     gods  my head           too bright .     said rincewind .  he looked across the floor to the cage on the picture box .  the lizards inside  now noticeably thinner  were watching him with interest .      the salamanders     moaned twoflower .     the picture   ll be overexposed  i know it           they   re salamanders .     asked rincewind incredulously .      of course .  standard attachment .      rincewind staggered across to the box and picked it up .  he   d seen salamanders before  of course  but they had been small specimens .  they had also been floating in a jar of pickle in the curiobiological museum down in the cellars of unseen university  since live salamanders were extinct around the circle sea .   he tried to remember the little he knew about them .  they were magical creatures .  they also had no mouths  since they subsisted entirely on the nourishing quality of the octarine wavelength in the discworld   s sunlight  which they absorbed through their skins .  of course  they also absorbed the rest of the sunlight as well  storing it in a special sac until it was excreted in the normal way .  a desert inhabited by discworld salamanders was a veritable lighthouse at night .   rincewind put them down and nodded grimly .  with all the octarine light in this magical place the creatures had been gorging themselves  and then nature had taken its course .   the picture box sidled away on its tripod .  rincewind aimed a kick at it  and missed .  he was beginning to dislike sapient pearwood .   something small stung his cheek .  he brushed it away irritably .   he looked around at a sudden grinding noise  and a voice like a carving knife cutting through silk said     this is very undignified .         shuddup     said hrun .  he was using kring to lever the top off the altar .  he looked up at rincewind and grinned .  rincewind hoped that rictus strung grimace was a grin .      mighty magic     commented the barbarian  pushing down heavily on the complaining blade with a hand the size of a ham .     now we share the treasure  eh .      rincewind grunted as something small and hard struck his ear .  there was a gust of wind  hardly felt .      how do you know there   s treasure in there .     he said .   hrun heaved  and managed to hook his fingers under the stone .     you find chokeapples under a chokeapple tree     he said .     you find treasure under altars .  logic .      he gritted his teeth .  the stone swung up and landed heavily on the floor .   this time something struck rincewind   s hand  heavily .  he clawed at the air and looked at the thing he had caught .  it was a piece of stone with five plus three sides .  he looked up at the ceiling .  should it be sagging like that .  hrun hummed a little tune as he began to pull crumbling leather from the desecrated altar .   the air crackled  fluoresced  hummed .  intangible winds gripped the wizard   s robe  flapping it out in eddies of blue and green sparks .  around rincewind   s head mad  half formed spirits howled and gibbered as they were sucked past .   he tried raising a hand .  it was immediately surrounded by a glowing octarine corona as the rising magical wind roared past .  the gale raced through the room without stirring one iota of dust  yet it was blowing rincewind   s eyelids inside out .  it screamed along the tunnels  its banshee wail bouncing madly from stone to stone .   twoflower staggered up  bent double in the teeth of the astral gale .      what the hell is this .     he shouted .   rincewind half turned .  immediately the howling wind caught him  nearly pitching him over .  poltergeist eddies  spinning in the rushing air  snatched at his feet .   hrun   s arm shot out and caught him .  a moment later he and twoflower had been dragged into the lee of the ravaged altar  and lay panting on the floor .  beside them the talking sword kring sparkled  its magical field boosted a hundredfold by the storm .      hold on .     screamed rincewind .      the wind .     shouted twoflower .     where   s it coming from .  where   s it blowing to .     he looked into rincewind   s mask of sheer terror  which made him redouble his own grip on the stones .      we   re doomed     murmured rincewind  while overhead the roof cracked and shifted .     where do shadows come from .  that   s where the wind is blowing .      what was in fact happening  as the wizard knew  was that as the abused spirit of bel shamharoth sank through the deeper chthonic planes his brooding spirit was being sucked out of the very stones into the region which  according to the discworld   s most reliable priests  was both under the ground and somewhere else .  in consequence his temple was being abandoned to the ravages of time  who for thousands of shamefaced years had been reluctant to go near the place .  now the suddenly released  accumulated weight of all those pent up seconds was bearing down heavily on the unbraced stones .   hrun glanced up at the widening cracks and sighed .  then he put two fingers into his mouth and whistled .   strangely the real sound rang out loudly over the pseudo sound of the widening astral whirlpool that was forming in the middle of the great octagonal slab .  it was followed by a hollow echo which sounded  he fancied  strangely like the bouncing of strange bones .  then came a noise with no hint of strangeness .  it was hollow hoofbeats .   hrun   s warhorse cantered through a creaking archway and reared up by its master  its mane streaming in the gale .  the barbarian pulled himself to his feet and slung his treasure bags into a sack that hung from the saddle  then hauled himself onto the beast   s back .  he reached down and grabbed twoflower by the scruff of his neck  dragging him across the saddle tree .  as the horse turned around rincewind took a desperate leap and landed behind hrun  who raised no objection .   the horse pounded surefooted along the tunnels  leaping sudden slides of rubble and adroitly sidestepping huge stones as they thundered down from the straining roof .  rincewind  clinging on grimly  looked behind them .   no wonder the horse was moving so swiftly .  close behind  speeding through the flickering violet light  were a large ominous looking chest and a picture box that skittered along dangerously on its three legs .  so great was the ability of sapient pearwood to follow its master anywhere  the gravegoods of dead emperors had traditionally been made of it     they reached the outer air a moment before the octagonal arch finally broke and smashed into the flags .   the sun was rising .  behind them a column of dust rose as the temple collapsed in on itself  but they did not look back .  that was a shame  because twoflower might have been able to obtain pictures unusual even by discworld standards .   there was a movement in the smoking ruins .  they seemed to be growing a green carpet .  then an oak tree spiraled up  branching out like an exploding green rocket  and was in the middle of a venerable copse even before the tips of its aged branches had stopped quivering .  a beech burst out like a fungus  matured  rotted  and fell in a cloud of tinder dust amid its struggling offspring .  already the temple was a half buried heap of mossy stones .   but time  having initially gone for the throat  was now setting out to complete the job .  the boiling interface between decaying magic and ascendant entropy roared down the hill and overtook the galloping horse  whose riders  being themselves creatures of time  completely failed to notice it .  but it lashed into the enchanted forest with the whip of centuries .      impressive  isn   t it .     observed a voice by rincewind   s knee as the horse cantered through the haze of decaying timber and falling leaves .   the voice had an eerie metallic ring to it .  rincewind looked down at kring the sword .  it had a couple of rubies set in the pommel .  he got the impression they were watching him .   from the moorland rimward of the wood they watched the battle between the trees and time  which could only have one ending .  it was a sort of cabaret to the main business of the halt  which was the consumption of quite a lot of a bear which had incautiously come within bowshot of hrun .   rincewind watched hrun over the top of his slab of greasy meat .  hrun going about the business of being a hero  he realized  was quite different to the wine bibbing  carousing hrun who occasionally came to ankh morpork .  he was cat cautious  lithe as a panther  and thoroughly at home .   and i   ve survived bel shamharoth  rincewind reminded himself .  fantastic .   twoflower was helping the hero sort through the treasure stolen from the temple .  it was mostly silver set with unpleasant purple stones .  representations of spiders  octopi and the tree dwelling octarsier of the hubland wastes figured largely in the heap .   rincewind tried to shut his ears to the grating voice beside him .  it was no use .         and then i belonged to the pasha of re   durat and played a prominent part in the battle of the great nef  which is where i received the slight nick you may have noticed some two thirds of the way up my blade     kring was saying from its temporary home in a tussock .     some infidel was wearing an octiron collar  most unsporting  and of course i was a lot sharper in those days and my master used to use me to cut silk handkerchiefs in midair and   am i boring you .         huh .  oh  no  no  not at all .  it   s all very interesting     said rincewind  with his eyes still on hrun .  how trustworthy would he be .  here they were  out in the wilds  there were trolls about        i could see you were a cultured person     kring went on .     so seldom do i get to meet really interesting people  for any length of time  anyway .  what i   d really like is a nice mantelpiece to hang over  somewhere nice and quiet .  i spent a couple of hundred years on the bottom of a lake once .         that must have been fun     said rincewind absently .      not really     said kring .      no  i suppose not .         what i   d really like is to be a plowshare .  i don   t know what that is  but it sounds like an existence with some point to it .      twoflower hurried over to the wizard .      i had a great idea     he burbled .      yah     said rincewind  wearily .     why don   t we get hrun to accompany us to quirm .      twoflower looked amazed .     how did you know .     he said .      i just thought you   d think it     said rincewind .   hrun ceased stuffing silverware into his saddlebags and grinned encouragingly at them .  then his eyes strayed back to the luggage .      if we had him with us  who   d attack us .     said twoflower .   rincewind scratched his chin .     hrun .     he suggested .      but we saved his life in the temple .         well  if by attack you mean kill     said rincewind     i don   t think he   d do that .  he   s not that sort .  he   d just rob us and tie us up and leave us for the wolves  i expect .         oh  come on .         look  this is real life     snapped rincewind .     i mean  here you are  carrying around a box full of gold  don   t you think anyone in their right minds would jump at the chance of pinching it .     i would  he added mentally   if i hadn   t seen what the luggage does to prying fingers .   then the answer hit him .  he looked from hrun to the picture box .  the picture imp was doing its laundry in a tiny tub  while the salamanders dozed in their cage .      i   ve got an idea     he said .     i mean  what is it heroes really want .         gold .     said twoflower .      no .  i mean really want .      twoflower frowned .     i don   t quite understand     he said .  rincewind picked up the picture box .      hrun     he said .     come over here  will you .         the days passed peacefully .  true  a small band of bridge trolls tried to ambush them on one occasion  and a party of brigands nearly caught them unawares one night  but unwisely tried to investigate the luggage before slaughtering the sleepers  .  hrun demanded  and got  double pay for both occasions .      if any harm comes to us     said rincewind     then there will be no one to operate the magic box .  no more pictures of hrun  you understand .      hrun nodded  his eyes fixed on the latest picture .  it showed hrun striking a heroic pose  with one foot on a heap of slain trolls .      me and you and little friend twoflowers  we all get on hokay     he said .     also tomorrow  may we get a better profile  hokay .      he carefully wrapped the picture in trollskin and stowed it in his saddlebag  along with the others .      it seems to be working     said twoflower admiringly  as hrun rode ahead to scout the road .      sure     said rincewind .     what heroes like best is themselves .         you   re getting quite good at using the picture box  you know that .         yar .         so you might like to have this .     twoflower held out a picture .      what is it .     asked rincewind .      oh  just the picture you took in the temple .      rincewind looked in horror .  there  bordered by a few glimpses of tentacle  was a huge  whorled  callused  potion stained and unfocused thumb .      that   s the story of my life     he said wearily .         you win     said fate  pushing the heap of souls across the gaming table .  the assembled gods relaxed .     there will be other games     he added .   the lady smiled into two eyes that were like holes in the universe .      and then there was nothing but the ruin of the forests and a cloud of dust on the horizon  which drifted away on the breeze .  and  sitting on a pitted and moss grown milestone  a black and raggedy figure .  his was the air of one who is unjustly put upon  who is dreaded and feared  yet who is the only friend of the poor and the best doctor for the mortally wounded .   death  although of course completely eyeless  watched rincewind disappearing with what would  had his face possessed any mobility at all  have been a frown .  death  although exceptionally busy at all times  decided that he now had a hobby .  there was something about the wizard that irked him beyond measure .  he didn   t keep appointments  for one thing .   i   ll get you yet  cully  said death  in the voice like the slamming of leaden coffin lids  see if i don   t .            the lure of the wyrm     it was called the wyrmberg and it rose almost one half of a mile above the green valley  a mountain huge  gray and upside down .   at its base it was a mere score of yards across .  then it rose through clinging cloud  curving gracefully outward like an upturned trumpet until it was truncated by a plateau fully a quarter of a mile across .  there was a tiny forest up there  its greenery cascading over the lip .  there were buildings .  there was even a small river  tumbling over the edge in a waterfall so wind whipped that it reached the ground as rain .   there were also a number of cave mouths  a few yards below the plateau .  they had a crudely carved  regular look about them  so that on this crisp autumn morning the wyrmberg hung over the clouds like a giant   s dovecote .   this would mean that the    doves    had a wingspan slightly in excess of forty yards .         i knew it     said rincewind .     we   re in a strong magical field .      twoflower and hrun looked around the little hollow where they had made their noonday halt .  then they looked at each other .   the horses were quietly cropping the rich grass by the stream .  yellow butterflies skittered among the bushes .  there was a smell of thyme and a buzzing of bees .  the wild pigs on the spit sizzled gently .   hrun shrugged and went back to oiling his biceps .  they gleamed .      looks all right to me     he said .      try tossing a coin     said rincewind .      what .         go on .  toss a coin .         hokay     said hrun .     if it gives you any pleasure .     he reached into his pouch and withdrew a handful of loose change plundered from a dozen realms .  with some care he selected a zchloty leaden quarter iotum and balanced it on a purple thumbnail .      you call     he said .     heads or       he inspected the obverse with an air of intense concentration     some sort of a fish with legs .         when it   s in the air     said rincewind .  hrun grinned and flicked his thumb .   the iotum rose  spinning .      edge     said rincewind  without looking at it .      magic never dies .  it merely fades away .   nowhere was this more evident on the wide blue expanse of the discworld than in those areas that had been the scene of the great battles of the mage wars  which had happened very shortly after creation .  in those days magic in its raw state had been widely available  and had been eagerly utilized by the first men in their war against the gods .   the precise origins of the mage wars have been lost in the fogs of time  but disc philosophers agree that the first men  shortly after their creation  understandably lost their temper .  and great and pyrotechnic were the battles that followed   the sun wheeled across the sky  the seas boiled  weird storms ravaged the land  small white pigeons mysteriously appeared in people   s clothing  and the very stability of the disc  carried as it was through space on the backs of four giant turtle riding elephants  was threatened .  this resulted in stern action by the old high ones  to whom even the gods themselves are answerable .  the gods were banished to high places  men were re created a good deal smaller  and much of the old wild magic was sucked out of the earth .   that did not solve the problem of those places on the disc which  during the wars  had suffered a direct hit by a spell .  the magic faded away   slowly  over the millennia  releasing as it decayed myriads of sub astral particles that severely distorted the reality around it        rincewind  twoflower and hrun stared at the coin .      edge it is     said hrun .     well  you   re a wizard .  so what .         i don   t do   that sort of spell .         you mean you can   t .      rincewind ignored this  because it was true .     try it again     he suggested .   hrun pulled out a fistful of coins .   the first two landed in the usual manner .  so did the fourth .  the third landed on its edge and balanced there .  the fifth turned into a small yellow caterpillar and crawled away .  the sixth  upon reaching its zenith  vanished with a sharp    spang .     a moment later there was a small thunder clap .      hey  that one was silver .     exclaimed hrun  rising to his feet and staring upward .     bring it back .         i don   t know where it   s gone     said rincewind wearily .     it   s probably still accelerating .  the ones i tried this morning didn   t come down  anyway .      hrun was still staring into the sky .      what .     said twoflower .   rincewind sighed .  he had been dreading this .      we   ve strayed into a zone with a high magical index     he said .     don   t ask me how .  once upon a time a really powerful magic field must have been generated here  and we   re feeling the aftereffects .         precisely     said a passing bush .   hrun   s head jerked down .      you mean this is one of those places .     he asked .     let   s get out of here .         right     agreed rincewind .     if we retrace our steps we might make it .  we can stop every mile or so and toss a coin .      he stood up urgently and started stuffing things into his saddlebags .      what .     said twoflower .   rincewind stopped .     look     he snapped .     just don   t argue .  come on .         it looks all right     said twoflower .     just a bit underpopulated  that   s all           yes     said rincewind .     odd  isn   t it .  come on .      there was a noise high above them  like a strip of leather being slapped on a wet rock .  something glassy and indistinct passed over rincewind   s head  throwing up a cloud of ashes from the fire  and the pig carcass took off from the spit and rocketed into the sky .   it banked to avoid a clump of trees  righted itself  roared around in a tight circle  and headed hubward leaving a trail of hot pork fat droplets .         what are they doing now .     asked the old man .   the young woman glanced at the scrying glass .      heading rimward at speed     she reported .     by the way   they   ve still got that box on legs .      the old man chuckled  an oddly disturbing sound in the dark and dusty crypt .     sapient pearwood     he said .     remarkable .  yes  i think we will have that .  please see to it  my dear   before they go beyond your power  perhaps .         silence .  or           or what  liessa .     said the old man  in this dim light there was something odd about the way he was slumped in the stone chair  .     you killed me once already  remember .      she snorted and stood up  tossing back her hair scornfully .  it was red  flecked with gold .  erect  liessa wyrmbidder was entirely a magnificent sight .  she was also almost naked  except for a couple of mere scraps of the lightest chain mail and riding boots of iridescent dragonhide .  in one boot was thrust a riding crop  unusual in that it was as long as a spear and tipped with tiny steel barbs .      my power will be quite sufficient     she said coldly .   the indistinct figure appeared to nod  or at least to wobble .     as you keep assuring me     he said .  liessa snorted  and strode out of the hall .   her father did not bother to watch her go .  one reason for this was  of course  that since he had been dead for three months his eyes were in any case not in the best of condition .  the other was that as a wizard   even a dead wizard of the fifteenth grade  his optic nerves had long since become attuned to seeing into levels and dimensions far removed from common reality  and were therefore somewhat inefficient at observing the merely mundane .   during his life they had appeared to others to be eight faceted and eerily insectile  .  besides  since he was now suspended in the narrow space between the living world and the dark shadow world of death he could survey the whole of causality itself .  that was why  apart from a mild hope that this time his wretched daughter would get herself killed  he did not devote his considerable powers to learning more about the three travelers galloping desperately out of his realm .      several hundred yards away  liessa was in a strange humor as she strode down the worn steps that led into the hollow heart of the wyrmberg  followed by half a dozen riders .  would this be the opportunity .  perhaps here was the key to break the deadlock  the key to the throne of the wyrmberg .  it was rightfully hers  of course  but tradition said that only a man could rule the wyrmberg .  that irked liessa  and when she was angry the power flowed stronger and the dragons were especially big and ugly .   if she had a man  things would be different .  someone who  for preference  was a big strapping lad but short on brains .  someone who would do what he was told     the biggest of the three now fleeing the dragonlands might do .  and if it turned out that he wouldn   t  then dragons were always hungry and needed to be fed regularly .  she could see to it that they got ugly .   uglier than usual  anyway .   the stairway passed through a stone arch and ended in a narrow ledge near the roof of the great cavern where the wyrms roosted .   sunbeams from the myriad entrances around the walls crisscrossed the dusty gloom like amber rods in which a million golden insects had been preserved .  below  they revealed nothing but a thin haze .  above     the walking rings started so close to liessa   s head that she could reach up and touch one .  they stretched away in their thousands across the upturned acres of the cavern roof .  it had taken a score of masons a score of years to hammer the pitons for all those  hanging from their work as they progressed .  yet they were as nothing compared to the eighty eight major rings that clustered near the apex of the dome .  a further fifty had been lost in the old days  as they were swung into place by teams of sweating slaves  and there had been slaves aplenty  in the first days of the power  and the great rings had gone crashing into the depths  dragging their unfortunate manipulators with them .   but eighty eight had been installed  huge as rainbows  rusty as blood .  from them        the dragons sense liessa   s presence .  air swishes around the cavern as eighty eight pairs of wings unfold like a complicated puzzle .  great heads with green  multifaceted eyes peer down at her .   the beasts are still faintly transparent .  while the men around her take their hookboots from the rack  liessa bends her mind to the task of full visualization  above her in the musty air the dragons become fully visible  bronze scales dully reflecting the sunbeam shafts .  her mind throbs  but now that the power is flowing fully she can  with barely a waver of concentration  think of other things .   now she too buckles on the hookboots and turns a graceful cartwheel to bring their hooks  with a faint clang  against a couple of the walking rings in the ceiling .   only now it is the floor .  the world has changed .  now she is standing on the edge of a deep bowl or crater  floored with the little rings across which the dragonriders are already strolling with a pendulum gait .  in the center of the bowl their huge mounts wait among the herd .  far above are the distant rocks of the cavern floor  discolored by centuries of dragon droppings .   moving with the easy gliding movement that is second nature liessa sets off toward her own dragon  laolith  who turns his great horsey head toward her .  his jowls are greasy with pork fat .   it was very enjoyable  he says in her mind .      i thought i said there were to be no unaccompanied flights .     she snaps .   i was hungry  liessa .      curb your hunger .  soon there will be horses to eat .      the reins stick in our teeth .  are there any warriors .  we like warriors .   liessa swings down the mounting ladder and lands with her legs locked around laolith   s leathery neck .      the warrior is mine .  there are a couple of others you can have .  one appears to be a wizard of sorts     she adds by way of encouragement .   oh  you know how it is with wizards .  half an hour afterward you could do with another one  the dragon grumbles .   he spreads his wings and drops .         they   re gaining .     screamed rincewind .  he bent even lower over his horse   s neck and groaned .  twoflower was trying to keep up while at the same time craning round to look at the flying beasts .      you don   t understand .     screamed the tourist  above the terrible noise of the wingbeats .     all my life i   ve wanted to see dragons .         from the inside .     shouted rincewind .     shut up and ride .     he whipped at his horse with the reins and stared at the wood ahead  trying to drag it closer by sheer willpower .  under those trees they   d be safe .  under those trees no dragons could fly     he heard the clap of wings before shadows folded around him .  instinctively he rolled in the saddle and felt the white hot stab of pain as something sharp scored a line across his shoulders .   behind him hrun screamed  but it sounded more like a bellow of rage than a cry of pain .  the barbarian had vaulted down into the heather and had drawn the black sword  kring .  he flourished it as one of the dragons curved in for another low pass .      no bloody lizard does that to me .     he roared .   rincewind leaned over and grabbed twoflower   s reins .      come on .     he hissed .      but  the dragons       said twoflower  entranced .      blast the       began the wizard  and froze .  another dragon had peeled off from the circling dots overhead and was gliding toward them .  rincewind let go of twoflower   s horse  swore bitterly  and spurred his own mount toward the trees  alone .  he didn   t look back at the sudden commotion behind him and  when a shadow passed over him  merely gibbered weakly and tried to burrow into the horse   s mane .   then  instead of the searing  piercing pain he had expected  there was a series of stinging blows as the terrified animal passed under the eaves of the wood .  the wizard tried to hang on but another low branch  stouter than the others  knocked him out of the saddle .  the last thing he heard before the flashing blue lights of unconsciousness closed in was a high reptilian scream of frustration  and the thrashing of talons in the treetops .      when he awoke a dragon was watching him  at least  it was staring in his general direction .  rincewind groaned and tried to dig his way into the moss with his shoulderblades  then gasped as the pain hit him .   through the mists of agony and fear he looked back at the dragon .   the creature was hanging from a branch of a large dead oak tree  several hundred feet away .  its bronze gold wings were tightly wrapped around its body but the long equine head turned this way and that at the end of a remarkably prehensile neck .  it was scanning the forest .   it was also semitransparent .  although the sun glinted off its scales  rincewind could clearly make out the outlines of the branches behind it .   on one of them a man was sitting  dwarfed by the hanging reptile .  he appeared to be naked except for a pair of high boots  a tiny leather hold all in the region of his groin  and a high crested helmet .  he was swinging a short sword back and forth idly  and stared out across the treetops with the air of one carrying out a tedious and unglamorous assignment .   a beetle began to crawl laboriously up rincewind   s leg .   the wizard wondered how much damage a half solid dragon could do .  would it only half kill him .  he decided not to stay and find out .   moving on heels  fingertips and shoulder muscles  rincewind wriggled sideways until foliage masked the oak and its occupants .  then he scrambled to his feet and hared off between the trees .   he had no destination in mind  no provisions  and no horse .  but while he still had legs he could run .  ferns and brambles whipped at him  but he didn   t feel them at all .   when he had put about a mile between him and the dragon he stopped and collapsed against a tree  which then spoke to him .      psst     it said .   dreading what he might see  rincewind let his gaze slide upward .  it tried to fasten on innocuous bits of bark and leaf  but the scourge of curiosity forced it to leave them behind .  finally it fixed on a black sword thrust straight through the branch above rincewind   s head .      don   t just stand there     said the sword  in a voice like the sound of a finger dragged around the rim of a large empty wine glass  .     pull me out .         what .     said rincewind  his chest still heaving .      pull me out     repeated kring .     it   s either that or i   ll be spending the next million years in a coal measure .  did i ever tell you about the time i was thrown into a lake up in the           what happened to the others .     said rincewind  still clutching the tree desperately .      oh  the dragons got them .  and the horses .  and that box thing .  me too  except that hrun dropped me .  what a stroke of luck for you .         well       began rincewind .  kring ignored him .      i expect you   ll be in a hurry to rescue them     it added .      yes  well           so if you   ll just pull me out we can be off .      rincewind squinted up at the sword .  a rescue attempt had hitherto been so far at the back of his mind that  if some advanced speculations on the nature and shape of the many dimensioned multiplexity of the universe were correct  it was right at the front  but a magic sword was a valuable item     and it would be a long trek back home  wherever that was     he scrambled up the tree and inched along the branch .  kring was buried very firmly in the wood .  he gripped the pommel and heaved until lights flashed in front of his eyes .      try again     said the sword encouragingly .   rincewind groaned and gritted his teeth .      could be worse     said kring .     this could have been an anvil .         yaargh     hissed the wizard  fearing for the future of his groin .      i have had a multidimensional existence     said the sword .      ungh .         i have had many names  you know .         amazing     said rincewind .  he swayed backward as the blade slid free .  it felt strangely light .   back on the ground again he decided to break the news .      i really don   t think rescue is a good idea     he said .     i think we   d better head back to a city  you know .  to raise a search party .         the dragons headed hubward     said kring .     however  i suggest we start with the one in the trees over there .         sorry  but           you can   t leave them to their fate .      rincewind looked surprised .     i can   t .     he said .      no .  you can   t .  look  i   ll be frank .  i   ve worked with better material than you  but it   s either that or   have you ever spent a million years in a coal measure .         look  i           so if you don   t stop arguing i   ll chop your head off .      rincewind saw his own arm snap up until the shimmering blade was humming a mere inch from his throat .  he tried to force his fingers to let go .  they wouldn   t .      i don   t know how to be a hero .     he shouted .      i propose to teach you .         bronze psepha rumbled deep in his throat .   k . sdra the dragonrider leaned forward and squinted across the clearing .      i see him     he said .  he swung himself down easily from branch to branch and landed lightly on the tussocky grass  drawing his sword .   he took a long look at the approaching man  who was obviously not keen on leaving the shelter of the trees .  he was armed  but the dragonrider observed with some interest the strange way in which the man held the sword in front of him at arm   s length  as though embarrassed to be seen in its company .   k . sdra hefted his own sword and grinned expansively as the wizard shuffled toward him .  then he leapt .   later  he remembered only two things about the fight .  he recalled the uncanny way in which the wizard   s sword curved up and caught his own blade with a shock that jerked it out of his grip .  the other thing   and it was this  he averred  that led to his downfall   was that the wizard was covering his eyes with one hand .   k . sdra jumped back to avoid another thrust and fell full length on the turf .  with a snarl psepha unfolded his great wings and launched himself from his tree .   a moment later the wizard was standing over him  shouting     tell it that if it singes me i   ll let the sword go .  i will .  i   ll let it go .  so tell it .     the tip of the black sword was hovering over k . sdra   s throat .  what was odd was that the wizard was obviously struggling with it  and it appeared to be singing to itself .      psepha .     k . sdra shouted .   the dragon roared in defiance  but pulled out of the dive that would have removed rincewind   s head  and flapped ponderously back to the tree .      talk .     screamed rincewind .   k . sdra squinted at him up the length of the sword .      what would you like me to say .     he asked .      what .         i said what would you like me to say .      where are my friends .  the barbarian and the little man is what i mean .         i expect they have been taken back to the wyrmberg .      rincewind tugged desperately against the surge of the sword  trying to shut his mind to kring   s bloodthirsty humming .      what   s a wyrmberg .     he said .      the wyrmberg .  there is only one .  it is dragonhome .         and i suppose you were waiting to take me there  eh .      k . sdra yelped involuntarily as the tip of the sword pricked a bead of blood from his adam   s apple .      don   t want people to know you   ve got dragons here  eh .     snarled rincewind .  the dragonrider forgot himself enough to nod  and came within a quarter inch of cutting his own throat .   rincewind looked around desperately  and realized that this was something he was really going to have to go through with .      right then     he said as diffidently as he could manage .     you   d better take me to this wyrmberg of yours  hadn   t you .         i was supposed to take you in dead     muttered k . sdra sullenly .   rincewind looked down at him and grinned slowly .  it was a wide  manic and utterly humorless rictus .  it was the sort of grin that is normally accompanied by small riverside birds wandering in and out  picking scraps out of the teeth .      alive will do     said rincewind .     if we   re talking about anyone being dead  remember whose sword is in which hand .         if you kill me nothing will prevent psepha killing you .     shouted the prone dragonrider .      so what i   ll do is  i   ll chop bits off     agreed the wizard .  he tried the effect of the grin again .      oh  all right     said k . sdra sulkily .     do you think i   ve got no imagination .      he wriggled out from under the sword and waved at the dragon  which took wing again and glided in toward them .  rincewind swallowed .      you mean we   ve got to go on that .     he said .  k . sdra looked at him scornfully  the point of kring still aimed at his neck .      how else would anyone get to the wyrmberg .         i don   t know     said rincewind .     how else .         i mean  there is no other way .  it   s flying or nothing .      rincewind looked again at the dragon before him .  he could quite clearly see through it to the crushed grass on which it lay but  when he gingerly touched a scale that was a mere golden sheen on thin air  it felt solid enough .  either dragons should exist completely or fail to exist at all  he felt .  a dragon only half existing was worse than the extremes .      i didn   t know dragons could be seen through     he said .   k . sdra shrugged .     didn   t you .     he said .   he swung himself astride the dragon awkwardly  because rincewind was hanging on to his belt .  once uncomfortably aboard the wizard moved his white knuckle grip to a convenient piece of harness and prodded k . sdra lightly with the sword .      have you ever flown before .     said the dragonrider  without looking around .      not as such  no .         would you like something to suck .      rincewind gazed at the back of the man   s head  then dropped to the bag of red and yellow sweets that was being proffered .      is it necessary .     he asked .      it is traditional     said k . sdra .     please yourself .      the dragon stood up  lumbered heavily across the meadow  and fluttered into the air .   rincewind occasionally had nightmares about teetering on some intangible but enormously high place  and seeing a blue distanced  cloud punctuated landscape reeling away below him  this usually woke him up with his ankles sweating  he would have been even more worried had he known that the nightmare was not  as he thought  just the usual discworld vertigo .  it was a backward memory of an event in his future so terrifying that it had generated harmonics of fear all the way along his lifeline  .   this was not that event  but it was good practice for it .   psepha clawed its way into the air with a series of vertebrae shattering bounds .  at the top of its last leap the wide wings unfolded with a snap and spread out with a thump which shook the trees .   then the ground was gone  dropping away in a series of gentle jerks .  psepha was suddenly rising gracefully  the afternoon sunlight gleaming off wings that were still no more than a golden film .  rincewind made the mistake of glancing downward  and found himself looking through the dragon to the treetops below .  far below .  his stomach shrank at the sight .   closing his eyes wasn   t much better  because it gave his imagination full rein .  he compromised by gazing fixedly into the middle distance  where moorland and forest drifted by and could be contemplated almost casually .   wind snatched at him .  k . sdra half turned and shouted into his ear .      behold the wyrmberg .      rincewind turned his head slowly  taking care to keep kring resting lightly on the dragon   s back .  his streaming eyes saw the impossibly inverted mountain rearing out of the deep forested valley like a trumpet in a tub of moss .  even at this distance he could make out the faint octarine glow in the air that must be indicating a stable magic aura of at least   he gasped   several milliprime .  at least .      oh no     he said .   even looking at the ground was better than that .  he averted his eyes quickly  and realized that he could now no longer see the ground through the dragon .  as they glided around in a wide circle toward the wyrmberg it was definitely taking on a more solid form  as if the creature   s body was filling with a gold mist .  by the time the wyrmberg was in front of them  swinging wildly across the sky  the dragon was as real as a rock .   rincewind thought he could see a faint streak in the air  as if something from the mountain had reached out and touched the beast .  he got the strange feeling that the dragon was being made more genuine .   ahead of it the wyrmberg turned from a distant toy to several billion tons of rock poised between heaven and earth .  he could see small fields  woods and a lake up there  and from the lake a river spilled out and over the edge     he made the mistake of following the thread of foaming water with his eyes  and jerked himself back just in time .   the flared plateau of the upturned mountain drifted toward them .  the dragon didn   t even slow .   as the mountain loomed over rincewind like the biggest fly swatter in the universe he saw a cave mouth .  psepha skimmed toward it  shoulder muscles pumping .   the wizard screamed as the dark spread and enfolded him .  there was a brief vision of rock flashing past  blurred by speed .  then the dragon was in the open again .   it was inside a cave  but bigger than any cave had a right to be .  the dragon  gliding across its vast emptiness  was a mere gilded fly in a banqueting hall .   there were other dragons   gold  silver  black  white   flapping across the sun shafted air on errands of their own or perched on outcrops of rock .  high in the domed roof of the cavern scores of others hung from huge rings  their wings wrapped batlike around their bodies .  there were men up there  too .  rincewind swallowed hard when he saw them  because they were walking on that broad expanse of ceiling like flies .   then he made out the thousands of tiny rings that studded the ceiling .  a number of inverted men were watching psepha   s flight with interest .  rincewind swallowed again .  for the life of him he couldn   t think of what to do next .      well .     he asked  in a whisper .     any suggestions .         obviously you attack     said kring scornfully .      why didn   t i think of that .     said rincewind .     could it be because they all have crossbows .         you   re a defeatist .         defeatist .  that   s because i   m going to be defeated .         you   re your own worst enemy  rincewind     said the sword .   rincewind looked up at grinning men .      bet .     he said wearily .   before kring could reply psepha reared in midair and alighted on one of the large rings  which rocked alarmingly .      would you like to die now  or surrender first .     asked k . sdra calmly .   men were converging on the ring from all directions  walking with a swaying motion as their hooked boots engaged the ceiling rings .   there were more boots on a rack that hung in a small platform built on the side of the perch ring .  before rincewind could stop him the dragonrider had leapt from the creature   s back to land on the platform  where he stood grinning at the wizard   s discomforture .   there was a small expressive sound made by a number of crossbows being cocked .  rincewind looked up at a number of impassive  upside down faces .  the dragonfolk   s taste in clothing didn   t run to anything much more imaginative than a leather harness  studded with bronze ornaments .  knives and sword sheaths were worn inverted .  those who were not wearing helmets let their hair flow freely  so that it moved like seaweed in the ventilation breeze near the roof .  there were several women among them .  the inversion did strange things to their anatomy .  rincewind stared .      surrender     said k . sdra again .   rincewind opened his mouth to do so .  kring hummed a warning  and agonizing waves of pain shot up his arm .     never     he squeaked .  the pain stopped .      of course he won   t .     boomed an expansive voice behind him .     he   s a hero  isn   t he .      rincewind turned and looked into a pair of hairy nostrils .  they belonged to a heavily built young man  hanging nonchalantly from the ceiling by his boots .      what is your name  hero .     said the man .     so that we know who you were .      agony shot up rincewind   s arm .     i   i   m rincewind of ankh     he managed to gasp .      and i am lio . rt dragonlord     said the hanging man  pronouncing the word with the harsh click in the back of the throat that rincewind could only think of as a kind of integral punctuation .     you have come to challenge me in mortal combat .         well  no  i didn   t           you are mistaken .  k . sdra  help our hero into a pair of hookboots .  i am sure he is anxious to get started .         no  look  i just came here to find my friends .  i   m sure there   s no       rincewind began  as the dragonrider guided him firmly onto the platform  pushed him onto a seat  and proceeded to strap hookboots to his feet .      hurry up  k . sdra .  we mustn   t keep our hero from his destiny     said lio . rt .      look  i expect my friends are happy enough here  so if you could just  you know  set me down somewhere           you will see your friends soon enough     said the dragonlord airily .     if you are religious  i mean .  none who enter the wyrmberg ever leave again .  except metaphorically  of course .  show him how to reach the rings  k . sdra .         look what you   ve got me into .     rincewind hissed .   kring vibrated in his hand .     remember that i am a magic sword     it hummed .      how can i forget .         climb the ladder and grab a ring     said the dragonrider     then bring your feet up until the hooks catch .     he helped the protesting wizard climb until he was hanging upside down  robe tucked into his britches  kring dangling from one hand .  at this angle the dragonfolk looked reasonably bearable but the dragons themselves  hanging from their perches  loomed over the scene like immense gargoyles .  their eyes glowed with interest .      attention  please     said lio . rt .  a dragonrider handed him a long shape  wrapped in red silk .      we fight to the death     he said .     yours .         and i suppose i earn my freedom if i win .     said rincewind  without much hope .   lio . rt indicated the assembled dragonriders with a tilt of his head .      don   t be naive     he said .   rincewind took a deep breath .     i suppose i should warn you     he said  his voice hardly quavering at all     that this is a magic sword .      lio . rt let the red silk wrapping drop away into the gloom and flourished a jet black blade .  runes glowed on its surface .      what a coincidence     he said  and lunged .   rincewind went rigid with fright  but his arm swung out as kring shot forward .  the swords met in an explosion of octarine light .   lio . rt swung himself backward  his eyes narrowing .  kring leapt past his guard and  although the dragonlord   s sword jerked up to deflect most of the force  the result was a thin red line across its master   s torso .   with a growl he launched himself at the wizard  boots clattering as he slid from ring to ring .  the swords met again in another violent discharge of magic and  at the same time  lio . rt brought his other hand down against rincewind   s head  jarring him so hard that one foot jerked out of its ring and flailed desperately .      rincewind knew himself to be almost certainly the worst wizard on the discworld since he knew but one spell  yet for all that he was still a wizard  and thus by the inexorable laws of magic this meant that upon his demise it would be death himself who appeared to claim him  instead of sending one of his numerous servants  as is usually the case  .   thus it was that  as a grinning lio . rt swung back and brought his sword around in a lazy arc  time ran into treacle .   to rincewind   s eyes the world was suddenly lit by a flickering octarine light  tinged with violet as photons impacted on the sudden magical aura .  inside it the dragonlord was a ghastly hued statue  his sword moving at a snail   s pace in the glow .   beside lio . rt was another figure  visible only to those who can see into the extra four dimensions of magic .  it was tall and dark and thin and  against a sudden night of frosty stars  it swung two handed a scythe of proverbial sharpness     rincewind ducked .  the blade hissed coldly through the air beside his head and entered the rock of the cavern roof without slowing .  death screamed a curse in his cold crypt voice .  the scene vanished .  what passed for reality on the discworld reasserted itself with a rush of sound .  lio . rt gasped at the sudden turn of speed with which the wizard had dodged his killing stroke and  with that desperation only available to the really terrified  rincewind uncoiled like a snake and launched himself across the space between them .  he locked both hands around the dragonlord   s sword arm  and wrenched .   it was at that moment that rincewind   s one remaining ring  already overburdened  slid out of the rock with a nasty little metal sound .   he plunged down  swung wildly  and ended up dangling over a bone splintering death with his hands gripping the dragonlord   s arm so tightly that the man screamed .   lio . rt looked up at his feet .  small flakes of rock were dropping out of the roof around the ring pitons .      let go  damn you .     he screamed .     or we   ll both die .      rincewind said nothing .  he was concentrating on maintaining his grip and keeping his mind closed to the pressing images of his fate on the rocks below .      shoot him .     bellowed lio . rt .   out of the corner of his eye rincewind saw several crossbows leveled at him .  lio . rt chose that moment to flail down with his free hand  and a fistful of rings stabbed into the wizard   s fingers .   he let go .      twoflower grabbed the bars and pulled himself up .      see anything .     said hrun  from the region of his feet .      just clouds .      hrun lifted him down again  and sat on the edge of one of the wooden beds that were the only furnishings in the cell .     bloody hell     he said .      don   t despair     said twoflower .      i   m not despairing .         i expect it   s all some sort of misunderstanding .  i expect they   ll release us soon .  they seem very civilized .      hrun stared at him from under bushy eyebrows .  he started to say something  then appeared to think better of it .  he sighed instead .      and when we get back we can say we   ve seen dragons .     twoflower continued .     what about that  eh .         dragons don   t exist     said hrun flatly .     codice of chimeria killed the last one two hundred years ago .  i don   t know what we   re seeing  but they aren   t dragons .         but they carried us up in the air .  in that hall there must have been hundreds           i expect it was just magic     said hrun  dismissively .      well  they looked like dragons     said twoflower  an air of defiance about him .     i always wanted to see dragons  ever since i was a little lad .  dragons flying around in the sky  breathing flames           they just used to crawl around in swamps and stuff  and all they breathed was stink     said hrun  lying down in the bunk .     they weren   t very big  either .  they used to collect firewood .         i heard they used to collect treasure     said twoflower .      and firewood .  hey     hrun added  brightening up     did you notice all those rooms they brought us through .  pretty impressive  i thought .  lot of good stuff about  plus some of those tapestries have got to be worth a fortune .     he scratched his chin thoughtfully  making a noise like a porcupine shouldering its way through gorse .      what happens next .     asked twoflower .   hrun screwed a finger in his ear and inspected it absently .      oh     he said     i expect in a minute the door will be flung back and i   ll be dragged off to some sort of temple arena where i   ll fight maybe a couple of giant spiders and an eight foot slave from the jungles of klatch and then i   ll rescue some kind of a princess from the altar and then kill off a few guards or whatever and then this girl will show me the secret passage out of the place and we   ll liberate a couple of horses and escape with the treasure .     hrun leaned his head back on his hands and looked at the ceiling  whistling tunelessly .      all that .     said twoflower .      usually .      twoflower sat down on his bunk and tried to think .  this proved difficult  because his mind was awash with dragons .   dragons .   ever since he was two years old he had been captivated by the pictures of the fiery beasts in the octarine fairy book .  his sister had told him they didn   t really exist  and he recalled the bitter disappointment .  if the world didn   t contain those beautiful creatures  he   d decided  it wasn   t half the world it ought to be .  and then later he had been bound apprentice to ninereeds the masteraccount  who in his gray mindedness was everything that dragons were not  and there was no time for dreaming .   but there was something wrong with these dragons .  they were too small and sleek  compared to the ones in his mind   s eye .  dragons ought to be big and green and clawed and exotic and firebreathing   big and green with long sharp     something moved at the edge of his vision  in the furthest  darkest corner of the dungeon .  when he turned his head it vanished  although he thought he heard the faintest of noises that might have been made by claws scrabbling on stone .      hrun .     he said .   there was a snore from the other bunk .   twoflower padded over to the corner  poking gingerly at the stones in case there was a secret panel .  at that moment the door was flung back  thumping against the wall .  half a dozen guards hurtled through it  spread out and flung themselves down on one knee .  their weapons were aimed exclusively at hrun .  when he thought about this later  twoflower felt quite offended .   hrun snored .   a woman strode into the room .  not many women can stride convincingly  but she managed it .  she glanced briefly at twoflower  as one might look at a piece of furniture  then glared down at the man on the bed .   she was wearing the same sort of leather harness that the dragonriders had been wearing  but in her case it was much briefer .  that  and the magnificent mane of chestnut red hair that fell to her waist  was her only concession to what even on the discworld passed for decency .  she was also wearing a thoughtful expression .   hrun made a glubbing noise  turned over  and slept on .   with a careful movement  as though handling some instrument of rare delicacy  the woman drew a slim black dagger from her belt and stabbed downward .   before it was halfway through its arc hrun   s right hand moved so fast that it appeared to travel between two points in space without at any time occupying the intervening air .  it closed around the woman   s wrist with a dull smack .  his other hand groped feverishly for a sword that wasn   t there     hrun awoke .      gngh .     he said  looking up at the woman with a puzzled frown .  then he caught sight of the bowmen .      let go     said the woman  in a voice that was calm and quiet and edged with diamonds .  hrun released his grip slowly .   she stepped back  massaging her wrist and looking at hrun in much the same way that a cat watches a mousehole .      so     she said at last .     you pass the first test .  what is your name  barbarian .         who are you calling a barbarian .     snarled hrun .      that is what i want to know .      hrun counted the bowmen slowly and made a brief calculation .  his shoulders relaxed .      i am hrun of chimeria .  and you .         liessa dragonlady .         you are the lord of this place .         that remains to be seen .  you have the look about you of a hired sword  hrun of chimeria .  i could use you   if you pass the tests  of course .  there are three of them .  you have passed the first .         what are the other       hrun paused  his lips moved soundlessly and then he hazarded     two .         perilous .         and the fee .         valuable .         excuse me     said twoflower .      and if i fail these tests .     said hrun  ignoring him .  the air between hrun and liessa crackled with small explosions of charisma as their gazes sought for a hold .      if you had failed the first test you would now be dead .  this may be considered a typical penalty .         um  look     began twoflower .  liessa spared him a brief glance  and appeared actually to notice him for the first time .      take that away     she said calmly  and turned back to hrun .  two of the guards shouldered their bows  grasped twoflower by the elbows and lifted him off the ground .  then they trotted smartly through the doorway .      hey     said twoflower  as they hurried down the corridor outside     where     as they stopped in front of another door     is my     as they dragged the door open     luggage .     he landed in a heap of what might once have been straw .  the door banged shut  its echoes punctuated by the sound of bolts being slammed home .   in the other cell hrun had barely blinked .      okay     he said     what is the second test .         you must kill my two brothers .     hrun considered this .      both at the same time  or one after the other .     he said .      consecutively or concurrently     she assured him .      what .         just kill them     she said sharply .      good fighters  are they .         renowned .         so in return for all this    .         you will wed me and become lord of the wyrmberg .      there was a long pause .  hrun   s eyebrows twisted themselves in unaccustomed calculation .      i get you and this mountain .     he said at last .      yes .     she looked him squarely in the eye  and her lips twitched .     the fee is worthwhile  i assure you .      hrun dropped his gaze to the rings on her hand .  the stones were large  being the incredibly rare blue milk diamonds from the clay basins of mithos .  when he managed to turn his eyes from them he saw liessa glaring down at him in fury .      so calculating .     she rasped .     hrun the barbarian  who would boldly walk into the jaws of death himself .      hrun shrugged .     sure     he said     the only reason for walking into the jaws of death is so   s you can steal his gold teeth .     he brought one arm around expansively  and the wooden bunk was at the end of it .  it cannoned into the bowmen and hrun followed it joyously  felling one man with a blow and snatching the weapon from another .  a moment later it was all over .   liessa had not moved .      well .     she said .      well what .     said hrun  from the carnage .      do you intend to kill me .         what .  oh no .  no  this is just  you know  kind of a habit .  just keeping in practice .  so where are these brothers .     he grinned .      twoflower sat on his straw and stared into the darkness .  he wondered how long he had been there .  hours  at least .  days  probably .  he speculated that perhaps it had been years  and he had simply forgotten .   no  that sort of thinking wouldn   t do .  he tried to think of something else   grass  trees  fresh air  dragons .  dragons     there was the faintest of scrabblings in the darkness .  twoflower felt the sweat prickle on his forehead .   something was in the cell with him .  something that made small noises  but even in the pitch blackness gave the impression of hugeness .  he felt the air move .   when he lifted his arm there was the greasy feel and faint shower of sparks that betokened a localized magical field .  twoflower found himself fervently wishing for light .   a gout of flame rolled past his head and struck the far wall .  as the rocks flashed into furnace heat he looked up at the dragon that now occupied more than half the cell .   i obey  lord said a voice in his head .   by the glow of the crackling  spitting stone twoflower looked into his own reflection in two enormous green eyes .  beyond them the dragon was as multihued  horned  spiked and lithe as the one in his memory   a real dragon .  its folded wings were nevertheless still wide enough to scrape the wall on both sides of the room .  it lay with him between its talons .      obey .     he said  his voice vibrating with terror and delight .   of course  lord .   the glow faded away .  twoflower pointed a trembling finger at where he remembered the door to be and said     open it .      the dragon raised its huge head .  again the ball of flame rolled out but this time  as the dragon   s neck muscles contracted  its color faded from orange to yellow  from yellow to white  and finally to the faintest of blues .  by that time the flame was also very thin  and where it touched the wall the molten rock spat and ran .  when it reached the door the metal exploded into a shower of hot droplets .   black shadows arced and jigggered over the walls .  the metal bubbled for an eye aching moment  and then the door fell in two pieces in the passage beyond .  the flame winked out with a suddenness that was almost as startling as its arrival .   twoflower stepped gingerly over the cooling door and looked up and down the corridor .  it was empty .   the dragon followed .  the heavy door frame caused it some minor difficulty  which it overcame with a swing of its shoulders that tore the timber out and tossed it to one side .  the creature looked expectantly at twoflower  its skin rippling and twitching as it sought to open its wings in the confines of the passage .      how did you get in there .     said twoflower .   you summoned me  master .      i don   t remember doing that .      in your mind .  you called me up  in your mind  thought the dragon  patiently .      you mean i just thought of you and there you were .      yes .      it was magic .      yes .      but i   ve thought about dragons all my life .      in this place the frontier between thought and reality is probably a little confused .  all i know is that once i was not  and then you thought me  and then i was .  therefore  of course  i am yours to command .      good grief .      half a dozen guards chose that moment to turn the bend in the corridor .  they stopped  open mouthed .  then one remembered himself sufficiently to raise his crossbow and fire .   the dragon   s chest heaved .  the quarrel exploded into flaming fragments in midair .  the guards scurried out of sight .  a fraction of a second later a wash of flame played over the stones where they had been standing .   twoflower looked up in admiration .      can you fly  too .     he said .   of course .   twoflower glanced up and down the corridor  and decided against following the guards .  since he knew himself to be totally lost already  any direction was probably an improvement .  he edged past the dragon and hurried away  the huge beast turning with difficulty to follow him .   they padded down a series of passages that crisscrossed like a maze .  at one point twoflower thought he heard shouts  a long way behind them  but they soon faded away .  sometimes the dark arch of a crumbling doorway loomed past them in the gloom .  light filtered through dimly from various shafts and  here and there  bounced off big mirrors that had been mortared into angles of the passage .  sometimes there was a brighter glow from a distant light well .   what was odd  thought twoflower as he strolled down a wide flight of stairs and kicked up billowing clouds of silver dust motes  was that the tunnels here were much wider .  and better constructed  too .  there were statues in niches set in the walls  and here and there faded but interesting tapestries had been hung .  they mainly showed dragons   dragons by the hundred  in flight or hanging from their perch rings  dragons with men on their backs hunting down deer and  sometimes  other men .  twoflower touched one tapestry gingerly .  the fabric crumbled instantly in the hot dry air  leaving only a dangling mesh where some threads had been plaited with fine gold wire .      i wonder why they left all this .     he said .   i don   t know said a polite voice in his head .   he turned and looked up into the scaly horse face above him .      what is your name  dragon .     said twoflower .   i don   t know .      i think i shall call you ninereeds .      that is my name  then .   they waded through the all encroaching dust in a series of huge  dark pillared halls which had been carved out of the solid rock .  with some cunning too  from floor to ceiling the walls were a mass of statues  gargoyles  bas reliefs and fluted columns that cast weirdly moving shadows when the dragon gave an obliging illumination at twoflower   s request .  they crossed the lengthy galleries and vast carven amphitheaters  all awash with deep soft dust and completely uninhabited .  no one had come to these dead caverns in centuries .   then he saw the path  leading away into yet another dark tunnel mouth .  someone had been using it regularly  and recently .  it was a deep narrow trail in the gray blanket .   twoflower followed it .  it led through still more lofty halls and winding corridors quite big enough for a dragon  and dragons had come this way once  it seemed  there was a room full of rotting harness  dragon sized  and another room containing plate and chain mail big enough for elephants  .  they ended in a pair of green bronze doors  each so high that they disappeared into the gloom .  in front of twoflower  at chest height  was a small handle shaped like a brass dragon .   when he touched it the doors swung open instantly and with a disconcerting noiselessness .   instantly sparks crackled in twoflower   s hair and there was a sudden gust of hot dry wind that didn   t disturb the dust in the way that ordinary wind should but  instead  whipped it up momentarily into unpleasantly half living shapes before it settled again .  in twoflower   s ears came the strange shrill twittering of the things locked in the distant dungeon dimensions  out beyond the fragile lattice of time and space .  shadows appeared where there was nothing to cause them .  the air buzzed like a hive .   in short  there was a vast discharge of magic going on around him .   the chamber beyond the door was lit by a pale green glow .  stacked around the walls  each on its own marble shelf  were tier upon tier of coffins .  in the center of the room was a stone chair on a raised dais  and it contained a slumped figure which did not move but said  in a brittle old voice     come in  young man .      twoflower stepped forward .  the figure in the seat was human  as far as he could make out in the murky light  but there was something about the awkward way it was sprawled in the chair that made him glad he couldn   t see it any clearer .      i   m dead  you know     came a voice from what twoflower fervently hoped was a head  in conversational tones .     i expect you can tell .         um     said twoflower .     yes .     he began to back away .      obvious  isn   t it .     agreed the voice .     you   d be twoflower  wouldn   t you .  or is that later .         later .     said twoflower .     later than what .     he stopped .      well     said the voice .     you see  one of the advantages of being dead is that one is released as it were from the bonds of time and therefore i can see everything that has happened or will happen  all at the same time except that of course i now know that time does not  for all practical purposes  exist .         that doesn   t sound like a disadvantage     said twoflower .      you don   t think so .  imagine every moment being at one and the same time a distant memory and a nasty surprise and you   ll see what i mean .  anyway  i now recall what it was i am about to tell you .  or have i already done so .  that   s a fine looking dragon  by the way .  or don   t i say that yet .         it is rather good .  it just turned up     said twoflower .      it turned up .     said the voice .     you summoned it .         yes  well  all i did           you have the power .         all i did was think of it .         that   s what the power is .  have i already told you that i am greicha the first .  or is that next .  i   m sorry  but i haven   t had too much experience of transcendence .  anyway  yes   the power .  it summons dragons  you know .         i think you already told me that     said twoflower .      did i .  i certainly intended to     said the dead man .      but how does it .  i   ve been thinking about dragons all my life  but this is the first time one has turned up .         oh well  you see  the truth of the matter is that dragons have never existed as you  and  until i was poisoned some three months ago  i  understand existence .  i   m talking about the true dragon  draconis nobilis  you understand  the swamp dragon  draconis vulgaris  is a base creature and not worth our consideration .  the true dragon  on the other hand  is a creature of such refinement of spirit that they can only take on form in this world if they are conceived by the most skilled imagination .  and even then the said imagination must be in some place heavily impregnated with magic  which helps to weaken the walls between the world of the seen and unseen .  then the dragons pop through  as it were  and impress their form on this world   s possibility matrix .  i was very good at it when i was alive .  i could imagine up to  oh  five hundred dragons at a time .  now liessa  the most skilled of my children  can barely imagine fifty rather nondescript creatures .  so much for a progressive education .  she doesn   t really believe in them .  that   s why her dragons are rather boring   while yours     said the voice of greicha     is almost as good as some of mine used to be .  a sight for sore eyes  not that i have any to speak of now .      twoflower said hurriedly     you keep saying you   re dead           well .         well  the dead  er  they  you know  don   t talk much .  as a rule .         i used to be an exceptionally powerful wizard .  my daughter poisoned me  of course .  it is the generally accepted method of succession in our family  but     the corpse sighed  or at least a sigh came from the air a few feet above it     it soon became obvious that none of my three children is sufficiently powerful to wrest the lordship of the wyrmberg from the other two .  a most unsatisfactory arrangement .  a kingdom like ours has to have one ruler .  so i resolved to remain alive in an unofficial capacity  which of course annoys them all immensely .  i won   t give my children the satisfaction of burying me until there is only one of them left to perform the ceremony .     there was a nasty wheezing noise .  twoflower decided that it was meant to be a chuckle .      so it was one of them that kidnapped us .     said twoflower .      liessa     said the dead wizard   s voice .     my daughter .  her power is strongest  you know .  my sons    dragons are incapable of flying more than a few miles before they fade .         fade .  i did notice that we could see through the one that brought us here     said twoflower .     i thought that was a bit odd .         of course     said greicha .     the power only works near the wyrmberg .  it   s the inverse square law  you know .  at least  i think it is .  as the dragons fly further away they begin to dwindle .  otherwise my little liessa would be ruling the whole world by now  if i know anything about it .  but i can see i mustn   t keep you .  i expect you   ll be wanting to rescue your friend .      twoflower gaped .     hrun .     he said .      not him .  the skinny wizard .  my son lio . rt is trying to hack him to pieces .  i admired the way you rescued him .  will  i mean .      twoflower drew himself up to his full height  an easy task .     where is he .     he said  heading toward the door with what he hoped was an heroic stride .      just follow the pathway in the dust     said the voice .     liessa comes to see me sometimes .  she still comes to see her old dad  my little girl .  she was the only one with the strength of character to murder me .  a chip off the old block .  good luck  by the way .  i seem to recall i said that .  will say it now  i mean .      the rambling voice got lost in a maze of tenses as twoflower ran along the dead tunnels  with the dragon loping along easily behind him .  but soon he was leaning against a pillar  completely out of breath .  it seemed ages since he   d had anything to eat .   why don   t you fly .  said ninereeds  inside his head .  the dragon spread its wings and gave an experimental flap  which lifted it momentarily off the ground .  twoflower stared for a moment  then ran forward and clambered quickly onto the beast   s neck .  soon they were airborne  the dragon skimming along easily a few feet from the floor and leaving a billowing cloud of dust in its wake .   twoflower hung on as best he could as ninereeds swooped through a succession of caverns and soared around a spiral staircase that could easily have accommodated a retreating army .  at the top they emerged into the more inhabited regions  the mirrors at every corridor corner brightly polished and reflecting a pale light .   i smell other dragons .   the wings became a blur and twoflower was jerked back as the dragon veered and sped off down a side corridor like a gnat crazed swallow .  another sharp turn sent them soaring out of a tunnel mouth in the side of a vast cavern .  there were rocks far below  and up above were broad shafts of light from great holes near the roof .  a lot of activity on the ceiling  too   as ninereeds hovered  thumping the air with his wings  twoflower peered up at the shapes of roosting beasts and tiny men shaped dots that were somehow walking upside down .   this is a roosting hall said the dragon in a satisfied tone .   as twoflower watched  one of the shapes far above detached itself from the roof and began to grow larger        rincewind watched as lio . rt   s pale face dropped away from him .  this is funny  gibbered a small part of his mind  why am i rising .   then he began to tumble in the air and reality took over .  he was dropping to the distant  guano speckled rocks .   his brain reeled with the thought .  the words of the spell picked just that moment to surface from the depths of his mind  as they always did in time of crisis .  why not say us  they seemed to urge .  what have you got to lose .   rincewind waved a hand in the gathering slipstream .      ashonai     he called .  the word formed in front of him in a cold blue flame that streamed in the wind .   he waved the other hand  drunk with terror and magic .      ebiris     he intoned .  the sound froze into a flickering orange word that hung beside its companion .      urshoring .  kvanti .  pythan .  n   gurad .  feringomalee .     as the words blazed their rainbow colors around him he flung his hands back and prepared to say the eighth and final word that would appear in corruscating octarine and seal the spell .  the imminent rocks were forgotten .             he began .   the breath was knocked out of him  the spell scattered and snuffed out .  a pair of arms locked around his waist and the whole world jerked sideways as the dragon rose out of its long dive  claws grazing just for a moment the topmost rock on the wyrmberg   s noisome floor .  twoflower laughed triumphantly .      got him .      and the dragon  curving gracefully at the top of his flight  gave a lazy flip of his wings and soared through a cavemouth into the morning air .      at noon  in a wide green meadow on the lush tableland that was the top of the impossibly balanced wyrmberg  the dragons and their riders formed a wide circle .  there was room beyond them for a rabble of servants and slaves and others who scratched a living here on the roof of the world  and they were all watching the figures clustered in the center of the grassy arena .   the group contained a number of senior dragonlords  and among them were lio . rt and his brother liartes .  the former was still rubbing his legs  with small grimaces of pain .  slightly to one side stood liessa and hrun  with some of the woman   s own followers .  between the two factions stood the wyrmberg   s hereditary loremaster .      as you know     he said uncertainly     the not fully late lord of the wyrmberg  greicha the first  has stipulated that there will be no succession until one of his children feels himself   or as it might be  herself   powerful enough to challenge and defeat his or her siblings in mortal combat .         yes  yes  we know all that .  get on with it     said a thin peevish voice from the air beside him .   the loremaster swallowed .  he had never come to terms with his former master   s failure to expire properly .  is the old buzzard dead or isn   t he .  he wondered .      it is not certain     he quavered     whether it is allowable to issue a challenge by proxy           it is  it is     snapped greicha   s disembodied voice .     it shows intelligence .  don   t take all day about it .         i challenge you     said hrun  glaring at the brothers     both at once .      lio . rt and liartes exchanged looks .      you   ll fight us both together .     said liartes  a tall  wiry man with long black hair .      yah .         that   s pretty uneven odds  isn   t it .         yah .  i outnumber you one to two .      lio . rt scowled .     you arrogant barbarian           that just about does it .     growled hrun .     i   ll        the loremaster put out a blue veined hand to restrain him .      it is forbidden to fight on the killing ground     he said  and paused while he considered the sense of this .     you know what i mean  anyway     he hazarded  giving up  and added    as the challenged parties my lords lio . rt and liartes have choice of weapons .         dragons     they said together .  liessa snorted .      dragons can be used offensively  therefore they are weapons     said lio . rt firmly .     if you disagree we can fight over it .         yah     said his brother  nodding at hrun .   the loremaster felt a ghostly finger prod him in the chest .      don   t stand there with your mouth open     said greicha   s graveyard voice .     just hurry up  will you .      hrun stepped back  shaking his head .      oh no     he said .     once was enough .  i   d rather be dead than fight on one of those things .         die  then     said the loremaster  as kindly as he could manage .   lio . rt and liartes were already striding back across the turf to where the servants stood waiting with their mounts .  hrun turned to liessa .  she shrugged .      don   t i even get a sword .     he pleaded .     a knife  even .         no     she said .     i didn   t expect this .     she suddenly looked smaller  all defiance gone .     i   m sorry .         you   re sorry .         yes .  i   m sorry .         yes  i thought you said you   re sorry .         don   t glare at me like that .  i can imagine you the finest dragon to ride           no .      the loremaster wiped his nose on a handkerchief  held the little silken square aloft for a moment  then let it fall .   a boom of wings made hrun spin around .  lio . rt   s dragon was already airborne and circling around toward them .  as it swooped low over the turf a billow of flame shot from its mouth  scoring a black streak across the grass that rushed toward hrun .   at the last minute he pushed liessa aside  and felt the wild pain of the flame on his arm as he dived for safety .  he rolled as he hit the ground  and flipped onto his feet again while he looked around frantically for the other dragon .  it came in from one side  and hrun was forced to take a badly judged standing jump to escape the flame .  the dragon   s tail whipped around as it passed and caught him a stinging blow across the forehead .  he pushed himself upright  shaking his head to make the wheeling stars go away .  his blistered back screamed pain at him .   lio . rt came in for a second run  but slower this time to allow for the big man   s unexpected agility .  as the ground drifted up he saw the barbarian standing stock still  chest heaving  arms hanging loosely by his sides .  an easy target .   as his dragon swooped away lio . rt turned his head  expecting to see a dreadfully big cinder .   there was nothing there .  puzzled  lio . rt turned back .   hrun  heaving himself over the dragon   s shoulder scales with one hand and beating out his flaming hair with the other  presented himself to his view .  lio . rt   s hand flew to his dagger  but pain had sharpened hrun   s normally excellent reflexes to needle point .  a backhand blow hammered into the dragonlord   s wrist  sending the dagger arcing away toward the ground  and another caught the man full on the chin .   the dragon  carrying the weight of two men  was only a few yards above the grass .  this turned out to be fortunate  because at the moment lio . rt lost consciousness the dragon winked out of existence .   liessa hurried across the grass and helped hrun stagger to his feet .  he blinked at her .      what happened .  what happened .     he said thickly .      that was really fantastic .     she said .     the way you turned that somersault in midair and everything .         yah  but what happened .         it   s rather difficult to explain        hrun peered up at the sky .  liartes  by far the most cautious of the two brothers  was circling high above them .      well  you   ve got about ten seconds to try     he said .      the dragons           yah .         they   re imaginary .         like all these imaginary burns on my arm  you mean .         yes .  no .     she shook her head violently .     i   ll have to tell you later .         fine  if you can find a really good medium     snapped hrun .  he glared up at liartes  who was beginning to descend in wide sweeps .      just listen  will you .  unless my brother is conscious his dragon can   t exist  it   s got no pathway through to this           run .     shouted hrun .  he threw her away from him and flung himself flat on the ground as liartes   s dragon thundered by  leaving another smoking scar across the turf .   while the creature sought height for another sweep hrun scrambled to his feet and set off at a dead run for the woods at the edge of the arena .  they were sparse  little more than a wide and overgrown hedge  but at least no dragon would be able to fly through them .   it didn   t try .  liartes brought his mount in to land on the turf a few yards away and dismounted casually .  the dragon folded its wings and poked its head in among the greenery  while its master leaned against a tree and whistled tunelessly .      i can burn you out     said liartes  after a while .   the bushes remained motionless .      perhaps you   re in that holly bush over there .      the holly bush became a waxy ball of flame .      i   m sure i can see movement in those ferns .      the ferns became mere skeletons of white ash .      you   re only prolonging it  barbarian .  why not give in now .  i   ve burned lots of people  it doesn   t hurt a bit     said liartes  looking sideways at the bushes .   the dragon continued through the spinney  incinerating every likely looking bush and clump of ferns .  liartes drew his sword and waited .   hrun dropped from a tree and landed running .  behind him the dragon roared and crashed through the bushes as it tried to turn around  but hrun was running  running  with his gaze fixed on liartes and a dead branch in his hands .   it is a little known but true fact that a two legged creature can usually beat a four legged creature over a short distance  simply because of the time it takes the quadruped to get its legs sorted out .  hrun heard the scrabble of claws behind him and then an ominous thump .  the dragon had half opened its wings and was trying to fly .   as hrun bore down on the dragonlord liartes   s sword came up wickedly  to be caught on the branch .  then hrun cannoned into him and the two men sprawled on the ground .   the dragon roared .   liartes screamed as hrun brought a knee upward with anatomical precision  but managed a wild blow that rebroke the barbarian   s nose for him .   hrun kicked away and scrambled to his feet  to find himself looking up into the wild horse face of the dragon  its nostrils distended .   he lashed out with a foot and caught liartes  who was trying to stand up  on the side of his head .  the man slumped .   the dragon vanished .  the ball of fire that was billowing toward hrun faded until  when it reached him  it was no more than a puff of warm air .  then there was no sound but the crackle of burning bushes .   hrun slung the unconscious dragonlord over his shoulder and set off at a trot back to the arena .  halfway there he found lio . rt sprawled on the ground  one leg bent awkwardly .  he stooped and  with a grunt  hoisted the man onto his vacant shoulder .   liessa and the loremaster were waiting on a raised dais at one end of the meadow .  the dragonwoman had quite recovered her composure now  and looked levelly at hrun as he threw the two men down on the steps before her .  the people around her were standing in deferential poses  like a court .      kill them     she said .      i kill in my own time     he said .     in any case  killing unconscious people isn   t right .         i can   t think of a more opportune time     said the loremaster .  liessa snorted .      then i shall banish them     she said .     once they are beyond the reach of the wyrmberg   s magic then they   ll have no power .  they   ll be simply brigands .  will that satisfy you .         yes .         i am surprised that you are so merciful  ba   hrun .      hrun shrugged .     a man in my position  he can   t afford to be anything else  he   s got to consider his image .     he looked around .     where   s the next test  then .         i warn you that it is perilous .  if you wish  you may leave now .  if you pass the test  however  you will become lord of the wyrmberg and  of course  my lawful husband .      hrun met her gaze .  he thought about his life  to date .  it suddenly seemed to him to have been full of long damp nights sleeping under the stars  desperate fights with trolls  city guards  countless bandits and evil priests and  on at least three occasions  actual demigods   and for what .  well  for quite a lot of treasure  he had to admit   but where had it all gone .  rescuing beleaguered maidens had a certain passing reward  but most of the time he   d finished up by setting them up in some city somewhere with a handsome dowry  because after a while even the most agreeable ex maiden became possessive and had scant sympathy for his efforts to rescue her sister sufferers .  in short  life had really left him with little more than a reputation and a network of scars .  being a lord might be fun .  hrun grinned .  with a base like this  all these dragons and a good bunch of fighting men  a man could really be a contender .   besides  the wench was not uncomely .      the third test .     she said .      am i to be weaponless again .     said hrun .   liessa reached up and removed her helmet  letting the coils of red hair tumble out .  then she unfastened the brooch of her robe .  underneath  she was naked .   as hrun   s gaze swept over her his mind began to operate two notional counting machines .  one assessed the gold in her bangles  the tiger rubies that ornamented her toe rings  the diamond spangle that adorned her navel  and two highly individual whirligigs of silver filigree .  the other was plugged straight into his libido .  both produced tallies that pleased him mightily .   as she raised a hand and proffered a glass of wine she smiled  and said     i think not .            he didn   t attempt to rescue you     rincewind pointed out as a last resort .   he clung desperately to twoflower   s waist as the dragon circled slowly  tilting the world at a dangerous angle .  the new knowledge that the scaly back he was astride only existed as a sort of three dimensional daydream did not  he had soon realized  do anything at all for his ankle wrenching sensations of vertigo .  his mind kept straying toward the possible results of twoflower losing his concentration .      not even hrun could have prevailed against those crossbows     said twoflower stoutly .   as the dragon rose higher above the patch of woodland  where the three of them had slept a damp and uneasy sleep  the sun rose over the edge of the disc .  instantly the gloomy blues and grays of pre dawn were transformed into a bright bronze river that flowed across the world  flaring into gold where it struck ice or water or a light dam .   owing to the density of the magical field surrounding the disc  light itself moved at subsonic speeds  this interesting property was well utilized by the sorca people of the great nef  for example  who over the centuries had constructed intricate and delicate dams  and valleys walled with polished silica  to catch the slow sunlight and sort of store it .  the scintillating reservoirs of the nef  overflowing after several weeks of uninterrupted sunlight  were a truly magnificent sight from the air and it is therefore unfortunate that twoflower and rincewind did not happen to glance in that direction .    in front of them the billion ton impossibility that was the magic wrought wyrmberg hung against the sky and that was not too bad  until rincewind turned his head and saw the mountain   s shadow slowly unroll itself across the cloudscape of the world        what can you see .     said twoflower to the dragon .   i see fighting on the top of the mountain came the gentle reply .      see .     said twoflower .     hrun   s probably fighting for his life at this very moment .      rincewind was silent .  after a moment twoflower looked around .  the wizard was staring intently at nothing at all  his lips moving soundlessly .      rincewind .      the wizard made a small croaking noise .      i   m sorry     said twoflower .     what did you say .            all the way   the great fall       muttered rincewind .  his eyes focused  looked puzzled for a moment  then widened in terror .  he made the mistake of looking down .      aargh     he opined  and began to slide .  twoflower grabbed him .      what   s the matter .      rincewind tried shutting his eyes  but there were no eyelids to his imagination and it was staring widely .      don   t you get scared of heights .     he managed to say .   twoflower looked down at the tiny landscape  mottled with cloud shadows .  the thought of fear hadn   t actually occurred to him .      no     he said .     why should i .  you   re just as dead if you fall from forty feet as you are from four thousand fathoms  that   s what i say .      rincewind tried to consider this dispassionately  but couldn   t see the logic of it .  it wasn   t the actual falling  it was the hitting he     twoflower grabbed him quickly .      steady on     he said cheerfully .     we   re nearly there .         i wish i was back in the city     moaned rincewind .     i wish i was back on the ground .         i wonder if dragons can fly all the way to the stars .     mused twoflower .     now that would be something           you   re mad     said rincewind flatly .  there was no reply from the tourist  and when the wizard craned around he was horrified to see twoflower looking up at the paling stars with an odd smile on his face .      don   t you even think about it     added rincewind  menacingly .   the man you seek is talking to the dragonwoman said the dragon .      hmm .     said twoflower  still looking at the paling stars .      what .     said rincewind urgently .      oh yes .  hrun .     said twoflower .     i hope we   re in time .  dive now .  go low .      rincewind opened his eyes as the wind increased to a whistling gale .  perhaps they were blown open   the wind certainly made them impossible to shut .   the flat summit of the wyrmberg rose up at them  lurched alarmingly  then somersaulted into a green blur that flashed by on either side .  tiny woods and fields blurred into a rushing patchwork .  a brief silvery flash in the landscape may have been the little river that overflowed into the air at the plateau   s rim .  rincewind tried to force the memory out of his mind  but it was rather enjoying itself there  terrorizing the other occupants and kicking over the furniture .         i think not     said liessa .   hrun took the wine cup  slowly .  he grinned like a pumpkin .   around the arena the dragons started to bay .  their riders looked up .  and something like a green blur flashed across the arena  and hrun had gone .   the winecup hung momentarily in the air  then crashed down on the steps .  only then did a single drop spill .   this was because  in the instant of enfolding hrun gently in his claws  ninereeds the dragon had momentarily synchronized their bodily rhythms .  since the dimension of the imagination is much more complex than those of time and space  which are very junior dimensions indeed  the effect of this was to instantly transform a stationary and priapic hrun into a hrun moving sideways at eighty miles an hour with no ill effects whatsoever  except for a few wasted mouthfuls of wine .  another effect was to cause liessa to scream with rage and summon her dragon .  as the gold beast materialized in front of her she leapt astride it  still naked  and snatched a crossbow from one of the guards .  then she was airborne  while the other dragonriders swarmed toward their own beasts .   the loremaster  watching from the pillar he had prudently slid behind in the mad scramble  happened at that moment to catch the cross dimensional echoes of a theory being at the same instant hatched in the mind of an early psychiatrist in an adjacent universe  possibly because the dimension leak was flowing both ways  and for a moment the psychiatrist saw the girl on the dragon .  the loremaster smiled .      want to bet that she won   t catch him .     said greicha  in a voice of worms and sepulchers  right by his ear .   the loremaster shut his eyes and swallowed hard .      i thought that my lord would now be residing fully in the dread land     he managed .      i am a wizard     said greicha .     death himself must claim a wizard .  and  aha  he doesn   t appear to be in the neighborhood        shall we go .  asked death .   he was on a white horse  a horse of flesh and blood but red of eye and fiery of nostril  and he stretched out a bony hand and took greicha   s soul out of the air and rolled it up until it was a point of painful light  and then he swallowed it .   then he clapped spurs to his steed and it sprang into the air  sparks corruscating from its hooves .      lord greicha .     whispered the old loremaster  as the universe flickered around him .      that was a mean trick     came the wizard   s voice  a mere speck of sound disappearing into the infinite black dimensions .      my lord   what is death like .     called the old man tremulously .      when i have investigated it fully  i will let you know     came the faintest of modulations on the breeze .      yes     murmured the loremaster .  a thought struck him .     during daylight  please     he added .         you clowns     screamed hrun  from his perch on ninereeds   s foreclaws .      what did he say .     roared rincewind  as the dragon ripped its way through the air in the race for the heights .      didn   t hear .     bellowed twoflower  his voice torn away by the gale .  as the dragon banked slightly he looked down at the little toy spinning top that was the mighty wyrmberg and saw the swarm of creatures rising in pursuit .  ninereed   s wings pounded and flicked the air away contemptuously .  thinner air  too .  twoflower   s ear popped for the third time .   ahead of the swarm  he noticed  was a golden dragon .  someone on it  too .      hey  are you all right .     said rincewind urgently .  he had to drink in several lungfuls of the strangely distilled air in order to get the words out .      i could have been a lord  and you clowns had to go and       hrun gasped  as the chill thin air drew the life even out of his mighty chest .      wass happnin to the air .     muttered rincewind .  blue lights appeared in front of his eyes .      unk     said twoflower  and passed out .   the dragon vanished .   for a few seconds the three men continued upward  twoflower and the wizard presenting an odd picture as they sat one in front of the other with their legs astride something that wasn   t there .  then what passed for gravity on the disc recovered from the surprise  and claimed them .   at that moment liessa   s dragon flashed by  and hrun landed heavily across its neck .  liessa leaned over and kissed him .   this detail was lost to rincewind as he dropped away  with his arms still clasped around twoflower   s waist .  the disc was a little round map pinned against the sky .  it didn   t appear to be moving  but rincewind knew that it was .  the whole world was coming toward him like a giant custard pie .      wake up .     he shouted  above the roar of the wind .     dragons .  think of dragons .      there was a flurry of wings as they plummeted through the host of pursuing creatures  which fell away and up .  dragons screamed and wheeled across the sky .   no answer came from twoflower .  rincewind   s robe whipped around him  but he did not wake .   dragons  thought rincewind in a panic .  he tried to concentrate his mind  tried to envisage a really lifelike dragon .  if he can do it  he thought  then so can i .  but nothing happened .   the disc was bigger now  a cloud swirled circle rising gently underneath them .   rincewind tried again  screwing up his eyes and straining every nerve in his body .  a dragon .  his imagination  a somewhat battered and overused organ  reached out for a dragon   any dragon .   it won   t work  laughed a voice like the dull toning of a funeral bell  you don   t believe in them .   rincewind looked at the terrible mounted apparition grinning at him  and his mind bolted in terror .   there was a brilliant flash .   there was utter darkness .   there was a soft floor under rincewind   s feet  a pink light around him  and the sudden shocked cries of many people .   he looked around wildly .  he was standing in some kind of tunnel  which was mostly filled with seats in which out landishly dressed people had been strapped .  they were all shouting at him .      wake up .     he hissed .     help me .      dragging the still unconscious tourist with him he backed away from the mob until his free hand found an oddly shaped door handle .  he twisted it and ducked through  then slammed it hard .   he stared around the new room in which he found himself and met the terrified gaze of a young woman who dropped the tray she was holding and screamed .   it sounded like the sort of scream that brings muscular help .  rincewind  awash with fear distilled adrenaline  turned and barged past her .  there were more seats here  and the people in them ducked as he dragged twoflower urgently along the central gangway .  beyond the rows of seats were little windows .  beyond the windows  against a background of fleecy clouds  was a dragon   s wing .  it was silver .   i   ve been eaten by a dragon  he thought .  that   s ridiculous  he replied  you can   t see out of dragons .  then his shoulder hit the door at the far end of the tunnel  and he followed it through into a cone shaped room that was even stranger than the tunnel .   it was full of tiny glittering lights .  among the lights  in contoured chairs  were four men who were now staring at him open mouthed .  as he stared back he saw their gazes dart sideways .   rincewind turned slowly .  beside him was a fifth man   youngish  bearded  as swarthy as the nomad folk of the great nef .      where am i .     said the wizard .     in the belly of a dragon .      the young man crouched back and shoved a small black box in the wizard   s face .  the men in the chairs ducked down .      what is it .     said rincewind .     a picture box .     he reached out and took it  a movement which appeared to surprise the swarthy man  who shouted and tried to snatch it back .  there was another shout  this time from one of the men in the chairs .  only now he wasn   t sitting .  he was standing up  pointing something small and metallic at the young man .   it had an amazing effect .  the man crouched back with his hands in the air .      please give me the bomb  sir     said the man with the metallic thing .     carefully  please .         this thing .     said rincewind .     you have it .  i don   t want it .     the man took it very carefully and put it on the floor .  the seated men relaxed  and one of them started speaking urgently to the wall .  the wizard watched him in amazement .      don   t move .     snapped the man with the metal   an amulet  rincewind decided  it must be an amulet .  the swarthy man backed into the corner .      that was a very brave thing you did     said amuletholder to rincewind .     you know that .         what .         what   s the matter with your friend .         friend .      rincewind looked down at twoflower  who was still slumbering peacefully .  that was no surprise .  what was really surprising was that twoflower was wearing new clothes .  strange clothes .  his britches now ended just above his knees .  above that he wore some sort of vest of brightly striped material .  on his head was a ridiculous little straw hat .  with a feather in it .   an awkward feeling around the leg regions made rincewind look down .  his clothes had changed  too .  instead of the comfortable old robe  so marvelously well adapted for speed into action in all possible contingencies  his legs were encased in cloth tubes .  he was wearing a jacket of the same gray material     until now he   d never heard the language the man with the amulet was using .  it was uncouth and vaguely hublandish   so why could he understand every word .   let   s see  they   d suddenly appeared in this dragon after  they   d materialized in this drag  they   d sudd  they   d  they   d   they had struck up a conversation in the airport so naturally they had chosen to sit together on the plane  and he   d promised to show jack zweiblumen around when they got back to the states .  yes  that was it .  and then jack had been taken ill and he   d panicked and come through here and surprised this hijacker .  of course .  what on earth was    hublandish .      dr .  rjinswand rubbed his forehead .  what he could do with was a drink .      ripples of paradox spread out across the sea of causality .   possibly the most important point that would have to be borne in mind by anyone outside the sum totality of the multiverse was that although the wizard and the tourist had indeed only recently appeared in an aircraft in midair  they had also at one and the same time been riding on that airplane in the normal course of things .  that is to say  while it was true that they had just appeared in this particular set of dimensions  it was also true that they had been living in them all along .  it is at this point that normal language gives up  and goes and has a drink .   the point is that several quintillion atoms had just materialized  however  they had not .  see below  in a universe where they should not strictly had been .  the usual upshot of this sort of thing is a vast explosion but  since universes are fairly resilient things  this particular universe had saved itself by instantaneously unraveling its space time continuum back to a point where the surplus atoms could safely be accommodated and then rapidly rewinding back to that circle of firelight which for want of a better term its inhabitants were wont to call the present .  this had of course changed history   there had been a few less wars  a few extra dinosaurs and so on   but on the whole the episode passed remarkably quietly .   outside of this particular universe  however  the repercussions of the sudden double take bounced to and fro across the face of the sum of things  bending whole dimensions and sinking galaxies without a trace .   all this was however totally lost on dr .  rjinswand      a bachelor  born in sweden  raised in new jersey  and a specialist in the breakaway oxidation phenomena of certain nuclear reactors .  anyway  he probably would not have believed any of it .   zweiblumen still seemed to be unconscious .  the stewardess  who had helped rjinswand to his seat to the applause of the rest of the passengers  was bending over him anxiously .      we   ve radioed ahead     she told rjinswand .     there   ll be an ambulance waiting when we land .  uh  it says on the passenger list that you   re a doctor           i don   t know what   s wrong with him     said rjinswand hurriedly .     it might be a different matter if he was a magnox reactor of course .  is it shock of some kind .         i   ve never        her sentence terminated in a tremendous crash from the rear of the plane .  several passengers screamed .  a sudden gale of air swept every loose magazine and newspaper into a screaming whirlwind that twisted madly down the aisle .   something else was coming up the aisle .  something big and oblong and wooden and brass bound .  it had hundreds of legs .  if it was what it seemed   a walking chest of the kind that appeared in pirate stories brim full of ill gotten gold and jewels   then what would have been its lid suddenly gaped open .   there were no jewels .  but there were lots of big square teeth  white as sycamore  and a pulsating tongue  red as mahogany .   an ancient suitcase was coming to eat him .   rjinswand clutched at the unconscious zweiblumen for what little comfort there was there  and gibbered .  he wished fervently that he was somewhere else     there was a sudden darkness .   there was a brilliant flash .   the sudden departure of several quintillion atoms from a universe that they had no right to be in anyway caused a wild imbalance in the harmony of the sum totality which it tried frantically to retrieve  wiping out a number of subrealities in the process .  huge surges of raw magic boiled uncontrolled around the very foundations of the multiverse itself  welling up through every crevice into hitherto peaceful dimensions and causing novas  supernovas  stellar collisions  wild flights of geese and drowning of imaginary continents .  worlds as far away as the other end of time experienced brilliant sunsets of corruscating octarine as highly charged magical particles roared through the atmosphere .  in the cometary halo around the fabled ice system of zeret a noble comet died as a prince flamed across the sky .   all this was however lost on rincewind as  clutching the inert twoflower around the waist  he plunged toward the disc   s sea several hundred feet below .  not even the convulsions of all the dimensions could break the iron law of the conservation of energy  and rjinswand   s brief journey in the plane had sufficed to carry him several hundred miles horizontally and seven thousand feet vertically .   the word    plane    flamed and died in rincewind   s mind .   was that a ship down there .   the cold waters of the circle sea roared up at him and sucked him down into their green  suffocating embrace .  a moment later there was another splash as the luggage  still bearing a label carrying the powerful traveling rune twa  also hit the sea .   later on  they used it as a raft .            close to the edge     it had been a long time in the making .  now it was almost completed  and the slaves hacked away at the last clay remnants of the mantle .   where other slaves were industriously rubbing its metal flanks with silver sand it was already beginning to gleam in the sun with the silken  organic sheen of young bronze .  it was still warm  even after a week of cooling in the casting pit .   the arch astronomer of krull motioned lightly with his hand and his bearers set the throne down in the shadow of the hull .   like a fish  he thought .  a great flying fish .  and of what seas .      it is indeed magnificent     he whispered .     a work of true art .         craft     said the thickset man by his side .  the arch astronomer turned slowly and looked up at the man   s impassive face .  it isn   t particularly hard for a face to look impassive when there are two golden spheres where the eyes should be .  they glowed disconcertingly .      craft  indeed     said the astronomer  and smiled .     i would imagine that there is no greater craftsman on the entire disc than you  goldeneyes .  would i be right .      the craftsman paused  his naked body   naked  at least  were it not for a toolbelt  a wrist abacus and a deep tan   tensing as he considered the implications of this last remark .  the golden eyes appeared to be looking into some other world .      the answer is both yes and no     he said at last .  some of the lesser astronomers behind the throne gasped at this lack of etiquette  but the arch astronomer appeared not to have noticed it .      continue     he said .      there are some essential skills that i lack .  yet i am goldeneyes silverhand dactylos     said the craftsman .     i made the metal warriors that guard the tomb of pitchiu  i designed the light dams of the great nef  i built the palace of the seven deserts .  and yet       he reached up and tapped one of his eyes  which rang faintly     when i built the golem army for pitchiu he loaded me down with gold and then  so that i would create no other work to rival my work for him  he had my eyes put out .         wise but cruel     said the arch astronomer sympathetically .      yah .  so i learned to hear the temper of metals and to see with my fingers .  i learned how to distinguish ores by taste and smell .  i made these eyes  but i cannot make them see .      next i was summoned to build the palace of the seven deserts  as a result of which the emir showered me with silver and then  not entirely to my surprise  had my right hand cut off .         a grave hindrance in your line of business     nodded the arch astronomer .      i used some of the silver to make myself this new hand  putting to use my unrivaled knowledge of levers and fulcrums .  it suffices .  after i created the first great light dam  which had a capacity of        daylight hours  the tribal councils of the nef loaded me down with fine silks and then hamstrung me so that i could not escape .  as a result i was put to some inconvenience to use the silk and some bamboo to build a flying machine from which i could launch myself from the topmost turret of my prison .         bringing you  by various diversions  to krull     said the arch astronomer .     and one cannot help feeling that some alternative occupation   lettuce farming  say   would offer somewhat less of a risk of being put to death by installments .  why do you persist in it .      goldeneyes dactylos shrugged .      i   m good at it     he said .   the arch astronomer looked up again at the bronze fish  shining now like a gong in the noontime sun .      such beauty     he murmured .     and unique .  come  dactylos .  recall to me what it was that i promised should be your reward .         you asked me to design a fish that would swim through the seas of space that lie between the worlds     intoned the master craftsman .     in return for which   in return           yes .  my memory is not what it used to be     purred the arch astronomer  stroking the warm bronze .      in return     continued dactylos  without much apparent hope     you would set me free  and refrain from chopping off any appendages .  i require no treasure .         ah  yes .  i recall now .     the old man raised a blue veined hand  and added     i lied .      there was the merest whisper of sound  and the goldeneyed man rocked on his feet .  then he looked down at the arrowhead protruding from his chest  and nodded wearily .  a speck of blood bloomed on his lips .   there was no sound in the entire square  save for the buzzing of a few expectant flies  as his silver hand came up  very slowly  and fingered the arrowhead .   dactylos grunted .      sloppy workmanship     he said  and toppled backward .   the arch astronomer prodded the body with his toe  and sighed .      there will be a short period of mourning  as befits a master craftsman     he said .  he watched a bluebottle alight on one golden eye and fly away puzzled      that would seem to be long enough     said the arch astronomer  and beckoned a couple of slaves to carry the corpse away .      are the chelonauts ready .     he asked .   the master launchcontroller bustled forward .      indeed  your prominence     he said .      the correct prayers are being intoned .         quite so  your prominence .         how long to the doorway .         the launch window     corrected the master launchcontroller carefully .     three days  your prominence .  great a   tuin   s tail will be in an unmatched position .         then all that remains     concluded the arch astronomer     is to find the appropriate sacrifices .      the master launchcontroller bowed .      the ocean shall provide     he said .   the old man smiled .     it always does     he said .         if only you could navigate           if only you could steer        a wave washed over the deck .  rincewind and twoflower looked at each other .     keep bailing .     they screamed in unison  and reached for the buckets .   after a while twoflower   s peevish voice filtered up from the waterlogged cabin .      i don   t see how it   s my fault     he said .  he handed up another bucket  which the wizard tipped over the side .      you were supposed to be on watch     snapped rincewind .      i saved us from the slavers  remember     said twoflower .      i   d rather be a slave than a corpse     replied the wizard .  he straightened up and looked out to sea .  he appeared puzzled .   he was a somewhat different rincewind from the one that escaped the fire of ankh morpork some six months before .  more scarred  for one thing  and much more traveled .  he had visited the hublands  discovered the curious folkways of many colorful peoples   invariably obtaining more scars in the process   and had even  for a never to be forgotten few days  sailed on the legendary dehydrated ocean at the heart of the incredibly dry desert known as the great nef .  on a colder and wetter sea he had seen floating mountains of ice .  he had ridden on an imaginary dragon .  he had very nearly said the most powerful spell on the disc .  he had        there was definitely less horizon than there ought to be .      hmm .     said rincewind .      i said nothing   s worse than slavery     said twoflower .  his mouth opened as the wizard flung his bucket far out to sea and sat down heavily on the waterlogged deck  his face a gray mask .      look  i   m sorry i steered us into the reef  but this boat doesn   t seem to want to sink and we   re bound to strike land sooner or later     said twoflower comfortingly .     this current must go somewhere .         look at the horizon     said rincewind  in a monotone .   twoflower squinted .      it looks all right     he said after a while .     admittedly  there seems to be less than there usually is  but           that   s because of the rimfall     said rincewind .     we   re being carried over the edge of the world .      there was a long silence  broken only by the lapping of the waves as the foundering ship spun slowly in the current .  it was already quite strong .      that   s probably why we hit that reef     rincewind added .     we got pulled off course during the night .         would you like something to eat .     asked twoflower .  he began to rummage through the bundle that he had tied to the rail  out of the damp .      don   t you understand .     snarled rincewind .     we are going over the edge  godsdammit .         can   t we do anything about it .         no .         then i can   t see the sense in panicking     said twoflower calmly .      i knew we shouldn   t have come this far edgewise     complained rincewind to the sky     i wish           i wish i had my picture box     said twoflower     but it   s back on that slaver ship with the rest of the luggage and           you won   t need luggage where we   re going     said rincewind .  he sagged  and stared moodily at a distant whale that had carelessly strayed into the rimward current and was now struggling against it .   there was a line of white on the foreshortened horizon  and the wizard fancied he could hear a distant roaring .      what happens after a ship goes over the rimfall .     said twoflower .      who knows .         well  in that case perhaps we   ll just sail on through space and land on another world .     a faraway look came into the little man   s eyes .     i   d like that     he said .   rincewind snorted .   the sun rose in the sky  looking noticeably bigger this close to the edge .  they stood with their backs against the mast  busy with their own thoughts .  every so often one or other would pick up a bucket and do a bit of desultory bailing  for no very intelligent reason .   the sea around them seemed to be getting crowded .  rincewind noticed several tree trunks keeping station with them  and just below the surface the water was alive with fish of all sorts .  of course   the current must be teeming with food washed from the continents near the hub .  he wondered what kind of life it would be  having to keep swimming all the time to stay exactly in the same place .  pretty similar to his own  he decided .  he spotted a small green frog which was paddling desperately in the grip of the inexorable current .  to twoflower   s amazement he found a paddle and carefully extended it toward the little amphibian  which scrambled onto it gratefully .  a moment later a pair of jaws broke the water and snapped impotently at the spot where it had been swimming .   the frog looked up at rincewind from the cradle of his hands  and then bit him thoughtfully on the thumb .  twoflower giggled .  rincewind tucked the frog away in a pocket  and pretended he hadn   t heard .      all very humanitarian  but why .     said twoflower .     it   ll all be the same in an hour .         because     said rincewind vaguely  and did a bit of bailing .  spray was being thrown up now and the current was so strong that waves were forming and breaking all around them .  it all seemed unnaturally warm .  there was a hot golden haze on the sea .   the roaring was louder now .  a squid bigger than anything rincewind had seen before broke the surface a few hundred yards away and thrashed madly with its tentacles before sinking away .  something else that was large and fortunately unidentifiable howled in the mist .  a whole squadron of flying fish tumbled up in a cloud of rainbow edged droplets and managed to gain a few yards before dropping back and being swept away in an eddy .   they were running out of world .  rincewind dropped his bucket and snatched at the mast as the roaring  final end of everything raced toward them .      i must see this       said twoflower  half falling and half diving toward the prow .   something hard and unyielding smacked into the hull  which spun ninety degrees and came side on to the invisible obstacle .  then it stopped suddenly and a wash of cold sea foam cascaded over the deck  so that for a few seconds rincewind was under several feet of boiling green water .  he began to scream and then the underwater world became the deep clanging purple color of fading consciousness  because it was at about this point that rincewind started to drown .      he awoke with his mouth full of burning liquid and  when he swallowed  the searing pain in his throat jerked him into full consciousness .   the boards of a boat pressed into his back and twoflower was looking down at him with an expression of deep concern .  rincewind groaned  and sat up .   this turned out to be a mistake .  the edge of the world was a few feet away .   beyond it  at a level just below that of the lip of the endless rimfall  was something altogether magical .      some seventy miles away  and well beyond the tug of the rim current  a dhow with the red sails typical of a freelance slaver drifted aimlessly through the velvety twilight .  the crew   such as remained   were clustered on the foredeck  surrounding the men working feverishly on the raft .   the captain  a thickset man who wore the elbow turbans typical of a great nef tribesman  was much traveled and had seen many strange peoples and curious things  many of which he had subsequently enslaved or stolen .  he had begun his career as a sailor on the dehydrated ocean in the heart of the disc   s driest desert .   water on the disc has an uncommon fourth state  caused by intense heat combined with the strange dessicating effects of octarine light  it dehydrates  leaving a silvery residue like free flowing sand through which a well designed hull can glide with ease .  the dehydrated ocean is a strange place  but not so strange as its fish .   the captain had never before been really frightened .  now he was terrified .      i can   t hear anything     he muttered to the first mate .   the mate peered into the gloom .      perhaps it fell overboard .     he suggested hopefully .  as if in answer there came a furious pounding from the oar deck below their feet  and the sound of splintering wood .  the crewmen drew together fearfully  brandishing axes and torches .   they probably wouldn   t dare to use them  even if the monster came rushing toward them .  before its terrible nature had been truly understood several men had attacked it with axes  whereupon it had turned aside from its single minded searching of the ship and had either chased them overboard or had   eaten them .  the captain was not quite certain .  the thing looked like an ordinary wooden sea chest .  a bit larger than usual  maybe  but not suspiciously so .  but while it sometimes seemed to contain things like old socks and miscellaneous luggage  at other times   and he shuddered   it seemed to be  seemed to be  seemed to have   he tried not to think about it .  it was just that the men who had been drowned overboard had probably been more fortunate than those it had caught .  he tried not to think about it .  there had been teeth  teeth like white wooden gravestones  and a tongue red as mahogany     he tried not to think about it .  it didn   t work .   but he thought bitterly about one thing .  this was going to be the last time he rescued ungrateful drowning men in mysterious circumstances .  slavery was better than sharks  wasn   t it .  and then they had escaped and when his sailors had investigated their big chest   how had they appeared in the middle of an untroubled ocean sitting on a big chest  anyway .    and it had bitt   he tried not to think about it again  but he found himself wondering what would happen when the damned thing realized that its owner wasn   t on board any longer        raft   s ready  lord     said the first mate .      into the water with it     shouted the captain  and    get aboard .     and    fire the ship .      after all  another ship wouldn   t be too hard to come by  he philosophized  but a man might have to wait a long time in that paradise the mullahs advertised before he was granted another life .  let the magical box eat lobsters .   some pirates achieved immortality by great deeds of cruelty or derring do .  some achieved immortality by amassing great wealth .  but the captain had long ago decided that he would  on the whole  prefer to achieve immortality by not dying .         what the hell is that .     demanded rincewind .      it   s beautiful     said twoflower beatifically .      i   ll decide about that when i know what it is     said the wizard .      it is the rimbow     said a voice immediately behind his left ear     and you are fortunate indeed to be looking at it .  from above  at any rate .      the voice was accompanied by a gust of cold  fishy breath .  rincewind sat quite still .      twoflower .     he said .      yes .         if i turn around  what will i see .         his name is tethis .  he says he   s a sea troll .  this is his boat .  he rescued us     explained twoflower .     will you look around now .         not just at the moment  thank you .  so why aren   t we going over the edge  then .     asked rincewind with glassy calmness .      because your boat hit the circumfence     said the voice behind him  in tones that made rincewind imagine submarine chasms and lurking things in coral reefs  .      the circumfence .     he repeated .      yes .  it runs along the edge of the world     said the unseen troll .  above the roar of the waterfall rincewind thought he could make out the splash of oars .  he hoped they were oars .      ah .  you mean the circumference     said rincewind .     the circumference makes the edge of things .         so does the circumfence     said the troll .      he means this     said twoflower  pointing down .  rincewind   s eyes followed the finger  dreading what they might see     hubward of the boat was a rope suspended a few feet above the surface of the white water .  the boat was attached to it  moored yet mobile  by a complicated arrangement of pulleys and little wooden wheels .  they ran along the rope as the unseen rower propelled the craft along the very lip of the rimfall .  that explained one mystery   but what supported the rope .   rincewind peered along its length and saw a stout wooden post sticking up out of the water a few yards ahead .  as he watched the boat neared it and then passed it  the little wheels clacking neatly around it in a groove obviously cut for the purpose .   rincewind also noticed that smaller ropes hung down from the main rope at intervals of a yard or so .   he turned back to twoflower .      i can see what it is     he said     but what is it .      twoflower shrugged .  behind rincewind the sea troll said     up ahead is my house .  we will talk more when we are there .  now i must row .      rincewind found that looking ahead meant that he would have to turn and find out what a sea troll actually looked like  and he wasn   t sure he wanted to do that yet .  he looked at the rimbow instead .   it hung in the mists a few lengths beyond the edge of the world  appearing only at morning and evening when the light of the disc   s little orbiting sun shone past the massive bulk of great a   tuin the world turtle and struck the disc   s magical field at exactly the right angle .   a double rainbow corruscated into being .  close into the lip of the rimfall were the seven lesser colors  sparkling and dancing in the spray of the dying seas .   but they were pale in comparison to the wider band that floated beyond them  not deigning to share the same spectrum .   it was the king color  of which all the lesser colors are merely partial and wishy washy reflections .  it was octarine  the color of magic .  it was alive and glowing and vibrant and it was the undisputed pigment of the imagination  because wherever it appeared it was a sign that mere matter was a servant of the powers of the magical mind .  it was enchantment itself .   but rincewind always thought it looked a sort of greenish purple .      after a while a small speck on the rim of the world resolved itself into a eyot or crag  so perilously perched that the waters of the fall swirled around it at the start of their long drop .  a driftwood shanty had been built on it  and rincewind saw that the top rope of the circumfence climbed over the rocky island on a number of iron stakes and actually passed through the shack by a small round window .  he learned later that this was so that the troll could be alerted to the arrival of any salvage on his stretch of the circumfence by means of a series of small bronze bells  balanced delicately on the rope .   a crude floating stockade had been built out of rough timber on the hubward side of the island .  it contained one or two hulks and quite a large amount of floating wood in the form of planks  baulks and even whole natural tree trunks  some still sporting green leaves .  this close to the edge the disc   s magical field was so intense that a hazy corona flickered across everything as raw illusion spontaneously discharged itself .   with a last few squeaky jerks the boat slid up against a small driftwood jetty .  as it grounded itself and formed a circuit rincewind felt all the familiar sensations of a huge occult aura   oily  bluish tasting  and smelling of tin .  all around them pure  unfocused magic was sleeting soundlessly into the world .   the wizard and twoflower scrambled onto the planking and for the first time rincewind saw the troll .   it wasn   t half so dreadful as he had imagined .   umm  said his imagination after a while .   it wasn   t that the troll was horrifying .  instead of the rotting  betentacled monstrosity he had been expecting rincewind found himself looking at a rather squat but not particularly ugly old man who would quite easily have passed for normal on any city street  always provided that other people on the street were used to seeing old men who were apparently composed of water and very little else .  it was as if the ocean had decided to create life without going through all that tedious business of evolution  and had simply formed a part of itself into a biped and sent it walking squishily up the beach .  the troll was a pleasant translucent blue color .  as rincewind stared a small shoal of silver fish flashed across its chest .      it   s rude to stare     said the troll .  its mouth opened with a little crest of foam  and shut again in exactly the same way that water closes over a stone .      is it .  why .     asked rincewind .  how does he hold himself together  his mind screamed at him .  why doesn   t he spill .      if you will follow me to my house i will find you food and a change of clothing     said the troll solemnly .  he set off over the rocks without turning to see if they would follow him .  after all  where else could they go .  it was getting dark  and a chilly damp breeze was blowing over the edge of the world .  already the transient rimbow had faded and the mists above the waterfall were beginning to thin .      come on     said rincewind  grabbing twoflower   s elbow .  but the tourist didn   t appear to want to move .      come on     the wizard repeated .      when it gets really dark  do you think we   ll be able to look down and see great a   tuin the world turtle .     asked twoflower  staring at the rolling clouds .      i hope not     said rincewind     i really do .  now let   s go  shall we .      twoflower followed him reluctantly into the shack .  the troll had lit a couple of lamps and was sitting comfortably in a rocking chair .  he got to his feet as they entered and poured two cups of a green liquid from a tall pitcher .  in the dim light he appeared to phosphoresce  in the manner of warm seas on velvety summer nights .  just to add a baroque gloss to rincewind   s dull terror he seemed to be several inches taller  too .   most of the furniture in the room appeared to be boxes .      uh .  really great place you   ve got here     said rincewind .     ethnic .      he reached for a cup and looked at the green pool shimmering inside it .  it   d better be drinkable  he thought .  because i   m going to drink it .  he swallowed .   it was the same stuff twoflower had given him in the rowing boat but  at the time  his mind had ignored it because there were more pressing matters .  now it had the leisure to savor the taste .   rincewind   s mouth twisted .  he whimpered a little .  one of his legs came up convulsively and caught him painfully in the chest .   twoflower swirled his own drink thoughtfully while he considered the flavor .      ghlen livid     he said .     the fermented vul nut drink they freeze distill in my home country .  a certain smoky quality   piquant .  from the western plantations in  ah  rehigreed province  yes .  next year   s harvest  i fancy  from the color .  may i ask how you came by it .       plants on the disc  while including the categories known commonly as annuals  which were sown this year to come up later this year  biennials  sown this year to grow next year  and perennials  sown this year to grow until further notice  also included a few rare re annuals which  because of an unusual four dimensional twist in their genes  could be planted this year to come up last year .  the vul nut vine was particularly exceptional in that it could flourish as many as eight years prior to its seed actually being sown .  vul nut wine was reputed to give certain drinkers an insight into the future which was  from the nut   s point of view  the past .  strange but true .       all things drift into the circumfence in time     said the troll  gnomically  gently rocking in his chair .     my job is to recover the flotsam .  timber  of course  and ships .  barrels of wine .  bales of cloth .  you .      light dawned inside rincewind   s head .      it   s a net  isn   t it .  you   ve got a net right on the edge of the sea .         the circumfence     nodded the troll .  ripples ran across his chest .   rincewind looked out into the phosphorescent darkness that surrounded the island  and grinned inanely .      of course     he said .     amazing .  you could sink piles and attach it to reefs and   good grief .  the net would have to be very strong .         it is     said tethis .      it could be extended for a couple of miles  if you found enough rocks and things     said the wizard .      ten thousands of miles .  i just patrol this league .         that   s a third of the way around the disc .      tethis sloshed a little as he nodded again .  while the two men helped themselves to some more of the green wine  he told them about the circumfence  the great effort that had been made to build it  and the ancient and wise kingdom of krull which had constructed it several centuries before  and the seven navies that patrolled it constantly to keep it in repair and bring its salvage back to krull  and the manner in which krull had become a land of leisure ruled by the most learned seekers after knowledge  and the way in which they sought constantly to understand in every possible particular the wondrous complexity of the circumfence were turned into slaves  and usually had their tongues cut out .  after some interjections at this point he spoke  in a friendly way  on the futility of force  the impossibility of escaping from the island except by boat to one of the other three hundred and eighty isles that lay between the island and krull itself  or by leaping over the edge  and the high merit of muteness in comparison to  for example  death .   there was a pause .  the muted night roar of the rimfall only served to give the silence a heavier texture .   then the rocking chair started to creak again .  tethis seemed to have grown alarmingly during the monologue .      there is nothing personal in all this     he added .     i too am a slave .  if you try to overpower me i shall have to kill you  of course  but i won   t take any particular pleasure in it .      rincewind looked at the shimmering fists that rested lightly in the troll   s lap .  he suspected they could strike with all the force of a tsunami .      i don   t think you understand     explained twoflower .     i am a citizen of the golden empire .  i   m sure krull would not wish to incur the displeasure of the emperor .         how will the emperor know .     asked the troll .     do you think you   re the first person from the empire who has ended up on the circumfence .         i won   t be a slave .     shouted rincewind .     i   d   i   d jump over the edge first .     he was amazed at the sound in his own voice .      would you  though .     asked the troll .  the rocking chair flicked back against the wall and one blue arm caught the wizard around the waist .  a moment later the troll was striding out of the shack with rincewind gripped carelessly in one fist .   he did not stop until he came to the rimward edge of the island .  rincewind squealed .      stop that or i really will throw you over the edge     snapped the troll .     i   m holding you  aren   t i .  look .      rincewind looked .   in front of him was a soft black night whose mist muted stars glowed peacefully .  but his eyes turned downward  drawn by some irresistible fascination .   it was midnight on the disc and so  therefore  the sun was far  far below  swinging slowly under great a   tuin   s vast and frosty plastron .  rincewind tried a last attempt to fix his gaze on the tips of his boots  which were protruding over the rim of the rock  but the sheer drop wrenched it away .   on either side of him two glittering curtains of water hurtled toward infinity as the sea swept around the island on its way to the long fall .  a hundred yards below the wizard the largest sea salmon he had ever seen flicked itself out of the foam in a wild  jerky and ultimately hopeless leap .  then it fell back  over and over  in the golden underworld light .   huge shadows grew out of that light like pillars supporting the roof of the universe .  hundreds of miles below him the wizard made out the shape of something  the edge of something     like those curious little pictures where the silhouette of an ornate glass suddenly becomes the outline of two faces  the scene beneath him flipped into a whole  new  terrifying perspective .  because down there was the head of an elephant as big as a reasonablysized continent .  one mighty tusk cut like a mountain against the golden light  trailing a widening shadow toward the stars .  the head was slightly tilted  and a huge ruby eye might almost have been a red supergiant that had managed to shine at noonday .   below the elephant     rincewind swallowed and tried not to think     below the elephant there was nothing but the distant  painful disc of the sun .  and  sweeping slowly past it  was something that for all its city sized scales  its crater pocks  its junar cragginess  was indubitably a flipper .      shall i let go .     suggested the troll .      gnah     said rincewind  straining backward .      i have lived here on the edge for five years and i have not had the courage     boomed tethis .     nor have you  if i   m any judge .     he stepped back  allowing rincewind to fling himself onto the ground .   twoflower strolled up to the rim and peered over .      fantastic     he said .     if only i had my picture box   what else is down there .  i mean  if you jumped off  what would you see .      tethis sat down on an outcrop .  high over the disc the moon came out from behind a cloud  giving him the appearance of ice .      my home is down there  perhaps     he said slowly .     beyond your silly elephants and that ridiculous turtle .  a real world .  sometimes i come out here and look  but somehow i can never bring myself to take that extra step   a real world  with real people .  i have wives and little ones  somewhere down there       he stopped  and blew his nose .     you soon learn what you   re made of  here on the edge .         stop saying that .  please     moaned rincewind .  he turned over and saw twoflower standing unconcernedly at the very lip of the rock .     gnah     he said  and tried to burrow into the stone .      there   s another world down there .     said twoflower  peering over .     where  exactly .      the troll waved an arm vaguely .     somewhere     he said .     that   s all i know .  it was quite a small world .  mostly blue .         so why are you here .     said twoflower .      isn   t it obvious .     snapped the troll .     i fell off the edge .         he told them of the world of bathys  somewhere among the stars  where the seafolk had built a number of thriving civilizations in the three large oceans that sprawled across its disc .  he had been a meatman  one of the caste which earned a perilous living in large  sail powered land yachts that ventured far out to land and hunted the shoals of deer and buffalo that abounded in the storm haunted continents .  his particular yacht had been blown into uncharted lands by a freak gale .  the rest of the crew had taken the yacht   s little rowing trolley and had struck out for a distant lake  but tethis  as master  had elected to remain with his vessel .  the storm had carried it right over the rocky rim of the world  smashing it to matchwood in the process .      at first i fell     said tethis     but falling isn   t so bad  you know .  it   s only the landing that hurts  and there was nothing below me .  as i fell i saw the world spin off into space until it was lost against the stars .         what happened next .     said twoflower breathlessly  glancing toward the misty universe .      i froze solid     said tethis simply .     fortunately it is something my race can survive .  but i thawed out occasionally when i passed near other worlds .  there was one  i think it was the one with what i thought was this strange ring of mountains around it that turned out to be the biggest dragon you could ever imagine  covered in snow and glaciers and holding its tail in its mouth   well  i came within a few leagues of that  i shot over the landscape like a comet  in fact  and then i was off again .  then there was a time i woke up and there was your world coming at me like a custard piethrown by the creator and  well  i landed in the sea not far from the circumfence widdershins of krull .  all sorts of creatures get washed up against the fence  and at the time they were looking for slaves to man the way stations  and i ended up here .     he stopped and stared intently at rincewind .     every night i come out here and look down     he finished     and i never jump .  courage is hard to come by  here on the edge .      rincewind began to crawl determinedly toward the shack .  he gave a little scream as the troll picked him up  not unkindly  and set him on his feet .      amazing     said twoflower  and leaned farther out over the edge .     there are lots of other worlds out there .         quite a number  i imagine     said the troll .      i suppose one could contrive some sort of  i don   t know  some sort of a thing that could preserve one against the cold     said the little man thoughtfully .     some sort of a ship that one could sail over the edge and sail to far off worlds  too .  i wonder           don   t even think about it .     moaned rincewind .     stop talking like that  do you hear .         they all talk like that in krull     said tethis .      those with tongues  of course     he added .         are you awake .      twoflower snored on .  rincewind jabbed him viciously in the ribs .      i said  are you awake .     he snarled .      scrdfngh           we   ve got to get out of here before this salvage fleet comes .      the dishwater light of dawn oozed through the shack   s one window  slopping across the piles of salvaged boxes and bundles that were strewn around the interior .  twoflower grunted again and tried to burrow into the pile of furs and blankets that tethis had given them .      look  there   s all kinds of weapons and stuff in here     said rincewind .     he   s gone out somewhere .  when he comes back we could overpower him and   and   well  then we can think of something .  how about it .         that doesn   t sound like a very good idea     said twoflower .     anyhow  it   s a bit ungracious isn   t it .         tough buns     snapped rincewind .     this is a rough universe .      he rummaged through the piles around the walls and selected a heavy  wavy bladed scimitar that had probably been some pirate   s pride and joy .  it looked the sort of weapon that relied as much on its weight as its edge to cause damage .  he raised it awkwardly .      would he leave that sort of thing around if it could hurt him .     twoflower wondered aloud .   rincewind ignored him and took up a position beside the door .  when it opened some ten minutes later he moved unhesitatingly  swinging it across the opening at what he judged was the troll   s head height .  it swished harmlessly through nothing at all and struck the doorpost  jerking him off his feet and onto the floor .   there was a sigh above him .  he looked up into tethis   s face  which was shaking sadly from side to side .      it wouldn   t have harmed me     said the troll     but nevertheless i am hurt .  deeply hurt .     he reached over the wizard and jerked the sword out of the wood .  with no apparent effort he bent its blade into a circle and sent it bowling away over the rocks until it hit a stone and sprang  still spinning  in a silver arc that ended in the mists forming over the rimfall .      very deeply hurt     he concluded .  he reached down beside the door and tossed a sack toward twoflower .      it   s the carcass of a deer that is just about how you humans like it  and a few lobsters  and a sea salmon .  the circumfence provides     he said casually .   he looked hard at the tourist  and then down again at rincewind .      what are you staring at .     he said .      it   s just that       said twoflower .         compared to last night       said rincewind .      you   re so small     finished twoflower .      i see  said the troll carefully .     personal remarks now .     he drew himself up to his full height  which was currently about four feet .     just because i   m made of water doesn   t mean i   m made of wood  you know .         i   m sorry     said twoflower  climbing hastily out of the furs .      you   re made of dirt     said the troll     but i didn   t pass comments about things you can   t help  did i .  oh  no .  we can   t help the way the creator made us  that   s my view .  but if you must know  your moon here is rather more powerful than the ones around my own world .         the moon .     said twoflower .     i don   t under           if i   ve got to spell it out     said the troll  testily     i   m suffering from chronic tides .      a bell jangled in the darkness of the shack .  tethis strode across the creaking floor to the complicated devices of levers  strings and bells that was mounted on the circumfence   s topmost strand where it passed through the hut .   the bell rang again  and then started to clang away in an odd jerky rhythm for several minutes .  the troll stood with his ear pressed close to it .   when it stopped he turned slowly and looked at them with a worried frown .      you   re more important than i thought     he said .     you   re not to wait for the salvage fleet .  you   re to be collected by a flyer .  that   s what they say in krull .     he shrugged .     and i hadn   t even sent a message that you   re here  yet .  someone   s been drinking vul nut wine again .      he picked up a large mallet that hung on a pillar beside the bell and used it to tap out a brief carillon .      that   ll be passed from lengthman to lengthman all the way back to krull     he said .     marvelous really  isn   t it .         it came speeding across the sea  floating a man length above it  but still leaving a foaming wake as whatever power that held it up smacked brutally into the water .  rincewind knew what power held it up .  he was  he would be the first to admit  a coward  an incompetent  and not even very good at being a failure  but he was still a wizard of sorts  he knew one of the eight great spells  he would be claimed by death himself when he died  and he recognized really finely honed magic when he saw it .   the lens skimming toward the island was perhaps twenty feet across  and totally transparent .  sitting around its circumference were a large number of black robed men  each one strapped securely to the disc by a leather harness and each one staring down at the waves with an expression so tormented  so agonizing  that the transparent disc seemed to be ringed with gargoyles .   rincewind sighed with relief .  this was such an unusual sound that it made twoflower take his eyes off the approaching disc and turn them on him .      we   re important  no lie     explained rincewind .     they wouldn   t be wasting all that magic on a couple of potential slaves .     he grinned .      what is it .     said twoflower .      well  the disc itself would have been created by fresnel   s wonderful concentrator     said rincewind  authoritatively .     that calls for many rare and unstable ingredients  such as demon   s breath and so forth  and it takes at least eight fourth grade wizards a week to envision .  then there   s those wizards on it  who must all be gifted hydrophobes           you mean they hate water .     said twoflower .      no  that wouldn   t work     said rincewind .     hate is an attracting force  just like love .  they really loathe it  the very idea of it revolts them .  a really good hydrophobe has to be trained on dehydrated water from birth .  i mean  that costs a fortune in magic alone .  but they make great weather magicians .  rain clouds just give up and go away .         it sounds terrible     said the water troll behind them .      and they all die young     said rincewind  ignoring him .     they just can   t live with themselves .         sometimes i think a man could wander across the disc all his life and not see everything there is to see     said twoflower .     and now it seems there are lots of other worlds as well .  when i think i might die without seeing a hundredth of all there is to see it makes me feel     he paused  then added     well  humble  i suppose .  and very angry  of course .      the flyer halted a few yards hubward of the island  throwing up a sheet of spray .  it hung there  spinning slowly .  a hooded figure standing by the stubby pillar at the exact center of the lens beckoned to them .      you   d better wade out     said the troll .     it doesn   t do to keep them waiting .  it has been nice to make your acquaintance .     he shook them both  wetly  by the hand .  as he waded out a little way with them the two nearest loathers on the lens shied away with expressions of extreme disgust .   the hooded figure reached down with one hand and released a rope ladder .  in its other hand it held a silver rod  which had about it the unmistakable air of something designed for killing people .  rincewind   s first impression was reinforced when the figure raised the stick and waved it carelessly toward the shore .  a section of rock vanished  leaving a small gray haze of nothingness .      that   s so you don   t think i   m afraid to use it     said the figure .      don   t think you   re afraid .     said rincewind .  the hooded figure snorted .      we know all about you  rincewind the magician .  you are a man of great cunning and artifice .  you laugh in the face of death .  your affected air of craven cowardice does not fool me .      it fooled rincewind .     i       he began  and paled as the nothingness stick was turned toward him .     i see you know all about me     he finished weakly  and sat down heavily on the slippery surface .  he and twoflower  under instructions from the hooded commander  strapped themselves down to rings set in the transparent disc .      if you make the merest suggestion of weaving a spell     said the darkness under the hood     you die .  third quadrant reconcile  ninth quadrant redouble  forward all .      a wall of water shot into the air behind rincewind and the disc jerked suddenly .  the dreadful presence of the sea troll had probably concentrated the hydrophobes    minds wonderfully  because it then rose at a very steep angle and didn   t begin level flight until it was a dozen fathoms above the waves .  rincewind glanced down through the transparent surface and wished he hadn   t .      well  off again then     said twoflower cheerfully .  he turned and waved at the troll  now no more than a speck on the edge of the world .   rincewind glared at him .     doesn   t anything every worry you .     he asked .      we   re still alive  aren   t we .     asked twoflower .     and you yourself said they wouldn   t be going to all this trouble if we were just going to be slaves .  i expect tethis was exaggerating .  i expect it   s all a misunderstanding .  i expect we   ll be sent home .  after we   ve seen krull  of course .  and i must say it all sounds fascinating .         oh yes     said rincewind  in a hollow voice .     fascinating .     he was thinking  i   ve seen excitement  and i   ve seen boredom .  and boredom was best .   had either of them happened to look down at that moment they would have noticed a strange v shaped wave surging through the water far below them  its apex pointing directly at tethis   s island .  but they weren   t looking .  the twenty four hydrophobic magicians were looking  but to them it was just another piece of dreadfulness  not really any different from the liquid horror around it .  they were probably right .      sometime before all this the blazing pirate ship had hissed under the waves and started the long slow slide toward the distant ooze .  it was more distant than average  because directly under the stricken keel was the gorunna trench   a chasm in the disc   s surface that was so black  so deep and so reputedly evil that even the krakens went there fearfully  and in pairs .  in less reputedly evil chasms the fish went about with natural lights on their heads and on the whole managed quite well .  in gorunna they left them unlit and  insofar as it is possible for something without legs to creep  they crept  they tended to bump into things  too .  horrible things .   the water around the ship turned from green to purple  from purple to black  from black to a darkness so complete that blackness itself seemed merely gray by comparison .  most of its timbers had already been crushed into splinters under the intense pressure .   it spiraled past groves of nightmare polyps and drifting forests of seaweed which glowed with faint  diseased colors .  things brushed it briefly with soft  cold tentacles as they darted away into the freezing silence .   something rose up from the murk and ate it in one mouthful .   some time later the islanders on a little rimward atoll were amazed to find  washed into their little local lagoon  the wave rocked corpse of a hideous sea monster  all beaks  eyes and tentacles .  they were further astonished at its size  since it was rather larger than their village .  but their surprise was tiny compared to the huge  stricken expression on the face of the dead monster  which appeared to have been trampled to death .   somewhat farther rimward of the atoll a couple of little boats  trolling a net for the ferocious free swimming oysters which abounded in those seas  caught something that dragged both vessels for several miles before one captain had the presence of mind to sever the lines .   but even his bewilderment was as nothing compared to that of the islanders on the last atoll in the archipelago .  during the following night they were awakened by a terrific crashing and splintering noise coming from their minute jungle  when some of the bolder spirits went to investigate in the morning they found that the trees had been smashed in a broad swath that started on the hubmost shore of the atoll and made a line of total destruction pointing precisely edgewise  littered with broken lianas  crushed bushes and a few bewildered and angry oysters .      they were high enough now to see the wide curve of the rim sweeping away from them  lapped by the fluffy clouds that mercifully hid the waterfall for most of the time .  from up here the sea  a deep blue dappled with cloud shadows  looked almost inviting .  rincewind shuddered .      excuse me     he said .  the hooded figure turned from its contemplation of the distant haze and raised its wand threateningly .      i don   t want to use this     it said .      you don   t .     said rincewind .      what is it  anyway .     said twoflower .      ajandurah   s wand of utter negativity     said rincewind .     and i wish you   d stop waving it about .  it might go off     he added  nodding at the wand   s glittering point .     i mean  it   s all very flattering  all this magic being used just for our benefit  but there   s no need to go quite that far .  and           shut up .  the figure reached up and pulled back its hood  revealing itself to be a most unusually tinted young woman .  her skin was black .  not the dark brown of urabewe  or the polished blue black of monsoon haunted klatch  but the deep black of midnight at the bottom of a cave .  her hair and eyebrows were the color of moonlight .  there was the same pale sheen around her lips .  she looked about fifteen  and very frightened .   rincewind couldn   t help noticing that the hand holding the wand was shaking  this was because a piece of sudden death  wobbling uncertainly a mere five feet from your nose  is very hard to miss .  it dawned on him   very slowly  because it was a completely new sensation   that someone in the world was frightened of him .  the complete reverse was so often the case that he had come to think of it as a kind of natural law .      what is your name .     he said  as reassuringly as he could manage .  she might be frightened  but she did have the wand .  if i had a wand like that  he thought  i wouldn   t be frightened of anything .  so what in creation can she imagine i could do .      my name is immaterial     she said .      that   s a pretty name     said rincewind .     where are you taking us  and why .  i can   t see any harm in your telling us .         you are being brought to krull     said the girl .     and don   t mock me  hublander .  else i   ll use the wand .  i must bring you in alive  but no one said anything about bringing you in whole .  my name is marchesa  and i am a wizard of the fifth level .  do you understand .         well  since you know all about me then you know that i never even made it to neophyte     said rincewind .     i   m not even a wizard  really .     he caught twoflower   s astonished expression  and added hastily     just a wizard of sorts .         you can   t do magic because one of the eight great spells is indelibly lodged in your mind     said marchesa  shifting her balance gracefully as the great lens described a wide arc over the sea .     that   s why you were thrown out of unseen university .  we know .         but you said just now that he was a magician of great cunning and artifice     protested twoflower .      yes  because anyone who survives all that he has survived   most of which was brought on himself by his tendency to think of himself as a wizard   well  he must be some kind of a magician     said marchesa .     i warn you  rincewind .  if you give me the merest suspicion that you are intoning the great spell i really will kill you .     she scowled at him nervously .      seems to me your best course would be to just  you know  drop us off somewhere     said rincewind .     i mean  thanks for rescuing us and everything  so if you   d just let us get on with leading our lives i   m sure we   d all           i hope you   re not proposing to enslave us     said twoflower .   marchesa looked genuinely shocked .     certainly not .  whatever could have given you that idea .  your lives in krull will be rich  full and comfortable           oh  good     said rincewind .         just not very long .         krull turned out to be a large island  quite mountainous and heavily wooded  with pleasant white buildings visible here and there among the trees .  the land sloped gradually up toward the rim  so that the highest point in krull in fact slightly overhung the edge .  here the krullians had built their major city  also called krull  and since so much of their building material had been salvaged from the circumfence the houses of krull had a decidedly nautical persuasion .   to put it bluntly  entire ships had been mortised artfully together and converted into buildings .  triremes  dhows and caravels protruded at strange angles from the general wooden chaos .  painted figureheads and hublandish dragonprows reminded the citizens of krull that their good fortune stemmed from the sea  barquentines and carracks lent a distinctive shape to the larger buildings .  and so the city rose tier on tier between the blue green ocean of the disc and the soft cloud sea of the edge  the eight colors of the rimbow reflected in every window and in the many telescope lenses of the city   s multitude of astronomers .      it   s absolutely awful     said rincewind gloomily .   the lens was approaching now along the very lip of the rimfall .  the island not only got higher as it neared the edge .  it got narrower  too  so that the lens was able to remain over water until it was very near the city .  the parapet along the edgewise cliff was dotted with gantries projecting into nothingness .  the lens glided smoothly toward one of them and docked with it as smoothly as a boat might glide up to a quay .  four guards  with the same moonlight hair and nightblack faces as marchesa  were waiting .  they did not appear to be armed  but as twoflower and rincewind stumbled onto the parapet they were each grabbed by the arms and held quite firmly enough for any thought of escape to be instantly dismissed .   then marchesa and the watching hydrophobic wizards were quickly left behind and the guards and their prisoners set off briskly along a lane that wound between the ship houses .  soon it led downward  into what turned out to be a palace of some sort  half hewn out of the rock of the cliff itself .  rincewind was vaguely aware of brightly lit tunnels  and courtyards open to the distant sky .  a few elderly men  their robes covered in mysterious occult symbols  stood aside and watched with interest as the sextet passed .  several times rincewind noticed hydrophobes   their ingrained expressions of self revulsion at their own body fluids was distinctive   and here and there trudging men who could only be slaves .  he didn   t have much time to reflect on all this before a door was opened ahead of them and they were pushed  gently but firmly  into a room .  then the door slammed behind them .   rincewind and twoflower regained their balance and stared around the room in which they now found themselves .      gosh     said twoflower ineffectually  after a pause during which he had tried unsuccessfully to find a better word .      this is a prison cell .     wondered rincewind aloud .      all that gold and silk and stuff     twoflower added .     i   ve never seen anything like it .      in the center of the richly decorated room  on a carpet that was so deep and furry that rincewind trod on it gingerly lest it be some kind of shaggy  floor loving beast  was a long gleaming table laden with food .  most were fish dishes  including the biggest and most ornately prepared lobster rincewind had ever seen  but there were also plenty of bowls and platters piled with strange creations that he had never seen before .  he reached out cautiously and picked up some sort of purple fruit crusted with green crystals .      candied sea urchin     said a cracked  cheerful voice behind him .     a great delicacy .      he dropped it quickly and turned around .  an old man had stepped out from behind the heavy curtains .  he was tall  thin and looked almost benign compared to some of the faces rincewind had seen recently .      the pur  e of sea cucumbers is very good  too     said the face  conversationally .     those little green bits are baby starfish .         thank you for telling me     said rincewind weakly .      actually  they   re rather good     said twoflower  his mouth full .     i thought you liked seafood .         yes  i thought i did     said rincewind .     what   s this wine   crushed octopus eyeballs .         sea grape     said the old man .      great     said rincewind  and swallowed a glassful .     not bad .  a bit salty  maybe .         sea grape is a kind of small jellyfish     explained the stranger .     and now i really think i should introduce myself .  why has your friend gone that strange color .         culture shock  i imagine     said twoflower .     what did you say your name was .         i didn   t .  it   s garhartra .  i   m the guestmaster  you see .  it is my pleasant task to make sure that your stay here is as delightful as possible .     he bowed .     if there is anything you want you have only to say .      twoflower sat down on an ornate mother of pearl chair with a glass of oily wine in one hand and a crystallized squid in the other .  he frowned .      i think i   ve missed something along the way     he said .     first we were told we were going to be slaves           a base canard .     interrupted garhartra .      what   s a canard .     said twoflower .      i think it   s a kind of duck     said rincewind from the far end of the long table .     are these biscuits made of something really nauseating  do you suppose .            and then we were rescued at great magical expense           they   re made of pressed seaweed     snapped the guestmaster .         but then we   re threatened  also at a vast expenditure of magic           yes  i thought it would be something like seaweed     agreed rincewind .     they certainly taste like seaweed would taste if anyone was masochistic enough to eat seaweed .            and then we   re manhandled by guards and thrown in here           pushed gently     corrected garhartra .         which turned out to be this amazingly rich room and there   s all this food and a man saying he   s devoting his life to making us happy     twoflower concluded .     what i   m getting at is this sort of lack of consistency .         yar     said rincewind .     what he means is  are you about to start being generally unpleasant again .  is this just a break for lunch .      garhartra held up his hands reassuringly .      please  please     he protested .     it was just necessary to get you here as soon as possible .  we certainly do not want to enslave you .  please be reassured on that score .         well  fine     said rincewind .      yes  you will in fact be sacrificed     garhartra continued placidly .      sacrificed .  you   re going to kill us .     shouted the wizard .      kill .  yes  of course .  certainly .  it would hardly be a sacrifice if we didn   t  would it .  but don   t worry   it   ll be comparatively painless .         comparatively .  compared to what .     said rincewind .  he picked up a tall green bottle that was full of sea grape jellyfish wine and hurled it hard at the guestmaster  who flung up a hand as if to protect himself .   there was a crackle of octarine flame from his fingers and the air suddenly took on the thick  greasy feel that indicated a powerful magical discharge .  the flung bottle slowed and then stopped in midair  rotating gently .   at the same time an invisible force picked rincewind up and hurled him down the length of the room  pinning him awkwardly halfway up the far wall with no breath left in his body .  he hung there with his mouth open in rage and astonishment .   garhartra lowered his hand and brushed it slowly on his robe .      i didn   t enjoy doing that  you know     he said .      i could tell     muttered rincewind .      but what do you want to sacrifice us for .     asked twoflower .     you hardly know us .         that   s rather the point  isn   t it .  it   s not very good manners to sacrifice a friend .  besides  you were  um  specified .  i don   t know a lot about the god in question  but he was quite clear on that point .  look  i must be running along now .  so much to organize  you know how it is     the guestmaster opened the door  and then peered back around it .     please make yourselves comfortable  and don   t worry .         but you haven   t actually told us anything .     wailed twoflower .      it   s not really worth it  is it .  what with you being sacrificed in the morning     said garhartra     it   s hardly worth the bother of knowing  really .  sleep well .  comparatively well  anyway .      he shut the door .  a brief octarine flicker of balefire around it suggested that it had now been sealed beyond the skills of any earthly locksmith .      gling  clang  tang went the bells along the circumfence in the moonlit  rimfall roaring night .   terton  lengthman of the   th length  hadn   t heard such a clashing since the night a giant kraken had been swept into the fence five years ago .  he leaned out of his hut  which for the lack of any convenient eyot on this length had been built on wooden piles driven into the seabed  and stared into the darkness .  once or twice he thought he could see movement  far off .  strictly speaking  he should row out to see what was causing the din .  but here in the clammy darkness it didn   t seem like an astoundingly good idea  so he slammed the door  wrapped some sacking around the madly jangling bells  and tried to get back to sleep .   that didn   t work  because even the top strand of the fence was thrumming now  as if something big and heavy was bouncing on it .  after staring at the ceiling for a few minutes  and trying hard not to think of great long tentacles and pond sized eyes  terton blew out the lantern and opened the door a crack .   something was coming along the fence  in giant loping bounds that covered meters at a time .  it loomed up at him and for a moment terton saw something rectangular  multilegged  shaggy with seaweed and   although it had absolutely no features from which he could have deduced this   it was also very angry indeed .   the hut was smashed to fragments as the monster charged through it  although terton survived by clinging to the circumfence  some weeks later he was picked up by a returning salvage fleet  subsequently escaped from krull on a hijacked lens  having developed hydrophobia to an astonishing degree  and after a number of adventures eventually found his way to the great nef  an area of the disc so dry that it actually has negative rainfall  which he nevertheless considered uncomfortably damp .         have you tried the door .         yes     said twoflower .     and it isn   t any less locked than it was last time you asked .  there   s the window  though .         a great way of escape     muttered rincewind  from his perch halfway up the wall .     you said it looks out over the edge .  just step out  eh  and plunge through space and maybe freeze solid or hit some other world at incredible speeds or plunge wildly into the burning heart of a sun .         worth a try     said twoflower .     want a seaweed biscuit .         no .         when are you coming down .      rincewind snarled .  this was partly in embarrassment .  garhartra   s spell had been the little used and hard to master atavarr   s personal gravitational upset  the practical result of which was that until it wore off rincewind   s body was convinced that    down    lay at ninety degrees to that direction normally accepted as of a downward persuasion by the majority of the disc   s inhabitants .  he was in fact standing on the wall .   meanwhile the flung bottle hung supportless in the air a few yards away .  in its case time had   well  not actually been stopped  but had been slowed by several orders of magnitude  and its trajectory had so far occupied several hours and a couple of inches as far as twoflower and rincewind were concerned .  the glass gleamed in the moonlight .  rincewind sighed and tried to make himself comfortable on the wall .      why don   t you ever worry .     he demanded petulantly .     here we are  going to be sacrificed to some god or other in the morning  and you just sit there eating barnacle canap  s .         i expect something will turn up     said twoflower .      i mean  it   s not as if we know why we   re going to be killed     the wizard went on .   you   d like to  would you .      did you say that .     asked rincewind .      say what .      you   re hearing things said the voice in rincewind   s head .   he sat bolt sideways .     who are you .     he demanded .   twoflower gave him a worried look .      i   m twoflower     he said .     surely you remember .      rincewind put his head in his hands .      it   s happened at last     he moaned .     i   m going out of my mind .      good idea said the voice .  it   s getting pretty crowded in here  the spell pinning rincewind to the wall vanished with a faint    pop .     he fell forward and landed in a heap on the floor .   careful   you nearly squashed me  rincewind struggled to his elbows and reached into the pocket of his robe .  when he withdrew his hand the green frog was sitting on it  its eyes oddly luminous in the half light .      you .     said rincewind .   put me down on the floor and stand back the frog blinked .   the wizard did so  and dragged a bewildered twoflower out of the way .   the room darkened .  there was a windy  roaring sound .  streamers of green  purple and octarine cloud appeared out of nowhere and began to spiral rapidly toward the recumbent amphibian  shedding small bolts of lightning as they whirled .  soon the frog was lost in a golden haze which began to elongate upward  filling the room with a warm yellow light .  within it was a darker  indistinct shape  which wavered and changed even as they watched .  and all the time there was the high  brain curdling whine of a huge magical field     as suddenly as it had appeared  the magical tornado vanished .  and there  occupying the space where the frog had been  was a frog .      fantastic     said rincewind .   the frog gazed at him reproachfully .      really amazing     said rincewind sourly .     a frog magically transformed into a frog .  wondrous .         turn around     said a voice behind them .  it was a soft  feminine voice  almost an inviting voice  the sort of voice you could have a few drinks with  but it was coming from a spot where there oughtn   t to be a voice at all .  they managed to turn without really moving  like a couple of statues revolving on plinths .   there was a woman standing in the pre dawn light .  she looked   she was   she had a   in point of actual fact she     later rincewind and twoflower couldn   t quite agree on any single fact about her  except that she had appeared to be beautiful  precisely what physical features made her beautiful they could not  definitively  state  and that she had green eyes .  not the pale green of ordinary eyes  either   these were the green of fresh emeralds and as iridescent as a dragonfly .  and one of the few genuinely magical facts that rincewind knew was that no god or goddess  contrary and volatile as they might be in all other respects  could change the color or nature of their eyes        l       he began .  she raised a hand .      you know that if you say my name i must depart     she hissed .     surely you recall that i am the one goddess who comes only when not invoked .         uh .  yes  i suppose i do     croaked the wizard  trying not to look at the eyes .     you   re the one they call the lady .         yes .         are you a goddess then .     said twoflower excitedly .     i   ve always wanted to meet one .      rincewind tensed  waiting for the explosion of rage .  instead  the lady merely smiled .      your friend the wizard should introduce us     she said .   rincewind coughed .     uh  yar     he said .     this is twoflower  lady  he   s a tourist              i have attended him on a number of occasions              and  twoflower  this is the lady .  just the lady  right .  nothing else .  don   t try and give her any other name  okay .     he went on desperately  his eyes darting meaningful glances that were totally lost on the little man .   rincewind shivered .  he was not  of course  an atheist  on the disc the gods dealt severely with atheists .  on the few occasions when he had some spare change he had always made a point of dropping a few coppers into a temple coffer  somewhere  on the principle that a man needed all the friends he could get .  but usually he didn   t bother the gods  and he hoped the gods wouldn   t bother him .  life was quite complicated enough .   there were two gods  however  who were really terrifying .  the rest of the gods were usually only sort of large scale humans  fond of wine and war and whoring .  but fate and the lady were chilling .   in the gods    quarter  in ankh morpork  fate had a small  heavy  leaden temple  where hollow eyed and gaunt worshippers met on dark nights for their predestined and fairly pointless rites .  there were no temples at all to the lady  although she was arguably the most powerful goddess in the entire history of creation .  a few of the more daring members of the gamblers    guild had once experimented with a form of worship  in the deepest cellars of guild headquarters  and had all died of penury  murder or just death within the week .  she was the goddess who must not be named  those who sought her never found her  yet she was known to come to the aid of those in greatest need .  and  then again  sometimes she didn   t .  she was like that .  she didn   t like the clicking of rosaries  but was attracted to the sound of dice .  no man knew what she looked like  although there were many times when a man who was gambling his life on the turn of the cards would pick up the hand he had been dealt and stare her full in the face .  of course  sometimes he didn   t .  among all the gods she was at one and the same time the most courted and the most cursed .      we don   t have gods where i come from     said two flower .      you do  you know     said the lady .     everyone has gods .  you just don   t think they   re gods .      rincewind shook himself mentally .      look     he said .     i don   t want to sound impatient  but in a few minutes some people are going to come through that door and take us away and kill us .         yes     said the lady .      i suppose you wouldn   t tell us why .     said twoflower .      yes     said the lady .     the krullians intend to launch a bronze vessel over the edge of the disc .  their prime purpose is to learn the sex of a   tuin the world turtle .         seems rather pointless     said rincewind .      no .  consider .  one day great a   tuin may encounter another member of the species chelys galactica  somewhere in the vast night in which we move .  will they fight .  will they mate .  a little imagination will show you that the sex of great a   tuin could be very important to us .  at least  so the krullians say .      rincewind tried not to think of world turtles mating .  it wasn   t completely easy .      so     continued the goddess     they intend to launch this ship of space  with two voyagers aboard .  it will be the culmination of decades of research .  it will also be very dangerous for the travelers .  and so  in an attempt to reduce the risks  the arch astronomer of krull has bargained with fate to sacrifice two men at the moment of launch .  fate  in his turn  has agreed to smile on the space ship .  a neat barter  is it not .         and we   re the sacrifices     said rincewind .      yes .         i thought fate didn   t go in for that sort of bargaining .  i thought fate was implaccable     said rincewind .      normally  yes .  but you two have been thorns in his side for some time .  he specified that the sacrifices should be you .  he allowed you to escape from the pirates .  he allowed you to drift into the circumfence .  fate can be one mean god at times .      there was a pause .  the frog sighed and wandered off under the table .      but you can help us .     prompted twoflower .      you amuse me     said the lady .     i have a sentimental streak .  you   d know that  if you were gamblers .  so for a little while i rode in a frog   s mind and you kindly rescued me  for  as we all know  no one likes to see pathetic and helpless creatures swept to their death .         thank you     said rincewind .      the whole mind of fate is bent against you     said the lady .     but all i can do is give you one chance .  just one  small chance .  the rest is up to you .      she vanished .      gosh     said twoflower  after a while .     that   s the first time i   ve ever seen a goddess .      the door swung open .  garhartra entered  holding a wand in front of him .  behind him were two guards  armed more conventionally with swords .      ah     he said conversationally .     you are ready  i see .      ready said a voice inside rincewind   s head .   the bottle that the wizard had flung some eight hours earlier had been hanging in the air  imprisoned by magic in its own personal time field .  but during all those hours the original mana of the spell had been slowly leaking away until the total magical energy was no longer sufficient to hold it against the universe   s own powerful normality field  and when that happened reality snapped back in a matter of microseconds .  the visible sign of this was that the bottle suddenly completed the last part of its parabola and burst against the side of the guestmaster   s head  showering the guards with glass and jellyfish wine .   rincewind grabbed twoflower   s arm  kicked the nearest guard in the groin  and dragged the startled tourist into the corridor .  before the stunned garhartra had sunk to the floor his two guests were already pounding across distant flagstones .   rincewind skidded around a corner and found himself on a balcony that ran around the four sides of a courtyard .  below them  most of the floor of the yard was taken up by an ornamental pond in which a few terrapins sunbathed among the lily leaves .   and ahead of rincewind were a couple of very surprised wizards wearing the distinctive dark blue and black robes of trained hydrophobes .  one of them  quicker on the uptake than his companion  raised a hand and began the first words of a spell .   there was a short sharp noise by rincewind   s side .  twoflower had spat .  the hydrophobe screamed and dropped his hand as though it had been stung .   the other didn   t have time to move before rincewind was on him  fists swinging wildly .  one stiff punch with the weight of terror behind it sent the man tumbling over the balcony rail and into the pond  which did a very strange thing  the water smacked aside as though a large invisible balloon had been dropped into it  and the hydrophobe hung screaming in his own revulsion field .   twoflower watched him in amazement until rincewind snatched at his shoulder and indicated a likely looking passage .  they hurried down it  leaving the remaining hydrophobe writhing on the floor and snatching at his damp hand .   for a while there was some shouting behind them  but they scuttled along a cross corridor and another courtyard and soon left the sounds of pursuit behind .  finally rincewind picked a safe looking door  peered around it  found the room beyond to be unoccupied  dragged twoflower inside  and slammed it behind him .  then he leaned against it  wheezing horribly .      we   re totally lost in a palace on an island we haven   t a hope of leaving     he panted .     and what   s more we   hey .     he finished  as the sight of the contents of the room filtered up his deranged optic nerves .   twoflower was already staring at the walls .   because what was so odd about the room was  it contained the whole universe .      death sat in his garden  running a whetstone along the edge of his scythe .  it was already so sharp that any passing breeze that blew across it was sliced smoothly into two puzzled zephyrs  although breezes were rare indeed in death   s silent garden .  it lay on a sheltered plateau overlooking the discworld   s complex dimensions  and behind it loomed the cold  still  immensely high and brooding mountains of eternity .   swish .  went the stone .  death hummed a dirge  and tapped one bony foot on the frosty flagstones .   someone approached through the dim orchard where the nightapples grew  and there came the sickly sweet smell of crushed lilies .  death looked up angrily  and found himself staring into eyes that were black as the inside of a cat and full of distant stars that had no counterpart among the familiar constellations of the realtime universe .   death and fate looked at each other .  death grinned   he had no alternative  of course  being made of implaccable bone .  the whetstone sang rhythmically along the blade as he continued his task .      i have a task for you     said fate .  his words drifted across death   s scythe and split tidily into two ribbons of consonants and vowels .   i have tasks enough this day  said death in a voice as heavy as neutronium .  the white plague abides even now in pseudopolis and i am bound there to rescue many of its citizens from his grasp .  such a one has not been seen these hundred years .  i am expected to stalk the streets  as is my duty .      i refer to the matter of the little wanderer and the rogue wizard     said fate softly  seating himself beside death   s black robed form and staring down at the distant  multifaceted jewel which was the disc universe as seen from this extra dimensional vantage point .   the scythe ceased its song .      they die in a few hours     said fate .     it is fated .      death stirred  and the stone began to move again .      i thought you would be pleased     said fate .   death shrugged  a particularly expressive gesture for someone whose visible shape was that of a skeleton .   i did indeed chase them mightily  once  he said  but at last the thought came to me that sooner or later all men must die .  everything dies in the end .  i can be robbed but never denied  i told myself .  why worry .      i too cannot be cheated     snapped fate .   so i have heard  said death  still grinning .      enough .     shouted fate  jumping to his feet .     they will die .     he vanished in a sheet of blue fire .   death nodded to himself and continued at his work .  after some minutes the edge of the blade seemed to be finished to his satisfaction .  he stood up and leveled the scythe at the fat and noisome candle that burned on the edge of the bench and then  with two deft sweeps  cut the flame into three bright slivers .  death grinned .   a short while later he was saddling his white stallion  which lived in a stable at the back of death   s cottage .  the beast snuffled at him in a friendly fashion  though it was crimson eyed and had flanks like oiled silk  it was nevertheless a real flesh and blood horse and  indeed  was in all probability better treated than most beasts of burden on the disc .  death was not an unkind master .  he weighed very little and  although he often rode back with his saddlebags bulging  they weighed nothing whatsoever .         all those worlds .     said twoflower .     it   s fantastic .      rincewind grunted  and continued to prowl warily around the star filled room .  twoflower turned to a complicated astrolabe  in the center of which was the entire great a   tuin elephant disc system wrought in brass and picked out with tiny jewels .  around it stars and planets wheeled on fine silver wires .      fantastic .     he said again .  on the walls around him constellations made of tiny phosphorescent seed pearls had been picked out on vast tapestries made of jet black velvet  giving the room   s occupants the impression of floating in the interstellar gulf .  various easels held huge sketches of great a   tuin as viewed from various parts of the circumfence  with every mighty scale and cratered pock mark meticulously marked in .  twoflower stared about him with a faraway look in his eyes .   rincewind was deeply troubled .  what troubled him most of all were the two suits that hung from supports in the center of the room .  he circled them uneasily .   they appeared to be made of fine white leather  hung about with straps and brass nozzles and other highly unfamiliar and suspicious contrivances .  the leggings ended in high  thick soled boots  and the arms were shoved into big supple gauntlets .  strangest of all were the big copper helmets that were obviously supposed to fit on heavy collars around the neck of the suits .  the helmets were almost certainly useless for protection   a light sword would have no difficulty in splitting them  even if it didn   t hit the ridiculous little glass windows in the front .  each helmet had a crest of white feathers on top  which went absolutely no way at all toward improving their overall appearance .   rincewind was beginning to have the glimmerings of a suspicion about those suits .   in front of them was a table covered with celestial charts and scraps of parchment covered with figures .  whoever would be wearing those suits  rincewind decided  was expecting to boldly go where no man   other than the occasional luckless sailor  who didn   t really count   had boldly gone before  and he was now beginning to get not just a suspicion but a horrible premonition .   he turned around and found twoflower looking at him with a speculative expression .      no       began rincewind  urgently .  twoflower ignored him .      the goddess said two men were going to be sent over the edge     he said  his eyes gleaming     and you remember tethis the troll saying you   d need some kind of protection .  the krullians have got over that .  these are suits of space armor .         they don   t look very roomy to me     said rincewind hurriedly  and grabbed the tourist by the arm     so if you   d just come on  no sense in staying here           why must you always panic .     asked twoflower petulantly .      because the whole of my future life just flashed in front of my eyes  and it didn   t take very long  and if you don   t move now i   m going to leave without you because any second now you   re going to suggest that we put on        the door opened .   two husky young men stepped into the room .  all they were wearing was a pair of woolen pants apiece .  one of them was still toweling himself briskly .  they both nodded at the two escapees with no apparent surprise .   the taller of the two men sat down on one of the benches in front of the seats .  he beckoned to rincewind  and said       . ty   yur   tl h   sooten g  trunen .      and this was awkward  because although rincewind considered himself an expert in most of the tongues of the western segments of the disc it was the first time that he had ever been addressed in krullian  and he did not understand one word of it .  neither did twoflower  but that did not stop him stepping forward and taking a breath .   the speed of light through a magical aura such as the one that surrounded the disc was quite slow  being not much faster than the speed of sound in less highly tuned universes .  but it was still the fastest thing around with the exception  in moments like this  of rincewind   s mind .   in an instant he became aware that the tourist was about to try his own peculiar brand of linguistics  which meant that he would speak loudly and slowly in his own language .   rincewind   s elbow shot back  knocking the breath from twoflower   s body .  when the little man looked up in pain and astonishment rincewind caught his eye and pulled an imaginary tongue out of his mouth and cut it with an imaginary pair of scissors .   the second chelonaut   for such was the profession of the men whose fate it would shortly be to voyage to great a   tuin   looked up from the chart table and watched this in puzzlement .  his big heroic brow wrinkled with the effort of speech .       . h  r yu latruin n  r    .     he said .   rincewind smiled and nodded and pushed twoflower in his general direction .  with an inward sigh of relief he saw the tourist pay sudden attention to a big brass telescope that lay on the table .       .  sooten    .     commanded the seated chelonaut .  rincewind nodded and smiled and took one of the big copper helmets from the rack and brought it down on the man   s head as hard as he possibly could .  the chelonaut fell forward with a soft grunt .   the other man took one startled step before twoflower hit him amateurishly but effectively with the telescope .  he crumpled on top of his colleague .   rincewind and twoflower looked at each other over the carnage .      all right .     snapped rincewind  aware that he had lost some kind of contest but not entirely certain what it was .     don   t bother to say it .  someone out there is expecting these two guys to come out in the suits in a minute .  i suppose they thought we were slaves .  help me hide these behind the drapes and then  and then              we   d better suit up     said twoflower  picking up the second helmet .      yes     said rincewind .     you know  as soon as i saw the suits i just knew i   d end up wearing one .  don   t ask me how i knew   i suppose it was because it was just about the worst possible thing that was likely to happen .         well  you said yourself we have no way of escaping     said twoflower  his voice muffled as he pulled the top half of a suit over his head .     anything   s better than being sacrificed .         as soon as we get a chance we run for it     said rincewind .     don   t get any ideas .      he thrust an arm savagely into his suit and banged his head on the helmet .  he reflected briefly that someone up there was watching over him .      thanks a lot     he said bitterly .      at the very edge of the city and country of krull was a large semicircular amphitheater  with seating for several tens of thousands of people .  the arena was only semicircular for the very elegant reason that it overlooked the cloud sea that boiled up from the rimfall  far below  and now every seat was occupied .  and the crowd was growing restive .  it had come to see a double sacrifice and also the launching of the great bronze space ship .  neither event had yet materialized .   the arch astronomer beckoned the master launchcontroller to him .      well .     he said  filling a mere four letters with a full lexicon of anger and menace .  the master launchcontroller went pale .      no news  lord     said the launchcontroller  and added with a brittle brightness     except that your prominence will be pleased to hear that garhartra has recovered .         that is a fact he may come to regret     said the arch astronomer .      yes  lord .         how much longer do we have .      the launchcontroller glanced at the rapidly climbing sun .      thirty minutes  your prominence .  after that krull will have revolved away from great a   tuin   s tail and the potent voyager will be doomed to spin away into the interterrapene gulf .  i have already set the automatic controls  so           all right  all right     the arch astronomer said  waving him away .     the launch must go ahead .  maintain the watch on the harbor  of course .  when the wretched pair are caught i will personally take a great deal of pleasure in executing them myself .         yes  lord .  er        the arch astronomer frowned .     what else have you got to say  man .      the launchcontroller swallowed .  all this was very unfair on him  he was a practical magician rather than a diplomat  and that was why some wiser brains had seen to it that he would be the one to pass on the news .      a monster has come out of the sea and it   s attacking the ships in the harbor     he said .     a runner just arrived from there .         a big monster .     said the arch astronomer .      not particularly  although it is said to be exceptionally fierce  lord .      the ruler of krull and the circumfence considered this for a moment  then shrugged .      the sea is full of monsters     he said .     it is one of its prime attributes .  have it dealt with .  and   master launchcontroller .         lord .         if i am further vexed  you will recall that two people are due to be sacrificed .  i may feel generous and increase the number .         yes  lord .     the master launchcontroller scuttled away  relieved to be out of the autocrat   s sight .   the potent voyager  no longer the blank bronze shell that had been smashed from the mold a few days earlier  rested in its cradle on top of a wooden tower in the center of the arena .  in front of it a railway ran down toward the edge  where for the space of a few yards it turned suddenly upward .   the late dactylos goldeneyes  who had designed the launching pad as well as the potent voyager itself  had claimed that this last touch was merely to ensure that the ship would not snag on any rocks as it began its long plunge .  maybe it was merely coincidental that it would also  because of that little twitch in the track  leap like a salmon and shine theatrically in the sunlight before disappearing into the cloud sea .   there was a fanfare of trumpets at the edge of the arena .  the chelonauts    honor guard appeared  to much cheering from the crowd .  then the white suited explorers themselves stepped out into the light .   it immediately dawned on the arch astronomer that something was wrong .  heroes always walked in a certain way  for example .  they certainly didn   t waddle  and one of the chelonauts was definitely waddling .   the roar of the assembled people of krull was deafening .  as the chelonauts and their guards crossed the great arena  passing between the many altars that had been set up for the various wizards and priests of krull   s many sects to ensure the success of the launch  the arch astronomer frowned .  by the time the party was halfway across the floor his mind had reached a conclusion .  by the time the chelonauts were standing at the foot of the ladder that led to the ship   and was there more than a hint of reluctance about them .    the arch astronomer was on his feet  his words lost in the noise of the crowd .  one of his arms shot out and back  fingers spread dramatically in the traditional spell casting position  and any passing lip reader who was also familiar with the standard texts on magic would have recognized the opening words of vestcake   s floating curse  and would then have prudently run away .   its final words remained unsaid  however .  the arch astronomer turned in astonishment as a commotion broke out around the big arched entrance to the arena .  guards were running out into the daylight  throwing down their weapons as they scuttled among the altars or vaulted the parapet into the stands .   something emerged behind them  and the crowd around the entrance ceased its raucous cheering and began a silent  determined scramble to get out of the way .   the something was a low dome of seaweed  moving slowly but with a sinister sense of purpose .  one guard overcame his horror sufficiently to stand in its path and hurl his spear  which landed squarely among the weeds .  the crowd cheered   then went deathly silent as the dome surged forward and engulfed the man completely .   the arch astronomer dismissed the half formed shape of vestcake   s famous curse with a sharp wave of his hand  and quickly spoke the words of one of the most powerful spells in his repertoire  the infernal combustion enigma .   octarine fire spiraled around and between his fingers as he shaped the complex rune of the spell in midair and sent it  screaming and trailing blue smoke  toward the shape .   there was a satisfying explosion and a gout of flame shot up into the clear morning sky  shedding flakes of burning seaweed on the way .  a cloud of smoke and steam concealed the monster for several minutes  and when it cleared the dome had completely disappeared .   there was a large charred circle on the flagstones  however  in which a few clumps of kelp and bladderwrack still smoldered .   and in the center of the circle was a perfectly ordinary  if somewhat large  wooden chest .  it was not even scorched .  someone on the far side of the arena started to laugh  but the sound was broken off abruptly as the chest rose up on dozens of what could only be legs and turned to face the arch astronomer .  a perfectly ordinary if somewhat large wooden chest does not  of course  have a face with which to face  but this one was quite definitely facing .  in precisely the same way as he understood that  the arch astronomer was also horribly aware that this perfectly normal box was in some indescribable way narrowing its eyes .   it began to move resolutely toward him .  he shuddered .      magicians .     he screamed .     where are my magicians .      around the arena pale faced men peeped out from behind altars and under benches .  one of the bolder ones  seeing the expression on the arch astronomer   s face  raised an arm tremulously and essayed a hasty thunderbolt .  it hissed toward the chest and struck it squarely in a shower of white sparks .   that was the signal for every magician  enchanter and thaumaturgist in krull to leap up eagerly and  under the terrified eyes of their master  unleash the first spell that came to each desperate mind .  charms curved and whistled through the air .   soon the chest was lost to view again in an expanding cloud of magical particles  which billowed out and wreathed it in twisting  disquieting shapes .  spell after spell screamed into the melee .  flame and lightning bolts of all eight colors stabbed out brightly from the seething thing that now occupied the space where the box had been .   not since the mage wars had so much magic been concentrated on one small area .  the air itself wavered and glittered .  spell ricocheted off spell  creating short lived wild spells whose brief half life was both weird and uncontrolled .  the stones under the heaving mass began to buckle and split .  one of them in fact turned into something best left undescribed and slunk off into some dismal dimension .  other strange side effects began to manifest themselves .  a shower of small lead cubes bounced out of the storm and rolled across the heaving floor  and eldritch shapes gibbered and beckoned obscenely  four sided triangles and double ended circles existed momentarily before merging again into the booming  screaming tower of runaway raw magic that boiled up from the molten flagstones and spread out over krull .  it no longer mattered that most of the magicians had ceased their spell casting and fled   the thing was now feeding on the stream of octarine particles that were always at their thickest near the edge of the disc .  throughout the island of krull every magical activity failed as all the available mana in the area was sucked into the cloud  which was already a quarter of a mile high and streaming out into mind curdling shapes  hydrophobes on their sea skimming lenses crashed screaming into the waves  magic potions turned to mere impure water in their phials  magic swords melted and dripped from their scabbards .   but none of this in any way prevented the thing at the base of the cloud  now gleaming mirror bright in the intensity of the power storm around it  from moving at a steady walking pace toward the arch astronomer .      rincewind and twoflower watched in awe from the shelter of potent voyager   s launch tower .  the honor party had long since vanished  leaving their weapons scattered behind them .      well     sighed twoflower at last     there goes the luggage .     he sighed .      don   t you believe it     said rincewind .     sapient pearwood is totally impervious to all known forms of magic .  it   s been constructed to follow you anywhere .  i mean  when you die  if you go to heaven  you   ll at least have a clean pair of socks in the afterlife .  but i don   t want to die yet  so let   s just get going  shall we .         where .     said twoflower .   rincewind picked up a crossbow and a handful of quarrels .     anywhere that isn   t here     he said .      what about the luggage .         don   t worry .  when the storm has used up all the free magic in the vicinity it   ll just die out .      in fact that was already beginning to happen .  the billowing cloud was still flowing up from the area but now it had a tenuous  harmless look about it .  even as twoflower stared  it began to flicker uncertainly .   soon it was a pale ghost .  the luggage was now visible as a squat shape among the almost invisible flames .  around it the rapidly cooling stones began to crack and buckle .   twoflower called softly to his luggage .  it stopped its stolid progression across the tortured flags and appeared to be listening intently  then  moving its dozens of feet in an intricate pattern  it turned on its length and headed toward the potent voyager .  rincewind watched it sourly .  the luggage had an elemental nature  absolutely no brain  a homicidal attitude toward anything that threatened its master  and he wasn   t quite sure that its inside occupied the same space time framework as its outside .      not a mark on it     said twoflower cheerfully  as the box settled down in front of him .  he pushed open the lid .      this is a fine time to change your underwear     snarled rincewind .     in a minute all those guards and priests are going to come back  and they   re going to be upset  man .         water     murmured twoflower .     the whole box is full of water .      rincewind peered over his shoulder .  there was no sign of clothes  moneybags  or any other of the tourist   s belongings .  the whole box was full of water .   a wave sprang up from nowhere and lapped over the edge .  it hit the flagstones but  instead of spreading out  began to take the shape of a foot .  another foot and the bottom half of a pair of legs followed as more water streamed down as if filling an invisible mold .  a moment later tethis the sea troll was standing in front of them  blinking .      i see     he said at last .     you two .  i suppose i shouldn   t be surprised .      he looked around  ignoring their astonished expressions .      i was just sitting outside my hut  watching the sun set  when this thing came roaring up out of the water and swallowed me     he said .     i thought it was rather strange .  where is this place .         krull     said rincewind .  he stared hard at the now closed luggage  which was managing to project a smug expression .  swallowing people was something it did quite frequently  but always when the lid was next opened there was nothing inside but twoflower   s laundry .  savagely he wrenched the lid up .  there was nothing inside but twoflower   s laundry .  it was perfectly dry .      well  well     said tethis .  he looked up .      hey .     he said .     isn   t this the ship they   re going to send over the edge .  isn   t it .  it must be .      an arrow zipped through his chest  leaving a faint ripple .  he didn   t appear to notice .  rincewind did .  soldiers were beginning to appear at the edge of the arena  and a number of them were peering around the entrances .   another arrow bounced off the tower behind twoflower .  at this range the bolts did not have a lot of force  but it would only be a matter of time        quick .     said twoflower .     into the ship .  they won   t dare fire at that .         i knew you were going to suggest that     groaned rincewind .     i just knew it .      he aimed a kick at the luggage .  it backed off a few inches  and opened its lid threateningly .   a spear arced out of the sky and trembled to a halt in the woodwork by the wizard   s ear .  he screamed briefly and scrambled up the ladder after the others .   arrows whistled around them as they came out onto the narrow catwalk that led along the spine of the potent voyager .  twoflower led the way  jogging along with what rincewind considered to be too much suppressed excitement .   atop the center of the ship was a large round bronze hatch with hasps around it .  the troll and the tourist knelt down and started to work on them .   in the heart of the potent voyager fine sand had been trickling into a carefully designed cup for several hours .  now the cup was filled by exactly the right amount to dip down and upset a carefully balanced weight .  the weight swung away  pulling a pin from an intricate little mechanism .  a chain began to move .  there was a clonk        what was that .     said rincewind urgently .  he looked down .   the hail of arrows had stopped .  the crowd of priests and soldiers were standing motionless  staring intently at the ship .  a small worried man elbowed his way through them and started to shout something .      what was what .     said twoflower  busy with a wing nut .      i thought i heard something     said rincewind .     look     he said     we   ll threaten to damage the thing if they don   t let us go  right .  that   s all we   re going to do  right .         yah     said twoflower vaguely .  he sat back on his heels .     that   s it     he said .     it ought to lift off now .      several muscular men were swarming up the ladder to the ship .  rincewind recognized the two chelonauts among them .  they were carrying swords .      i       he began .   the ship lurched .  then  with infinite slowness  it began to move along the rails .   in that moment of black horror rincewind saw that twoflower and the troll had managed to pull the hatch up .  a metal ladder inside led into the cabin below .  the troll disappeared .      we   ve got to get off     whispered rincewind .  twoflower looked at him  a strange mad smile on his face .      stars     said the tourist .     worlds .  the whole damn sky full of worlds .  places no one will ever see .  except me .     he stepped through the hatchway .      you   re totally mad     said rincewind hoarsely  trying to keep his balance as the ship began to speed up .  he turned as one of the chelonauts tried to leap the gap between the voyager and the tower  landed on the curving flank of the ship  scrabbled for an instant for purchase  failed to find any  and dropped away with a shriek .   the voyager was traveling quite fast now .  rincewind could see past twoflower   s head to the sunlit cloud sea and the impossible rimbow  floating tantalizingly beyond it  beckoning fools to venture too far     he also saw a gang of men climbing desperately over the lower slopes of the launching ramp and manhandling a large bulk of timber onto the track  in a frantic attempt to derail the ship before it vanished over the edge .  the wheels slammed into it  but the only effect was to make the ship rock  twoflower to lose his grip on the ladder and fall into the cabin  and the hatch to slam down with the horrible sound of a dozen fiddly little catches snapping into place .  rincewind dived forward and scrabbled at them  whimpering .   the cloud sea was much nearer now .  the edge itself  a rocky perimeter to the arena  was startlingly close .   rincewind stood up .  there was only one thing to do now  and he did it .  he panicked blindly  just as the ship   s bogeys hit the little upgrade and flung it  sparkling like a salmon  into the sky and over the edge .   a few seconds later there was a thunder of little feet and the luggage cleared the rim of the world  legs still pumping determinedly  and plunged down into the universe .       the end  rincewind woke up and shivered .  he was freezing cold .   so this is it  he thought .  when you die you go to a cold  damp  misty freezing place .  hades  where the mournful spirits of the dead troop forever across the sorrowful marshes  corpse lights flickering fitfully in the encircling   hang on a minute     surely hades wasn   t this uncomfortable .  and he was very uncomfortable indeed .  his back ached where a branch was pressing into it  his legs and arms hurt where the twigs had lacerated them and  judging by the way his head was feeling  something hard had recently hit it .  if this was hades it sure was hell   hang on a minute     tree .  he concentrated on the word that floated up from his mind  although the buzzing in his ears and the flashing lights in front of his eyes made this an unexpected achievement .  tree .  wooden thing .  that was it .  branches and twigs and things .  and rincewind  lying in it .  tree .  dripping wet .  cold white cloud all around .  underneath  too .  now that was odd .   he was alive and lying covered in bruises in a small thorn tree that was growing in a crevice in a rock that projected out of the foaming white wall that was the rimfall .  the realization hit him in much the same way as an icy hammer .  he shuddered .  the tree gave a warning creak .   something blue and blurred shot past him  dipped briefly into the thundering waters  and whirred back and settled on a branch near rincewind   s head .  it was a small bird with a tuft of blue and green feathers .  it swallowed the little silver fish that it had snatched from the fall and eyed him curiously .   rincewind became aware that there were lots of similar birds around .   they hovered  darted and swooped easily across the face of the water  and every so often one would raise an extra plume of spray as it stole another doomed morsel from the waterfall .  several of them were perching in the tree .  they were as iridescent as jewels .  rincewind was entranced .   he was in fact the first man ever to see the rimfishers  the tiny creatures who had long ago evolved a lifestyle quite unique even for the disc .  long before the krullians had built the circumfence the rimfishers had devised their own efficient method of policing the edge of the world for a living .   they didn   t seem bothered about rincewind .  he had a brief but chilling vision of himself living the rest of his life out in this tree  subsisting on raw birds and such fish as he could snatch as they plummeted past .   the tree moved distinctly .  rincewind gave a whimper as he found himself sliding backward  but managed to grab a branch .  only  sooner or later  he would fall asleep     there was a subtle change of scene  a slight purplish tint to the sky .  a tall  black cloaked figure was standing on the air next to the tree .  it had a scythe in one hand .  its face was hidden in the shadows of the hood .   i have come for thee  said the invisible mouth  in tones as heavy as a whale   s heartbeat .   the trunk of the tree gave another protesting creak  and a pebble bounced off rincewind   s helmet as one root tore loose from the rock .   death himself always came in person to harvest the souls of wizards .      what am i going to die of .     said rincewind .   the tall figure hesitated .   pardon .  it said .      well  i haven   t broken anything  and i haven   t drowned  so what am i about to die of .  you can   t just be killed by death  there has to be a reason     said rincewind .  to his utter amazement he didn   t feel terrified anymore .  for about the first time in his life he wasn   t frightened .  pity the experience didn   t look like lasting for long .   death appeared to reach a conclusion .   you could die of terror  the hood intoned .  the voice still had its graveyard ring  but there was a slight tremor of uncertainty .      won   t work     said rincewind smugly .   there doesn   t have to be a reason  said death .  i can just kill you .      hey  you can   t do that .  it   d be murder .      the cowled figure sighed and pulled back its hood .  instead of the grinning death   s head that rincewind had been expecting he found himself looking up into the pale and slightly transparent face of a rather worried demon  of sorts .      i   m making rather a mess of this  aren   t i .     it said wearily .      you   re not death .  who are you .     cried rincewind .      scrofula .         scrofula .         death couldn   t come     said the demon wretchedly .     there   s a big plague on in pseudopolis .  he had to go and stalk the streets .  so he sent me .         no one dies of scrofula .  i   ve got rights .  i   m a wizard .         all right  all right .  this was going to be my big chance     said scrofula     but look at it this way   if i hit you with this scythe you   ll be just as dead as you would be if death had done it .  who   d know .         i   d know .     snapped rincewind .      you wouldn   t .  you   d be dead     said scrofula logically .      piss off     said rincewind .      that   s all very well     said the demon  hefting the scythe     but why not try to see things from my point of view .  this means a lot to me  and you   ve got to admit that your life isn   t all that wonderful .  reincarnation can only be an improvement   uh .      his hand flew to his mouth but rincewind was already pointing a trembling finger at him .      reincarnation .     he said excitedly .     so it is true what the mystics say .         i   m admitting nothing     said scrofula testily .     it was a slip of the tongue .  now   are you going to die willingly or not .         no     said rincewind .      please yourself     replied the demon .  he raised the scythe .  it whistled down in quite a professional way  but rincewind wasn   t there .  he was in fact several meters below  and the distance was increasing all the time  because the branch had chosen that moment to snap and send him on his interrupted journey toward the interstellar gulf .      come back .     screamed the demon .   rincewind didn   t answer .  he was lying belly down in the rushing air  staring down into the clouds that even now were thinning .   they vanished .   below  the whole universe twinkled at rincewind .  there was great a   tuin  huge and ponderous and pocked with craters .  there was the little disc moon .  there was a distant gleam that could only be the potent voyager .  and there were all the stars  looking remarkably like powdered diamonds spilled on black velvet  the stars that lured and ultimately called the boldest toward them     the whole of creation was waiting for rincewind to drop in .   he did so .   there didn   t seem to be any alternative .         the shape and cosmology of the disc system are perhaps worthy of note at this point .   there are  of course  two major directions on the disc  hubward and rimward .  but since the disc itself revolves at the rate of once every eight hundred days  in order to distribute the weight fairly upon its supportive pachyderms  according to reforgule of krull  there are also two lesser directions  which are turnwise and widdershins .   since the disc   s tiny orbiting sunlet maintains a fixed orbit while the majestic disc turns slowly beneath it  it will be readily deduced that a disc year consists of not four but eight seasons .  the summers are those times when the sun rises or sets at the nearest point on the rim  the winters those occasions when it rises or sets at a point around ninety degrees along the circumference .   thus  in the lands around the circle sea  the year begins on hogs    watch night  progresses through a spring prime to its first midsummer  small gods    eve  which is followed by autumn prime and  straddling the half year point of crueltide  winter secundus  also known as the spindlewinter  since at this time the sun rises in the direction of spin  .  then comes secundus spring with summer two on its heels  the three quarter mark of the year being the night of alls fallow   the one night of the year  according to legend  when witches and warlocks stay in bed .  then drifting leaves and frosty nights drag on toward backspindlewinter and a new hogs    watch night nestling like a frozen jewel at its heart .   since the hub is never closely warmed by the weak sun the lands there are locked in permafrost .  the rim  on the other hand  is a region of sunny islands and balmy days .   there are  of course  eight days in a disc week and eight colors in its light spectrum .  eight is a number of some considerable occult significance on the disc and must never  ever  be spoken by a wizard .   precisely why all the above should be so is not clear  but goes some way to explain why  on the disc  the gods are not so much worshipped as blamed .       about the author   terry pratchett lives in england  an
