whatever about that .  the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman  the clerk  the undertaker  and the chief mourner .  scrooge signed it .  and scrooge s name was good upon  change  for anything he chose to put his hand to .   old marley was dead as a door nail .   scrooge knew he was dead .  of course he did .  how could it be otherwise .  scrooge and he were partners for i don t know how many years .  scrooge was his sole executor  his sole administrator  his sole assign  his sole residuary legatee  his sole friend  and sole mourner .  and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event  but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral  and solemnized it with an undoubted bargain .   the mention of marley s funeral brings me back to the point i started from .  there is no doubt that marley was dead .  this must be distinctly understood  or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate .   scrooge never painted out old marley s name .  there it stood  years afterward  above the warehouse door  scrooge and marley .  the firm was known as scrooge and marley .  sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge  and sometimes marley  but he answered to both names .  it was all the same to him .   oh .  but he was a tight fisted hand at the grindstone  scrooge .  a squeezing  wrenching  grasping  scraping  clutching  covetous  old sinner .  hard and sharp as flint  from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire  secret and self contained  and solitary as an oyster .  the cold within him froze his old features  nipped his pointed nose  shriveled his cheek  stiffened his gait  made his eyes red  his thin lips blue  and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice .  a frosty rime on his head  and on his eyebrows  and his wiry chin .   external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge .  no warmth could warm  no wintry weather chill him .  no wind that blew was bitterer than he  no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose  no pelting rain less open to entreaty .  foul weather didn t know where to have him .  the heaviest rain  and snow  and hail  and sleet  could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect .  they often  came down  handsomely  and scrooge never did .   nobody ever stopped him in the street to say  with gladsome looks   my dear scrooge  how are you .  when will you come to see me .   no beggars implored him to bestow a trifle  no children asked him what it was o clock  no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place  of scrooge .   but what did scrooge care .  it was the very thing he liked .  to edge his way along the crowded paths of life  warning all human sympathy to keep its distance  was what the knowing ones call  nuts  to scrooge .   once upon a time  of all the good days in the year  on christmas eve  old scrooge sat busy in his counting house .  it was cold  bleak  biting weather  foggy withal  and he could hear the people in the court outside  go wheezing up and down  beating their hands upon their breasts  and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them .  the city clocks had only just gone three  but it was quite dark already  it had not been light all day  and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighboring offices  like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air .   the door of scrooge s counting house was open  that he might keep his eye upon his clerk  who in a dismal little cell beyond  a sort of tank  was copying letters .  scrooge had a very small fire  but the clerk s fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal .  but he couldn t replenish it  for scrooge kept the coal box in his own room  and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel  the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part .  wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter  and tried to warm himself at the candle  in which effort  not being a man of strong imagination  he failed .    a merry christmas  uncle .  god save you .   cried a cheerful voice .  it was the voice of scrooge s nephew  who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach .    bah .   said scrooge .   humbug .    he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost  this nephew of scrooge s  that he was all in a glow  his face was ruddy and handsome  his eyes sparkled  and his breath smoked again .    christmas a humbug  uncle .   said scrooge s nephew .   you don t mean that  i am sure .     i do   said scrooge .   merry christmas .  what right have you to be merry .  what reason have you to be merry .  you re poor enough .     come then   returned the nephew gaily .   what right have you to be dismal .  what reason have you to be morose .  you re rich enough .    scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment  said   bah .   again  and followed it up with   keep christmas in your own way  and let me keep it in mine .     keep it .   repeated scrooge s nephew .   but you don t keep it .     let me leave it alone  then   said scrooge .   much good may it do you .  much good it has ever done you .     there are many things from which i might have derived good  by which i have not profited  i dare say   returned the nephew   christmas among the rest .  but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time  when it has come round  apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin  if anything belonging to it can be apart from that  as a good time  a kind  forgiving  charitable  pleasant time  the only time i know of  in the long calendar of the year  when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut up hearts freely  and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave  and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys .  and therefore  uncle  though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket  i believe that it has done me good  and will do me good  and i say  god bless it .    the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded .  becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety  he poked the fire  and extinguished the last frail spark for ever .    let me hear another sound from you   said scrooge   and you ll keep your christmas by losing your situation .  you re quite a powerful speaker  sir   he added  turning to his nephew .   i wonder you don t go into parliament .     don t be angry  uncle .  come .  dine with us to morrow .    scrooge said that he would see him  yes  indeed he did .  he went the whole length of the expression  and said that he would see him in that extremity first .    but why .   cried scrooge s nephew   why .     why did you get married .   said scrooge .    because i fell in love .     because you fell in love .   growled scrooge  as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas .   good afternoon .     nay  uncle  but you never came to see me before that happened .  why give it as a reason for not coming now .     good afternoon   said scrooge .    i want nothing from you  i ask nothing of you  why cannot we be friends .     good afternoon   said scrooge .    i am sorry  with all my heart  to find you so resolute .  we have never had any quarrel  to which i have been a party .  but i have made the trial in homage to christmas  and i ll keep my christmas humor to the last .  so a merry christmas  uncle .     good afternoon .   said scrooge .    and a happy new year .     good afternoon .   said scrooge .   his nephew left the room without an angry word  notwithstanding .  he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk  who  cold as he was  was warmer than scrooge  for he returned them cordially .    there s another fellow   muttered scrooge  who overheard him   my clerk  with fifteen shillings a week  and a wife and family  talking about a merry christmas .  i ll retire to bedlam .    this lunatic  in letting scrooge s nephew out  had let two other people in .  they were portly gentlemen  pleasant to behold  and now stood  with their hats off  in scrooge s office .  they had books and papers in their hands  and bowed to him .    scrooge and marley s  i believe   said one of the gentlemen  referring to his list .   have i the pleasure of addressing mr .  scrooge  or mr .  marley .     mr .  marley has been dead these seven years   scrooge replied .   he died seven years ago  this very night .     we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner   said the gentleman  presenting his credentials .   it certainly was  for they had been two kindred spirits .  at the ominous word  liberality   scrooge frowned  and shook his head  and handed the credentials back .    at this festive season of the year  mr .  scrooge   said the gentleman  taking up a pen   it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute  who suffer greatly at the present time .  many thousands are in want of common necessaries  hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts  sir .     are there no prisons .   asked scrooge .    plenty of prisons   said the gentleman  laying down the pen again .    and the union workhouses .   demanded scrooge .   are they still in operation .     they are .  still   returned the gentleman   i wish i could say they were not .  under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude  a few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink  and means of warmth .  we choose this time  because it is a time  of all others  when want is keenly felt  and abundance rejoices .  what shall i put you down for .     nothing .   scrooge replied .    you wish to be anonymous .     i wish to be left alone   said scrooge .   since you ask me what i wish  gentlemen  that is my answer .  i don t make merry myself at christmas  and i can t afford to make idle people merry .  i help to support the establishments i have mentioned  they cost enough  and those who are badly off must go there .     many can t go there  and many would rather die .     if they would rather die   said scrooge   they had better do it  and decrease the surplus population .  besides  excuse me  i don t know that .     but you might know it   observed the gentleman .    it s not my business   scrooge returned .   it s enough for a man to understand his own business  and not to interfere with other people s .  mine occupies me constantly .  good afternoon  gentlemen .    seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point  the gentlemen withdrew .  scrooge resumed his labors with an improved opinion of himself  and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him .   at length the hour of shutting up the counting house arrived .  with an ill will scrooge dismounted from his stool  and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank  who instantly snuffed his candle out  and put on his hat .    you ll want all day to morrow  i suppose .   said scrooge .    if quite convenient  sir .     it s not convenient   said scrooge   and it s not fair .  if i was to stop half a crown for it  you d think yourself ill used  i ll be bound .    the clerk smiled faintly .    and yet   said scrooge   you don t think me ill used  when i pay a day s wages for no work .    the clerk observed that it was only once a year .    a poor excuse for picking a man s pocket every twenty fifth of december .   said scrooge  buttoning his great coat to the chin .   but i suppose you must have the whole day .  be here all the earlier next morning .    the clerk promised that he would  and scrooge walked out with a growl .  the office was closed in a twinkling  and the clerk  with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist  for he boasted no great coat   went down a slide on cornhill  at the end of a lane of boys  twenty times  in honor of its being christmas eve  and then ran home to camden town as hard as he could pelt  to play at blindman s buff .   scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern  and having read all the newspapers  and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker s book  went home to bed .  he lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner .  they were a gloomy suite of rooms  in a lowering pile of building up a yard  where it had so little business to be  that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house  playing at hide and seek with other houses  and have forgotten the way out again .  it was old enough now  and dreary enough  for nobody lived in it but scrooge  the other rooms being all let out as offices .   every room above  and every cask in the wine merchant s cellars below  appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own .  scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes .  he fastened the door  and walked across the hall  and up the stairs  slowly too  trimming his candle as he went .  half a dozen gas lamps out of the street wouldn t have lighted the entry too well  so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooge s dip .   up scrooge went  not caring a button for that .  darkness is cheap  and scrooge liked it .  but before he shut his heavy door  he walked through his rooms to see that all was right .   quite satisfied  he closed his door  and locked himself in  double locked himself in  which was not his custom .  thus secured against surprise  he  took off his cravat  put on his dressing gown and slippers  and his night cap  and sat down before the fire to take his gruel .  as he threw his head back in the chair  his glance happened to rest upon a bell  a disused bell  that hung in the room  and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building .  it was with great astonishment  and with a strange  inexplicable dread  that as he looked  he saw this bell begin to swing .  it swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound  but soon it rang out loudly  and so did every bell in the house .   this might have lasted half a minute  or a minute  but it seemed an hour .  the bells ceased as they had begun  together .  they were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below  as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant s cellar .  scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains .   the cellar door flew open with a booming sound  and then he heard the noise much louder  on the floors below  then coming up the stairs  then coming straight toward his door .    it s humbug still .   said scrooge .   i won t believe it .    his color changed though  when  without a pause  it came on through the heavy door  and passed into the room before his eyes .  upon its coming in  the dying flame leaped up  as though it cried  i know him .  marley s ghost .   and fell again .   the same face  the very same .  the chain he drew was clasped about his middle .  it was long and wound about him like a tail  and it was made  for scrooge observed it closely  of cash boxes  keys  padlocks  ledgers  deeds  and heavy purses wrought in steel .    how now  said scrooge  caustic and cold as ever .   what do you want with me .     much .    marley s voice  no doubt about it .    who are you .     ask me who i was .     who were you then .   said scrooge  raising his voice .   you re particular  for a shade .   he was going to say  to a shade   but substituted this  as more appropriate .    in life i was your partner  jacob marley .     can you  can you sit down .   asked scrooge  looking doubtfully at him .    i can .     do it  then .    scrooge asked the question  because he didn t know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair  and felt that in the event of its being impossible  it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation .  but the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace  as if he were quite used to it .   scrooge fell upon his knees  and clasped his hands before his face .    mercy .   he said   dreadful apparition  why do you trouble me .     man of the worldly mind .   replied the ghost   do you believe in me or not .     i do   said scrooge .   i must .  but why do spirits walk the earth  and why do they come to me .     it is required of every man   the ghost returned   that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellow men  and travel far and wide  and if that spirit goes not forth in life  it is condemned to do so after death .  it is doomed to wander through the world  oh  woe is me .   and witness what it cannot share  but might have shared on earth  and turned to happiness .    the spectre raised a cry  and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands .    you are fettered   said scrooge  trembling .   tell me why .     i wear the chain i forged in life   replied the ghost .   i made it link by link  and yard by yard  i girded it on of my own free will  and of my own free will i wore it .  is its pattern strange to you .    scrooge trembled more and more .    or would you know   pursued the ghost   the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself .  it was full as heavy and as long as this  seven christmas eves ago .  you have labored on it since .  it is a ponderous chain .    scrooge glanced about him on the floor  in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable  but he could see nothing .    jacob   he said imploringly .   old jacob marley  tell me more .  speak comfort to me  jacob .     i have none to give   the ghost replied .   it comes from other regions  ebenezer scrooge  and is conveyed by other ministers  to other kinds of men .  nor can i tell you what i would .  a very little more  is all permitted to me .  i cannot rest  i cannot stay  i cannot linger anywhere .  my spirit never walked beyond our counting house  mark me .   in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money changing hole  and weary journeys lie before me .    it was a habit with scrooge  whenever he became thoughtful  to put his hands in his breeches  pockets .  pondering on what the ghost had said  he did so now  but without lifting up his eyes  or getting off his knees .    you must have been very slow about it  jacob   scrooge observed  in a business like manner  though with humility and deference .    slow .   the ghost repeated .    seven years dead   mused scrooge .   and traveling all the time .     the whole time   said the ghost .   no rest  no peace .  incessant torture of remorse .     you travel fast .   said scrooge .    on the wings of the wind   replied the ghost .    you might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years   said scrooge .   the ghost  on hearing this set up another cry  and clanked its chain hideously .    oh .  captive  bound  and double ironed   cried the phantom   not to know that ages of incessant labor  by immortal creatures  for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed .  not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere  whatever it may be  will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness .  not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life s opportunities misused .  yet such was i .  oh .  such was i .     but you were always a good man of business  jacob   faltered scrooge  who now began to apply this to himself .    business .   cried the ghost  wringing its hands again .   mankind was my business .  the common welfare was my business  charity  mercy  forbearance  and benevolence  were  all my business .  the dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business .    it held up its chain at arm s length  as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief  and flung it heavily upon the ground again .    at this time of the rolling year   the spectre said   i suffer most .  why did i walk through crowds of fellow beings with my eyes turned down  and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode .  were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me .    scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate  and began to quake exceedingly .    hear me .   cried the ghost .   my time is nearly gone .     i will   said scrooge .   but don t be hard upon me .  don t be flowery  jacob .  pray .     how it is that i appear before you in a shape that you can see  i may not tell .  i have sat invisible beside you many and many a day .    it was not an agreeable idea .  scrooge shivered  and wiped the perspiration from his brow .    that is no light part of my penance   pursued the ghost .   i am here to night to warn you  that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate .  a chance and hope of my procuring  ebenezer .     you were always a good friend to me   said scrooge .   thank ee .     you will be haunted   resumed the ghost   by three spirits .    scrooge s countenance fell .    is that the chance and hope you mentioned .  jacob .   he demanded  in a faltering voice .    it is .     i  i think i d rather not   said scrooge .    without their visits   said the ghost   you cannot hope to shun the path i tread .  expect the first to morrow  when the bell tolls one .     couldn t i take  em all at once  and have it over  jacob .   hinted scrooge .    expect the second on the next night at the same hour .  the third  upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate .  look to see me no more  and look that  for your own sake  you remember what has passed between us .    the apparition walked backward from him toward the window  and floated out upon the bleak  dark night .   scrooge followed to the window  desperate in his curiosity .  he looked out .   the air was filled with phantoms  wandering hither and thither in restless haste  and moaning as they went .  every one of them wore chains like marley s ghost  some few  they might be guilty governments  were linked together  none were free .  many had been personally known to scrooge in their lives .  he had been quite familiar with one old ghost  in a white waistcoat  with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle  who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant  whom it saw below upon a door step .  the misery with them all was  clearly  that they sought to interfere  for good  in human matters and had lost the power for ever .   whether these creatures faded into mist  or mist enshrouded them  he could not tell .  but they and their spirit voices faded together  and the night became as it had been when he walked home .   scrooge closed the window  and examined the door by which the ghost had entered .  it was double locked  as he had locked it with his own hands  and the bolts were undisturbed .  he tried to say  humbug .   but stopped at the first syllable .  and being  from the emotion he had undergone  or the fatigues of the day  or his glimpse of the invisible world  or the dull conversation of the ghost  or the lateness of the hour  much in need of repose  went straight to bed  without undressing  and fell asleep upon the instant .   stave two .   the first of the three spirits .   when scrooge awoke  it was so dark  that  looking out of bed  he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber .  he was endeavoring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes  when the chimes of a neighboring church clock struck twelve .    why it isn t possible   said scrooge   that i can have slept through a whole day and far into another night .    scrooge lay and thought and thought it over and over  and could make nothing of it .  the more he thought  the more perplexed he was  and the more he endeavored not to think  the more he thought .  marley s ghost bothered him exceedingly .   was it a dream or not .    scrooge lay in this state until he remembered  on a sudden  that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one .  he resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed  and considering that he could not go to sleep  this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power .   he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously  and missed the clock .  at length it broke upon his listening ear .    the hour itself   said scrooge  triumphantly   nothing else .    he spoke before the hour bell sounded  which it now did with a deep  dull  hollow  melancholy one .  light flashed up in the room upon the instant  and the curtains of his bed were drawn .   the curtains of his bed were drawn aside  i tell you  by a hand .  not the curtains at his feet  nor the curtains at his back  but those to which his face was addressed .  the curtains of his bed were drawn aside  and scrooge  starting up into a half recumbent attitude  found himself face to face with the visitor who drew them .   it was a strange figure  like a child  yet not so like a child as like an old man  viewed through some supernatural medium  which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view  and being diminished to a child s proportions .  its hair  which hung about its neck and down its back  was white as if with age  and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it  and the tenderest bloom was on the skin .  the arms were very long and muscular  the hands the same  as if its hold were of uncommon strength .  its legs and feet  most delicately formed  were  like those upper members  bare .  it wore a tunic of the purest white  and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt  the sheen of which was beautiful .  it held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand  and  in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem  had its dress trimmed with summer flowers .  but the strangest thing about it was  that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light  by which all this was visible  and which was doubtless the occasion of its using  in its duller moments  a great extinguisher for a cap  which it now held under its arm .    are you the spirit  sir  whose coming was foretold to me .   asked scrooge .    i am .    the voice was soft and gentle .  singularly low  as if instead of being so close beside him  it were at a distance .    who  and what are you .   scrooge demanded .    i am the ghost of christmas past .     long past .   inquired scrooge  observant of its dwarfish stature .    no .  your past .    scrooge then made bold to inquire what business brought him there .    your welfare .   said the ghost .   scrooge expressed himself much obliged  but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end .  the spirit must have heard him thinking  for it said immediately    your reclamation  then .  take heed .    it put out its strong hand as it spoke  and clasped him gently by the arm .    rise .  and walk with me .    it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes  that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below freezing  that he was clad but lightly in his slippers  dressing gown  and night cap  and that he had a cold upon him at the time .  the grasp  though gentle as a woman s hand  was not to be resisted .  he rose  but finding that the spirit made toward the window  clasped its robe in supplication .    i am a mortal   scrooge remonstrated   and liable to fall .     bear but a touch of my hand there   said the spirit  laying it upon his heart   and you shall be upheld in more than this .    as the words were spoken  they passed out  and stood upon an open country road  with fields on either hand .  the city had entirely vanished .  not a vestige of it was to be seen .  the darkness and the mist had vanished with it  for it was a clear  cold  winter day  with snow upon the ground .    good spirit .   said scrooge  clasping his hands together  as he looked about him .   i was bred in this place .  i was a boy here .    the spirit gazed upon him mildly .  its gentle touch  though it had been light and instantaneous  appeared still present to the old man s sense of feeling .  he was conscious of a thousand odors floating in the air  each one connected with a thousand thoughts  and hopes  and joys  and cares long  long  forgotten .    your lip is trembling   said the ghost .   and what is that upon your cheek .    scrooge muttered  with an unusual catching in his voice  that it was a pimple  and begged the ghost to lead him where he would .    you recollect the way .   inquired the spirit .    remember it .   cried scrooge with fervor   i could walk it blindfold .     strange to have forgotten it for so many years .   observed the ghost .   let us go on .    they walked along the road  scrooge recognizing every gate  and post  and tree  until a little market town appeared in the distance  with its bridge  its church  and winding river .  some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting toward them with boys upon their backs  who called to other boys in country gigs and carts  driven by farmers .  all these boys were in great spirits  and shouted to each other  until the broad fields were so full of merry music  that the crisp air laughed to hear it .    these are but shadows of the things that have been   said the ghost .   they have no consciousness of us .    the jocund travelers came on  and as they came  scrooge knew and named them every one .  why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them .  why did his cold eye glisten  and his heart leap up as they went past .  why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas  as they parted at cross roads and bye ways  for their several homes .  what was merry christmas to scrooge .  out upon merry christmas .  what good had it ever done to him .    the school is not quite deserted   said the ghost .   a solitary child  neglected by his friends  is left there still .    scrooge said he knew it .  and he sobbed .   they left the high road  by a well remembered lane  and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick  with a little weathercock surmounted cupola  on the roof  and a bell hanging in it .  it was a large house  but one of broken fortunes  for the spacious offices were little used  their walls were damp and mossy  their windows broken  and their gates decayed .  fowls clucked and strutted in the stables  and the coach houses and sheds were overrun with grass .  nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within  for entering the dreary hall  and glancing through the open doors of many rooms  they found them poorly furnished  cold  and vast .  there was an earthy savor in the air  a chilly bareness in the place  which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle light  and not too much to eat .   they went  the ghost and scrooge  across the hall  to a door at the back of the house .  it opened before them  and disclosed a long  bare  melancholy room  made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks .  at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire  and scrooge sat down upon a form  and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he had used to be .    i wish   scrooge muttered  putting his hand in his pocket  and looking about him  after drying his eyes with his cuff   but it s too late now .     what is the matter .   asked the spirit .    nothing   said scrooge .   nothing .  there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night .  i should like to have given him something  that s all .    the ghost smiled thoughtfully  and waved its hand  saying as it did so   let us see another christmas .    scrooge s former self grew larger at the words  and the room became a little darker and more dirty .  the panels shrunk  the windows cracked  fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling  and the naked laths were shown instead  but how all this was brought about  scrooge knew no more than you do .  he only knew that it was quite correct  that everything had happened so  that there he was  alone again  when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays .   he was not reading now  but walking up and down despairingly .  scrooge looked at the ghost  and with a mournful shaking of his head  glanced anxiously toward the door .   it opened  and a little girl much younger than the boy  came darting in  and putting her arms about his neck  and often kissing him  addressed him as her  dear  dear brother .     i have come to bring you home  dear brother .   said the child  clapping her tiny hands  and bending down to laugh .   to bring you home  home  home .     home  little fan .   returned the boy .    yes   said the child  brimful of glee .   home  for good and all .  home  for ever and ever .  father is so much kinder than he used to be  that home s like heaven .  he spoke so gently to me one dear night when i was going to bed  that i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home  and he said yes  you should  and sent me in a coach to bring you .  and you re to be a man .   said the child  opening her eyes   and are never to come back here  but first  we re to be together all the christmas long  and have the merriest time in all the world .     you are quite a woman  little fan .   exclaimed the boy .   she clapped her hands and laughed  and tried to touch his head  but being too little  laughed again  and stood on tiptoe to embrace him .  then she began to drag him  in her childish eagerness  toward the door  and he  nothing loth to go  accompanied her .   a terrible voice in the hall cried   bring down master scrooge s box  there .   and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself  who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious condescension  and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him .  master scrooge s trunk being tied on to the top of the chaise  the children bade the schoolmaster good bye right willingly  and getting into it  drove gaily down the garden sweep  the quick wheels dashing the hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray .    always a delicate creature  whom a breath might have withered   said the ghost .   but she had a large heart .     so she had   cried scrooge .   you re right .  i will not gainsay it spirit .  god forbid .     she died a woman   said the ghost   and had  as i think  children .     one child   scrooge returned .    true   said the ghost .   your nephew .    scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind  and answered briefly   yes .    although they had but that moment left the school behind them  they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city  where shadowy passengers passed and repassed  where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way  and all the strife and tumult of a real city were .  it was made plain enough  by the dressing of the shops  that here too it was christmas time again  but it was evening  and the streets were lighted up .   the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door  and asked scrooge if he knew it .    know it .   said scrooge .   was not i apprenticed here .    they went in .  at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig  sitting behind such a high desk  that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling  scrooge cried in great excitement    why  it s old fezziwig .  bless his heart  it s fezziwig alive again .    old fezziwig laid down his pen  and looked up at the clock  which pointed to the hour of seven .  he rubbed his hands  adjusted his capacious waistcoat  laughed all over himself  from his shoes to his organ of benevolence  and called out in a comfortable  oily  rich  fat  jovial voice    yo ho  there .  ebenezer .  dick .    scrooge s former self  now grown a young man  came briskly in  accompanied by his fellow  prentice .    dick wilkins  to be sure .   said scrooge to the ghost .   bless me  yes .  there he is .  he was very much attached to me  was dick .  poor dick .  dear  dear .     yo ho  my boys .   said fezziwig   no more work to night .  christmas eve  dick  christmas  ebenezer .  let s have the shutters up   cried old fezziwig  with a sharp clap of his hands   before a man can say jack robinson .    you wouldn t believe how those two fellows went at it .  they charged into the street with the shutters  one  two  three  had  em up in their places  four  five  six  barred  em and pinned  em  seven  eight  nine  and came back before you could have got to twelve  panting like race horses .    hilli ho .   cried old fezziwig  skipping down from the high desk  with wonderful agility .   clear away  my lads  and let s have lots of room here .    clear away .  there was nothing they wouldn t have cleared away  or couldn t have cleared away  with old fezziwig looking on .  it was done in a minute .  every movable was packed off  as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore  the floor was swept and watered  the lamps were trimmed  fuel was heaped upon the fire  and the warehouse was as snug  and warm  and dry  and bright a play room as you would desire to see upon a winter s night .   in came a fiddler with a music book  and went up to the lofty desk  and made an orchestra of it  and tuned like fifty stomach aches .  in came mrs .  fezziwig  one vast substantial smile .  in came the three miss fezziwigs  beaming and lovable .  in came all the young men and women employed in the business .  in came the housemaid  with her cousin  the baker .  in came the cook  with her brother s particular friend  the milkman .  in they all came  one after another  some shyly  some boldly  some gracefully  some awkwardly  some pushing  some pulling  in they all came  anyhow and everyhow .   there were dances  and there were forfeits  and more dances  and there was cake  and there was a great piece of cold roast  and there was a great piece of cold boiled  and there were mince pies .   when the clock struck eleven  this domestic ball broke up .  mr .  and mrs .  fezziwig took their stations  one on either side the door  and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out  wished him or her a merry christmas .  when everybody had retired but the two  prentices they did the same to them  and thus the cheerful voices died away  and the lads were left to their beds  which were under a counter in the back shop .   during the whole of this time  scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits .  his heart and soul were in the scene  and with his former self .  he corroborated everything  remembered everything  enjoyed everything  and underwent the strangest agitation .  it was not until now  when the bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from them  that he remembered the ghost  and became conscious that it was looking full upon him  while the light upon its head burnt very clear .    a small matter   said the ghost   to make these silly folks so full of gratitude .     small .   echoed scrooge .   the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices  who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig  and when he had done so said    why .  is it not .  he has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money  three or four  perhaps .  is that so much that he deserves this praise .     it isn t that   said scrooge  heated by the remark  and speaking unconsciously like his former  not his latter self .   it isn t that  spirit .  he has the power to render us happy or unhappy  to make our service light or burdensome  a pleasure or a toil .  say that his power lies in words and looks  in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count  em up  what then .  the happiness he gives  is quite as great as if it cost a fortune .    he felt the spirit s glance  and stopped .    what is the matter .   asked the ghost .    nothing particular   said scrooge .    something  i think .   the ghost insisted .    no   said scrooge   no .  i should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now .  that s all .    his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish  and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by side in the open air .    my time grows short   observed the spirit .   quick .    this was not addressed to scrooge  or to any one whom he could see  but it produced an immediate effect .  for again scrooge saw himself .  he was older now  a man in the prime of life .  his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years  but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice .  there was an eager  greedy  restless motion in the eye  which showed the passion that had taken root  and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall .   he was not alone  but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning dress  in whose eyes there were tears  which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of christmas past .    it matters little   she said  softly .   to you  very little .  another idol has displaced me  and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come  as i would have tried to do  i have no just cause to grieve .     what idol has displaced you .   he rejoined .    a golden one .     this is the even handed dealing of the world .   he said .   there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty  and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth .     you fear the world too much   she answered  gently .   all your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach .  i have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one  until the master passion  gain  engrosses you .  have i not .     what then .   he retorted .   even if i have grown so much wiser  what then .  i am not changed toward you .    she shook her head .    am i .     our contract is an old one .  it was made when we were both poor and content to be so  until  in good season  we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry .  you are changed .  when it was made  you were another man .     i was a boy   he said impatiently .    your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are   she returned .   i am .  that which promised happiness when we were one in heart  is fraught with misery now that we are two .  how often and how keenly i have thought of this  i will not say .  it is enough that i have thought of it  and can release you .     have i ever sought release .     in words .  no .  never .     in what  then .     in a changed nature  in an altered spirit  in another atmosphere of life  another hope as its great end .  in everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight .  if this had never been between us   said the girl  looking mildly  but with steadiness  upon him   can even i believe that you would choose a dowerless girl  or  choosing her  do i not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow .  i do  and i release you .  with a full heart  for the love of him you once were .    he was about to speak  but she left him and they parted .    spirit .   said scrooge   show me no more .  conduct me home .  why do you delight to torture me .     i told you these were shadows of the things that have been   said the ghost .   that they are what they are  do not blame me .     remove me .   scrooge exclaimed .   i cannot bear it .    he turned upon the ghost  and seeing that it looked upon him with a face  in which some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him  wrestled with it .    leave me .  take me back .  haunt me no longer .    in the struggle  if that can be called a struggle in which the ghost  with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary  scrooge was conscious of being exhausted  and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness  and  further  of being in his own bed room .  he had barely time to reel to bed  before he sank into a heavy sleep .   stave three .   the second of the three spirits .   awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore  and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together  scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of one .  he felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time  for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through jacob marley s intervention .  but  finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back  he put them every one aside with his own hands  and lying down again  established a sharp look out all round the bed .  for he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its appearance  and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous .   now  being prepared for almost anything  he was not by any means prepared for nothing  and  consequently  when the bell struck one  and no shape appeared  he was taken with a violent fit of trembling .  five minutes  ten minutes a quarter of an hour went by  yet nothing came .  all this time  he lay upon his bed  the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light  which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour  and which  being only light  was more alarming than a dozen ghosts  as he was powerless to make out what it meant .  at last  however  he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room  from whence  on further tracing it  it seemed to shine .  this idea taking full possession of his mind  he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door .   the moment scrooge s hand was on the lock  a strange voice called him by his name  and bade him enter .  he obeyed .   it was his own room .  there was no doubt about that .  but it had undergone a surprising transformation .  the walls and ceiling were so hung with living green  that it looked a perfect grove  from every part of which  bright gleaming berries glistened .  the crisp leaves of holly  mistletoe  and ivy reflected back the light  as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there  and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney  as that dull petrifaction of a hearth had never known in scrooge s time  or marley s  or for many and many a winter season gone .  heaped up on the floor  to form a kind of throne  were turkeys  geese  game  poultry  brawn  great joints of meat  sucking pigs  long wreaths of sausages  mince pies  plum puddings  barrels of oysters  red hot chestnuts  cherry cheeked apples  juicy oranges  luscious pears and immense twelfth cakes  that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam .  in easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly giant  glorious to see  who bore a glowing torch  in shape not unlike plenty s horn  and held it up  high up  to shed its light on scrooge  as he came peeping round the door .    come in .   exclaimed the ghost  come in .  and know me better  man .    scrooge entered timidly  and hung his head before this spirit .  he was not the dogged scrooge he had been  and though the spirit s eyes were clear and kind  he did not like to meet them .    i am the ghost of christmas present   said the spirit   look upon me .  you have never seen the like of me before .   exclaimed the spirit .    never   scrooge made answer to it .    have never walked forth with the younger members of my family  meaning  for i am very young  my elder brothers born in these later years .   pursued the phantom .    i don t think i have   said scrooge .   i am afraid i have not .  have you had many brothers  spirit .     more than eighteen hundred   said the ghost .    a tremendous family to provide for   muttered scrooge .   the ghost of christmas present rose .    spirit   said scrooge  submissively   conduct me where you will .  i went forth last night on compulsion  and i learnt a lesson which is working now .  to night  if you have aught to teach me  let me profit by it .     touch my robe .    scrooge did as he was told  and held it fast .   the whole scene vanished instantly and they stood in the city streets on christmas morning  where  for the weather was severe  the people made a rough  but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music  in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings  and from the tops of their houses  whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below  and splitting into artificial little snowstorms .   perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing his sympathy with all poor men  that led him straight to scrooge s clerk s  for there he went  and took scrooge with him  holding to his robe  and on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled  and stopped to bless bob cratchit s dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch .   then up rose mrs .  cratchit  cratchit s wife  dressed out but poorly in a twice turned gown  but brave in ribbons  which are cheap and make a goodly show  and she laid the cloth  assisted by belinda cratchit  second of her daughters  also brave in ribbons  while master peter cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes .  and now two smaller cratchits  boy and girl  came tearing in  screaming that outside the baker s they had smelt the goose  and known it for their own .    what has ever got your precious father  then .   said mrs .  cratchit .   and your brother  tiny tim .  and martha warn t as late last christmas day by half an hour .     here s martha  mother   said a girl appearing as she spoke .    here s martha  mother   cried the two young cratchits .   hurrah .  there s such a goose  martha .     why  bless your heart alive  my dear  how late you are .   said mrs .  cratchit  kissing her a dozen times  and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal .    we d a deal of work to finish up last night   replied the girl   and had to clear away this morning  mother .     well .  never mind so long as you are come   said mrs .  cratchit .   sit ye down before the fire  my dear  and have a warm  lord bless ye .     no no .  there s father coming   cried the two young cratchits  who were everywhere at once .   hide  martha  hide .    so martha hid herself  and in came little bob  the father  with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe hanging down before him  and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed  to look seasonable  and tiny tim upon his shoulder .  alas for tiny tim  he bore a little crutch  and had his limbs supported by an iron frame .    why  where s our martha .   cried bob cratchit looking round .    not coming   said mrs .  cratchit .    not coming .   said bob  with a sudden declension in his high spirits  for he had been tim s blood horse all the way from church  and had come home rampant .   not coming upon christmas day .    martha didn t like to see him disappointed  if it were only in joke  so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door  and ran into his arms  while the two young cratchits hustled tiny tim  and bore him off into the wash house  that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper .    and how did little tim behave .   asked mrs .  cratchit  when she had rallied bob on his credulity  and bob had hugged his daughter to his heart s content .    as good as gold   said bob   and better .  somehow he gets thoughtful  sitting by himself so much  and thinks the strangest things you ever heard .  he told me  coming home  that he hoped the people saw him in the church  because he was a cripple  and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon christmas day  who made lame beggars walk and blind men see .    bob s voice was tremulous when he told them this  and trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing strong and hearty .   his active little crutch was heard upon the floor  and back came tiny tim before another word was spoken  escorted by his brother and sister to his stool beside the fire  and master peter and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the goose  with which they soon returned in high procession .   mrs .  cratchit made the gravy  ready beforehand in a little saucepan  hissing hot  master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigor  miss belinda sweetened up the apple sauce  martha dusted the hot plates  bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table  the two young cratchits set chairs for everybody  not forgetting themselves  and mounting guard upon their posts  crammed spoons into their mouths  lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped .  at last the dishes were set on  and grace was said .  it was succeeded by a breathless pause  as mrs .  cratchit  looking slowly all along the carving knife  prepared to plunge it in the breast  but when she did  and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth  one murmur of delight arose all round the board  and even tiny tim  excited by the two young cratchits  beat on the table with the handle of his knife  and feebly cried hurrah .   there never was such a goose .  bob said he didn t believe there ever was such a goose cooked .  its tenderness and flavor  size and cheapness  were the themes of universal admiration .  eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes  it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family  indeed  as mrs .  cratchit said with great delight  surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish   they hadn t ate it all at last .  yet every one had had enough .  but now the plates being changed by miss belinda  mrs .  cratchit left the room alone  too nervous to bear witnesses  to take the pudding up  and bring it in .   oh  a wonderful pudding .  bob cratchit said  and calmly too  that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by mrs .  cratchit since their marriage .  mrs .  cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind  she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour .  everybody had something to say about it  but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family .  it would have been flat heresy to do so .  any cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing .   at last the dinner was all done  the cloth was cleared  the hearth swept  and the fire made up .  apples and oranges were put upon the table and a shovelful of chestnuts on the fire .  then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth  in what bob cratchit called a circle  meaning half a one .  then bob proposed   a merry christmas to all  my dears .  god bless us .    which all the family re echoed .    god bless us  every one .   said tiny tim  the last of all .   he sat very close to his father s side  upon his little stool .  bob held his withered little hand in his  as if he loved the child and wished to keep him by his side  and dreaded that he might be taken from him .    spirit   said scrooge  with an interest he had never felt before   tell me if tiny tim will live .     i see a vacant seat   replied the ghost   in the poor chimney corner  and a crutch without an owner  carefully preserved .  if these shadows remain unaltered by the future the child will die .     no  no   said scrooge .   oh  no  kind spirit .  say he will be spared .     if these shadows remain unaltered by the future none other of my race   returned the ghost   will find him here .  what then .  if he be like to die  he had better do it  and decrease the surplus population .    scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit  and was overcome with penitence and grief .    man   said the ghost   if man you be in heart  not adamant  forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is .  will you decide what men shall live  what men shall die .  it may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man s child .  oh  god .  to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust .    scrooge bent before the ghost s rebuke  and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground .  but he raised them speedily on hearing his own name .    mr .  scrooge .   said bob   i ll give you mr .  scrooge  the founder of the feast .     the founder of the feast indeed .   cried mrs .  cratchit  reddening .   i wish i had him here .  i d give him a piece of my mind to feast upon  and i hope he d have a good appetite for it .     my dear   said bob   the children .  christmas day .    scrooge was the ogre of the family .  the mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party  which was not dispelled for full five minutes .   after it had passed away  they were ten times merrier than before  from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done with .  bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for master peter .  the two young cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of peter s being a man of business  and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars  as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favor when he came into receipt of the bewildering income .  martha  who was a poor apprentice at a milliner s  then told them what kind of work she had to do  and how many hours she worked at a stretch  and how she meant to be abed to morrow morning for a good long rest  to morrow being a holiday she passed at home .  also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before  and how the lord  was much about as tall as peter   at which peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn t have seen his head if you had been there .  by and by they had a song  about a lost child traveling in the snow  from tiny tim  who had a plaintive little voice  and sang it very well indeed .   there was nothing of high mark in this .  they were not a handsome family  they were not well dressed  their shoes were far from being waterproof  their clothes were scanty  and peter might have known  and very likely did  the inside of a pawnbroker s .  but they were happy  grateful  pleased with one another  and contented with the time  and when they faded  and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the spirit s torch at parting  scrooge had his eye upon them  and especially on tiny tim  until the last .   by this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily  and as scrooge and the spirit went along the streets  the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens  parlors  and all sorts of rooms  was wonderful .  here  the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner  with hot plates baking through and through before the fire  and deep red curtains  ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness .  there  all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters  brothers  cousins  uncles  aunts  and be the first to greet them .   it was a great surprise to scrooge  as he meditated on these scenes  to hear a hearty laugh .  it was a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognize it as his own nephew s  and to find himself in a bright  dry  gleaming room  with the spirit standing smiling by his side  and looking at that same nephew with approving affability .    ha .  ha .   laughed scrooge s nephew .   ha .  ha .  ha .    if you should happen  by any unlikely chance  to know a man more blessed in a laugh than scrooge s nephew  all i can say is  i should like to know him too .  introduce him to me  and i ll cultivate his acquaintance .   it is a fair  even handed  noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow  there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor .  when scrooge s nephew laughed in this way  holding his sides  rolling his head  and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions  scrooge s niece  by marriage  laughed as heartily as he .  and their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand  roared out lustily .    ha  ha .  ha  ha  ha  ha .     he said that christmas was a humbug  as i live .   cried scrooge s nephew .   he believed it  too .     more shame for him  fred .   said scrooge s niece  indignantly .  bless those women .  they never do anything by halves .  they are always in earnest .   she was very pretty  exceedingly pretty .  with a dimpled  surprised looking  capital face  a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be kissed  as no doubt it was  all kinds of good little dots about her chin  that melted into one another when she laughed  and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature s head .  altogether she was what you would have called provoking  you know  but satisfactory  too .  oh  perfectly satisfactory .    he s a comical old fellow   said scrooge s nephew   that s the truth  and not so pleasant as he might be .  however  his offences carry their own punishment  and i have nothing to say against him .     i have no patience with him   observed scrooge s niece .  scrooge s niece s sisters  and all the other ladies  expressed the same opinion .    oh  i have .   said scrooge s nephew .   i am sorry for him  i couldn t be angry with him if i tried .  who suffers by his ill whims .  himself  always .  here  he takes it into his head to dislike us  and he won t come and dine with us .  what s the consequence .  he don t lose much of a dinner .     indeed  i think he loses a very good dinner   interrupted scrooge s niece .  everybody else said the same  and they must be allowed to have been competent judges  because they had just had dinner  and with the dessert upon the table  were clustered round the fire  by lamp light .    well .  i am very glad to hear it   said scrooge s nephew   because i haven t any great faith in these young housekeepers .  what do you say  topper .    topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge s niece s sisters  for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast  who had no right to express an opinion on the subject .  whereat scrooge s niece s sister  the plump one with the lace tucker  not the one with the roses  blushed .    do go on  fred   said scrooge s niece  clapping her hands .   he never finishes what he begins to say .  he is such a ridiculous fellow .     i was only going to say   said scrooge s nephew   that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us  and not making merry with us  is  as i think  that he loses some pleasant moments  which could do him no harm .  i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts  either in his mouldy old office  or his dusty chambers .  i mean to give him the same chance every year  whether he likes it or not  for i pity him .  he may rail at christmas till he dies  but he can t help thinking better of it  i defy him  if he finds me going there  in good temper  year after year  and saying   uncle scrooge  how are you .   if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds  that s something  and i think i shook him yesterday .    it was their turn to laugh now  at the notion of his shaking scrooge .  but being thoroughly goodnatured  and not much caring what they laughed at  so that they laughed at any rate  he encouraged them in their merriment .   after tea they had some music  scrooge s niece played well  and played among other tunes a simple little air  a mere nothing  you might learn to whistle it in two minutes   which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the boarding school  as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past .  when this strain of music sounded  all the things that the ghost had shown him  came upon his mind  he softened more and more  and thought that if he could have listened to it often  years ago  he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands  without resorting to the sexton s spade that buried jacob marley .   but they didn t devote the whole evening to music .  after awhile they played at forfeits  for it is good to be children sometimes  and never better than at christmas  when its mighty founder was a child himself .   stop .  there was first a glorious game at blindman s buff .  of course there was .  and i no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he had eyes in his boots .  my opinion is  that it was a done thing between him and scrooge s nephew  and that the ghost of christmas present knew it .  the way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker  was an outrage on the credulity of human nature .  knocking down the fire irons  tumbling over the chairs  bumping up against the piano  smothering himself amongst the curtains  wherever she went  there went he .  he always knew where the plump sister was .  he wouldn t catch anybody else .  if you had fallen up against him   as some of them did  on purpose  he would have made a feint of endeavoring to seize you  which would have been an affront to your understanding  and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister .  she often cried out that it wasn t fair  and it really was not .  but when at last  he caught her  when  in spite of all her silken rustlings  and her rapid flutterings past him  he got her into a corner whence there was no escape  then his conduct was the most execrable .  for his pretending not to know her  his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head dress  and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger  and a certain chain about her neck  was vile  monstrous .  no doubt she told him her opinion of it when  another blind man being in office  they were so very confidential together  behind the curtains .   scrooge s niece was not one of the blind man s buff party  but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool  in a snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her .  but she joined in the forfeits  and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet .  likewise at the game of how  when  and where  she was very great  and  to the secret joy of scrooge s nephew  beat her sisters hollow  though they were sharp girls too  as topper could have told you .  there might have been twenty people there  young and old  but they all played  and so did scrooge  for  wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on  that his voice made no sound in their ears  he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud  and very often guessed right  too  for the sharpest needle  warranted not to cut in the eye  was not sharper than scrooge  blunt as he took it in his head to be .   the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood  and looked upon him with such favor  that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed .  but this the spirit said could not be done .  the whole scene passed off  and he and the spirit were again upon their travels .   much they saw  and far they went  and many homes they visited  but always with a happy end .  the spirit stood beside sick beds  and they were cheerful  on foreign lands  and they were close at home  by struggling men  and they were patient in their greater hope  by poverty  and it was rich .  in almshouse  hospital  and jail  in misery s every refuge  where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door  and barred the spirit out  he left his blessing  and taught scrooge his precepts .   it was a long night  if it were only a night  but scrooge had his doubts of this  because the christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together .  it was strange  too  that while scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form  the ghost grew older  clearly older .    forgive me if i am not justified in what i ask   said scrooge  looking intently at the spirit s robe   but i see something strange  and not belonging to yourself  protruding from your skirts .  is it a foot or a claw .     it might be a claw  for the flesh there is upon it   was the spirit s sorrowful reply .   look here .    from the foldings of its robe  it brought two children  wretched  abject  frightful  hideous  miserable .  they knelt down at its feet  and clung upon the outside of its garment .   they were a boy and girl .  yellow  meagre  ragged  scowling  wolfish  but prostrate  too  in their humility .  where graceful youth should have filled their features out  and touched them with its freshest tints  a stale and shriveled hand  like that of age  had pinched  and twisted them  and pulled them into shreds .  where angels might have sat enthroned  devils lurked  and glared out menacing .  no change  no degradation  no perversion of humanity  in any grade  through all the mysteries of wonderful creation  has monsters half so horrible and dread .   scrooge started back  appalled .  having them shown to him in this way  he tried to say they were fine children  but the words choked themselves  rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude .    spirit  are they yours .   scrooge could say no more .    they are man s   said the spirit  looking down upon them .   and they cling to me  appealing from their fathers .  this boy is ignorance .  this girl is want .  beware of them both  and all of their degree  but most of all beware of this boy .     have they no refuge or resource .   cried scrooge .    are there no prisons .   said the spirit  turning on him for the last time with his own words .   are there no work houses .    the bell struck twelve .   scrooge looked about him for the ghost  and saw it not .  as the last stroke ceased to vibrate  he remembered the prediction of old jacob marley  and lifting up his eyes  beheld a solemn phantom  draped and hooded  coming like a mist along the ground toward him .   stave four .   the last of the spirits .   the phantom slowly  gravely  silently  approached .  when it came near him  scrooge bent down upon his knee  for in the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery .   it was shrouded in a deep black garment  which concealed its head  its face  its form  and left nothing of it visible  save one outstretched hand .  but for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night  and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded .   he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him  and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread .  he knew no more  for the spirit neither spoke nor moved .    i am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come .   said scrooge .   the spirit answered not  but pointed onward with its hand .    you are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened  but will happen in the time before us   scrooge pursued .   is that so  spirit .    the upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds  as if the spirit had inclined its head .  that was the only answer he received .   although well used to ghostly company by this time  scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him  and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it .  the spirit paused a moment  as observing his condition  and giving him time to recover .   but scrooge was all the worse for this .  it thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror  to know that behind the dusky shroud  there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him  while he  though he stretched his own to the utmost  could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black .    ghost of the future .   he exclaimed   i fear you more than any spectre i have seen .  but as i know your purpose is to do me good and as i hope to live to be another man from what i was  i am prepared to bear you company  and do it with a thankful heart .  will you not speak to me .    it gave him no reply .  the hand was pointed straight before them .    lead on .   said scrooge .   lead on .  the night is waning fast  and it is precious time to me  i know .  lead on  spirit .    the phantom moved away as it had come toward him .  scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress  which bore him up  he thought  and carried him along .   they scarcely seemed to enter the city  for the city rather seemed to spring up about them  and encompass them of its own act .  but there they were in the heart of it  on  change  amongst the merchants  who hurried up and down  and chinked the money in their pockets  and conversed in groups  and looked at their watches  and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals  and so forth  as scrooge had seen them often .   the spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men .  observing that the hand was pointed to them  scrooge advanced to listen to their talk .    no   said a great fat man with a monstrous chin   i don t know much about it either way .  i only know he s dead .     when did he die .   inquired another .    last night  i believe .     what has he done with his money .   asked a red faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose  that shook like the gills of a turkey cock .    i haven t heard   said the man with the large chin  yawning again .   left it to his company  perhaps .  he hasn t left it to me .  that s all i know .    this pleasantry was received with a general laugh .    it s likely to be a very cheap funeral   said the same speaker   for upon my life i don t know of anybody to go to it .  suppose we make up a party and volunteer .     i don t mind going if a lunch is provided   observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose .   but i must be fed  if i make one .    another laugh .    well  i am the most disinterested among you  after all   said the first speaker   for i never wear black gloves  and i never eat lunch .  but i ll offer to go  if anybody else will .  when i come to think of it  i m not at all sure that i wasn t his most particular friend  for we used to stop and speak whenever we met .  bye  bye .    speakers and listeners strolled away  and mixed with other groups .  scrooge knew the men  and looked toward the spirit for explanation .  he was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial  but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose  he set himself to consider what it was likely to be .  they could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of jacob  his old partner  for that was past  and this ghost s province was the future .  nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself  to whom he could apply them .   they left the busy scene  and went into an obscure part of the town  where scrooge had never penetrated before  although he recognized its situation and its bad repute .  the ways were foul and narrow  the shops and houses wretched  the people half naked  drunken  slipshod  ugly .  alleys and archways  like so many cesspools  disgorged their offences of smell  and dirt  and life  upon the straggling streets  and the whole quarter reeked with crime  with filth and misery .   far in this den of infamous resort  there was a low browed  beetling shop  below a pent house roof  where iron  old rags  bottles  bones  and greasy offal were bought .  upon the floor within  were piled up heaps of rusty keys  nails  chains  hinges  files  scales  weights  and refuse iron of all kinds .  secrets that few would like to scrutinize were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags  masses of corrupted fat  and sepulchres of bones .  sitting in among the wares he dealt in  by a charcoal stove  made of old bricks  was a grey haired rascal  nearly seventy years of age  who had screened himself from the cold air without  by a frowsy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line  and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement .   scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man  just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop .  but she had scarcely entered  when another woman  similarly laden  came in too  and she was closely followed by a man in faded black  who was no less startled by the sight of them  than they had been upon the recognition of each other .  after a short period of blank astonishment  in which the old man with a pipe had joined them  they all three burst into a laugh .    let the charwoman alone to be the first .   cried she who had entered first .   let the laundress alone to be the second  and let the undertaker s man alone to be the third .  look here  old joe  here s a chance .  if we haven t all three met here without meaning it .     you couldn t have met in a better place   said old joe  removing his pipe from his mouth .   come into the parlor .    the parlor was the space behind the screen of rags .  the old man raked the fire together with an old stair rod  and having trimmed his smoky lamp  for it was night   with the stem of his pipe  put it into his mouth again .   while he did this  the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool  crossing her elbows on her knees  and looking with a bold defiance at the other two .   now  then .   cried the woman .   who s the worse for the loss of a few things like these .  not a dead man  i suppose .     no  indeed   said mrs .  dilber  laughing .    if he wanted to keep  em after he was dead  a wicked old screw   pursued the woman   why wasn t he natural in his lifetime .  if he had been  he d have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death  instead of lying gasping out his last there  alone by himself .     it s the truest word that ever was spoke   said mrs .  dilber .   it s a judgment on him .     i wish it was a little heavier judgment   replied the woman   and it should have been  you may depend upon it  if i could have laid my hands on anything else .  open that bundle  old joe  and let me know the value of it .  speak out plain .  i m not afraid to be the first  nor afraid for them to see it .  we knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves  before we met here  i believe .  open the bundle  joe .    but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this  and the man in faded black  mounting the breach first  produced his plunder .  it was not extensive .  a seal or two  a pencil case  a pair of sleeve buttons  and a brooch of no great value  were all .  they were severally examined and appraised by old joe  who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each  upon the wall  and added them up into a total when he found that there was nothing more to come .    that s your account   said joe   and i wouldn t give another sixpence  if i was to be boiled for not doing it .  who s next .    mrs .  dilber was next .  sheets and towels  a little wearing apparel  two old fashioned silver teaspoons  a pair of sugar tongs  and a few boots .  her account was stated on the wall in the same manner .    i always give too much to ladies .  it s a weakness of mine  and that s the way i ruin myself   said old joe .   that s your account .  if you asked me for another penny  and made it an open question  i d repent of being so liberal  and knock off half a crown .     and now undo my bundle  joe   said the first woman .   joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it  and having unfastened a great many knots  dragged out a large heavy roll of some dark stuff .    what do you call this .   said joe .   bed curtains .     ah .   returned the woman  laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms .   bed curtains .     you don t mean to say you took  em down rings and all  with him lying there .   said joe .    yes  i do   replied the woman .   why not .     you were born to make your fortune   said joe   and you ll certainly do it .     i certainly shan t hold my hand  when i can get anything in it by reaching it out  for the sake of such a man as he was  i promise you  joe   returned the woman coolly .   don t drop that oil upon the blankets  now .     his blankets .   asked joe .    whose else s do you think .   replied the woman .   he isn t likely to take cold without  em  i dare say .     i hope he didn t die of anything catching .  eh .   said old joe  stopping in his work  and looking up .    don t you be afraid of that   returned the woman .   i an t so fond of his company that i d loiter about him for such things  if he did .  ah .  you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache  but you won t find a hole in it  nor a threadbare place .  it s the best he had  and a fine one too .  they d have wasted it  if it hadn t been for me .     what do you call wasting of it .   asked old joe .    putting it on him to be buried in  to be sure   replied the woman with a laugh .   somebody was fool enough to do it  but i took it off again .  if calico ain t good enough for such a purpose  it isn t good enough for anything .  it s quite as becoming to the body .  he can t look uglier than he did in that one .    scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror .  as they sat grouped about their spoil  in the scanty light afforded by the old man s lamp  he viewed them with a detestation and disgust  which could hardly have been greater  though they had been obscene demons  marketing the corpse itself .    ha  ha .   laughed the same woman  when old joe  producing a flannel bag with money in it  told out their several gains upon the ground .   this is the end of it  you see .  he frightened everyone away from him when he was alive  to profit us when he was dead .  ha .  ha .  ha .     spirit .   said scrooge  shuddering from head to foot   i see  i see .  the case of this unhappy man might be my own .  my life tends that way  now .  merciful heaven  what is this .    he recoiled in terror  for the scene had changed  and now he almost touched a bed  a bare  uncurtained bed  on which  beneath a ragged sheet  there lay a something covered up which  though it was dumb  announced itself in awful language .   the room was very dark  too dark to be observed with any accuracy  though scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse  anxious to know what kind of room it was .  a pale light rising in the outer air  fell straight upon the bed  and on it  plundered and bereft  unwatched  unwept  uncared for  was the body of this man .   scrooge glanced toward the phantom .  its steady hand was pointed to the head .  the cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it  the motion of a finger upon scrooge s part  would have disclosed the face .  he thought of it  felt how easy it would be to do  and longed to do it  but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side .    spirit .   he said   this is a fearful place .  in leaving it  i shall not leave its lesson  trust me .  let us go .    still the ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head .    i understand you   scrooge returned   and i would do it if i could .  but i have not the power  spirit .  i have not the power .    again it seemed to look upon him .    if there is any person in the town  who feels emotion caused by this man s death   said scrooge  quite agonized   show that person to me  spirit  i beseech you .    the phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment  like a wing  and withdrawing it  revealed a room by daylight  where a mother and her children were .   she was expecting some one  and with anxious eagerness  for she walked up and down the room  started at every sound  looked out from the window  glanced at the clock  tried  but in vain  to work with her needle  and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play .   at length the long expected knock was heard .  she hurried to the door and met her husband  a man whose face was care worn and depressed  though he was young .  there was a remarkable expression in it now  a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed  and which he struggled to repress .   he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire  and when she asked him faintly what news  which was not until after a long silence   he appeared embarrassed how to answer .    is it good   she said   or bad .    to help him .    bad   he answered .    we are quite ruined .     no .  there is hope yet  caroline .     if he relents   she said  amazed   there is .  nothing is past hope  if such a miracle has happened .     he is past relenting   said her husband .   he is dead .    she was a mild and patient creature  if her face spoke truth  but she was thankful in her soul to hear it  and she said so  with clasped hands .  she prayed forgiveness the next moment  and was sorry  but the first was the emotion of her heart .    what the half drunken woman  whom i told you of last night  said to me  when i tried to see him and obtain a week s delay  and what i thought was a mere excuse to avoid me  turns out to have been quite true .  he was not only very ill  but dying  then .     to whom will our debt be transferred .     i don t know .  but before that time we shall be ready with the money  and even though we were not  it would be bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor .  we may sleep to night with light hearts  caroline .    yes .  soften it as they would  their hearts were lighter .  the children s faces  hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood  were brighter  and it was a happier house for this man s death .  the only emotion that the ghost could show him  caused by the event  was one of pleasure .    let me see some tenderness connected with the death   said scrooge   or that dark chamber  spirit  which we left just now  will be for ever present to me .    the ghost conducted him through several streets to poor bob cratchit s house  the dwelling he had visited before  and found the mother and the children seated round the fire .   quiet .  very quiet .  the noisy little cratchits were as still as statues in one corner  and sat looking up at peter  who had a book before him .  the mother and her daughters were sewing .  but surely they were very quiet .     and he took a child  and set him in the midst of them .     where had scrooge heard those words .  he had not dreamed them .  the boy must have read them out  as he and the spirit crossed the threshold .  why did he not go on .   the mother laid her work upon the table  and put her hand up to her face .    the color hurts my eyes   she said .   the color .  ah  poor tiny tim .    they re better now again   said cratchit s wife .   it makes them weak by candle light  and i wouldn t show weak eyes to your father when he comes home  for the world .  it must be near his time .     past it rather   peter answered  shutting up his book .   but i think he has walked a little slower than he used  these few last evenings  mother .    they were very quiet again .  at last she said  and in a steady  cheerful voice  that only faltered once    i have known him walk with  i have known him walk with tiny tim upon his shoulder  very fast indeed .     and so have i   cried peter .   often .     and so have i   exclaimed another .  so had all .    but he was very light to carry   she resumed  intent upon her work   and his father loved him so  that it was no trouble  no trouble .  and there is your father at the door .    she hurried out to meet him  and little bob in his comforter  he had need of it  poor fellow  came in .  his tea was ready for him  and they all tried who should help him to it most .  then the two young cratchits got upon his knees and laid  each child  a little cheek against his face  as if they said   don t mind it  father .  don t be grieved .    bob was very cheerful with them  and spoke pleasantly to all the family .  he looked at the work upon the table  and praised the industry and speed of mrs .  cratchit and the girls .  they would be done long before sunday  he said .    sunday .  you went to day  then  robert .   said his wife .    yes  my dear   returned bob .   i wish you could have gone .  it would have done you good to see how green a place it is .  but you ll see it often .  i promised him that i would walk there on a sunday .  my little  little child .   cried bob .   my little child .    he broke down all at once .  he couldn t help it .  if he could have helped it  he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were .    spectre   said scrooge   something informs me that our parting moment is at hand .  i know it  but i know not how .  tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead .    the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him as before into the resorts of business men  but showed him not himself .  indeed  the spirit did not stay for anything  but went straight on  as to the end just now desired  until besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment .    this court   said scrooge   through which we hurry now  is where my place of occupation is  and has been for a length of time .  i see the house .  let me behold what i shall be  in days to come .    the spirit stopped  the hand was pointed elsewhere .    the house is yonder  scrooge exclaimed .   why do you point away .    the inexorable finger underwent no change .   scrooge hastened to the window of his office  and looked in .  it was an office still  but not his .  the furniture was not the same  and the figure in the chair was not himself .  the phantom pointed as before .   he joined it once again  and wondering why and whither he had gone  accompanied it until they reached an iron gate .  he paused to look round before entering .   a churchyard .  here  then  the wretched man whose name he had now to learn  lay underneath the ground .  it was a worthy place .  walled in by houses  overrun by grass and weeds  the growth of vegetation s death  not life  choked up with too much burying  fat with repleted appetite .  a worthy place .   the spirit stood among the graves  and pointed down to one .  he advanced toward it trembling .  the phantom was exactly as it had been  but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape .    before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point   said scrooge   answer me one question .  are these the shadows of the things that will be  or are they shadows of the things that may be  only .    still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood .    men s courses will foreshadow certain ends  to which  if persevered in  they must lead   said scrooge   but if the courses be departed from  the ends will change .  say it is thus with what you show me .    the spirit was immovable as ever .   scrooge crept toward it  trembling as he went  and following the finger  read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name  ebenezer scrooge .    am i that man who lay upon the bed .   he cried  upon his knees .   the finger pointed from the grave to him  and back again .    no  spirit .  oh  no  no .    the finger still was there .   holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed  he saw an alteration in the phantom s hood and dress .  it shrunk  collapsed  and dwindled down into a bedpost .   stave five .   the end of it .   yes .  and the bedpost was his own .  the bed was his own  and the room was his own .  best and happiest of all  the time before him was his own  to make amends in .   he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions  that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call .  he had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the spirit  and his face was wet with tears .    they are not torn down   cried scrooge  folding one of his bed curtains in his arms   they are not torn down  rings and all .  they are here  i am here  the shadows of the things that would have been  may be dispelled .  they will be .  i know they will .    he had frisked into the sitting room  and was now standing there  perfectly winded .    there s the saucepan that the gruel was in .   cried scrooge  starting off again  and going round the fire place .   there s the door by which the ghost of jacob marley entered .  there s the corner where the ghost of christmas present sat .  there s the window where i saw the wandering spirits .  it s all right  it s all true  it all happened .  ha  ha  ha .    really  for a man who had been out of practice for so many years  it was a splendid laugh  a most illustrious laugh .  the father of a long  long line of brilliant laughs .    i don t know what day of the month it is   said scrooge .   i don t know how long i have been among the spirits .  i don t know anything .  i m quite a baby .  never mind .  i don t care .  i d rather be a baby .  hallo .  whoop .  hallo here .    he was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard .  clash  clash  hammer  ding  dong  bell .  bell  dong  ding  hammer  clang  clash .  oh  glorious  glorious .   running to the window  he opened it and put out his head .    what s to day .   cried scrooge  calling downward to a boy in sunday clothes  who perhaps had loitered in to look about him .    eh .   returned the boy  with all his might of wonder .    what s to day  my fine fellow .   said scrooge .    to day .   replied the boy .   why  christmas day .     it s christmas day .   said scrooge to himself .   i haven t missed it .  the spirits have done it all in one night .  hallo  my fine fellow .     hallo .   returned the boy .    do you know the poulterer s  in the next street but one  at the corner .   scrooge inquired .    i should hope i did   replied the lad .    an intelligent boy .   said scrooge .   a remarkable boy .  do you know whether they ve sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there .     it s hanging there now   replied the boy .    is it .   said scrooge .   go and buy it .     walk er .   exclaimed the boy .    no  no   said scrooge   i am in earnest .  go and buy it  and tell  em to bring it here  that i may give them the directions where to take it .  come back with the man  and i ll give you a shilling .    the boy was off like a shot .    i ll send it to bob cratchit s   whispered scrooge  rubbing his hands  and splitting with a laugh .   he shan t know who sends it .  it s twice the size of tiny tim .    the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one  but write it he did  somehow  and went down stairs to open the street door  ready for the coming of the poulterer s man .   the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey  and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy  were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again  and chuckled till he cried .   he dressed himself  all in his best   and got out into the streets .  the people were by this time pouring forth  as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present  and walking with his hands behind him  scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile .  he looked so irresistibly pleasant  in a word  that three or four good humored fellows said  good morning  sir .  a merry christmas to you .   and scrooge said often afterward  that of all the blithe sounds he ever heard  those were the blithest in his ears .   he had not gone far  when coming on toward him he beheld the portly gentleman  who had walked into his counting house the day before  and said  scrooge and marley s  i believe .   it sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met  but he knew what path lay straight before him  and he took it .    my dear sir   said scrooge  quickening his pace  and taking the old gentleman by both his hands   how do you do .  i hope you succeeded yesterday .  it was very kind of you .  a merry christmas to you  sir .     mr .  scrooge .     yes   said scrooge .   that is my name  and i fear it may not be pleasant to you .  allow me to ask your pardon .  and will you have the goodness   here scrooge whispered in his ear .    lord bless me .   cried the gentleman  as if his breath were taken away .   my dear mr .  scrooge  are you serious .     if you please   said scrooge .   not a farthing less .  a great many back payments are included in it  i assure you .  will you do me that favor .     my dear sir   said the other  shaking hands with him   i don t know what to say to such munifi      don t say anything  please   retorted scrooge .   come and see me .  will you come and see me .     i will .   cried the old gentleman .  and it was clear he meant to do it .    thank ee   said scrooge .   i am much obliged to you .  i thank you fifty times .  bless you .    he went to church  and walked about the streets and watched the people hurrying to and fro  and patted the children on the head  and looked down into the kitchens of houses  and up to the windows  and found everything could yield him pleasure .  he had never dreamed that any walk  that any thing  could give him so much happiness .  in the afternoon  he turned his steps toward his nephew s house .   he passed the door a dozen times  before he had the courage to go up and knock .  but he made a dash  and did it .    is your master at home  my dear .   said scrooge to the girl .  nice girl .  very .    yes  sir .     where is he .   said scrooge .    he s in the dining room  sir  along with mistress .  i ll show you up stairs  if you please .     thank ee .  he knows me   said scrooge  with his hand already on the dining room lock .   i ll go in here  my dear .    he turned it gently  and sidled his face in  round the door .  they were looking at the table  which was spread out in great array   for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points  and like to see that everything is right .    fred .   said scrooge .    why  bless my soul .   cried fred   who s that .     it s i .  your uncle scrooge .  i have come to dinner .  will you let me in  fred .    let him in .  it is a mercy he didn t shake his arm off .  he was at home in five minutes .  nothing could be heartier .   but he was early at the office next morning .  oh  he was early there .  if he could only be there first  and catch bob cratchit coming late .  that was the thing he had set his heart upon .   and he did it  yes  he did .  the clock struck nine .  no bob .  a quarter past .  no bob .  he was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time .  scrooge sat with his door wide open  that he might see him come into the tank .   his hat was off  before he opened the door  his comforter too .  he was on his stool in a jiffy  driving away with his pen  as if he were trying to overtake nine o clock .    hallo .   growled scrooge  in his accustomed voice as near as he could feign it .   what do you mean by coming here at this time of day .     i am very sorry  sir   said bob .   i am behind my time .     you are .   repeated scrooge .   yes .  i think you are .  step this way  sir  if you please .     it s only once a year  sir   pleaded bob  appearing from the tank .   it shall not be repeated .  i was making rather merry yesterday  sir .     now  i ll tell you what  my friend   said scrooge .   i am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer .  and therefore i am about to raise your salary .     a merry christmas  bob .   said scrooge  with an earnestness that could not be mistaken  as he clapped him on the back   a merrier christmas  bob  my good fellow  than i have given you for many a year .  i ll raise your salary  and endeavor to assist your struggling family  and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon .  make up the fires  and buy another coal scuttle before you dot another i  bob cratchit .    scrooge was better than his word .  he did it all  and infinitely more  and to tiny tim  who did not die  he was a second father .  he became as good a friend  as good a master  and as good a man  as the good old city knew  or any other good old city  town  or borough  in the good old world .  some people laughed to see the alteration in him  but he let them laugh  and little heeded them  for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe  for good  at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset  and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway  he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins  as have the malady in less attractive forms .  his own heart laughed  and that was quite enough for him .   he had no further intercourse with spirits  but lived upon the total abstinence principle  ever afterward  and it was always said of him  that he knew how to keep christmas well  if any man alive possessed the knowledge .  may that be truly said of us  and all of us .  and so  as tiny tim observed  god bless us  every one .              the christmas babe .   by margaret e .  sangster .   we love to think of bethlehem  that little mountain town  to which  on earth s first christmas day  our blessed lord came down .  a lowly manger for his bed  the cattle near in stall  there  cradled close in mary s arms  he slept  the lord of all .   if we had been in bethlehem  we too had hasted fain to see the babe whose little face knew neither care nor pain .  like any little child of ours  he came unto his own  through cross and shame before him stretched    his pathway to his throne .   if we had dwelt in bethlehem  we would have followed fast  and where the star had led our feet have knelt ere dawn was past .  our gifts  our songs  our prayers had been an offering  as he lay  the blessed babe of bethlehem  in mary s arms that day .   now breaks the latest christmas morn .  again the angels sing  and far and near the children throng their happy hymns to bring .  all heaven is stirred .  all earth is glad .  for down the shining way  the lord who came to bethlehem  comes yet  on christmas day .              a western christmas in the old days .   by mrs .  w .  h .  corning .   christmas week there was no school  but such a succession of dining days  and visiting days  and day parties  and night parties  that fanny  who looked forward to the week as a season of rest  thought that the regular routine of school duties would be less fatiguing .   christmas at la belle prairie was the one jubilee of the year  something to be talked about for six months beforehand  and to be remembered as long after .  it was a time of feasting and recreation for both master and servant .  days before  preparations commenced in the kitchen .  various smells issued from thence  savory smells of boiled  baked  and roasted meats  and sweet delicious smells of warm pastry and steaming cakes .  aunt tibby was rolling pie crust or stirring cake all day long  and the chopping of sausage meat  the pounding of spices  and the beating of eggs were constantly heard .  everything was carried on with the greatest secrecy .  the children were all kept out of the kitchen  and when  somefin  good  was to be transferred therefrom to miss car line s store room  aunt tibby came sailing in  holding it high above the reach of the curious little heads .    i don t care   said cal .   there s six pound cakes all in a row on the store room shelf .  i see  em when ma opened the door  and marthy says one of  em got currants in it  and there s a little shoat thar roasted whole .  o .  how i wish christmas was come .    coming suddenly upon maud one day  fanny found her with her apron half full of bran  while her fingers were busily at work upon a few pieces of faded silk .  maud tried to hide them at first  but finding by fanny s question of  what is it  maud .   that it was too late  she had looked up with a tired  flushed face and said    miss fanny  don t you tell now .  will you .  i m makin  a pin cushion for aunt phoebe  but it won t come square  all i can do .  it acts awfully .     let me see what the trouble is   said fanny  and sitting down  she examined the poor cushion  which  indeed  under maud s hands  was not soon likely to come into shape .    you see   said maud   i want to give aunty a christmas gift  and i thought a cushion would be so nice   cause her old one that she wears pinned to her waist  you know  has burst a great hole  and the bran keeps tumbling out .  i m going to make her a right nice one  only i wish  twas brighter   cause aunty likes red  and yellow  and all them  so bad .    fanny searched her piece bag and brought forth bits of gay ribbon  the sight of which threw maud into ecstasies of delight  then giving up the morning to the job  she cut and planned  and fitted and basted together  getting all in order  so that maud could do the sewing herself .    aunty wouldn t think half so much of it if i didn t   said the child .   well and faithfully maud performed her labor of love  giving up her much prized runs on the prairie  and resisting all the children s entreaties to play with them  till the christmas gift was finished .  it was no small task  for maud most heartily hated to sew  and her fingers were anything but nimble in the operation .   i always did despise to sew  miss fanny   she said   but i m going to make this cushion for aunty anyhow .    it was finished at last  and  as maud expressed it   was just as beautiful as it could be .   there never was a prouder  happier child .  she did not thank fanny in words for her assistance  but that night she came softly behind her  and putting her arms around her neck  gave her an earnest kiss  a proceeding which called forth an exclamation of surprise from mrs .  catlett  for maud was very chary of her caresses .   christmas morning came  and long before daylight  every child upon the place  both black and white  was up ready to  march in christmas .   there had been mysterious preparations the night before  such as the hiding of tin pans and glass bottles under the bed  and the faint tooting of an old horn  heard down at the quarters  as though some one was rehearsing a part .  fanny was also astonished by an application from little  darky tom  for permission to use her school bell  the said cow tinkler not being remarkable for sweetness of sound .    o  yes  tom  you may take it  but what can you want of it .     couldn t tell no ways  miss fanny   said tom  with a grin .   mebbe miss fanny know in de mornin  .    morning did indeed bring an explanation of the mystery .  assembling in the yard  the children marshaled themselves into marching order  maud  of course  being captain  and taking the lead  bearing an old tin horn  while little black tom brought up the rear with fanny s unfortunate cow bell .   in this order they commenced  marching in christmas  to the music of the horn  the beating of tin pans  the rattling of bits of iron and pieces of wood  the jingling of bells  and the clapping of hands .  into the house  and up stairs to the very doors of the sleeping rooms  they all marched with their horrid din .  it was received with tolerable good humor by all but nanny  who  deprived of her morning nap by the tumult  raved at the juvenile disturbers of the peace  and finally threw her shoes at them as they stood on the stairway .  these were directly seized upon as trophies  and carried off in triumph to the quarters  where the young performers went through with the same operations .    christmas gift .  christmas gift .   was the first salutation from the servants this morning  and it was well worth while to give them some trifling present  were it only to hear their extravagant expressions of gratitude and delight .  it was impossible to forget for a moment that it was christmas .  one could see it in the faces of the servants  released for a whole week from their daily tasks  and rejoicing in the prospect of dances  and parties  and visits to friends and kindred on distant plantations .  the children  too  with their boisterous merriment and constant talk about the holidays  seemed determined to bear it in mind  and the great dinner  the one dinner of the year  in the preparation of which aunt tibby had exercised all her skill  this  in itself  seemed to proclaim that it was christmas .    oh  miss fanny   said little joy   don t you wish christmas lasted the whole year round .    the short december day was fast drawing to a close  as a party of four rode leisurely along the road crossing la belle prairie .  the ladies  though scarcely recognizable in their close hoods  long blue cotton riding skirts  and thick gloves  were none other than miss nancy catlett and our friend fanny  while their attendants were mr .  chester  the town gentleman  and massa dave catlett  who had come over from his new home in kansas  on purpose to enjoy the christmas festivities on the prairie .  one of those night parties  of which nanny had talked so much  was to come off at col .  turner s  and this was the place of their destination .  in accordance with the customs of society in these parts  they were to remain until the next day  and  accordingly  black viny rode a little in the rear  mounted upon old  poke neck   and bearing sundry carpet bags and valises  containing the ladies  party dresses .   just at dusk  our party reached their journey s end  and dismounting one by one from the horse block in front of the house  they walked up the road  and were met in the porch by miss bell turner  nanny s particular friend .  this young lady  with long curls and a very slender waist  performed the duties of hostess in a free and easy manner  ushering the gentlemen into the parlor  where a fire was blazing on the hearth  while the ladies  with their attendants  were conducted up stairs to the dressing room .   here a dozen or more were engaged in the mysteries of the toilet  braiding  twisting  and curling  while as many servants were flying about  stumbling over each other  and creating the most dire confusion in their efforts to supply the wants of their respective mistresses .  the beds and chairs were covered with dresses  capes  ribbons  curling irons  flowers  combs  and brushes  and all the paraphernalia of the toilet  while the ladies themselves kept up a continual stream of conversation with each other and their attendants .   into this scene nanny entered with great spirit .  shaking hands all round  and introducing fanny  she hastily threw off her bonnet and shawl  and bidding viny unpack the things  she set about dressing in good earnest .    how nice to get here so early   she said .   now we can have a chance at the glass  and plenty of room to move about in .    fanny wondered what she called plenty of room  but had yet to learn the signification of the term when applied to the dressing room of a western party .  thicker and faster came the arrivals  and it being necessary that each lady should undergo a thorough transformation in dress  before making her appearance down stairs  the labor and confusion necessary to bring this about can be imagined .  such hurryings to and fro  such knockings down and pickings up  such scolding and laughing  in short such a babel of sounds as filled the room for an hour or two  fanny had never heard before .  completing her own toilet as soon as possible  she seated herself upon one of the beds  and watched the proceedings with great interest .    you suke  bring me some more pins  directly .    o please  miss ellen  mind my wreath .    jule  how much longer are you goin  to keep the wash bowl .    dar now  miss eveline done get her coat all wet .    did you know tom walton was here .  i see him in the passage .    miss belle  that s my starch bag .    there  now .  don t them slippers fit beautiful .    why don t that girl come back .    o  liza  just fasten up my dress  that s a dear girl .    come  girls  do hurry  we shan t be dressed to night .    how it was all brought about  fanny could not tell  but at last the ladies were dressed  the last sash pinned  and the last curl adjusted .  dresses of thin material  cut low in the neck  with short sleeves  seemed to be the order of the night  which with wreaths  and bunches of artificial flowers in the hair  gave the ladies a handsome appearance .  with miss belle at the head  they all descended to the parlor  and found the gentlemen strolling about  employing themselves as they could  till the night s amusements commenced  and  indeed  both ladies and gentlemen manifested such eagerness to adjourn to the play room  that the signal was soon given  and they proceeded forthwith to a log building in the yard  formerly used as a school room .   games soon commenced  and were carried on with great vigor  the young people making up in activity what was lacking in gracefulness of motion .  game after game was made out  the ladies vying with each other to see who should laugh the most  while those who were left chatted gayly together in groups  or tried their powers of fascination upon some long limbed specimen of humanity .    what calls the gentlemen up stairs so frequently .   inquired fanny  innocently  as groups of two and three disappeared up the steps leading to the room above .    you are not aware  then  what a formidable rival the ladies have up in the loft .   said mr .  chester  gravely  though there was a comical expression about the corners of his mouth .    no  indeed .     well  i only hope you may not witness the overpowering influence sometimes exerted by this same rival   said mr .  chester   but honestly  miss hunter  there is serious danger that some of these light footed young gentlemen may  ere long  be obliged to relinquish their places in our party  all through the attractions presented to them up yonder .     i don t in the least know what you mean .     in plain words  then  they are talking about horses up there  men are crazy over horses you know .     are you in earnest  mr .  chester .     certainly i am .  it would not answer  i suppose  for ladies to intrude upon their modest retirement  or i could convince you in a moment .     how can you joke about it  mr .  chester .  i think it is perfectly scandalous .     well  it is bad enough   said her companion  more gravely .   one living at the west becomes accustomed to such things .     i never will   said fanny .   if i had known these christmas parties countenanced such impoliteness  i would have stayed at home .     a set supper   nanny had several times expressed a hope that mrs .  turner would provide  and she was not disappointed .  the long table was bountifully spread with the substantials of this life  and though not in the style of an entertainment in fifth avenue  it was admirably suited to the guests who partook of it .  a roasted  shoat  graced each end of the board  a side of bacon the centre  while salted beef  cut in thin slices  with pickles and cheese  constituted the side dishes .  hot coffee  corn bread and biscuit were passed to each guest  and a piece of pound cake and a little preserved fruit for dessert .   there was plenty of laughter and hearty joking at the table  and the flushed faces and increased volubility of the gentlemen gave too certain evidence of the truth of mr .  chester s assertions .    the langest day maun hae an end   says the old scotch proverb  audit was with a sigh of relief that fanny at last saw uncle jake lay down the tortured fiddle  and the guests with lingering steps and wishful eyes retire to seek the few hours of repose that were left of the night .   confusion worse confounded  reigned for a time in the apartment appropriated to the ladies  use  and the numerous couches spread upon the floor increased the difficulty of navigation .  at last  when quiet seemed restored  and fanny was sinking into a peaceful sleep  she was aroused by her neighbors in an adjoining bed  three young ladies who declared that they were  all but starved  and must have something to eat before they could go to sleep .   one of the black women was despatched to the store room for some slices of cold bacon  and sitting up in bed  with the candle before them  they made a hearty repast .    of course  you can t eat half as much as you want at table   said one of the young ladies  apologetically   one always wants to appear delicate like before the gentlemen .     what in goodness  name  nan  made breakfast so late .   said dave the next morning  or rather noon  as they were returning home   i thought one while we wasn t goin  to get any .    why  you see  they hadn t any wheat flour in the house for the biscuit   said nanny   and they had to send three miles over the prairie to mr .  john turner s to borrow some .     twenty people invited to stay over night  and no flour in the house .   said fanny  in amazement .    it rather shocks your yankee ideas of looking out ahead  miss hunter   said mr .  chester  laughing .   we are used to such things out this way .     oh .  miss fanny  people can t remember everything  you know   said nanny   belle says they never thought a word about it till this morning .               joe s search for santa claus .   by irving bacheller  a story  my child .  well  there s none that i know as good as the story about little joe .  he lived with his mother  just under the eaves of a tenement high  where the telegraph weaves its highway of wire  that everywhere goes  and makes the night musical when the wind blows .  their home had no father  the two were bereft of all but their appetites  those never left .  joe s grew with his thought  a day never passed he spent not in hunger to make the food last  and days when his mother silently went and stood by the windows  joe knew what it meant .  they d nothing for supper .  the words were so sad that somehow they drowned all the hunger he had .  and surely god s miracles never have ceased   joe s hunger grew less when his sorrows increased .  when the coal ran out in winter s worst storm  the fire burnt the harder that kept their hearts warm .  their windows revealed many wonderful sights  long acres of roofing and high flying kites  at sunset  the great vault of heaven aglow  the lining of gold on the clouds hanging low  the cross on the top of st .  mary s high tower ablaze with the light of that magical hour  and still  as the arrows of light slanted higher  the last thing in sight was the great cross of fire .  each day  as it vanished  the history old of christ s crucifixion was reverently told  to him the boy learned to confide all his woes  but oftenest prayed for a new suit of clothes  since those that he wore didn t fit him at all   the coat was too large and the trousers too small  and joe looked so queer  from his head to his feet  it grieved his proud soul to be seen in the street .  and sometimes he cherished a secret desire to own a hand sled  or to build a bonfire  but reached one conclusion by various routes   he could have better fun with a new pair of boots .  he thought how the old pair  when shiny and whole .  had squeaked in a way that delighted his soul  and remembrance grew sad as he strutted around and tried hard  but vainly  to waken that sound .  the day before christmas brought trouble for joe  a thousand times worse .   twas a terrible blow to hear that old santa claus  god of his dreams .  would not come that year with his fleet footed teams .  he d seen them .  why  once  of a night s witching hour he saw them jump over the cross on the tower and scamper away o er the snow covered roofs  his heart beating time to the sound of their hoofs .  not coming this year .  santa claus must be dead  he thought  as with sad tears he crept into bed .  and  as he lay thinking  the long strings of wire sang low in the wind like a deep sounding lyre  and joe caught the notes of this solemn refrain    he ll not come again .  no  he ll not come again .   and oh .  how the depths of his spirit were stirred by thoughts that were born of the music he heard .  how cold were the winds  and they sang in their strife  of storms yet to come in the winters of life .  they mocked him  but mark how the faith of the child stood firm as a fortress  its hope undefiled  for still the boy thought that  if santa claus knew how great were their needs and their comforts how few  he would come  and at length  when the first rays of light had fathomed the infinite depths of the night  and brightened the windows  joe cautiously crept out of bed  and he dressed while his mother still slept  and down the long stairways on tiptoe he ran  then out in the snow  with the will of a man  he went  looking hither and thither  because  poor boy .  he was trying to find santa claus .  he hurried along through the snow burdened street as if the good angels were guiding his feet  and as the sun rose in the heavens apace  a radiance fell on his uplifted face that came from the cross gleaming far overhead   a symbol of hope for the living and dead .  a moment he looked at the great house of prayer  then slyly peeked in to see what was there  and entering softly he wandered at will through pathways of velvet  deserted and still  and saw the light grow on a wonderful scene of ivy twined columns and arches of green  and back of the rail  where the clergyman knelt  he sat on the cushions to see how they felt .  how soft was that velvet he stroked with his hand .  but when he lay down  oh  the feeling was grand .  and while he was musing the walls seemed to sway  and slowly the windows went moving away .  what  ho .  there he comes .  with his big pack and all  down the sunbeams that slope from the high windowed wall  and joe tried to speak  but could not  if he died  when santa claus came and sat down by his side .   a tenement boy .  humph .  he probably swears .    joe trembled  and tried hard to think of his prayers .   he lifted joe s eyelids  he patted his brow  and said .   he is not a bad boy  anyhow .   but hark .  there is music  a deep swelling sound is sweeping on high as if heavenward bound .  and suddenly waking  joe saw kneeling there the rector  long robed  who was reading a prayer .   provide for the fatherless children   said he  the widowed  the helpless  the bond and the free .   the rector stops praying  his face wears a frown  a ragged young gamin is pulling his gown .   i knowed you would come   said the boy  half in fright    i knowed you would come  i was watchin  all night .  say .  what are ye goin  t give mother an  me .  le me see what  tis  santa claus  please le me see .   the rector looked down into joe s honest face  and a great wave of feeling swept over the place  and tenderly laying his hand on joe s head  he turned to the people and solemnly said   we pray that the poor may be sheltered and fed  and we leave it to heaven to furnish the bread .  ye know  while he feedeth the fowls in the air .  the children of mankind he leaves to man s care   and kissing joe s face the preacher said then   of such is the kingdom of heaven .  amen .   that day santa claus came to many a door he d forgotten to call at the evening before .  was little joe lucky .  well  now  you are right .  and the wires sang merrily all the next night .                angela s christmas .   by julia schayer .    then it is  yes   father dear .   said angela  looking across the breakfast table with a smile .  it was her mother s smile  and the girl had filled her mother s vacant chair for more than a year .   the eyes of the father and daughter met  and angela knew  before a word was said  that she had conquered .    i hate to see you at your age  beginning to worry over these things   ephraim frazier said  regretfully .   let the old women take care of the charities  dear .  you keep on dancing in the sunshine a while longer  daughter .    angela s smile grew graver  but not less sweet .    i am twenty  dear   she said .   too old to dance all the time  and i cannot help thinking  you know .  and  it s no use  papa dear .  i must do something .  it is  yes   isn t it .     you are sure you won t mind being criticised and ridiculed .     quite sure .   answered angela .    and sure you won t take your failures and disappointments to heart too deeply .     quite sure i can bear them bravely   answered the girl .   if only one  just one  of those poor creatures may be helped  and lifted up  and brought out of darkness  it will be worth trying for .     and what does robert johns say about it .    a glow kindled in angela s face .    robert is in perfect sympathy with me   she said softly .  then again  this time having risen and gone around to his side  to speak with her face against the old banker s smoothly shaven cheek   it is  yes   isn t it  daddy dear .     well  yes .  only you must go slow  dear .  you are not over strong  you know .    and soon it came to pass that on a vacant lot  hitherto given over to refuse heaps  haunted by stray cats  ragpickers  and vagrant children  in one of the vilest quarters of the metropolis  there sprang up  with magic swiftness  a commodious frame building  surrounded by smooth green sod  known in the lower circles as the locust street home  in upper circles  laughingly denominated  angela s experiment .    angela did not mind .  it was mostly goodnatured laughter  and many of the laughers ended by lending willing hands and hearts to the cause .  it was wonderful how the news spread through the city s purlieus that here was a sanctuary into which cold  hunger  and fatigue dared not intrude  a place which the lowest might enter and be made welcome  and go unquestioned  his personal rights as carefully respected as though he were one of the four hundred .   that was angela s theory .  no man  woman  or child should be compelled to anything .  first make their bodies comfortable  then surround them with ennobling influences and examples  entertain them  arouse them  stimulate them  hold out the helping hand  and leave the rest to god .   they shall not even be compelled to be clean .   she said  laughing .   if the beautiful clean bathrooms and clean clothing do not tempt them to cleanliness  then so be it .  i will have no rules  only influences .  you will see .    and people did see  and wondered .   sometimes  on warm  pleasant evenings  the spacious  cheerful hall  with its tables and chairs  would be almost empty  but on nights like that on which this story opens  a dark  cold december night  the seats were apt to be well filled  mostly with slatternly  hard featured women  and dull faced children  who sat staring stolidly about  while the music and speaking went on  half stupefied by the warmth and tranquillity so foreign to their lives .   outside  a dismal sleet was falling  but from the open door of the vestibule a great sheet of light fell upon the wet pavement  and above it glowed a transparency bearing the words    a merry christmas to all .  come in .    it was while the singing was going on  led by a high  sweet girl s voice  that a human figure came hobbling out from a side street  and stopped short at the very edge of the lighted space .   a woman by her dress  an old  old woman  with a seamed  blotched face  an ugly  human wreck  all torn and battered and discolored by the storms of life .  such was old marg   luny marg   as she was called in the haunts that knew her best .  her history .  she had forgotten it herself  very likely  and there was no one to know or care  no one in the wide world to care if she should at any moment be trampled to death  or slip from the dock into the black river .  the garret which lodged her would find another tenant  the children of the gutters another target for their missiles .  not that she was worse than others  only that she was old and ugly and sharp of tongue  and the world  even her world  has no use for such as she .   for some time this forlorn creature continued to hover on the edge of the lighted space .  the sleet had become snow  and already a thin white film covered the pavement  promising  a white christmas   and the cold increased from moment to moment .   the woman drew her filthy shawl closer  her jaws chattered  yet she seemed unable to tear herself from the spot .  her eyes  alert under their gray brows  as a rat s  were fixed now upon the open door  now upon the transparency  yet she made no motion toward the proffered shelter .  two men  hirsute and ragged  stopped near her and  after a moments consultation  slunk across the square of light and disappeared in the building .  as the door was opened  there came a fuller burst of song  and a rush of warm air  fragrant with the aroma of coffee and oysters .   the old woman s body quivered with desire  food  warmth  rest  all that her miserable frame demanded  were there within easy reach  for the mere asking  nay for the mere taking  yet still the devils of stubbornness and spite would not let go their hold upon her .  but finally  as a bitter blast swept the snow stingingly against her face  she uttered a hoarse snarl  and glancing about to see that no jeering eye was upon her  the poor creature crept across the pavement  clambered up the stone steps  and  pushing open the door  slipped into the nearest vacant seat .   the chairs and benches were unusually well filled .  numbers of women and children were in the foreground .  a few men were also present  sitting with their bodies hanging forward  their hats tightly clutched between their knees  their eyes fixed on the floor .  the women and children  on the contrary  followed every movement of the young women on the platform with furtive eagerness .   the simplicity of attire which angela and her friends had assumed did not deceive even the tiniest gutter child present  these were  ladies   and one and all accorded them the same tribute of genuine  if reluctant  admiration .   old marg  after the embarrassment of the first moment  took everything in with one hawk like glance  the christmas greens upon the clean  white walls  the curtained space in the rear which hid some pleasant mystery  the men and women on the platform .   at the organ sat a young girl  leaning upon the now silent keys  her face toward the young man who was speaking .  old marg could not take her eyes from this face  white  serious  sweet  set in a halo of pale golden hair .  the sight of it aroused strange feelings in the bosom of the old outcast .  fascinated  tortured  bewildered  she sat and gazed .  it was long since she had thought of her youth .  this girl reminded her of that forgotten time .  like a violet flung upon a refuse heap  the thought of her own innocent girlhood lay for an instant upon the foul mass of memories accumulated by sixty miserable years .   i was light haired  too .   ran old marg s thoughts .   light haired  an  light complected  like her .    the perfume of that thought breathed across her soul  and was gone .  still she gazed from under her shaggy brows  and  without meaning to listen  found herself hearing what the speaker was saying .  he was telling without rhetoric or cant the story of christ  and with simplicity and tact presenting the lesson of his life .    this joy of giving  of sacrificing for others   the young man was saying in his earnest  musical voice   so far beyond the joy of receiving  is within the reach of every human being .  think of that .  the poorest man or woman or child who breathes on earth to night may know this joy  may give some pleasure  some help  some comfort  to some fellow creature .  whether it be a human creature or a dumb beast  matters not .  it is all one in god s sight  being an act of love and kindness and sacrifice .    old marg looked down upon her squalid rags  her rough features writhed with a scornful smile .   that s a lie .   she muttered .   what could the likes of me do for anybody  i d like to know .    still she listened  but at last  as the warmth stole through her sodden garments  and into her chilled veins  and the peace of the place penetrated the turbulent recesses of her soul  the man s voice became like a voice heard in a dream  and the old outcast slept .   a confused sound greeted her awakening .  some one was playing the organ jubilantly  people were moving about  girls with trays loaded with steaming dishes  children were talking and laughing excitedly .  the curtain had been drawn  and a great christmas tree almost blinded her with its splendor .  she stared about in bewilderment .  she looked at the tree  at the people  at her own foul rags .  a fierce revulsion of feeling swept over her .  rage  shame  a desire to get out of sight  to be swallowed up in the darkness and misery which were her proper element  seized and mastered her .  she staggered to her feet .  a young girl approached her with a tray of tempting food .  the sight and smell of it goaded the starved creature to madness .  she could have fallen upon it like a wolf  but instead she pushed the girl roughly aside and fumbled dizzily at the door knob .   a hand was laid upon her arm .  the girl with the sweet  white face was looking at her with a friendly smile .    won t you stay and have something warm to eat before going into the cold .   the girl asked gently .   old marg shook the hand from her arm .    no .   she snarled .   i don t want nothin  .  let me go .    with a patient smile angela opened the door .    i am sorry you will not stay   she said softly .   it would give me great pleasure .  there is a gift for you on the tree  too .  it is christmas eve  you know .    a hoarse  choking sound came from the woman s lips .  she pushed by into the vestibule .  angela followed .    if you should feel differently to morrow   she said  in her kind  gentle voice   come here again  about eleven o clock .  i shall be here .   without waiting for a reply  she re entered the hall .  a young man  the same who had been speaking  met her at the door .    angela .   he exclaimed .   you should not be out there in the cold .   she smiled absently .   did you see her  robert .     that terrible old woman .  yes  i saw her .  a hopeless case  i fear .    angela s eyes kept their absent look .    it was awful to see her go away like that  into the cold and snow  hungry and half clad .   she said .   the young man leaned nearer .   angela   he whispered .   you must not let these things sink into your heart as you do  or you cannot bear the work you have undertaken .  as for that old creature  it is terrible to think of her  but she seemed to me beyond our reach .     but not beyond god s reach through us .   said angela .   meantime old marg was facing the storm with rage and pain in her face and in her heart .  the streets were deserted  and lighted only by such beams as found their way through the dirty windows of shops and saloons .  from these last came sounds of revelry and contention  and at one or another the poor creature paused  listening without fear to the familiar hubbub .  should she go in .  some one might give her a drink  to ease for a time the terrible gnawing at her breast .  might .  yes  but more likely she would be thrust out with jeers and curses  and  for some reason  old marg was in no mood to use the caustic wit and ready tongue that were her only weapons .  so she staggered on until the swarming tenement was reached  stumbled up the five flights of unillumined stairs  and almost fell headlong into the dismal garret which she called her home .   feeling about in the darkness  she found a match and lit a bit of candle which stopped the neck of an empty bottle .  it burned uncertainly as if reluctant to disclose the scene upon which its light fell .  a smoke stained  sloping ceiling  a blackened floor  a shapeless mattress heaped with rags  a deal box  a rusty stove resting upon two bricks  supporting in its turn an ancient frying pan  a chipped saucer  and a battered tin can from which  when the scavenger business was good  old marg served afternoon tea  such were her home and all her personal belongings .   there was no fire  nor any means of producing one  but upon the box was spread a piece of paper containing a slice of bread and a soup bone  whereto clung some fragments of meat  the gift of a neighbor hardly less wretched than herself .   the old woman s eyes glittered at the sight  and  seizing the food  she sank weakly upon the box and began gnawing at it  but her toothless jaws  stiff with cold  made no impression upon the tough meat and hard crust  and letting them drop to the floor  the poor creature fell to rocking to and fro  whimpering tearlessly  like a suffering dog .  strangely enough  within the withered bosom of this most wretched creature there had welled up  from some hidden source of womanly feeling  a passionate self pity  a no less passionate self loathing .  this was what a moment s contact with all that she had so long abjured  purity  order  gentleness  had brought to pass .   that fair young girl tall  pale  sweet as an easter lily  stood before her like an incarnate memory  pointing toward the past  the far distant past  when she  too  was young  and pretty  and innocent  and gay  too pretty and too gay for a poor working girl .  that was where the trouble began .    i was light haired  too   moaned old marg  twisting her withered fingers restlessly .   light haired  and light complected .  a pretty girl  an  a good girl  too .  not like her .  no .  how could i be .  little the likes o  her knows what the likes o  me has to face .  lord .    the bit of candle guttered and went out .  the cold increased .  it had ceased snowing  and a keen wind had arisen  tearing the clouds into shreds through which the stars gleamed .  and presently the moon climbed up behind the belfry of the old church across the square  and sent one broad white ray through the dingy window and across the floor .  all at once the great bell began to strike the midnight hour  its mingled vibrations filling the garret with tumultuous sounds .  the vision of the fair girl faded  and old marg was herself again  a hard  bitter  rebellious old woman  with a burning care where her heart had been  and only one thought  one desire  left in her desperate mind  the thought and the desire of death .   in young and passionate days she had often thought of seeking that way out of life s agonies  but at its worst there is always some sweetness left in the cup  when one is young .  it was not so now .  the dregs only had been hers for many a year  and she had enough .  death  yes  that was best .   her eyes glittered as she cast a look about the silent room .  bare  even of the means to this end .  ah  the window .   with an inarticulate cry the woman arose and hobbled along the shining moon ray to the window  and threw open the sash .  awed by the stern beauty of the heavens  the splendor of the moon tangled in the lace like carvings of the belfry as in a net  she leaned some moments against the sill  looking out and down .  far below lay the deserted square  its white bosom traced with the sharp shadow of the tower .  with a keen eye old marg measured the distance  a sheer descent of fifty feet .  nothing to break the fall  nothing .   one movement  a swift fall  and that white surface would be broken by a black shapeless heap .  a policeman would find it on his next round  or some drunken reveler would stumble over it  or the good people on their way to early mass  ah .  the seamed countenance lit up suddenly with a malignant joy .   why not wait until they began to pass  those pious  respectable people in their comfortable furs and wools  and cast herself into their midst  a ghastly christmas offering from poverty to riches  from sin to virtue .  this suggestion commended itself highly to her sense of humor .  with a hoarse chuckle she was about to close the window when a portion of the shadow that lay alongside the chimney showed signs of life  and  rising on four long and skinny legs  became a cat  a lean  black cat  which crept meekly toward the window  its phosphorescent eyes gleaming  its lank jaws parted in a vain effort to mew .  startled  old marg drew back for an instant  then  glancing from the animal to the pavement below  a brutal cunning  a malicious pleasure  lit up the witch like features .  reaching out one skinny arm  she called coaxingly   puss .  puss .    the cat dragged herself up to the outstretched arm  rubbing her lank body caressingly against it .   the cruel  cunning old face softened suddenly .   lord .   muttered old marg   if she ain t a tryin  to purr .  wall  that beats me .    the poor beast continued its piteous appeal for aid  arching its starved frame  waving its tail  fawning unsuspectingly against the arm that had threatened .   with an impulse new to her misery hardened heart  old marg drew the animal in and closed the window .  far from resisting  the cat nestled against her with every sign of pleasure .    she s been somebody s pet   said the old woman  placing her on the floor .   she ain t always been like this .    the divine emotion of pity  so new to this forlorn creature  grew and swelled in her bosom .  the man at the hall had not lied  after all .  here was another of god s creatures as miserable as herself  nay  more so  for she had a roof to shelter her .  and she could share it with this homeless one .    poor puss .   muttered old marg  stroking the rough fur .   you re starvin   too  ain t ye .  an  i ain t got nothin  to give ye  not a bite or a sup .  ah .    her eyes had fallen upon the discarded food .  eagerly she seized it and placed it before the cat  the starving creature gnawed greedily at the bone an instant  then looked up with a hopeless mew .   the old woman felt a keener pang of pity .    poor beast .   she said  with a bitter smile .   ye can t eat  em  can ye .  no more could i .  we re in the same box  puss .  old  an  toothless  an  nobody belongin  to us .  we ll have to starve together  i guess .  an  it s christmas day .  did ye know that  puss .  christmas day .  lord .  lord .    the cat rubbed against her skirts  her eyes fixed upon her benefactor s .   seems to understand every word i say .   old marg muttered .   if only i had a drop o  milk for her now .    hobbling to the stove  she examined the battered tin can  letting the moonlight shine into its rusty depths .  a little water or tea remained in it  and with this she moistened some of the bread and placed it before the cat  which devoured it now eagerly .  then she took the animal in her arms and laid herself down on the mattress  drawing the ragged covers over them .  the cat nestled against her side  the warmth of the two poor bodies mingled  and both slept .   the moon ray crept along and spread itself over the heap of rags  the knotted fingers resting on the cat s rough fur  the seamed old face  it passed away  and morning dawned  with a peal of bells and the sound of footsteps on the pavement below  and still the two slept on .   angela stood near the door  receiving her christmas guests .  they came straggling in  in twos and threes  some boldly and impudently  some shame faced and shy  some eager  some indifferent  but all poverty pinched .  each one was pleasantly welcomed  and passed on to the feast .  angela watched and waited  and at last the door opened slowly to admit old marg  who stopped short on the threshold  with a look at once stubborn  appealing  suspicious  ashamed .  like a wild animal on the alert for the faintest sign of repulsion or danger  she stood there  but angela only smiled  proffering her white  soft hand  destitute of jewels  but the hand of a lady .    a merry christmas .   she said brightly .    i was ugly to ye last night   said old marg huskily  ignoring the beautiful hand she dared not touch .    never mind .   angela answered sweetly .   you were tired .     i am a bad old woman .   said old marg  mistrustfully .    never mind that  either .   said angela .   let me be your friend .  if you will  you shall never be cold or hungry again .    a profound wonder came into the old face  then it began to writhe  and from each eye oozed scant tears  seeking a channel amid the seams and wrinkles of the sunken cheeks .    you will let me be your friend   urged angela .   still old marg wept silently  the scant tears of age .    you shall have a pleasant home and       a swift  suspicious glance darted from the wet eyes .    not a  sylum  miss  please .   said the old woman .    no   said angela quietly .   not an asylum  a home  a bright  clean  comfortable home        i can work  miss .   put in old marg  doubling her knotted hands to show their strength .   i can wash  an  scrub        yes   said angela   you may work all you are able  helping to keep things clean and comfortable .    still old marg looked doubtful .  wiping her cheeks with a corner of the shawl  she half turned toward the door .    have you a family  or any one belonging to you .   asked angela  thinking to have reached the root of the difficulty .    yes   said the old woman stoutly .   i have a cat .  where i go  she must go  too .    angela patted the grimy hand  with a laugh which was good to hear .    i understand you perfectly   she said .   i have a cat of my own .  you and your cat shall not be separated .    a half hour later entered the young man robert .  angela pointed silently to old marg  sitting in a warm corner  contentedly munching her christmas dinner .   what have you done to her .   he asked .   she looks more human already .    angela laughed again  that same laugh which goes to one s heart so .   i have adopted her  and her cat .   she answered .   that s all .               the first puritan christmas tree .    anonymous .    mrs .  olcott called her boys  and bade them go to the pine woods and get the finest  handsomest young hemlock tree that they could find .    get one that is straight and tall  with well boughed branches on it  and put it where you can draw it under the wood shed after dark   she added .   the boys went to pine hill  and there they picked out the finest young tree on all the hill  and said   we will take this one .   so  with their hatchets they hewed it down and brought it safely home the next night when all was dark .  and when roger was quietly sleeping in the adjoining room  they dragged the tree into the kitchen .  it was too tall  so they took it out again and cut it off two or three feet at the base .  then they propped it up  and the curtains being down over the windows  and blankets being fastened over the curtains to prevent any one looking in  and the door being doubly barred to prevent any one coming in  they all went to bed .   very early the next morning  while the stars shone on the snow covered hills  the same stars that shone sixteen hundred years before on the hills when christ was born in bethlehem  the little puritan mother in new england arose very softly .  she went out and lit the kitchen fire anew from the ash covered embers .  she fastened upon the twigs of the tree the gifts she had bought in boston for her boys and girl .  then she took as many as twenty pieces of candle and fixed them upon the branches .  after that she softly called rupert  robert and lucy  and told them to get up and come into the kitchen .   hurrying back  she began  with a bit of a burning stick  to light the candles .  just as the last one was set aflame  in trooped the three children .   before they had time to say a word  they were silenced by their mother s warning .    i wish to fetch roger in and wake him up before it   she said .   keep still until i come back .    the little lad  fast asleep  was lifted in a blanket and gently carried by his mother into the beautiful presence .    see .  roger  my boy  see .   she said  arousing him .   it is christmas morning now .  in england they only have christmas boughs  but here in new england we have a whole christmas tree .     o mother .   he cried .   o lucy .  is it really  really true  and no dream at all .  yes  i see .  i see .  o mother  it is so beautiful .  were all the trees on all the hills lighted up that way when christ was born .  and  mother   he added  clapping his little hands with joy at the thought   why  yes  the stars did sing when christ was born .  they must be glad  then  and keep christmas  too  in heaven .  i know they must  and there will be good times there .     yes   said his mother   there will be good times there  roger .     then   said the boy   i sha n t mind going  now that i ve seen the christmas bough .  i  what is that  mother .    what was it that they heard .  the little olcott home had never before seemed to tremble so .  there were taps at the window  there were knocks at the door  and it was as yet scarcely the break of day .  there were voices also  shouting something to somebody .    shall i put out the candles  mother .   whispered robert .    what will they do to us for having the tree .  i wish we hadn t it   regretted rupert  while lucy clung to her mother s gown and shrieked with all her strength   it s indians .    pale and white and still  ready to meet her fate  stood mrs .  olcott  until  out of the knocking and the tapping at her door  her heart caught a sound .  it was a voice calling   rachel .  rachel .  rachel .     unbar the door .   she cried back to her boys   it s your father calling .   down came the blankets  up went the curtain  open flew the door  and in walked captain olcott  followed by every man and woman in plymouth who had heard at break of day the glorious news that the expected ship had arrived at boston  and with it the long lost captain olcott .  for an instant nothing was thought of except the joyous welcoming of the captain in his new home .    what s this .  what is it .  what does this mean .   was asked again and again  when the first excitement was passed  as the tall young pine stood aloft  its candles ablaze  its gifts still hanging .    it s welcome home to father .   said lucy  her only thought to screen her mother .    no  child  no .   sternly spoke mrs .  olcott .   tell the truth .     it s  a  christmas tree .   faltered poor lucy .   one and another and another  pilgrims and puritans all  drew near with faces stern and forbidding  and gazed and gazed  until one and another and yet another softened slowly into a smile as little roger s piping voice sung out    she made it for me  mother did .  but you may have it now  and all the pretty things that are on it  too  because you ve brought my father back again  if mother will let you   he added .   neither pilgrim nor puritan frowned at the gift .  one man  the sternest there  broke off a little twig and said    i ll take it for the sake of the good old times at home .               the first christmas in new england .   by hezekiah butterworth .   they thought they had come to their port that day  but not yet was their journey done  and they drifted away from provincetown bay in the fireless light of the sun .  with rain and sleet were the tall masts iced  and gloomy and chill was the air  but they looked from the crystal sails to christ  and they came to a harbor fair .  the white hills silent lay    for there were no ancient bells to ring  no priests to chant  no choirs to sing  no chapel of baron  or lord  or king  that gray  cold winter day .   the snow came down on the vacant seas  and white on the lone rocks lay    but rang the axe  mong the evergreen trees and followed the sabbath day .  then rose the sun in a crimson haze  and the workmen said at dawn   shall our axes swing on this day of days  when the lord of life was born .   the white hills silent lay    for there were no ancient bells to ring  no priests to chant  no choirs to sing  no chapel of baron  or lord  or king  that gray  cold christmas day .    the old town s bells we seem to hear  they are ringing sweet on the dee  they are ringing sweet on the harlem meer  and sweet on the zuyder zee .  the pines are frosted with snow and sleet .  shall we our axes wield when the chimes at lincoln are ringing sweet and the bells of austerfield .   the air was cold and gray    and there were no ancient bells to ring  no priests to chant  no choirs to sing  no chapel of baron  or lord  or king  that gray  cold christmas day .   then the master said   your axes wield  remember ye malabarre bay  and the covenant there with the lord ye sealed  let your axes ring to day .  you may talk of the old town s bells to night  when your work for the lord is done  and your boats return  and the shallop s light shall follow the light of the sun .  the sky is cold and gray    and here are no ancient bells to ring  no priests to chant  no choirs to sing  no chapel of baron  or lord  or king .  this gray  cold christmas day .    if christ was born on christmas day  and the day by him is blest  then low at his feet the evergreens lay and cradle his church in the west .  immanuel waits at the temple gates of the nation to day ye found  and the lord delights in no formal rites  to day let your axes sound .   the sky was cold and gray    and there were no ancient bells to ring  no priests to chant  no choirs to sing  no chapel of baron  or lord  or king  that gray  cold christmas day .   their axes rang through the evergreen trees like the bells on the thames and tay  and they cheerily sang by the windy seas  and they thought of malabarre bay .  on the lonely heights of burial hill the old precisioners sleep  but did ever men with a nobler will a holier christmas keep  when the sky was cold and gray    and there were no ancient bells to ring  no priests to chant  no choirs to sing  no chapel of baron  or lord  or king  that gray  cold christmas day .              the chimes .   by charles dickens .   first quarter .   there are not many people  and as it is desirable that a story teller and a story reader should establish a mutual understanding as soon as possible  i beg it to be noticed that i confine this observation neither to young people nor to little people  but extend it to all conditions of people  little and big  young and old  yet growing up  or already growing down again  there are not  i say  many people who would care to sleep in a church .  i don t mean at sermon time in warm weather  when the thing has actually been done  once or twice   but in the night  and alone .  a great multitude of persons will be violently astonished  i know  by this position  in the broad bold day .  but it applies to night .  it must be argued by night .  and i will undertake to maintain it successfully on any gusty winter s night appointed for the purpose  with any one opponent chosen from the rest  who will meet me singly in an old churchyard  before an old church door  and will previously empower me to lock him in  if needful to his satisfaction  until morning .   for the night wind has a dismal trick of wandering round and round a building of that sort  and moaning as it goes  and of trying with its unseen hand  the windows and the doors  and seeking out some crevices by which to enter .  and when it has got in  as one not finding what it seeks  whatever that may be  it wails and howls to issue forth again  and not content with stalking through the aisles  and gliding round and round the pillars  and tempting the deep organ  soars up to the roof  and strives to rend the rafters  then flings itself despairingly upon the stones below  and passes  muttering  into the vaults .  ugh .  heaven preserve us  sitting snugly round the fire .  it has an awful voice  that wind at midnight  singing in a church .   but  high up in the steeple .  there the foul blast roars and whistles .  high up in the steeple  where it is free to come and go through many an airy arch and loophole  and to twist and twine itself about the giddy stair  and twirl the groaning weathercock  and make the very tower shake and shiver .   high up in the steeple of an old church  far above the light and murmur of the town and far below the flying clouds that shadow it  is the wild and dreary place at night  and high up in the steeple of an old church  dwelt the chimes i tell of .   they were old chimes  trust me .  centuries ago  these bells had been baptized by bishops  so many centuries ago  that the register of their baptism was lost long  long before the memory of man  and no one knew their names .  they had had their godfathers and godmothers  these bells  for my part  by the way  i would rather incur the responsibility of being godfather to a bell than a boy   and had had their silver mugs  no doubt  besides .  but time had mowed down their sponsors  and henry the eighth had melted down their mugs  and they now hung  nameless and mugless  in the church tower .   not speechless  though .  far from it .  they had clear  loud  lusty  sounding voices  had these bells  and far and wide they might be heard upon the wind .  much too sturdy chimes were they  to be dependent on the pleasure of the wind  moreover  for  fighting gallantly against it when it took an adverse whim  they would pour their cheerful notes into a listening ear right royally  and bent on being heard  on stormy nights  by some poor mother watching a sick child  or some lone wife whose husband was at sea  they had been sometimes known to beat a blustering nor wester  ay   all to fits   as toby veck said   for though they chose to call him trotty veck  his name was toby  and nobody could make it anything else either  except tobias   he having been as lawfully christened in his day as the bells had been in theirs  though with not quite so much of solemnity or public rejoicing .   for my part  i confess myself of toby veck s belief  for i am sure he had opportunities enough of forming a correct one .  and whatever toby veck said  i say .  and i take my stand by toby veck  although he did stand all day long  and weary work it was  just outside the church door .  in fact he was a ticket porter  toby veck  and waited there for jobs .   and a breezy  goose skinned  blue nosed  red eyed  stony toed  tooth chattering place it was to wait in  in the winter time  as toby veck well knew .  the wind came tearing round the corner  especially the east wind  as if it had sallied forth  express  from the confines of the earth  to have a blow at toby .  and oftentimes it seemed to come upon him sooner than it had expected  for bouncing round the corner  and passing toby  it would suddenly wheel round again  as if it cried  why  here he is .    toby was curious about the bells because there were points of resemblance between them and him .  they hung there in all weathers  with the wind and rain driving in upon them  facing only the outsides of all the houses  never getting any nearer to the blazing fires that gleamed and shone upon the windows or came puffing out of the chimney tops  and incapable of participating in any of the good things that were constantly being handed through the street doors and iron railings to prodigious cooks .  being but a simple man  he invested the bells with a strange and solemn character .  they were so mysterious  often heard and never seen  so high up  so far off  so full of such a deep  strong melody  that he regarded them with a species of awe  and sometimes when he looked up at the dark arched windows in the tower  he half expected to be beckoned to by something which was not a bell  and yet was what he heard so often sounding in the chimes .  for all this toby scouted with indignation a certain flying rumor that the chimes were haunted  as implying the possibility of their being connected with any evil thing .  in short  they were very often in his ears  and very often in his thoughts  but always in his good opinion  and he very often got such a crick in his neck by staring with his mouth wide open  at the steeple where they hung  that he was fain to take an extra trot or two  afterward  to cure it .   the very thing he was in the act of doing one cold day  when the last drowsy sound of twelve o clock  just struck  was humming like a melodious monster of a bee  and not by any means a busy bee  all through the steeple .    dinner time  eh .   said toby  trotting up and down before the church .   ah .    toby s nose was very red  and his eyelids were very red  and he winked very much  and his shoulders were very near his ears  and his legs were very stiff  and altogether he was evidently a long way upon the frosty side of cool .    dinner time  eh .   repeated toby  using his right hand muffler like an infantine boxing glove  and punishing his chest for being cold .   ah h h h .    he took a silent trot  after that  for a minute or two .    there s nothing   said toby   more regular in its coming round than dinner time  and nothing less regular in its coming round than dinner .  that s the great difference between  em .  it s took me a long time to find it out .  i wonder whether it would be worth any gentleman s while  now  to buy that obserwation for the papers  or the parliament .    tony was only joking  for he gravely shook his head in self depreciation .    why .  lord .   said toby .   the papers is full of obserwations as it is  and so s the parliament .  here s last week s paper  now   taking a very dirty one from his pocket  and holding it from him at arm s length   full of obserwations .  full of obserwations .  i like to know the news as well as any man   said toby  slowly  folding it a little smaller  and putting it in his pocket again   but it almost goes against the grain with me to read a paper now .  it frightens me almost .  i don t know what we poor people are coming to .  lord send we may be coming to something better in the new year nigh upon us .     why  father  father .   said a pleasant voice  hard by .   but toby  not hearing it continued to trot backward and forward  musing as he went  and talking to himself .    it seems as if we can t go right  or do right  or be righted   said toby .   i hadn t much schooling  myself  when i was young  and i can t make out whether we have any business on the face of the earth  or not .  sometimes i think we must have  a little  and sometimes i think we must be intruding .  i get so puzzled sometimes that i am not even able to make up my mind whether there is any good at all in us  or whether we are born bad .  we seem to do dreadful things  we seem to give a deal of trouble  we are always being complained of and guarded against .  one way or another  we fill the papers .  talk of a new year .   said toby  mournfully .   i can bear up as well as another man at most times  better than a good many  for i am as strong as a lion  and all men an t  but supposing it should really be that we have no right to a new year  supposing we really are intruding        why  father  father .   said the pleasant voice again .   toby heard it this time  started  stopped  and shortening his sight  which had been directed a long way off as seeking for enlightenment in the very heart of the approaching year  found himself face to face with his own child  and looking close into her eyes .   bright eyes they were .  eyes that would bear a world of looking in  before their depth was fathomed .  dark eyes  that reflected back the eyes which searched them  not flashingly or at the owner s will  but with a clear  calm  honest  patient radiance  claiming kindred with that light which heaven called into being .  eyes that were beautiful and true  and beaming with hope .  with hope so young and fresh  with hope so buoyant  vigorous and bright  despite the twenty years of work and poverty on which they had looked  that they became a voice to trotty veck  and said   i think we have some business here  a little .    trotty kissed the lips belonging to the eyes  and squeezed the blooming face between his hands .    why  pet   said trotty .   what s to do .  i didn t expect you  to day  meg .     neither did i expect to come  father   cried the girl  nodding her head and smiling as she spoke .   but here i am .  and not alone  not alone .     why you don t mean to say   observed trotty  looking curiously at a covered basket which she carried in her hand   that you        smell it  father dear   said meg   only smell it .    trotty was going to lift up the cover at once  in a great hurry  when she gayly interposed her hand .    no  no  no   said meg  with the glee of a child .   lengthen it out a little .  let me just lift up the corner  just the lit tle ti ny cor ner  you know   said meg  suiting the action to the word with the utmost gentleness  and speaking very softly  as if she were afraid of being overheard by something inside the basket   there .  now .  what s that .    toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge of the basket  and cried out in a rapture    why  it s hot .     it is burning hot .   cried meg .   ha  ha  ha .  it s scalding hot .     ha  ha  ha .   roared toby  with a sort of kick .   it s scalding hot .     but what is it father .   said meg .   come .  you haven t guessed what it is .  and you must guess what it is .  i can t think of taking it out till you guess what it is .  don t be in such a hurry .  wait a minute .  a little bit more of the cover .  now guess .    meg was in a perfect fright lest he should guess right too soon  shrinking away  as she held the basket toward him  curling up her pretty shoulders  stopping her ear with her hand  as if by so doing she could keep the right word out of toby s lips  and laughing softly the whole time .   meanwhile toby  putting a hand on each knee  bent down his nose to the basket  and took a long inspiration at the lid  the grin upon his withered face expanded in the process  as if he were inhaling laughing gas .    ah .  it s very nice   said toby .   it ain t  i suppose it ain t polonies .     no  no  no .   cried meg  delighted .   nothing like polonies .     no   said toby  after another sniff .   it s  it s mellower than polonies .  it s very nice .  it improves every moment .  it s too decided for trotters .  ain t it .    meg was in ecstasy .  he could not have gone wider of the mark than trotters  except polonies .    liver .   said toby  communing with himself .   no .  there s a mildness about it that don t answer to liver .  pettitoes .  no .  it an t faint enough for pettitoes .  it wants the stringiness of cocks  heads .  and i know it an t sausages .  i ll tell you what it is .  it s chitterlings .     no  it an t .   cried meg  in a burst of delight  no  it an t .     why  what am i a thinking of .   said toby  suddenly recovering a position as near the perpendicular as it was possible for him to assume .   i shall forget my own name next .  it s tripe .    tripe it was  and meg  in high joy  protested he should say  in half a minute more  it was the best tripe ever stewed .    and so   said meg  busying herself exultingly with her basket   i ll lay the cloth at once  father  for i have brought the tripe in a basin  and tied the basin up in a pocket handkerchief  and if i like to be proud for once  and spread that for a cloth  and call it a cloth  there s no law to prevent me  is there father .     not that i know of  my dear   said toby .   but they re always a bringing up some new law or other .     and according to what i was reading you in the paper the other day  father  what the judge said  you know  we poor people are supposed to know them all .  ha  ha .  what a mistake .  my goodness me  how clever they think us .     yes  my dear   cried trotty   and they d be very fond of any one of us that did know  em all .  he d grow fat upon the work he d get  that man  and be popular with the gentlefolks in his neighborhood .  very much so .     he d eat his dinner with an appetite  whoever he was  if it smelt like this   said meg  cheerfully .   make haste  for there s a potato besides .  where will you dine  father .  on the post  or on the steps .  dear  dear  how grand we are .  two places to choose from .     the steps to day  my pet   said trotty .   steps in dry weather .  post in wet .  there s a great conveniency in the steps at all times  because of the sitting down  but they re rheumatic in the damp .     then here   said meg  clapping her hands  after a moment s bustle   here it is  all ready .  and beautiful it looks .  come  father .  eat it while it s hot .  come .    since his discovery of the contents of the basket  trotty had been standing looking at her  and had been speaking too  in an abstracted manner  which showed that though she was the object of his thoughts and eyes  to the exclusion even of tripe  he neither saw nor thought about her as she was at that moment  but had before him some imaginary rough sketch or drama of her future life .  roused  now  by her cheerful summons  he shook off a melancholy shake of the head which was just coming upon him  and trotted to her side .  as he was stooping to sit down  the chimes rang .    amen .   said trotty  pulling off his hat and looking up toward them .    amen to the bells  father .   cried meg .    they broke in like a grace  my dear   said trotty  taking his seat .   they d say a good one  i am sure  if they could .  many s the kind thing they say to me .     the bells do  father .   laughed meg  as she set the basin  and a knife and fork before him .   well .     seem to  my pet   said trotty  falling to with great vigor .   and where s the difference .  if i hear  em  what does it matter whether they speak it or not .  why bless you  my dear   said toby  pointing at the tower with his fork  and becoming more animated under the influence of dinner   how often have i heard them bells say   toby veck  toby veck  keep a good heart toby .  toby veck  toby veck  keep a good heart toby .   a million times .  more .     well  i never .   cried meg .   she had  though  over and over again .  for it was toby s constant topic .    when things is very bad   said trotty   very bad indeed  i mean  almost at the worst  then it s  toby veck  toby veck  job coming soon  toby .  toby veck  toby veck  job coming soon  toby .   that way .     and it comes  at last  father   said meg  with a touch of sadness in her pleasant voice .    always   answered the unconscious toby .   never fails .    while this discourse was holding  trotty made no pause in his attack upon the savory meat before him  but cut and ate  and cut and drank  and cut and chewed  and dodged about  from tripe to hot potato  and from hot potato back again to tripe  with an unctuous and unflagging relish .  but happening now to look all round the street  in case anybody should be beckoning from any door or window  for a porter  his eyes  in coming back again  encountered meg  sitting opposite to him  with her arms folded  and only busy in watching his progress with a smile of happiness .    why  lord forgive me .   said trotty  dropping his knife and fork .   my love .  meg .  why didn t you tell me what a beast i was .     father .     sitting here   said trotty  in penitent explanation   cramming and stuffing  and gorging myself  and you before me there  never so much as breaking your precious fast  nor wanting to  when        but i have broken it  father   interposed his daughter  laughing   all to bits .  i have had my dinner .     nonsense   said trotty .   two dinners in one day .  it an t possible .  you might as well tell me that two new year s days will come together  or that i have had a gold head all my life  and never changed it .     i have had my dinner  father  for all that   said meg  coming nearer to him .   and if you ll go on with yours  i ll tell you how and where  and how your dinner came to be brought  and  something else besides .    toby still appeared incredulous  but she looked into his face with her clear eyes  and laying her hand upon his shoulder  motioned him to go on while the meat was hot .  so trotty took up his knife and fork again  and went to work .  but much more slowly than before  and shaking his head  as if he were not at all pleased with himself .    i had my dinner  father   said meg  after a little hesitation   with  with richard .  his dinner time was early  and as he brought his dinner with him when he came to see me  we  we had it together  father .    trotty said   oh .    because she waited .    and richard says  father    meg resumed .  then stopped .    what does richard say  meg .   asked toby .    richard says  father    another stoppage .    richard s a long time saying it   said toby .    he says then  father   meg continued  lifting up her eyes at last  and speaking in a tremble  but quite plainly   another year is nearly gone  and where is the use of waiting on from year to year  when it is so unlikely we shall ever be better off than we are now .  he says we are poor now  father  and we shall be poor then  but we are young now  and years will make us old before we know it .  he says that if we wait  people in our condition  until we see our way quite clearly  the way will be a narrow one indeed  the common way  the grave  father .    a bolder man than trotty veck must needs have drawn upon his boldness largely  to deny it .  trotty held his peace .    and how hard  father  to grow old and die  and think we might have cheered and helped each other .  how hard in all our lives to love each other  and to grieve  apart  to see each other working  changing  growing old and gray .  even if i got the better of it  and forgot him  which i never could   oh  father dear  how hard to have a heart so full as mine is now  and live to have it slowly drained out every drop  without the recollection of one happy moment of a woman s life  to stay behind and comfort me  and make me better .    trotty sat quite still  meg dried her eyes  and said more gayly  that is to say  with here a laugh  and there a sob  and here a laugh and sob together    so richard says  father  as his work was yesterday made certain for some time to come  and as i love him and have loved him fully three years  ah .  longer than that  if he knew it .   will i marry him on new year s day  the best and happiest day  he says  in the whole year  and one that is almost sure to bring good fortune with it .  it s a short notice  father  isn t it .   but i haven t my fortune to be settled  or my wedding dresses to be made  like the great ladies  father  have i .  and he said so much  and said it in his way  so strong and earnest  and all the time so kind and gentle  that i said i d come and talk to you  father .  and as they paid the money for that work of mine this morning  unexpectedly  i am sure .    and as you have fared very poorly for a whole week  and as i couldn t help wishing there should be something to make this day a sort of holiday to you as well as a dear and happy day to me  father  i made a little treat and brought it to surprise you .     and see how he leaves it cooling on the step .   said another voice .   it was the voice of the same richard  who had come upon them unobserved  and stood before the father and daughter  looking down upon them with a face as glowing as the iron on which his stout sledge hammer daily rung .  a handsome  well made  powerful youngster he was  with eyes that sparkled like the red hot droppings from a furnace fire  black hair that curled about his swarthy temples rarely  and a smile  a smile that bore out meg s eulogium on his style of conversation .    see how he leaves it cooling on the step .   said richard .   meg don t know what he likes .  not she .    trotty  all action and enthusiasm  immediately reached up his hand to richard  and was going to address him in a great hurry  when the house door opened without any warning  and a footman very nearly put his foot in the tripe .    out of the vays here  will you .  you must always go and be a settin on our steps  must you .  you can t go and give a turn to none of the neighbors never  can t you .  will you clear the road  or won t you .    strictly speaking  the last question was irrelevant  as they had already done it .    what s the matter  what s the matter .   said the gentleman for whom the door was opened  coming out of the house at that kind of light  heavy pace  that peculiar compromise between a walk and jog trot  with which a gentleman upon the smooth down hill of life  wearing creaking boots  a watch chain  and clean linen  may come out of his house  not only without any abatement of his dignity  but with an expression of having important and wealthy engagements elsewhere .   what s the matter .  what s the matter .     you re always a being begged  and prayed  upon your bended knees  you are   said the footman with great emphasis to trotty veck   to let our door steps be .  why don t you let  em be .  can t you let  em be .     there .  that ll do  that ll do .   said the gentleman   halloa there .  porter .   beckoning with his head to trotty veck   come here .  what s that .  your dinner .     yes  sir   said trotty  leaving it behind him in a corner .    don t leave it there .   exclaimed the gentleman .   bring it here  bring it here .  so .  this is your dinner  is it .     yes  sir   repeated trotty  looking with a fixed eye and a watery mouth at the piece of tripe he had reserved for a last delicious tit bit  which the gentleman was now turning over and over on the end of a fork .   two other gentlemen had come out with him .  one was a low spirited gentleman of middle age  of a meagre habit  and a disconsolate face  who kept his hands continually in the pockets of his scanty pepper and salt trousers  very large and dog s eared from that custom  and was not particularly well brushed or washed .  the other  a full sized  sleek  well conditioned gentleman  in a blue coat  with bright buttons  and a white cravat .  this gentleman had a very red face  as if an undue proportion of the blood in his body were squeezed up into his head  which perhaps accounted for his having also the appearance of being rather cold about the heart .   he who had toby s meat upon the fork called to the first one by the name of filer  and they both drew near together .  mr .  filer being exceedingly short sighted  was obliged to go so close to the remnant of toby s dinner before he could make out what it was  that toby s heart leaped up into his mouth .  but mr .  filer didn t eat it .    this is a description of animal food  alderman   said filer  making little punches in it with a pencil case   commonly known to the laboring population of this country by the name of tripe .    the alderman laughed  and winked  for he was a merry fellow .  alderman cute .  oh  and a sly fellow too .  a knowing fellow .  up to everything .  not to be imposed upon .  deep in the people s hearts .  he knew them  cute did .  i believe you .    but who eats tripe .   said mr .  filer  looking round .   tripe is without an exception the least economical  and the most wasteful article of consumption that the markets of this country can by possibility produce .  the loss upon a pound of tripe has been found to be  in the boiling  seven eighths of a fifth more than the loss upon a pound of any other animal substance whatever .  tripe is more expensive  properly understood  than the hot house pine apple .  taking into account the number of animals slaughtered yearly within the bills of mortality alone  and forming a low estimate of the quantity of tripe which the carcases of these animals  reasonably well butchered  would yield  i find that the waste on that amount of tripe  if boiled  would victual a garrison of five hundred men for five months of thirty one days each  and a february over .  the waste  the waste .    trotty stood aghast  and his legs shook under him .  he seemed to have starved a garrison of five hundred men with his own hand .    who eats tripe .   said mr .  filer  warmly .   who eats tripe .    trotty made a miserable bow .    you do  do you .   said mr .  filer .   then i ll tell you something .  you snatch your tripe  my friend  out of the mouths of widows and orphans .     i hope not  sir   said trotty  faintly .   i d sooner die of want .     divide the amount of tripe before mentioned  alderman   said mr .  filer   by the estimated number of existing widows and orphans  and the result will be one pennyweight of tripe to each .  not a grain is left for that man .  consequently  he s a robber .    trotty was so shocked that it gave him no concern to see the alderman finish the tripe himself .  it was a relief to get rid of it  anyhow .    and what do you say .   asked the alderman  jocosely  of the red faced gentleman in the blue coat .   you have heard friend filer .  what do you say .     what s it possible to say .   returned the gentleman .   what is to be said .  who can take any interest in a fellow like this   meaning trotty   in such degenerate times as these .  look at him .  what an object .  the good old times  the grand old times  the great old times .  those were the times for a bold peasantry  and all that sort of thing .  those were the times for every sort of thing  in fact .  there s nothing now a days .  ah .   sighed the red faced gentleman .   the good old times  the good old times .    it is possible that poor trotty s faith in these very vague old times was not entirely destroyed  for he felt vague enough  at that moment .  one thing  however  was plain to him  in the midst of his distress  to wit  that however these gentlemen might differ in details  his misgivings of that morning  and of many other mornings  were well founded .   no  no .  we can t go right or do right   thought trotty in despair .   there is no good in us .  we are born bad .    but trotty had a father s heart within him  which had somehow got into his breast in spite of this decree  and he could not bear that meg  in the blush of her brief joy  should have her fortune read by these wise gentlemen .   god help her   thought poor trotty .   she will know it soon enough .    he anxiously signed  therefore  to the young smith  to take her away .  but he was so busy  talking to her softly at a little distance  that he only became conscious of this desire  simultaneously with alderman cute .  now  the alderman had not yet had his say  but he was a philosopher  too  practical though .  oh  very practical .   and  as he had no idea of losing any portion of his audience  he cried  stop .    trotty took meg s hand and drew it through his arm .  he didn t seem to know what he was doing though .    your daughter  eh .   said the alderman  chucking her familiarly under the chin .    and you re making love to her  are you .   said cute to the young smith .    yes   returned richard quickly  for he was nettled by the question .   and we are going to be married on new year s day .     what do you mean .   cried filer sharply .   married .     why  yes  we were thinking of it .  master   said richard .   we re rather in a hurry you see  in case it should be put down first .     ah .   cried filer  with a groan .   put that down indeed .  alderman  and you ll do something .  married .  married .  .  the ignorance of the first principles of political economy on the part of these people  their improvidence  their wickedness is by heavens .  enough to  now look at that couple  will you .    well .  they were worth looking at .  and marriage seemed as reasonable and fair a deed as they need have in contemplation .    a man may live to be as old as methuselah   said mr .  filer   and may labor all his life for the benefit of such people as those  and may heap up facts on figures  facts on figures  facts on figures  mountains high and dry  and he can no more hope to persuade  em that they have no right or business to be married than he can hope to persuade  em that they have no earthly right or business to be born .  and that we know they haven t .  we reduced that to a mathematical certainty long ago .     come here  my girl .   said alderman cute .   the young blood of her lover had been mounting  wrathfully  within the last few minutes  and he was indisposed to let her come .  but  setting a constraint upon himself  he came forward with a stride as meg approached and stood beside her .  trotty kept her hand within his arm still  but looked from face to face as wildly as a sleeper in a dream .    now  i m going to give you a word or two of good advice  my girl   said the alderman  in his nice easy way .   it s my place to give advice  you know  because i m a justice .  you know i m a justice  don t you .    meg timidly said   yes .   but everybody knew alderman cute was a justice .  oh dear  so active a justice always .  who such a mote of brightness in the public eye  as cute .    you are going to be married  you say   pursued the alderman .   very unbecoming and indelicate in one of your sex .  but never mind that .  after you re married  you ll quarrel with your husband  and come to be a distressed wife .  you may think not  but you will  because i tell you so .  now  i give you fair warning  that i have made up my mind to put distressed wives down .  so  don t be brought before me .  you ll have children  boys .  those boys will grow up bad  of course  and run wild in the streets without shoes or stockings .  mind  my young friend .  i ll convict  em summarily every one  for i am determined to put boys without shoes or stockings  down .  perhaps your husband will die young  most likely  and leave you with a baby .  then you ll be turned out of doors  and wander up and down the streets .  now don t wander near me  my dear  for i am resolved to put all wandering mothers down .  all young mothers  of all sorts and kinds  it s my determination to put down .  don t think to plead illness as an excuse with me  or babies as an excuse with me  for all sick persons and young children  i hope you know the church service  but i m afraid not  i am determined to put down .  and if you attempt  desperately and ungratefully  and impiously  and fraudulently attempt  to drown yourself  or hang yourself  i ll have no pity on you  for i have made up my mind to put all suicide down .  if there is one thing   said the alderman  with his self satisfied smile   on which i can be said to have made up my mind more than on another  it is to put suicide down .  so don t try it on .  that s the phrase  isn t it .  ha  ha .  now we understand each other .    toby knew not whether to be agonized or glad  to see that meg had turned deadly white  and dropped her lover s hand .    as for you  you dull dog   said the alderman  turning with even increased cheerfulness and urbanity to the young smith   what are you thinking of being married for .  what do you want to be married for  you silly fellow .  if i was a fine  young  strapping chap like you  i should be ashamed of being milksop enough to pin myself to a woman s apron strings .  why  she ll be an old woman before you re a middle aged man .  and a pretty figure you ll cut then  with a draggle tailed wife and a crowd of squalling children crying after you wherever you go .    oh  he knew how to banter the common people  alderman cute .    there .  go along with you   said the alderman   and repent .  don t make such a fool of yourself as to get married on new year s day .  you ll think very differently of it  long before next new year s day  a trim young fellow like you  with all the girls looking after you .  there .  go along with you .    they went along .  not arm in arm  or hand in hand  or interchanging bright glances  but she in tears  he gloomy and down looking .  were these the hearts that had so lately made old toby s leap up from its faintness .  no  no .  the alderman  a blessing on his head .   had put them down .    as you happen to be here   said the alderman to toby   you shall carry a letter for me .  can you be quick .  you re an old man .    toby  who had been looking after meg  quite stupidly  made shift to murmur out that he was very quick  and very strong .    how old are you .   inquired the alderman .    i am over sixty  sir   said toby .    oh .  this man s a great deal past the average age  you know   cried mr .  filer  breaking in as if his patience would bear some trying  but this was really carrying matters a little too far .    i feel i m intruding  sir   said toby .   i  i misdoubted it this morning .  oh dear me .    the alderman cut him short by giving him the letter from his pocket .  toby would have got a shilling too  but mr .  filer clearly showing that in that case he would rob a certain given number of persons of ninepence half penny a piece  he only got sixpence  and thought himself very well off to get that .   then the alderman gave an arm to each of his friends  and walked off in high feather  but  he immediately came hurrying back alone  as if he had forgotten something .    porter .   said the alderman .    sir .   said toby .    take care of that daughter of yours .  she s much too handsome .     even her good looks are stolen from somebody or other i suppose   thought toby  looking at the sixpence in his hand  and thinking of the tripe .   she s been and robbed five hundred ladies of a bloom a piece  i shouldn t wonder .  it s very dreadful .     she s much too handsome  my man   repeated the alderman .   the chances are  that she ll come to no good  i clearly see .  observe what i say .  take care of her .   with which  he hurried off again .    wrong every way .  wrong every way .   said trotty clasping his hands .   born bad .  no business here .    the chimes came clashing in upon him as he said the last words .  full  loud  and sounding  but with no encouragement .  no  not a drop .    the tune s changed   cried the old man  as he listened .   there s not a word of all that fancy in it .  why should there be .  i have no business with the new year nor with the old one neither .  let me die .    still the bells  pealing forth their changes  made the very air spin .  put  em down .  put  em down .  good old times  good old times .  facts and figures  facts and figures .  put  em down  put  em down .  if they said anything they said this  until the brain of toby reeled .   he pressed his bewildered head between his hands as if to keep it from splitting asunder .  a well timed action  as it happened  for finding the letter in one of them  and being by that means reminded of his charge  he fell  mechanically  into his usual trot  and trotted off .   second quarter .   the letter toby had received from alderman cute  was addressed to a great man in the great district of the town .  the greatest district of the town .  it must have been the greatest district of the town  because it was commonly called  the world  by its inhabitants .   the year was old  that day .  the patient year had lived through the reproaches and misuses of its slanderers  and faithfully performed its work .  spring  summer  autumn  winter .  it had labored through the destined round  and now laid down its weary head to die .   trotty had no portion  to his thinking  in the new year or the old .    put  em down .  put  em down .  facts and figures  facts and figures .  good old times  good old times .  put  em down  put  em down .    his trot went to that measure  and would fit itself to nothing else .   but  even that one  melancholy as it was  brought him  in due time  to the end of his journey .  to the mansion of sir joseph bowley  member of parliament .   the door was opened by a porter .  such a porter .  not of toby s order .  quite another thing .  his place was the ticket  though  not toby s .   this porter underwent some hard panting before he could speak  having breathed himself by coming incautiously out of his chair  without first taking time to think about it and compose his mind .  when he had found his voice  which it took him some time to do  for it was a long way off and hidden under a load of meat  he said in a fat whisper    who s it from .    toby told him .    you re to take it in yourself   said the porter  pointing to a room at the end of a long passage  opening from the hall .   everything goes straight in  on this day of the year .  you re not a bit too soon  for the carriage is at the door now  and they have only come to town for a couple of hours  a purpose .    toby wiped his feet  which were quite dry already  with great care  and took the way pointed out to him  observing as he went that it was an awfully grand house  but hushed and covered up  as if the family were in the country .  knocking at the room door  he was told to enter from within  and doing so found himself in a spacious library  where  at a table strewn with files and papers  were a stately lady in a bonnet  and a not very stately gentleman in black  who wrote from her dictation  while another  and an older  and a much statelier gentleman  whose hat and cane were on the table  walked up and down  with one hand in his breast  and looked complacently from time to time at his own picture  a full length  a very full length  hanging over the fire place .    what is this .   said the last named gentleman .   mr .  fish  will you have the goodness to attend .    mr .  fish begged pardon  and taking the letter from toby  handed it  with great respect .    from alderman cute  sir joseph .     is this all .  have you nothing else  porter .   inquired sir joseph .   toby replied in the negative .    you have no bill or demand upon me  my name is bowley  sir joseph bowley  of any kind from anybody  have you .   said sir joseph .   if you have  present it .  there is a cheque book by the side of mr .  fish .  i allow nothing to be carried into the new year .  every description of account is settled in this house at the close of the old one .  so that if death was to  to      to cut   suggested mr .  fish .    to sever  sir   returned sir joseph  with great asperity   the cord of existence  my affairs would be found  i hope  in a state of preparation .     my dear sir joseph .   said the lady  who was greatly younger than the gentleman .   how shocking .     my lady bowley   returned sir joseph  floundering now and then  as in the great depth of his observations   at this season of the year we should think of  of  ourselves .  we should look into our  our accounts .  we should feel that every return of so eventful a period in human transactions involves matter of deep moment between a man and his  and his banker .    sir joseph delivered these words as if he felt the full morality of what he was saying  and desired that even trotty should have an opportunity of being improved by such discourse .  possibly he had this end before him in still forbearing to break the seal of the letter  and in telling trotty to wait where he was a minute .    i am the poor man s friend   observed sir joseph  glancing at the poor man present .   as such i may be taunted .  as such i have been taunted .  but i ask no other title .     bless him for a noble gentleman .   thought trotty .    i don t agree with cute here  for instance   said sir joseph  holding out the letter .   i don t agree with the filer party .  i don t agree with any party .  my friend  the poor man  has no business with any thing of that sort  and nothing of that sort has any business with him .  my friend  the poor man  in my district  is my business .  no man or body of men has any right to interfere between my friend and me .  that is the ground i take .  i assume a  a paternal character toward my friend .  i say   my good fellow  i will treat you paternally .     with that great sentiment  he opened the alderman s letter  and read it .    very polite and attentive  i am sure .   exclaimed sir joseph .   my lady  the alderman is so obliging as to remind me that he has had  the distinguished honor   he is very good  of meeting me at the house of our mutual friend deedles  the banker  and he does me the favor to inquire whether it will be agreeable to me to have will fern put down .  he came up to london  it seems  to look for employment  trying to better himself  that s his story   and being found at night asleep in a shed  was taken into custody  and carried next morning before the alderman .  the alderman observes  very properly  that he is determined to put this sort of thing down  and that if it will be agreeable to me to have will fern put down  he will be happy to begin with him .     let him be made an example of  by all means   returned the lady .   last winter  when i introduced pinking and eyelet holing among the men and boys in the village as a nice evening employment  and had the lines   oh let us love our occupations  bless the squire and his relations  live upon our daily rations  and always know our proper stations   set to music on the new system  for them to sing the while  this very fern  i see him now  touched that hat of his  and said   i humbly ask your pardon  my lady  but an t i something different from a great girl .   i expected it  of course  who can expect anything but insolence and ingratitude from that class of people .  that is not to the purpose  however .  sir joseph .  make an example of him .    trotty  who had long ago relapsed  and was very low spirited  stepped forward with a rueful face to take the letter sir joseph held out to him .    you have heard  perhaps   said sir joseph  oracularly   certain remarks into which i have been led respecting the solemn period of time at which we have arrived  and the duty imposed upon us of settling our affairs  and being prepared .  now  my friend  can you lay your hand upon your heart  and say that you also have made preparation for a new year .     i am afraid  sir   stammered trotty  looking meekly at him   that i am a  a  little behind hand with the world .     behind hand with the world .   repeated sir joseph bowley  in a tone of terrible distinctness .    i am afraid  sir   faltered trotty   that there s a matter of ten or twelve shillings owing to mrs .  chickenstalker .     to mrs .  chickenstalker .   repeated sir joseph  in the same tone as before .    a shop  sir   exclaimed toby   in the general line .  also a  a little money on account of rent .  a very little  sir .  it oughtn t to be owing  i know  but we have been hard put to it  indeed .    sir joseph looked at his lady  and at mr .  fish  and at trotty  one after another  twice all round .  he then made a despondent gesture with both hands at once  as if he gave the thing up altogether .    how a man  even among this improvident and impracticable race  an old man  a man grown grey  can look a new year in the face with his affairs in this condition  how he can lie down on his bed at night  and get up again in the morning  and  there .   he said  turning his back on trotty .    take the letter .  take the letter .     i heartily wish it was otherwise  sir   said trotty  anxious to excuse himself .   we have been tried very hard .    sir joseph still repeating  take the letter  take the letter .   and mr .  fish not only saying the same thing  but giving additional force to the request by motioning the bearer to the door  he had nothing for it but to make his bow and leave the house .  and in the street  poor trotty pulled his worn old hat down on his head to hide the grief he felt at getting no hold on the new year  anywhere .   he didn t even lift his hat to look up at the bell tower when he came to the old church on his return .  he halted there a moment  from habit  and knew that it was growing dark and that the steeple rose above him indistinct and faint in the murky air .  he knew  too  that the chimes would ring immediately  and that they sounded to his fancy  at such a time  like voices in the clouds .  but he only made the more haste to deliver the alderman s letter and get out of the way before they began  for he dreaded to hear them tagging  friends and fathers  friends and fathers   to the burden they had rung out last .   toby discharged himself of his commission  therefore  with all possible speed and set off trotting homeward .  but what with his pace  which was at best an awkward one in the street  and what with his hat  which didn t improve it  he trotted against somebody in less than no time and was sent staggering out into the road .    i beg your pardon  i m sure .   said trotty  pulling up his hat in great confusion  and between the hat and the torn lining  fixing his head into a kind of bee hive .   i hope i haven t hurt you .    as to hurting anybody  toby was not such an absolute samson  but that he was much more likely to be hurt himself  and indeed he had flown out into the road like a shuttle cock .  he had such an opinion of his own strength  however  that he was in real concern for the other party  and said again    i hope i haven t hurt you .    the man against whom he had run  a sun browned  sinewy  country looking man  with grizzled hair and a rough chin  stared at him for a moment  as if he suspected him to be in jest .  but  satisfied of his good faith  he answered    no  friend .  you have not hurt me .     nor the child  i hope .   said trotty .    nor the child   returned the man .   i thank you kindly .    as he said so  he glanced at a little girl he carried in his arms  asleep  and shading her face with the long end of the poor handkerchief he wore about his throat  went slowly on .   the tone in which he said  i thank you kindly   penetrated trotty s heart .  he was so jaded and foot sore  and so soiled with travel  and looked about him so forlorn and strange  that it was a comfort to him to be able to thank anyone  no matter for how little .  toby stood gazing after him as he plodded wearily away  with the child s arm clinging round his neck .   at the figure in the worn shoes  now the very shade and ghost of shoes  rough leather leggings  common frock and broad slouched hat  trotty stood gazing  blind to the whole street .  and at the child s arm  clinging round its neck .   before he merged into the darkness the traveler stopped  and looking round and seeing trotty standing there yet  seemed undecided whether to return or go on .  after doing first the one and then the other  he came back  and trotty went half way to meet him .    you can tell me  perhaps   said the man with a faint smile   and if you can i am sure will  and i d rather ask you than another  where alderman cute lives .     close at hand   replied toby   i ll show you his house with pleasure .     i was to have gone to him elsewhere to morrow   said the man  accompanying toby   but i am uneasy under suspicion  and want to clear myself and to be free to go and seek my bread  i don t know where .  so  maybe he ll forgive my going to his house to night .     it s impossible   cried toby with a start   that your name s fern .     eh .   cried the other  turning on him in astonishment .    fern .  will fern .   said trotty .    that s my name   replied the other .    why  then   cried trotty  seizing him by the arm and looking cautiously round   for heaven s sake don t go to him .  don t go to him .  he ll put you down as sure as ever you were born .  here  come up this alley  and i ll tell you what i mean .  don t go to him .    his new acquaintance looked as if he thought him mad  but he bore him company  nevertheless .  when they were shrouded from observation  trotty told him what he knew  and what character he had received  and all about it .   the subject of his history listened to it with a calmness that surprised him .  he did not contradict or interrupt it once .  he nodded his head now and then  more in corroboration of an old and worn out story  it appeared  than in refutation of it  and once or twice threw back his hat  and passed his freckled hand over a brow  where every furrow he had ploughed seemed to have set its image in little .  but he did no more .    it s true enough in the main   he said   master  i could sift grain from the husk here and there  but let it be as  tis .  what odds .  i have gone against his plans  to my misfortun  .  i can t help it  i should do the like to morrow .  as to character  them gentlefolks will search and search  and pry and pry  and have it as free from spot or speck in us  afore they ll help us to a dry good word .   well .  i hope they don t lose good opinion as easy as we do  or their lives is strict indeed  and hardly worth the keeping .  for myself  master  i never took with that hand   holding it before him   what wasn t my own  and never held it back from work  however hard  or poorly paid .  whoever can deny it  let him chop it off .  but when work won t maintain me like a human creetur  when my living is so bad  that i am hungry  out of doors and in  when i see a whole working life begin that way  go on that way  and end that way  without a chance or change  then i say to the gentlefolks  keep away from me .  let my cottage be .  my doors is dark enough without your darkening of  em more .  don t look for me to come up into the park to help the show when there s a birthday  or a fine speechmaking  or what not .  act your plays and games without me  and be welcome to  em and enjoy  em .  we ve now to do with one another .  i m best let alone .     seeing that the child in his arms had opened her eyes  and was looking about in wonder  he checked himself to say a word or two of foolish prattle in her ear  and stand her on the ground beside him .  then slowly winding one of her long tresses round and round his rough forefinger like a ring  while she hung about his dusty leg  he said to trotty    i m not a cross grained man by natur   i believe  and easy satisfied  i m sure .  i bear no ill will against none of  em .  i only want to live like one of the almighty s creeturs .  i can t  i don t  and so there s a pit dug between me  and them that can and do .  there s others like me .  you might tell  em off by hundreds and by thousands  sooner than by ones .    trotty knew that he spoke the truth in this  and shook his head to signify as much .    i ve got a bad name this way   said fern   and i m not likely  i m afeared  to get a better .   tan t lawful to be out of sorts  and i am out of sorts  though god knows  i d sooner bear a cheerful spirit if i could .  well .  i don t know as this alderman could hurt me much by sending me to gaol  but without a friend to speak a word for me  he might do it  and you see   .   pointing downward with his finger  at the child .   he sunk his voice so low  and gazed upon her with an air so stern and strange  that toby  to divert the current of his thoughts  inquired if his wife were living .    i never had one   he returned  shaking his head .   she s my brother s child  a orphan .  nine year old  though you d hardly think it  but she s tired and worn out now .  they d have taken care on her in the union  eight and twenty mile away from where we live  between four walls  as they took care of my old father when he couldn t work no more  though he didn t trouble  em long   but i took her instead  and she s lived with me ever since .  her mother had a friend once  in london here .  we are trying to find her  and to find work too  but it s a large place .  never mind .  more room for us to walk about in  lilly .    meeting the child s eyes with a smile which melted toby more than tears  he shook him by the hand .    i don t so much as know your name   he said   but i ve opened my heart free to you  for i m thankful to you  with good reason .  i ll take your advice and keep clear of this      justice   suggested toby .    ah .   he said .   if that s the name they give him .  this justice .  and to morrow will try whether there s better fortun  to be met with somewheres near london .  goodnight .  a happy new year .     stay .   cried trotty  catching at his hand  as he relaxed his grip .   stay .  the new year never can be happy to me  if we part like this .  the new year can never be happy to me  if i see the child and you go wandering away  you don t know where  without a shelter for your heads .  come home with me .  i m a poor man  living in a poor place  but i can give you lodging for one night and never miss it .  come home with me .  here .  i ll take her .   cried trotty  lifting up the child .   a pretty one .  i d carry twenty times her weight  and never know i d got it .  tell me if i go too quick for you .  i m very fast .  i always was .   trotty said this  taking about six of his trotting paces to one stride of his fatigued companion  and with his thin legs quivering again  beneath the load he bore .    down the mews here  uncle will  and step at the black door  with  t .  veck  ticket porter   wrote upon a board  and here we are  and here we go  and here we are indeed  my precious meg  surprising you .    with which words trotty  in a breathless state  set the child down before his daughter in the middle of the floor .  the little visitor looked once at meg  and doubting nothing in that face  but trusting everything she saw there  ran into her arms .    here we are  and here we go .   cried trotty  running round the room and choking audibly .   here  uncle will  here s a fire you know .  why don t you come to the fire .  oh here we are and here we go .  meg  my precious darling  where s the kettle .  here it is and here it goes  and it ll bile in no time .    trotty really had picked up the kettle somewhere or other in the course of his wild career  and now put it on the fire  while meg  seating the child in a warm corner  knelt down on the ground before her  and pulled off her shoes  and dried her wet feet on a cloth .  ay  and she laughed at trotty too  so pleasantly  so cheerfully  that trotty could have blessed her where she kneeled  for he had seen that  when they entered  she was sitting by the fire in tears .    why  father .   said meg .   you re crazy to night  i think .  i don t know what the bells would say to that .    meg looked toward him and saw that he had elaborately stationed himself behind the chair of their male visitor  where with many mysterious gestures he was holding up the six pence he had earned .    i see  my dear   said trotty   as i was coming in  half an ounce of tea lying somewhere on the stairs  and i m pretty sure there was a bit of bacon too .  as i don t remember where it was exactly  i ll go myself and try to find  em .    with this inscrutable artifice  toby withdrew to purchase the viands he had spoken of  for ready money  at mrs .  chickenstalker s  and presently came back  pretending that he had not been able to find them  at first in the dark .    but here they are at last   said trotty  setting out the tea things   all correct .  i was pretty sure it was tea and a rasher .  so it is .  meg my pet  if you ll just make the tea  while your unworthy father toasts the bacon  we shall be ready immediate .  it s a curious circumstance   said trotty  proceeding in his cookery  with the assistance of the toasting fork   curious  but well known to my friends  that i never care  myself  for rashers  nor for tea .  i like to see other people enjoy  em   said trotty  speaking very loud to impress the fact upon his guest   but to me  as food  they are disagreeable .    yet trotty sniffed the savor of the hissing bacon  ah .   as if he liked it  and when he poured the boiling water in the tea pot  looked lovingly down into the depths of that snug caldron  and suffering the fragrant steam to curl about his nose  and wreathe his head and face in a thick cloud .  however  for all this  he neither ate nor drank  except at the very beginning  a mere morsel for form s sake  which he appeared to eat with infinite relish  but declared was perfectly uninteresting to him .    now  i ll tell you what   said trotty after tea .   the little one  she sleeps with meg  i know .     with good meg .   cried the child  caressing her .   with meg .     that s right   said trotty .   and i shouldn t wonder if she ll kiss meg s father  won t she .  i m meg s father .    mightily delighted trotty was  when the child went timidly toward him  and having kissed him  fell back upon meg again .   meg looked toward their guest  who leaned upon her chair  and with his face turned from her  fondled the child s head  half hidden in her lap .    to be sure   said toby .   to be sure .  i don t know what i am rambling on about  to night .  my wits are wool gathering  i think .  will fern  you come along with me .  you re tired to death  and broken down for want of rest .  you come along with me .    the hand released from the child s hair  had fallen  trembling  into trotty s hand .  so trotty  talking without intermission  led him out as tenderly and easily as if he had been a child himself .   returning before meg  he listened for an instant at the door of her little chamber  an adjoining room .  the child was murmuring a simple prayer before lying down to sleep  and when she had remembered meg s name   dearly  dearly   so her words ran  trotty heard her stop and ask for his .   it was some short time before the foolish little old fellow could compose himself to mend the fire  and draw his chair to the warm hearth .  but when he had done so  and had trimmed the light  he took his newspaper from his pocket and began to read .  carelessly at first  and skimming up and down the columns  but with an earnest and a sad attention  very soon .   for this same dreaded paper re directed trotty s thoughts into the channel they had taken all that day  and which the day s events had so marked out and shaped .  his interest in the two wanderers had set him on another course of thinking  and a happier one  for the time  but being alone again  and reading of the crimes and violences of the people  he relapsed into his former train .    it s too true  all i ve heard to day   toby muttered   too just  too full of proof .  we re bad .    the chimes took up the words so suddenly  burst out so loud  and clear  and sonorous  that the bells seemed to strike him in his chair .   and what was that  they said .    toby veck  toby veck  waiting for you toby .  toby veck  toby veck  waiting for you toby .  come and see us  come and see us  drag him to us  drag him to us  haunt and hunt him  haunt and hunt him  break his slumbers  break his slumbers .  toby veck  toby veck  door open wide toby  toby veck  toby veck  door open wide toby    then fiercely back to their impetuous strain again  and ringing in the very bricks and plaster on the walls .   toby listened .  fancy  fancy .  his remorse for having run away from them that afternoon .  no  no .  nothing of the kind .  again  again  and yet a dozen times again .   haunt and hunt him  haunt and hunt him  drag him to us  drag him to us .   deafening the whole town .    meg   said trotty  softly  tapping at her door .   do you hear anything .     i hear the bells  father .  surely they re very loud to night .     is she asleep .   said toby  making an excuse for peeping in .    so peacefully and happily .  i can t leave her yet though  father .  look how she holds my hand .     meg .   whispered trotty .   listen to the bells .    she listened  with her face toward him all the time .  but it underwent no change .  she didn t understand them .   trotty withdrew  resumed his seat by the fire  and once more listened by himself .  he remained here a little time .   it was impossible to bear it  their energy was dreadful .    if the tower door is really open   said toby  hastily laying aside his apron  but never thinking of his hat   what s to hinder me from going up in the steeple and satisfying myself .  if it s shut  i don t want any other satisfaction .  that s enough .    he was pretty certain as he slipped out quietly into the street that he should find it shut and locked  for he knew the door well  and had so rarely seen it open  that he couldn t reckon above three times in all .  it was a low arched portal outside the church  in a dark nook behind a column  and had such great iron hinges  and such a monstrous lock  that there was more hinge and lock than door .   but what was his astonishment when  coming bare headed to the church  and putting his hand into this dark nook  with a certain misgiving that it might be unexpectedly seized  and a shivering propensity to draw it back again  he found that the door  which opened outward  actually stood ajar .   he thought  on the first surprise  of going back  or of getting a light  or a companion  but his courage aided him immediately  and he determined to ascend alone .    what have i to fear .   said trotty .   it s a church .  besides the ringers may be there  and have forgotten to shut the door .    so he went in  feeling his way as he went  like a blind man  for it was very dark .  and very quiet  for the chimes were silent .   the dust from the street had blown into the recess  and lying there  heaped up  made it so soft and velvet like to the foot  that there was something startling even in that .  the narrow stair was so close to the door  too  that he stumbled at the very first  and shutting the door upon himself by striking it with his foot  and causing it to rebound back heavily  he couldn t open it again .   this was another reason  however  for going on .  trotty groped his way  and went on .  up  up  up  and round and round  and up  up  up  higher  higher  higher up .   until  ascending through the floor  and pausing with his head just raised above its beams  he came among the bells .  it was barely possible to make out their great shapes in the gloom  but there they were .  shadowy  and dark  and dumb .   a heavy sense of dread and loneliness fell instantly upon him  as he climbed into this airy nest of stone and metal .  his head went round and round .  he listened and then raised a wild  halloa .    halloa .  was mournfully protracted by the echoes .   giddy  confused  and out of breath  and frightened  toby looked about him vacantly  and sunk down in a swoon .   third quarter .   when and how the darkness of the night black steeple changed to shining light  and how the solitary tower was peopled with a myriad figures  when and how the whispered  haunt and hunt him   breathing monotonously through his sleep or swoon  became a voice exclaiming in the waking ears of trotty   break his slumbers   when and how he ceased to have a sluggish and confused idea that such things were  companioning a host of others that were not  there are no dates or means to tell .  but  awake  and standing on his feet upon the boards where he had lately lain  he saw this goblin sight .   then and not before  did trotty see in every bell a bearded figure of the bulk and stature of the bell  incomprehensibly  a figure and the bell itself .  gigantic  grave  and darkly watchful of him  as he stood rooted to the ground .   mysterious and awful figures .  resting on nothing  poised in the night air of the tower  with their draped and hooded heads merged in the dim roof  motionless and shadowy .  shadowy and dark  although he saw them by some light belonging to themselves  none else was there  each with its muffled hand upon its goblin mouth .   he could not plunge down wildly through the opening in the floor  for  all power of motion had deserted him .  otherwise he would have done so  ay  would have thrown himself  head foremost  from the steeple top  rather than have seen them watching him with eyes that would have waked and watched  although the pupils had been taken out .   a blast of air  how cold and shrill .   came moaning through the tower .  as it died away  the great bell  or the goblin of the great bell  spoke .    what visitor is this .   it said .  the voice was low and deep  and trotty fancied that it sounded in the other figures as well .    i thought my name was called by the chimes .   said trotty  raising his hands in an attitude of supplication .   i hardly know why i am here  or how i came .  i have listened to the chimes these many years .  they have cheered me often .     and you have thanked them .   said the bell .    a thousand times .   cried trotty .    how .     i am a poor man   faltered trotty   and could only thank them in words .     and always so .   inquired the goblin of the bell .   have you never done us wrong in words .     no .   cried trotty  eagerly .    never done us foul  and false  and wicked wrong  in words .   pursued the goblin of the bell .   trotty was about to answer  never .   but he stopped and was confused .    the voice of time   said the phantom   cries to man  advance .  time is for his advancement and improvement  for his greater worth  his greater happiness  his better life  his progress onward to that goal within its knowledge and its view  and set there  in the period when time and he began .  ages of darkness  wickedness  and violence  have come and gone  millions uncountable  have suffered  lived  and died  to point the way before him .  who seeks to turn him back  or stay him on his course  arrests a mighty engine which will strike the meddler dead  and be the fiercer and the wilder  ever  for its momentary check .     i never did so to my knowledge  sir   said trotty .   it was quite by accident if i did .  i wouldn t go to do it  i m sure .     who puts into the mouth of time  or of its servants   said the goblin of the bell   a cry of lamentation for days which have had their trial and their failure  and have left deep traces of it which the blind may see  a cry that only serves the present time  by showing men how much it needs their help when any ears can listen to regrets for such a past  who does this  does a wrong .  and you have done that wrong to us  the chimes .    trotty s first excess of fear was gone .  but he had felt tenderly and gratefully toward the bells  as you have seen  and when he heard himself arraigned as one who had offended them so weightily  his heart was touched with penitence and grief .    if you knew   said trotty  clasping his hands earnestly   or perhaps you do know  if you know how often you have kept me company  how often you have cheered me up when i ve been low  how you were quite the plaything of my little daughter meg  almost the only one she ever had  when first her mother died  and she and me were left alone  you won t bear malice for a hasty word .     who hears in us  the chimes  one note bespeaking disregard  or stern regard  of any hope  or joy  or pain  or sorrow  of the many sorrowed throng  who hears us make response to any creed that gauges human passions and affections  as it gauges the amount of miserable food on which humanity may pine and wither  does us wrong .  that wrong you have done us .   said the bell .    i have .   said trotty .   oh  forgive me .     spare me   cried trotty  falling on his knees   for mercy s sake .     listen .   said the shadow .    listen .   cried the other shadows .    listen .   said a clear and child like voice  which trotty thought he recognized as having heard before .   the organ sounded faintly in the church below .  swelling by degrees  the melody ascended to the roof  and filled the choir and nave .  expanding more and more  it rose up  up  up  up  higher  higher  higher up  awakening agitated hearts within the burly piles of oak  the hollow bells  the iron bound doors  the stairs of solid stone  until the tower walls were insufficient to contain it  and it soared into the sky .   no wonder that an old man s breast could not contain a sound so vast and mighty .  it broke from that weak prison in a rush of tears  and trotty put his hands before his face .    listen .   said the shadow .    listen .   said the other shadows .    listen .   said the child s voice .   a solemn strain of blended voices rose into the tower .   it was a very low and mournful strain  a dirge  and as he listened  trotty heard his child among the singers .    she is dead .   exclaimed the old man .   meg is dead .  her spirit calls to me .  i hear it .     the spirit of your child bewails the dead  and mingles with the dead  dead hopes  dead fancies  dead imaginings of youth   returned the bell   but she is living .  learn from her life  a living truth .  learn from the creature dearest to your heart  how bad the bad are born .  see every bud and leaf plucked one by one from off the fairest stem  and know how bare and wretched it may be .  follow her .  to desperation .    each of the shadowy figures stretched its right arm forth  and pointed downward .    the spirit of the chimes is your companion   said the figure .   go .  it stands behind you .    trotty turned  and saw  the child .  the child will fern had carried in the street  the child whom meg had watched  but now  asleep .    i carried her myself  to night   said trotty .   in these arms .     show him what he calls himself   said the dark figures  one and all .   the tower opened at his feet .  he looked down  and beheld his own form  lying at the bottom  on the outside  crushed and motionless .    no more a living man .   cried trotty .   dead .     dead .   said the figures altogether .    gracious heaven .  and the new year      past   said the figures .    what .   he cried  shuddering   i missed my way  and coming on the outside of this tower in the dark  fell down  a year ago .     nine years ago .   replied the figures .   as they gave the answer  they recalled their outstretched hands  and where their figures had been  there the bells were .    what are these .   he asked his guide .   if i am not mad  what are these .     spirits of the bells .  their sound upon the air   returned the child .   they take such shapes and occupations as the hopes and thoughts of mortals  and the recollections they have stored up  give them .     and you   said trotty  wildly .   what are you .     hush  hush .   returned the child .   look here .    in a poor  mean room  working at the same kind of embroidery  which he had often  often  seen before her  meg  his own dear daughter  was presented to his view .  he made no effort to imprint his kisses on her face  he did not strive to clasp her to his loving heart  he knew that such endearments were  for him  no more .  but he held his trembling breath  and brushed away the blinding tears  that he might look upon her  that he might only see her .   ah .  changed .  changed .  the light of the clear eye  how dimmed .  the bloom  how faded from the cheek .  beautiful she was  as she had ever been  but hope  hope  hope  oh  where was the fresh hope that had spoken to him like a voice .   she looked up from her work  at a companion .  following her eyes  the old man started back .   in the woman grown  he recognized her at a glance .  in the long silken hair  he saw the self same curls  around the lips  the child s expression lingering still .  see .  in the eyes  now turned inquiringly on meg  there shone the very look that scanned those features when he brought her home .   then what was this  beside him .   looking with awe into its face  he saw a something reigning there  a lofty something  undefined and indistinct  which made it hardly more than a remembrance of that child  as yonder figure might be  yet it was the same  the same  and wore the dress .   hark .  they were speaking .    meg   said lilian  hesitating .   how often you raise your head from your work to look at me .     are my looks so altered  that they frighten you .   asked meg .    nay  dear .  but you smile at that yourself .  why not smile when you look at me  meg .     i do so .  do i not .   she answered  smiling on her .    now you do   said lilian   but not usually .  when you think i m busy  and don t see you  you look so anxious and so doubtful  that i hardly like to raise my eyes .  there is little cause for smiling in this hard and toilsome life  but you were once so cheerful .     am i not now .   cried meg  speaking in a tone of strange alarm  and rising to embrace her .   do i make our weary life more weary to you  lilian .     you have been the only thing that made it life   said lilian  fervently kissing her   sometimes the only thing that made me care to live so  meg .  such work  such work .  so many hours  so many days  so many long  long nights of hopeless  cheerless  never ending work  not to heap up riches  not to live grandly or gayly  not to live upon enough  however coarse  but to earn bare bread  to scrape together just enough to toil upon  and want upon  and keep alive in us the consciousness of our hard fate .  oh  meg  meg .   she raised her voice and twined her arms about her as she spoke  like one in pain .   how can the cruel world go round  and bear to look upon such lives .     lilly .   said meg  soothing her  and putting back her hair from her wet face .   why  lilly .  you .  so pretty and so young .     oh  meg .   she interrupted  holding her at arm s length  and looking in her face imploringly .   the worst of all .  the worst of all .  strike me old  meg .  wither me and shrivel me  and free me from the dreadful thoughts that tempt me in my youth .    trotty turned to look upon his guide .  but  the spirit of the child had taken flight .  was gone .              fourth quarter .   some new remembrance of the ghostly figures in the bells  some faint impression of the ringing of the chimes  some giddy consciousness of having seen the swarm of phantoms reproduced and reproduced until the recollection of them lost itself in the confusion of their numbers  some hurried knowledge  how conveyed to him he knew not  that more years had passed  and trotty  with the spirit of the child attending him  stood looking on at mortal company .   fat company  rosy cheeked company  comfortable company .  they were but two  but they were red enough for ten .  they sat before a bright fire  with a small low table between them  and unless the fragrance of hot tea and muffins lingered longer in that room than in most others  the table had seen service very lately .  but all the cups and saucers being clean  and in their proper places in the corner cupboard  and the brass toasting fork hanging in its usual nook  and spreading its four idle fingers out  as if it wanted to be measured for a glove  there remained no other visible tokens of the meal just finished  than such as purred and washed their whiskers in the person of the basking cat  and glistened in the gracious  not to say the greasy  faces of her patrons .   this cosy couple  married  evidently  had made a fair division of the fire between them  and sat looking at the glowing sparks that dropped into the grate  now nodding off into a doze  now waking up again when some hot fragment  larger than the rest  came rattling down  as if the fire were coming with it .   it was in no danger of sudden extinction  however  for it gleamed not only in the little room  and on the panes of window glass in the door  and on the curtain half drawn across them  but in the little shop beyond .  a little shop  quite crammed and choked with the abundance of its stock  a perfectly voracious little shop  with a maw as accommodating and full as any shark s .  cheese  butter  firewood  soap  pickles  matches  bacon  table beer  peg tops  sweetmeats  boys  kites  bird seed  cold ham  birch brooms  hearth stones  salt  vinegar  blacking  red herrings  stationery  lard  mushroom ketchup  stay laces  loaves of bread  shuttlecocks  eggs  and slate pencils  everything was fish that came to the net of this greedy little shop  and all articles were in its net .   glancing at such of these items as were visible in the shining of the blaze  and the less cheerful radiance of two smoky lamps which burnt but dimly in the shop itself  as though its plethora sat heavy on their lungs  and glancing  then  at one of the two faces by the parlor fire  trotty had small difficulty in recognizing in the stout old lady  mrs .  chickenstalker  always inclined to corpulency  even in the days when he had known her as established in the general line  and having a small balance against him in her books .   the features of her companion were less easy to him .  the great broad chin  with creases in it large enough to hide a finger in  the astonished eyes  that seemed to expostulate with themselves for sinking deeper and deeper into the yielding fat of the soft face  the nose afflicted with that disordered action of its functions which is generally termed the snuffles  the short thick throat and laboring chest  with other beauties of the like description  though calculated to impress the memory  trotty could at first allot to nobody he had ever known  and yet he had some recollection of them too .  at length  in mrs .  chickenstalker s partner in the general line  and in the crooked and eccentric line of life  he recognized the former porter of sir joseph bowley  an apoplectic innocent  who had connected himself in trotty s mind with mrs .  chickenstalker years ago  by giving him admission to the mansion where he had confessed his obligations to that lady  and drawn on his unlucky head such grave reproach .   trotty had little interest in a change like this  after the changes he had seen  but association is very strong sometimes  and he looked involuntarily behind the parlor door  where the accounts of credit customers were usually kept in chalk .  there was no record of his name .  some names were there  but they were strange to him  and infinitely fewer than of old  from which he argued that the porter was an advocate of ready money transactions  and on coming into the business had looked pretty sharp after the chickenstalker defaulters .   so desolate was trotty  and so mournful for the youth and promise of his blighted child  that it was a sorrow to him  even to have no place in mrs .  chickenstalker s ledger .    what sort of a night is it  anne .   inquired the former porter of sir joseph bowley  stretching out his legs before the fire  and rubbing as much of them as his short arms could reach  with an air that added   here i am if it s bad  and i don t want to go out if it s good .     hard weather indeed   returned his wife  shaking her head .    ay  ay .  years   said mr .  tugby   are like christians in that respect .  some of  em die hard  some of  em die easy .  this one hasn t many days to run  and is making a fight for it .  i like him all the better .  there s a customer  my love .    attentive to the rattling door  mrs .  tugby had already risen .    now  then .   said that lady  passing out into the little shop .   what s wanted .  oh .  i beg your pardon  sir  i m sure .  i didn t think it was you .    she made this apology to a gentleman in black  who  with his wristbands tucked up  and his hat cocked loungingly on one side  and his hand in his pocket  sat down astride on the table beer barrel  and nodded in return .    this is a bad business up stairs  mrs .  tugby   said the gentleman .   the man can t live .     not the back attic can t .   cried tugby  coming out into the shop to join the conference .    the back attic  mr .  tugby   said the gentleman   is coming down stairs fast  and will be below the basement very soon .    looking by turns at tugby and his wife  he sounded the barrel with his knuckles for the depth of beer  and having found it  played a tune upon the empty part .    the back attic  mr .  tugby   said the gentleman  tugby having stood in silent consternation for some time   is going .     then   said tugby  turning to his wife   he must go  you know  before he s gone .     i don t think you can move him   said the gentleman  shaking his head .   i wouldn t take the responsibility of saying it could be done  myself .  you had better leave him where he is .  he can t live long .     it s the only subject   said tugby  bringing the butter scale down upon the counter with a crash  by weighing his fist on it   that we ve ever had a word upon  she and me  and look what it comes to .  he s going to die here  after all .  going to die upon the premises .  going to die in our house .     and where should he have died  tugby .   cried his wife .    in the workhouse   he returned .   what are workhouses made for .     not for that .   said mrs .  tugby  with great energy .   not for that .  neither did i marry you for that .  don t think it  tugby .  i won t have it .  i won t allow it .  i d be separated first  and never see your face again .  when my widow s name stood over that door  as it did for many  many years  the house being known as mrs .  chickenstalker s far and wide  and never known but to its honest credit and its good report  when my widow s name stood over that door  tugby  i knew him as a handsome  steady  manly  independent youth  i knew her as the sweetest looking  sweetest tempered girl  eyes ever saw  i knew her father  poor old creetur  he fell down from the steeple walking in his sleep  and killed himself   for the simplest  hardest working  childest hearted man  that ever drew the breath of life  and when i turn them out of house and home  may angels turn me out of heaven .  as they would .  and serve me right .    her old face  which had been a plump and dimpled one before the changes which had come to pass  seemed to shine out of her as she said these words  and when she dried her eyes  and shook her head and her handkerchief at tugby  with an expression of firmness which it was quite clear was not to be easily resisted  trotty said   bless her .  bless her .    then he listened  with a panting heart  for what should follow .  knowing nothing yet  but that they spoke of meg .   the gentleman upon the table beer cask  who appeared to be some authorized medical attendant upon the poor  was far too well accustomed  evidently  to little differences of opinion between man and wife  to interpose any remark in this instance .  he sat softly whistling  and turning little drops of beer out of the tap upon the ground  until there was a perfect calm  when he raised his head and said to mrs .  tugby  late chickenstalker    there s something interesting about the woman  even now .  how did she come to marry him .     why  that   said mrs .  tugby  taking a seat near him   is not the least cruel part of her story  sir .  you see they kept company  she and richard  many years ago .  when they were a young and beautiful couple  everything was settled  and they were to have been married on a new year s day .  but  somehow  richard got it into his head  through what the gentleman told him  that he might do better  and that he d soon repent it  and that she wasn t good enough for him  and that a young man of spirit had no business to be married .  and the gentleman frightened her  and made her melancholy  and timid of his deserting her  and of her children coming to the gallows  and of its being wicked to be man and wife  and a good deal more of it .  and in short  they lingered and lingered  and their trust in one another was broken  and so at last was the match .  but the fault was his .  she would have married him  sir  joyfully .  i ve seen her heart swell  many times afterwards  when he passed her in a proud and careless way  and never did a woman grieve more truly for a man  than she for richard when he first went wrong .     oh .  he went wrong  did he .   said the gentleman  pulling out the vent peg of the table beer  and trying to peep down into the barrel through the hole .    well  sir  i don t know that he rightly understood himself  you see .  i think his mind was troubled by their having broke with one another  and that but for being ashamed before the gentlemen  and perhaps for being uncertain too  how she might take it  he d have gone through any suffering or trial to have had meg s promise  and meg s hand again .  that s my belief .  he never said so  more s the pity .  he took to drinking  idling  bad companions  all the fine resources that were to be so much better for him than the home he might have had .  he lost his looks  his character  his health  his strength  his friends  his work  everything .     he didn t lose everything  mrs .  tugby   returned the gentleman   because he gained a wife  and i want to know how he gained her .     i m coming to it  sir  in a moment .  this went on for years and years  he sinking lower and lower  she enduring  poor thing  miseries enough to wear her life away .  at last he was so cast down  and cast out  that no one would employ or notice him  and doors were shut upon him  go where he would .  applying from place to place  and door to door  and coming for the hundredth time to one gentleman  who had often and often tried him  he was a good workman to the very end   that gentleman  who knew his history  said   i believe you are incorrigible  there s only one person in the world who has a chance of reclaiming you  ask me to trust you no more  until she tries to do it .   something like that  in his anger and vexation .     ah .   said the gentleman .   well .     well  sir  he went to her  and kneeled to her  said it was so  said it ever had been so  and made a prayer to her to save him .     and she .   don t distress yourself  mrs .  tugby .     she came to me that night to ask me about living here .   what he was once to me   she said   is buried in a grave  side by side with what i was to him .  but i have thought of this  and i will make the trial .  in the hope of saving him  for the love of the light hearted girl  you remember her  who was to have been married on a new year s day  and for the love of her richard .   and he said he had come to her from lilian  and lilian had trusted to him  and she never could forget that .  so they were married  and when they came home here  and i saw them  i hoped that such prophecies as parted them when they were young  may not often fulfill themselves as they did in this case  or i wouldn t be the makers of them for a mine of gold .    the gentleman got off the cask  and stretched himself  observing    i suppose he used her ill  as soon as they were married .     i don t think he ever did that   said mrs .  tugby  shaking her head and wiping her eyes .   he went on better for a short time  but  his habits were too old and strong to be got rid of  he soon fell back a little  and was falling fast back  when his illness came so strong upon him .  i think he has always felt for her .  i am sure he has .  i ve seen him in his crying fits and tremblings  try to kiss her hand  and i have heard him call her  meg   and say it was her nineteenth birthday .  there he has been lying  now  these weeks and months .  between him and her baby  she has not been able to do her old work  and by not being able to be regular  she has lost it  even if she could have done it .  how they have lived  i hardly know .     i know   muttered mr .  tugby  looking at the till  and round the shop  and at his wife  and rolling his head with immense intelligence .   he was interrupted by a cry  a sound of lamentation  from the upper story of the house .  the gentleman moved hurriedly to the door .    my friend   he said  looking back   you needn t discuss whether he shall be removed or not .  he has spared you that trouble  i believe .    saying so  he ran up stairs  followed by mrs .  tugby  while mr .  tugby panted and grumbled after them at leisure  being rendered more than commonly short winded by the weight of the till  in which there had been an inconvenient quantity of copper .  trotty  with the child beside him  floated up the staircase like mere air .    follow her .  follow her .  follow her .   he heard the ghostly voices in the bells repeat their words as he ascended .   learn it  from the creature dearest to your heart .    it was over .  it was over .  and this was she  her father s pride and joy .  this haggard  wretched woman  weeping by the bed  if it deserved that name  and pressing to her breast  and hanging down her head upon  an infant .  who can tell how spare  how sickly  and how poor an infant .  who can tell how dear .    thank god .   cried trotty  holding up his folded hands .   o  god be thanked .  she loves her child .    again trotty heard the voices  saying   follow her .   he turned toward his guide  and saw it rising from him  passing through the air .   follow her .   it said .  and vanished .   he hovered round her  sat down at her feet  looked up into her face for one trace of her old self  listened for one note of her old pleasant voice .  he flitted round the child  so wan  so prematurely old  so dreadful in its gravity  so plaintive in its feeble  mournful  miserable wail .  he almost worshiped it .  he clung to it as her only safeguard  as the last unbroken link that bound her to endurance .  he set his father s hope and trust on the frail baby  watched her every look upon it as she held it in her arms  and cried a thousand times   she loves it .  god be thanked  she loves it .    he saw the woman tend her in the night  return to her when her grudging husband was asleep  and all was still  encourage her  shed tears with her  set nourishment before her .  he saw the day come  and the night again  the day  the night  the time go by  the house of death relieved of death  the room left to herself and to the child  he heard it moan and cry  he saw it harass her  and tire her out  and when she slumbered in exhaustion  drag her back to consciousness  and hold her with its little hands upon the rack  but she was constant to it  gentle with it  patient with it .  patient .  was its loving mother in her inmost heart and soul  and had its being knitted up with hers as when she carried it unborn .   all this time  she was in want  languishing away  in dire and pining want .  with the baby in her arms  she wandered here and there in quest of occupation  and with its thin face lying in her lap  and looking up in hers  did any work for any wretched sum  a day and night of labor for as many farthings as there were figures on the dial .  if she had quarreled with it  if she had neglected it  if she had looked upon it with a moment s hate .  if  in the frenzy of an instant  she had struck it .  no .  his comfort was  she loved it always .   she told no one of her extremity  and wandered abroad in the day lest she should be questioned by her only friend  for any help she received from her hands  occasioned fresh disputes between the good woman and her husband  and it was new bitterness to be the daily cause of strife and discord  where she owed so much .   she loved it still .  she loved it more and more .  but a change fell on the aspect of her love .   one night she was singing faintly to it in its sleep and walking to and fro to hush it  when her door was softly opened  and a man looked in .    for the last time   he said .    william fern .     for the last time .    he listened like a man pursued  and spoke in whispers .    margaret  my race is nearly run  i couldn t finish it  without a parting word with you .  without one grateful word .     what have you done .   she asked  regarding him with terror .   he looked at her but gave no answer .   after a short silence  he made a gesture with his hand  as if he set her question by  as if he brushed it aside  and said    it s long ago  margaret  now  but that night is as fresh in my memory as ever  twas .  we little thought then   he added  looking round   that we should ever meet like this .  your child  margaret .  let me have it in my arms .  let me hold your child .    he put his hat upon the floor  and took it .  and he trembled as he took it  from head to foot .    is it a girl .     yes .    he put his hand before its little face .    see how weak i m grown  margaret  when i want the courage to look at it .  let her be  a moment .  i won t hurt her .  it s long ago  but  what s her name .     margaret   she answered quickly .    i m glad of that   he said .   i m glad of that .    he seemed to breathe more freely  and after pausing for an instant  took away his hand  and looked upon the infant s face .  but covered it again  immediately .    margaret .   he said  and gave her back the child .   it s lilian s .     lilian s .     i held the same face in my arms when lilian s mother died and left her .     when lilian s mother died and left her .   she repeated  wildly .    how shrill you speak .  why do you fix your eyes upon me so .  margaret .    she sunk down in a chair  and pressed the infant to her breast  and wept over it .  sometimes  she released it from her embrace  to look anxiously in its face  then strained it to her bosom again .  at those times  when she gazed upon it  then it was that something fierce and terrible began to mingle with her love .  then it was that her old father quailed .    follow her .   was sounded through the house .   learn it  from the creature dearest to your heart .     margaret   said fern  bending over her  and kissing her upon the brow   i thank you for the last time .  good night .  good bye .  put your hand in mine  and tell me you ll forget me from this hour  and try to think the end of me was here .    she called to him  but he was gone .  she sat down stupefied  until her infant roused her to a sense of hunger  cold  and darkness .  she paced the room with it the livelong night  hushing it and soothing it .  she said at intervals   like lilian when her mother died and left her .   why was her step so quick  her eyes so wild  her love so fierce and terrible  whenever she repeated those words .    but  it is love   said trotty .   it is love .  she ll never cease to love it .  my poor meg .    she dressed the child next morning with unusual care  ah  vain expenditure of care upon such squalid robes .   and once more tried to find some means of life .  it was the last day of the old year .  she tried till night  and never broke her fast .  she tried in vain .   she mingled with an abject crowd  who tarried in the snow  until it pleased some officer appointed to dispense the public charity  the lawful charity  not that once preached upon a mount   to call them in  and question them  and say to this one   go to such a place   to that one   come next week   to make a foot ball of another wretch  and pass him here and there  from hand to hand  from house to house  until he wearied and lay down to die  or started up and robbed  and so became a higher sort of criminal  whose claims allowed of no delay .  here  too  she failed .   she loved her child  and wished to have it lying on her breast .  and that was quite enough .   it was night  a bleak  dark  cutting night  when pressing the child close to her for warmth  she arrived outside the house she called her home .  she was so faint and giddy  that she saw no one standing in the doorway until she was close upon it  and about to enter .  then  she recognized the master of the house  who had so disposed himself  with his person it was not difficult  as to fill up the whole entry .    oh .   he said softly .   you have come back .    she looked at the child and shook her head .    don t you think you have lived here long enough without paying any rent .  don t you think that  without any money  you ve been a pretty constant customer at this shop  now .   said mr .  tugby .   she repeated the same mute appeal .    suppose you try and deal somewhere else   he said .   and suppose you provide yourself with another lodging .  come .  don t you think you could manage it .    she said  in a low voice  that it was very late .  to morrow .    now i see what you want   said tugby   and what you mean .  you know there are two parties in this house about you  and you delight in setting them by the ears .  i don t want any quarrels  i m speaking softly to avoid a quarrel  but if you don t go away  i ll speak out loud  and you shall cause words loud enough to please you .  but you shan t come in  that i am determined .    she put her hair back with her hand  and looked in a sudden manner at the sky  and the dark lowering distance .    this is the last night of an old year  and i won t carry ill blood and quarrelings and disturbances into a new one  to please you nor anybody else   said tugby  who was quite a retail friend and father .   i wonder you an t ashamed of yourself  to carry such practices into a new year .  if you haven t any business in the world  but to be always giving way  and always making disturbances between man and wife  you d be better out of it .  go along with you .     follow her .  to desperation .    again the old man heard the voices .  looking up  he saw the figures hovering in the air  and pointing where she went  down the dark street .    she loves it .   he exclaimed in agonized entreaty for her .   chimes .  she loves it still .     follow her .   the shadows swept upon the track she had taken like a cloud .   oh  for something to awaken her .  for any sight or sound  or scent  to call up tender recollections in a brain on fire .  for any gentle image of the past  to rise up before her .    i was her father .  i was her father .   cried the old man  stretching out his hands to the dark shadows flying on above .   have mercy on her  and on me .  where does she go .  turn her back .  i was her father .    but  they only pointed to her  as she hurried on   to desperation .  learn it from the creature dearest to your heart .    a hundred voices echoed it .  the air was made of breath expended in those words .  he seemed to take them in  at every gasp he drew .  they were everywhere  and not to be escaped .  and still she hurried on  the same light in her eyes .   all at once she stopped .    now  turn her back .   exclaimed the old man  tearing his white hair .   my child .  meg .  turn her back .  great father  turn her back .    in her own scanty shawl  she wrapped the baby warm .  with her fevered hands  she smoothed its limbs  composed its face  arranged its mean attire .  in her wasted arms she folded it  as though she never would resign it more .  and with her dry lips  kissed it in a final pang  and last long agony of love .   putting its tiny hand up to her neck  and holding it there  within her dress  next to her distracted heart  she set its sleeping face against her  closely  steadily against her  and sped onward to the river .   to the rolling river  swift and dim  where winter night sat brooding like the last dark thoughts of many who had sought a refuge there before her .  where scattered lights upon the banks gleamed sullen  red and dull  as torches that were burning there to show the way to death .  where no abode of living people cast its shadow  on the deep  impenetrable  melancholy shade .   to the river .  to that portal of eternity  her desperate footsteps tended with the swiftness of its rapid waters running to the sea .  he tried to touch her as she passed him  going down to its dark level  but  the wild distempered form  the fierce and terrible love  the desperation that had left all human check or hold behind  swept by him like the wind .   he followed her .  she paused a moment on the brink  before the dreadful plunge .  he fell down on his knees  and in a shriek addressed the figures in the bells now hovering above them .    have mercy on her .   he exclaimed   as one in whom this dreadful crime has sprung from love perverted  from the strongest  deepest love we fallen creatures know .  think what her misery must have been  when such seed bears such fruit .  heaven meant her to be good .  there is no loving mother on the earth who might not come to this  if such a life had gone before .  oh  have mercy on my child  who  even at this pass  means mercy to her own  and dies herself  and perils her immortal soul  to save it .    she was in his arms .  he held her now .  his strength was like a giant s .   he might have said more  but the bells  the old familiar bells  his own dear  constant  steady friends  the chimes  began to ring the joy peals for a new year  so lustily  so merrily  so happily  so gayly  that he leapt upon his feet  and broke the spell that bound him .               and whatever you do  father   said meg   don t eat tripe again without asking some doctor whether it s likely to agree with you  for how you have been going on  good gracious .    she was working with her needle at the little table by the fire  dressing her simple gown with ribbons for her wedding .  so quietly happy  so blooming and youthful  so full of beautiful promise  that he uttered a great cry as if it were an angel in his house  then flew to clasp her in his arms .   but he caught his feet in the newspaper  which had fallen on the hearth  and somebody came rushing in between them .    no .   cried the voice of this same somebody  a generous and jolly voice it was .   not even you .  not even you .  the first kiss of meg in the new year is mine .  mine .  i have been waiting outside the house this hour to hear the bells and claim it .  meg  my precious prize  a happy year .  a life of happy years  my darling wife .    and richard smothered her with kisses .   you never in all your life saw anything like trotty after this .  i don t care where you have lived or what you have seen  you never in all your life saw anything at all approaching him .  he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and cried  he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and laughed  he sat down in his chair and beat his knees and laughed and cried together  he got out of his chair and hugged meg  he got out of his chair and hugged richard  he got out of his chair and hugged them both at once  he kept running up to meg and squeezing her fresh face between his hands and kissing it  going from her backward not to lose sight of it  and running up again like a figure in a magic lantern  and whatever he did  he was constantly sitting himself down in this chair  and never stopping in it for one single moment  being  that s the truth  beside himself with joy .    and to morrow s your wedding day  my pet .   cried trotty .   your real  happy wedding day .     to day .   cried richard  shaking hands with him .   to day .  the chimes are ringing in the new year .  hear them .    they were ringing .  bless their sturdy hearts  they were ringing .  great bells as they were  melodious  deep mouthed  noble bells  cast in no common metal  made by no common founder  when had they ever chimed like that before .    but to day  my pet   said trotty .   you and richard had some words to day .     because he s such a bad fellow  father   said meg .   an t you  richard .  such a headstrong  violent man .  he d have made no more of speaking his mind to that great alderman  and putting him down i don t know where  than he would of        kissing meg   suggested richard .  doing it  too .    no .  not a bit more   said meg .   but i wouldn t let him  father .  where would have been the use .     richard  my boy .   cried trotty .   you was turned up trumps originally  and trumps you must be until you die .  but you were crying by the fire to night  my pet  when i came home .  why did you cry by the fire .     i was thinking of the years we ve passed together  father .  only that .  and thinking you might miss me  and be lonely .    trotty was backing off to that extraordinary chair again  when the child  who had been awakened by the noise  came running in  half dressed .    why  here she is .   cried trotty catching her up .   here s little lilian .  ha  ha  ha .  here we are and here we go .  o  here we are and here we go again .  and here we are and here we go .  and uncle will  too .   stopping in his trot to greet him heartily .   o  uncle will  the vision that i ve had to night  through lodging you .  o  uncle will  the obligations that you ve laid me under by your coming  my good friend .    before will fern could make the least reply  a band of music burst into the room  attended by a flock of neighbors  screaming   a happy new year  meg .    a happy wedding .    many of  em .   and other fragmentary good wishes of that sort .  the drum  who was a private friend of trotty s  then stepped forward and said    trotty veck  my boy .  it s got about that your daughter is going to be married to morrow .  there an t a soul that knows you that don t wish you well  or that knows her and don t wish her well .  or that knows you both and don t wish you both all the happiness the new year can bring .  and here we are  to play it in accordingly .     what a happiness it is  i m sure   said trotty   to be so esteemed .  how kind and neighborly you are .  it s all along of my dear daughter .  she deserves it .    at this moment a combination of prodigious sounds was heard outside  and a good humored  comely woman of some fifty years of age  or thereabouts  came running in  closely followed by the marrow bones and cleavers and the bells  not the bells  but a portable collection on a frame .   trotty said   it s mrs .  chickenstalker .   and sat down and beat his knees again .    married  and not tell me  meg .   cried the good woman .   never .  i couldn t rest on the last night of the old year without coming to wish you joy .  i couldn t have done it  meg .  not if i had been bed ridden .  so here i am .     mrs .  tugby   said trotty  who had been going round and round her in an ecstasy   i should say chickenstalker  bless your heart and soul .  a happy new year  and many of  em .  mrs .  tugby   said trotty  when he had saluted her   i should say chickenstalker  this is william fern and lilian .    the worthy dame  to his surprise  turned very pale and very red .    not lilian fern  whose mother died in dorsetshire .   said she .   her uncle answered  yes   and meeting hastily they exchanged some hurried words together  of which the upshot was that mrs .  chickenstalker shook him by both hands  saluted trotty on his cheek again of her own free will  and took the child to her capacious breast .    will fern   said trotty  pulling on his right hand muffler .   not the friend that you was hoping to find .     ay   returned will  putting a hand on each of trotty s shoulders .   and like to prove a most as good a friend  if that can be  as one i found .     o .   said trotty .   please to play up there .  will you have the goodness .    had trotty dreamed .  or are his joys and sorrows  and the actors in them  but a dream  himself a dream  the teller of this tale a dreamer  waking but now .  if it be so  o listener  dear to him in all his visions  try to bear in mind the stern realities from which these shadows come  and in your sphere  none is too wide and none too limited for such an end  endeavor to correct  improve and soften them .  so may the new year be a happy one to you  happy to many more whose happiness depends on you .  so may each year be happier than the last  and not the meanest of our brethren or sisterhood debarred their rightful share in what our great creator formed them to enjoy .                billy s santa claus experience .   by cornelia redmond .   of course i don t believe in any such person as santa claus  but tommy does .  tommy is my little brother  aged six .  last christmas i thought i d make some fun for the young one by playing santa claus  but as always happens when i try to amuse anybody i jes  got myself into trouble .   i went to bed pretty early on christmas eve so as to give my parents a chance to get the presents out of the closet in mamma s room  where they had been locked up since they were bought .  i kep  my clo es on except my shoes  and put my nightgown over them so as i d look white if any of them came near me .  then i waited  pinchin  myself to keep awake .  after a while papa came into the room with a lot of things that he dumped on tommy s bed .  then mamma came in and put some things on mine and in our two stockings that were hung up by the chimney .  then they both went out very quiet  and soon all the lights went out too .   i kep  on pinchin  myself and waitin  for a time  and then when i was sure that everybody was asleep i got up .  the first thing i went into was my sister s room and got her white fur rug that mamma gave her on her birthday  and her sealskin cape that was hanging on the closet door .  i tied the cape on my head with shoestrings and it made a good big cap .  then i put the fur rug around me and pinned it with big safety pins what i found on tommy s garters .  then i got mamma s new scrap basket  trimmed with roses  what mrs .  simmons  broidered for the church fair and piled all of the kid s toys into it .  i fastened it to my back with papa s suspenders  and then i started for the roof .   i hurt my fingers some opening the scuttle  but kept right on .  it was snowing hard and i stood and let myself get pretty well covered with flakes .  then i crawled over to the chimney that went down into our room and climbed up on top of it .  i had brought my bicycle lantern with me and i lighted it so as tommy could see me when i came down the chimney into the room .   there did not seem to be any places inside the chimney where i could hold on by my feet  but the ceiling in our room was not very high and i had often jumped most as far  so i jes  let her go  and i suppose i went down .  anyway  i did not know about anything for a long time .  then i woke up all in the dark with my head feeling queer  and when i tried to turn over in bed i found i wasn t in bed at all  and then my arms and legs began to hurt terrible  mostly one arm that was doubled up .  i tried to get up but i couldn t because my bones hurt so and i was terrible cold and there was nothing to stand on .  i was jes  stuck .  then i began to cry  and pretty soon i heard mamma s voice saying to papa    those must be sparrers that are making that noise in the chimney .  jes  touch a match to the wood in the boys  fireplace .    i heard papa strike a light and then the wood began to crackle .  then  by jinks .  it began to get hot and smoky and i screamed    help .  murder .  put out that fire lest you want to burn me up .    then i heard papa stamping on the wood and mamma calling out    where s billy .  where is my chile .    next tommy woke up and began to cry and everything was terrible  specially the pains all over me .  then papa called out very stern    william  if you are in that chimney come down at once .   and i answered  cryin   that i would if i could  but i was stuck and couldn t .   then i heard papa gettin  dressed  and pretty soon he and john from the stable went up on the roof and let down ropes what i put around me and they hauled me up .   it was jes  daylight and i was all black and sooty and scratched and my arm was broken .   everybody scolded me excep  mamma .  i had spoiled my sister s white rug and broken all of tommy s toys  and the snow what went in through the scuttle melted and marked the parlor ceiling  besides i guess it cost papa a good deal to get my arm mended .  nobody would believe that i had jes  meant to make some fun for tommy  and my arm and all my bruised places hurt me awful for a long time .  if i live to be a million i am never goin  to play santa claus ag in .              christmas in poganuc .   by harriet beecher stowe .   the first christmas .   can any of us look back to the earlier days of our mortal pilgrimage and remember the helpless sense of desolation and loneliness caused by being forced to go off to the stillness and darkness of a solitary bed far from all the beloved voices and employments and sights of life .  can we remember lying  hearing distant voices  and laughs of more fortunate  older people and the opening and shutting of distant doors  that told of scenes of animation and interest from which we were excluded .  how doleful sounded the tick of the clock  and how dismal was the darkness as sunshine faded from the window  leaving only a square of dusky dimness in place of daylight .   all who remember these will sympathize with dolly  who was hustled off to bed by nabby the minute supper was over  that she might have the decks clear for action .    now be a good girl  shut your eyes  and say your prayers  and go right to sleep   had been nabby s parting injunction as she went out  closing the door after her .   the little head sunk into the pillow  and dolly recited her usual liturgy of  our father who art in heaven   and  i pray god to bless my dear father and mother and all my dear friends and relations  and make me a good girl   and ending with    now i lay me down to sleep .     but sleep she could not .  the wide  bright  wistful blue eyes lay shining like two stars toward the fading light in the window  and the little ears were strained to catch every sound .  she heard the shouts of tom and bill and the loud barking of spring as they swept out of the door  and the sound went to her heart .  spring  her faithful attendant  the most loving and sympathetic of dogs  her friend and confidential counselor in many a solitary ramble  spring had gone with the boys to see the sight  and left her alone .  she began to pity herself and cry softly on her pillow .  for a while she could hear nabby s energetic movements below  washing up dishes  putting back chairs  and giving energetic thumps and bangs here and there  as her way was of producing order .  but by and by that was all over  and she heard the loud shutting of the kitchen door and nabby s voice chatting with her attendant as she went off to the scene of gaiety .   in those simple  innocent days in new england villages nobody thought of locking house doors at night .  there was in those times no idea either of tramps or burglars  and many a night in summer had dolly lain awake and heard the voices of tree toads and whip poor wills mingling with the whisper of leaves and the swaying of elm boughs  while the great outside door of the house lay broad open in the moonlight .  but then this was when everybody was in the house and asleep  when the door of her parents  room stood open on the front hall  and she knew she could run to the paternal bed in a minute for protection .  now  however  she knew the house was empty .  everybody had gone out of it  and there is something fearful to a little lonely body in the possibilities of a great  empty house .  she got up and opened her door  and the  tick tock  of the old kitchen clock for a moment seemed like company  but pretty soon its ticking began to strike louder and louder with a nervous insistency on her ear  till the nerves quivered and vibrated  and she couldn t go to sleep .  she lay and listened to all the noises outside .  it was a still  clear  freezing night  when the least sound clinked with a metallic resonance .  she heard the runners of sleighs squeaking and crunching over the frozen road  and the lively jingle of bells .  they would come nearer  nearer  pass by the house  and go off in the distance .  those were the happy folks going to see the gold star and the christmas greens in the church .  the gold star  the christmas greens  had all the more attraction from their vagueness .  dolly was a fanciful little creature  and the clear air and romantic scenery of a mountain town had fed her imagination .  stories she had never read  except in the bible and the pilgrim s progress  but her very soul had vibrated with the descriptions of the celestial city  something vague  bright  glorious  lying beyond some dark river  and nabby s rude account of what was going on in the church suggested those images .   finally a bright thought popped into her little head .  she could see the church from the front windows of the house  she would go there and look .  in haste she sprang out of bed and dressed herself .  it was sharp and freezing in the fireless chamber  but dolly s blood had a racing  healthy tingle to it  she didn t mind cold .  she wrapped her cloak around her and tied on her hood and ran to the front windows .  there it was  to be sure  the little church with its sharp pointed windows  every pane of which was sending streams of light across the glittering snow .  there was a crowd around the door  and men and boys looking in at the windows .  dolly s soul was fired .  but the elm boughs a little obstructed her vision  she thought she would go down and look at it from the yard .  so down stairs she ran  but as she opened the door the sound of the chant rolled out into the darkness with sweet and solemn cadence    glory be to god on high  and on earth peace  good will toward men .    dolly s soul was all aglow  her nerves tingled and vibrated  she thought of the bells ringing in the celestial city  she could no longer contain herself  but faster and faster the little hooded form scudded across the snowy plain and pushed in among the dark cluster of spectators at the door .  all made way for the child  and in a moment  whether in the body or out she could not tell  dolly was sitting in a little nook under a bower of spruce  gazing at the star and listening to the voices    we praise thee  we bless thee  we worship thee  we glorify thee  we give thanks to thee for thy great glory  o lord god  heavenly king  god  the father almighty .    her heart throbbed and beat  she trembled with a strange happiness and sat as one entranced till the music was over .  then came reading  the rustle and murmur of people kneeling  and then they all rose and there was the solemn buzz of voices repeating the creed with a curious lulling sound to her ear .  there was old mr .  danforth with his spectacles on  reading with a pompous tone  as if to witness a good confession for the church  and there were squire lewis and old ma am lewis  and there was one place where they all bowed their heads and all the ladies made courtesies  all of which entertained her mightily .   when the sermon began dolly got fast asleep  and slept as quietly as a pet lamb in a meadow  lying in a little warm roll back under the shadows of the spruces .  she was so tired and so sound asleep that she did not wake when the service ended  lying serenely curled up  and having perhaps pleasant dreams .  she might have had the fortunes of little goody two shoes  whose history was detailed in one of the few children s books then printed  had not two friends united to find her out .   spring  who had got into the slip with the boys  and been an equally attentive and edified listener  after service began a tour of investigation  dog fashion  with his nose  for how could a minister s dog form a suitable judgment of any new procedure if he was repressed from the use of his own leading faculty .  so  spring went round the church conscientiously  smelling at pew doors  smelling of the greens  smelling at the heels of gentlemen and ladies  till he came near the door of the church  when he suddenly smelt something which called for immediate attention  and he made a side dart into the thicket where dolly was sleeping  and began licking her face and hands and pulling her dress  giving short barks occasionally  as if to say   come  dolly  wake up .   at the same instant hiel  who had seen her from the gallery  came down just as the little one was sitting up with a dazed  bewildered air .    why  dolly  how came you out o  bed this time o  night .  don t ye know the nine o clock bell s jest rung .    dolly knew hiel well enough  what child in the village did not .  she reached up her little hands  saying in an apologetic fashion    they were all gone away  and i was so lonesome .    hiel took her up in his long arms and carried her home  and was just entering the house door with her as the sleigh drove up with parson cushing and his wife .    wal  parson  your folks has all ben to the  lumination  nabby and bill and tom and dolly here  found her all rolled up in a heap like a rabbit under the cedars .     why  dolly cushing .   exclaimed her mother .   what upon earth got you out of bed this time of night .  you ll catch your death o  cold .     i was all alone   said dolly  with a piteous bleat .    oh  there  there  wife  don t say a word   put in the parson .   get her off to bed .  never mind  dolly  don t you cry   for parson cushing was a soft hearted gentleman and couldn t bear the sight of dolly s quivering under lip .  so dolly told her little story  how she had been promised a sugar dog by nabby if she d be a good girl and go to sleep  and how she couldn t go to sleep  and how she just went down to look from the yard  and how the music drew her right over .    there  there   said parson cushing   go to bed  dolly  and if nabby don t give you a sugar dog  i will .  this christmas dressing is all nonsense   he added   but the child s not to blame  it was natural .     after all   he said to his wife the last thing after they were settled for the night   our little dolly is an unusual child .  there were not many little girls that would have dared to do that .  i shall preach a sermon right away that will set all this christmas matter straight   said the doctor .   there is not a shadow of evidence that the first christians kept christmas .  it wasn t kept for the first three centuries  nor was christ born anywhere near the   th of december .               the next morning found little dolly s blue eyes wide open with all the wondering eagerness of a new idea .   dolly had her wise thoughts about christmas .  she had been terribly frightened at first  when she was brought home from the church  but when her papa kissed her and promised her a sugar dog she was quite sure that  whatever the unexplained mystery might be  he did not think the lovely scene of the night before a wicked one .  and when mrs .  cushing came and covered the little girl up warmly in bed  she only said to her   dolly  you must never get out of bed again at night after you are put there  you might have caught a dreadful cold and been sick and died  and then we should have lost our little dolly .   so dolly promised quite readily to be good and lie still ever after  no matter what attractions might be on foot in the community .   much was gained  however  and it was all clear gain  and forthwith the little fanciful head proceeded to make the most of it  thinking over every feature of the wonder .  the child had a vibrating  musical organization  and the sway and rush of the chanting still sounded in her ears and reminded her of that wonderful story in the  pilgrim s progress   where the gate of the celestial city swung open  and there were voices that sung   blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him who sitteth on the throne .   and then that wonderful star  that shone just as if it were a real star  how could it be .  for miss ida lewis  being a young lady of native artistic genius  had cut a little hole in the centre of her gilt paper star  behind which was placed a candle  so that it gave real light  in a way most astonishing to untaught eyes .  in dolly s simple view it verged on the supernatural  perhaps it was the very real star read about in the gospel story .  why not .  dolly was at the happy age when anything bright and heavenly seemed credible  and had the child faith to which all things were possible .    i wish  my dear   said mrs .  cushing  after they were retired to their room for the night   that to morrow morning you would read the account of the birth of christ in st .  matthew  and give the children some advice upon the proper way of keeping christmas .     well  but you know we don t keep christmas  nobody knows anything about christmas   said the doctor .    you know what i mean  my dear   replied his wife .   you know that my mother and her family do keep christmas .  i always heard of it when i was a child  and even now  though i have been out of the way of it so long  i cannot help a sort of kindly feeling toward these ways .  i am not surprised at all that the children got drawn over last night to the service .  i think it s the most natural thing in the world  and i know by experience just how attractive such things are .  i shouldn t wonder if this other church should draw very seriously on your congregation  but i don t want it to begin by taking away our own children .  dolly is an inquisitive child  a child that thinks a good deal  and she ll be asking all sorts of questions about the why and wherefore of what she saw last night .     oh  yes  dolly is a bright one .  dolly s an uncommon child   said the doctor  who had a pardonable pride in his children  they being  in fact  the only worldly treasure that he was at all rich in .   he rose up early on the following sabbath and proceeded to buy a sugar dog at the store of lucius jenks  and when dolly came down to breakfast he called her to him and presented it  saying as he kissed her    papa gives you this  not because it is christmas  but because he loves his little dolly .     but isn t it christmas .   asked dolly with a puzzled air .    no  child  nobody knows when christ was born  and there is nothing in the bible to tell us when to keep christmas .    and then in family worship the doctor read the account of the birth of christ and of the shepherds abiding in the fields who came at the call of the angels  and they sung the old hymn    while shepherds watched their flocks by night .     now  children   he said when all was over   you must be good children and go to school .  if we are going to keep any day on account of the birth of christ  the best way to keep it is by doing all our duties on that day better than any other .  your duty is to be good children  go to school and mind your lessons .    tom and bill were quite ready to fall in with their father s view of the matter .  as for dolly  she put her little tongue advisedly to the back of her sugar dog and found that he was very sweet indeed  a most tempting little animal .  she even went so far as to nibble off a bit of the green ground he stood on  yet resolved heroically not to eat him at once  but to make him last as long as possible .  she wrapped him tenderly in cotton and took him to the school with her  and when her confidential friend  bessie lewis  displayed her christmas gifts  dolly had something on her side to show  though she shook her curly head and informed bessie in strict confidence that there wasn t any such thing as christmas  her papa had told her so  a heresy which bessie forthwith reported when she went home at noon .    poor little child  and did she say so .   asked gentle old grandmamma lewis .   well  dear  you mustn t blame her  she don t know any better .  you bring the little one in here to night and i ll give her a christmas cooky .  i m sorry for such children .    and so  after school  dolly went in to see dear old madam lewis  who sat in her rocking chair in the front parlor  where the fire was snapping behind great tall brass andirons and all the pictures were overshadowed with boughs of spruce and pine .  dolly gazed about her with awe and wonder .  over one of the pictures was suspended a cross of green with flowers of white everlasting .    what is that for .   asked dolly  pointing solemnly with her little forefinger  and speaking under her breath .    dear child  that is the picture of my poor boy who died  ever so many years ago .  that is my cross  we have all one  to carry .    dolly did not half understand these words  but she saw tears in the gentle old lady s eyes and was afraid to ask more .   she accepted thankfully and with her nicest and best executed courtesy a christmas cooky representing a good sized fish  with fins all spread and pink sugar plums for eyes  and went home marveling yet more about this mystery of christmas .   as she was crossing the green to go home the poganuc stage drove in  with hiel seated on high  whipping up his horses to make them execute that grand entr  e which was the glory of his daily existence .   now that the stage was on runners  and slipped noiselessly over the smooth frozen plain  hiel cracked his whip more energetically and shouted louder  first to one horse then to another  to make up for the loss of the rattling wheels  and he generally had the satisfaction of seeing all the women rushing distractedly to doors and windows  and imagined them saying   there s hiel  the stage is in .     hulloa  dolly .   he called out  drawing up with a suddenness which threw the fore horses back upon their haunches .   i ve got a bundle for your folks .  want to ride .  you may jest jump up here by me and i ll take you  round to your father s door   and so dolly reached up her little red mittened hand  and hiel drew her up beside him .     xpect ye want a bit of a ride  and i ve got a bundle for widder badger  down on south street  so i guess i ll go  round that way to make it longer .  i  xpect this  ere bundle is from some of your ma s folks in boston   piscopals they be and keeps christmas .  good sized bundle  tis  reckon it ll come handy in a good many ways .    so  after finishing his detour  hiel landed his little charge at the parsonage door .    reckon i ll be over when i ve put up my hosses   he said to nabby when he handed down the bundle to her .   i hain t been to see you much lately  nabby  and i know you ve been a pinin  after me  but fact is      well  now  hiel jones  you jest shet up with your imperence   said nabby  with flashing eyes   you jest look out or you ll get suthin .     i  xpect to get a kiss when i come  round to night   said hiel  composedly .   take care o  that air bundle  now  mebbe there s glass or crockery in t .     hiel jones   said nabby   don t give me none o  your saace  for i won t take it .  jim sawin said last night you was the brassiest man he ever see .  he said there was brass enough in your face to make a kettle of .     you tell him there s sap enough in his head to fill it  anyway   said hiel .   good bye  nabby  i ll come  round this evenin    and he drove away at a rattling pace  while nabby  with flushed cheeks and snapping eyes  soliloquized    well  i hope he will come .  i d jest like a chance to show him how little i care for him .    meanwhile the bundle was soon opened  and contained a store of treasures  a smart little red dress and a pair of red shoes for dolly  a half dozen pocket handkerchiefs for dr .  cushing  and  robinson crusoe  and  sanford and merton   handsomely bound  for the boys  and a bonnet trimming for mrs .  cushing .  these were accompanied by a characteristic letter from aunt debby kittery  opening as follows    dear sister    mother worries because she thinks you won t get any christmas presents .  however  this comes to give every one of you some of the crumbs which fall from the church s table  and mother says she wishes you all a pious christmas  which she thinks is better than a merry one .  if i didn t lay violent hands on her she would use all our substance in riotous giving of christmas presents to all the beggars and chimney sweeps in boston .  she is in good health and talks daily of wanting to see you and the children  and i hope before long you will bring some of them  and come and make us a visit .    your affectionate sister    debby kittery .    there was a scene of exultation and clamor in the parsonage as these presents were pulled out and discussed  and when all possible joy was procured from them in the sitting room  the children rushed in a body into the kitchen and showed them to nabby  calling on her to join their acclamations .   on the whole  when dolly had said her prayers that night and thought the matter over  she concluded that her christmas day had been quite a success .   the second christmas .   once more had christmas come round in poganuc  once more the episcopal church was being dressed with ground pine and spruce  but this year economy had begun to make its claims felt .  an illumination might do very well to open a church  but there were many who said  to what purpose is this waste .   when the proposition was made to renew it yearly .  consequently it was resolved to hold the christmas eve service with only that necessary amount of light which would enable the worshipers to read the prayers .   on this christmas eve dolly went to bed at her usual hour with a resigned and quiet spirit .  she felt herself a year older  and more than a year wiser  than when christmas had first dawned upon her consciousness .   mis  persis appeared on the ground by day dawn .  a great kettle was slung over the kitchen fire  in which cakes of tallow were speedily liquefying  a frame was placed quite across the kitchen to sustain candle rods  with a train of boards underneath to catch the drippings  and mis  persis  with a brow like one of the fates  announced   now we can t hev any young  uns in this kitchen to day   and dolly saw that there was no getting any attention in that quarter .   mis  persis  in a gracious saturday afternoon mood  sitting in her own tent door dispensing hospitalities and cookies  was one thing  but mis  persis in her armor  with her loins girded and a hard day s work to be conquered  was quite another  she was terrible as minerva with her helmet on .   dinner baskets for all the children were hastily packed  and they were sent off to school with the injunction on no account to show their faces about the premises till night .  the doctor  warned of what was going on  retreated to his study at the top of the house  where  serenely above the lower cares of earth  he sailed off into president edwards  treatise on the nature of true virtue  concerning which he was preparing a paper to read at the next association meeting .   that candles were a necessity of life he was well convinced  and by faith he dimly accepted the fact that one day in the year the whole house was to be devoted and given up to this manufacture  and his part of the business  as he understood it  was  clearly  to keep himself out of the way till it was over .    there won t be much of a dinner at home  anyway   said nabby to dolly  as she packed her basket with an extra doughnut or two .   i ve got to go to church to day   cause i m one of the singers  and your ma ll be busy waitin  on her  so we shall just have a pick up dinner  and you be sure not to come home till night  by that time it ll be all over .    dolly trotted off to school well content with the prospect before her  a nooning  with leave to play with the girls at school  was not an unpleasant idea .   but the first thing that saluted her on her arrival was that bessie lewis  her own dear  particular bessie  was going to have a christmas party at her house that afternoon  and was around distributing invitations right and left among the scholars with a generous freedom .    we are going to have nuts  and raisins  and cakes  and mottoes   said bessie  with artless triumph .  the news of this bill of fare spread like wildfire through the school .   never had a party been heard of which contemplated such a liberal entertainment  for the rising generation of poganuc were by no means wearied with indulgence  and raisins and almonds stood for grandeur with them .  but these mottoes  which consisted of bits of confectionery wrapped up in printed couplets of sentimental poetry  were an unheard of refinement .  bessie assured them that her papa had sent clear to boston for them  and whoever got one would have his or her fortune told by it .   the school was a small  select one  comprising the children of all ages from the best families of poganuc .  both boys and girls  and all with great impartiality  had been invited .  miss titcome  the teacher  quite readily promised to dismiss at three o clock that afternoon any scholar who should bring a permission from parents  and the children nothing doubted that such a permission was obtainable .   dolly alone saw a cloud in the horizon .  she had been sent away with strict injunctions not to return till evening  and children in those days never presumed to make any exceptions in obeying an absolute command of their parents .    but  of course  you will go home at noon and ask your mother  and of course she ll let you  won t she  girls .   said bessie .    oh  certainly  of course she will   said all the older girls   because you know a party is a thing that don t happen every day  and your mother would think it strange if you didn t come and ask her .   so  too  thought miss titcome  a most exemplary  precise and proper young lady  who always moved and spoke and thought as became a schoolmistress  so that  although she was in reality only twenty years old  dolly considered her as a very advanced and ancient person  if anything  a little older than her father and mother .   even she was of opinion that dolly might properly go home to lay a case of such importance before her mother  and so dolly rushed home after the morning school was over  running with all her might  and increasing in mental excitement as she ran .  her bonnet blew off upon her shoulders  her curls flew behind her in the wind  and she most inconsiderately used up the little stock of breath that she would want to set her cause in order before her mother .   just here we must beg any mother and housekeeper to imagine herself in the very midst of the most delicate  perplexing and laborious of household tasks  when interruption is most irksome and perilous  suddenly called to discuss with a child some new and startling proposition to which at the moment she cannot even give a thought .   mrs .  cushing was sitting in the kitchen with mis  persis  by the side of a caldron of melted tallow  kept in a fluid state by the heat of a portable furnace on which it stood .  a long train of half dipped candles hung like so many stalactites from the frames on which the rods rested  and the two were patiently dipping set after set and replacing them again on the frame .    as sure as i m alive .  if there isn t dolly cushing comin  back  runnin  and tearin  like a wild cretur    said mis  persis .   she ll be in here in a minute and knock everything down .    mrs .  cushing looked  and with a quick movement stepped to the door .    dolly .  what are you here for .  didn t i tell you not to come home this noon .     oh  mamma  there s going to be a party at general lewis   bessie s party  and the girls are all going  mayn t i go .     no  you can t  it s impossible   said her mother .   your best dress isn t ready to wear  and there s nobody can spend time to get you ready .  go right back to school .     but  mamma      go .   said her mother  in the decisive tone that mothers used in the old days  when arguing with children was not a possibility .    what s all this about .   asked the doctor  looking out of the door .    why   said mrs .  cushing   there s going to be a party at general lewis   and dolly is wild to go .  it s just impossible for me to attend to her now .     oh  i don t want her intimate at lewis s   said the doctor  and immediately he came out behind his wife .    there  run away to school  dolly   he said .   don t trouble your mother  you don t want to go to parties  why  it s foolish to think of it .  run away now  and don t think any more about it  there s a good girl .    dolly turned and went back to school  the tears freezing on her cheek as she went .  as for not thinking any more about it  that was impossible .   when three o clock came  scholar after scholar rose and departed  until at last dolly was the only one remaining in the school room .   when dolly came home that night the coast was clear  and the candles were finished and put away to harden in a freezing cold room  the kitchen was once more restored  and nabby bustled about getting supper as if nothing had happened .    i really feel sorry about poor little dolly   said mrs .  cushing to her husband .    do you think she cared much .   asked the doctor  looking as if a new possibility had struck his mind .    yes  indeed  poor child  she went away crying  but what could i do about it .  i couldn t stop to dress her .     wife  we must take her somewhere to make up for it   said the doctor .   just then the stage stopped at the door and a bundle from boston was handed in .  dolly s tears were soon wiped and dried  and her mourning was turned into joy when a large jointed london doll emerged from the bundle  the christmas gift of her grandmother in boston .   dolly s former darling was old and shabby  but this was of twice the size  and with cheeks exhibiting a state of the most florid health .   besides this there was  as usual in grandmamma s christmas bundle  something for every member of the family  and so the evening went on festive wings .   poor little dolly .  only that afternoon she had watered with her tears  at school  the dismal long straight seam  which stretched on before her as life sometimes does to us  bare  disagreeable and cheerless .  she had come home crying  little dreaming of the joy just approaching  but before bed time no cricket in the hearth was cheerier or more noisy .  she took the new dolly to bed with her  and could hardly sleep  for the excitement of her company .   meanwhile  hiel had brought the doctor a message to the following effect    i was drivin  by tim hawkins   and mis  hawkins she comes out and says they re goin  to hev an apple cuttin  there to morrow night  and she would like to hev you and mis  cushin  and all your folks come  nabby and all .    the doctor and his lady of course assented .    wal  then  doctor  ef it s all one to you   continued hiel   i d like to take ye over in my new double sleigh .  i ve jest got two new strings o  bells up from boston  and i think we ll sort o  make the snow fly .  s pose there d be no objections to takin  my mother  long with ye .     oh  hiel  we shall be delighted to go in company with your mother  and we re ever so much obliged to you   said mrs .  cushing .    wal  i ll be round by six o clock   said hiel .    then  wife   said the doctor   we ll take dolly  and make up for the loss of her party .    punctually at six  hiel s two horses  with all their bells jingling  stood at the door of the parsonage  whence tom and bill  who had been waiting with caps and mittens on for the last half hour  burst forth with irrepressible shouts of welcome .    take care now  boys  don t haul them buffalo skins out on t  the snow   said hiel .   don t get things in a muss gen ally  wait for your ma and the doctor .  got to stow the grown folks in fust  boys kin hang on anywhere .    and so first came mrs .  cushing and the doctor  and were installed on the back seat  with dolly in between .  then hot bricks were handed in to keep feet warm  and the buffalo robe was tucked down securely .  then nabby took her seat by hiel in front  and the sleigh drove round for old mrs .  jones .  the doctor insisted on giving up his place to her and tucking her warmly under the buffalo robe  while he took the middle seat and acted as moderator between the boys  who were in a wild state of hilarity .  spring  with explosive barks  raced first on this and then on that side of the sleigh as it flew swiftly over the smooth frozen road .   the stars blinked white and clear out of a deep blue sky  and the path wound up hill among cedars and junipers and clumps of mountain laurel  on whose broad green leaves the tufts of snow lay like clusters of white roses .  the keen clear air was full of stimulus and vigor  and so hiel s proposition to take the longest way met with enthusiastic welcome from all the party .  next to being a bird  and having wings  is the sensation of being borne over the snow by a pair of spirited horses who enjoy the race  apparently  as much as those they draw .  though hiel contrived to make the ride about eight miles  it yet seemed but a short time before the party drove up to the great red farmhouse  whose lighted windows sent streams of radiant welcome far out into the night .   our little dolly had had an evening of unmixed bliss .  everybody had petted her  and talked to her  and been delighted with her sayings and doings  and she was carrying home a paper parcel of sweet things which good mrs .  hawkins had forced into her hand at parting .  she had spent a really happy christmas .              the christmas princess .   by mrs .  molesworth .   in the olden times there lived a king who was worthy of the name .  he loved his people  and his people loved him in return .  his kingdom must have been large  at least it appears to be beyond doubt that it extended a good way in different directions  for it was called the kingdom of the four orts  which  of course  as everybody knows  means that he had possessions north  south  east  and west .   it was not so large  however  but that he was able to manage it well for himself  that is to say  with certain help which i will tell you of .  a year never passed without his visiting every part of his dominions and inquiring for himself into the affairs of his subjects .  perhaps  who can say .   the world was not so big in those days  doubtless  however that may have been  there were not so many folk living on it .   many things were different in those times  many things existed which nowadays would be thought strange and incredible .  human beings knew much more than they do now about the other dwellers on the earth .  for instance  it was no uncommon case to find learned men who were able to converse with animals quite as well as with each other .  fairies  of course  were often visible to mortal eyes  and it was considered quite natural that they should interfere for good  sometimes  perhaps  for evil  as to that i cannot say  in human affairs .  and good king brave heart was especially favored in this way .  for the help which  as i said  was his in governing his people was that of four very wise counselors indeed  the four fairies of the north and the south  the east and the west .   these sisters were very beautiful as well as very wise .  though older than the world itself  they always looked young .  they were very much attached to each other  though they seldom met  and it must be confessed that sometimes on such occasions there were stormy scenes  though they made it up afterward .  and the advice they gave was always to be relied upon .   now  king brave heart was married .  his wife was young and charming  and devotedly fond of him .  but she was of a rather jealous and exacting disposition  and she had been much spoilt in her youth at her own home .  she was sweet and loving  however  which makes up for a good deal  and always ready to take part in any scheme for the good of their people  provided it did not separate her from her husband .   they had no children  though they had been married for some years  but at last there came the hope of an heir  and the queen s delight was unbounded  nor was the king s joy less than hers .   it was late autumn  or almost winter  when a great trouble befell the pretty queen .  the weather had grown suddenly cold  and a few snowflakes even had fallen before their time .  but queen claribel only clapped her hands at the sight  for with the winter she hoped the baby would come  and she welcomed the signs of its approach on this account .  the king  however  looked grave  and when the next morning the ground was all white  the trees and the bushes covered with silvery foliage  he looked graver still .    something is amiss   he said .   the fairy of the north must be on her way  and it is not yet time for her visit .    and that very afternoon the snow fell again  more heavily than before  and the frost wind whistled down the chimneys and burst open the doors and windows  and all the palace servants went hurrying and scurrying about to make great fires and hang up thick curtains and get everything in order for the cold season  which they had not expected so soon .    it will not last   said the king  quietly .   in a few days there will be milder weather again .   but  nevertheless  he still looked grave .   and early the next morning  as he was sitting with the queen  who was beginning to feel a little frightened at the continuance of the storm  the double doors of her boudoir suddenly flew open  an icy blast filled the room  and a tall  white shrouded figure stood before them .    i have come to fetch you  brave heart   she said abruptly .   you are wanted  sorely wanted  in my part of the world .  the people are starving  the season has been a poor one  and there has been bad faith .  some few powerful men have bought up the grain  which was already scarce  and refuse to let the poor folk have it .  nothing will save their lives or prevent sad suffering but your own immediate presence .  are you ready .  you must have seen i was coming .    she threw off her mantle as she spoke and sank on to a couch .  strong as she was  she seemed tired with the rate at which she had traveled  and the warm air of the room was oppressive to her .  her clear  beautiful features looked harassed  her gray eyes full of anxiety .  for the moment she took no notice of the queen .    are you ready .   she repeated .    yes  i am ready .   said brave heart  as he rose to his feet .   but the queen threw herself upon him  with bitter crying and reproaches .  would he leave her  and at such a time  a prey to all kinds of terrible anxiety .  then she turned to the fairy and upbraided her in unmeasured language .  but the spirit of the north glanced at her with calm pity .    poor child .   she said   i had almost forgotten you .  the sights i have seen of late have been so terrible that they absorb me .  take courage  claribel .  show yourself a queen .  think of the suffering mothers and their little ones whom your husband hastens to aid .  all will be well with you  believe me .  but you  too  must be brave and unselfish .    it was no use .  all she said but made the queen more indignant .  she would scarcely bid her husband farewell  she turned her back to the fairy with undignified petulance .    foolish child   said the northern spirit .   she will learn better some day .    then she gave all her attention to the matter she had come about  explaining to the king as they journeyed exactly the measures he must take and the difficulties to be overcome .  but though the king had the greatest faith in her advice  and never doubted that it was his duty to obey  his heart was sore  as you can understand .   things turned out as he had said .  the severe weather disappeared again as if by magic  and some weeks of unusually mild days followed .  and when the winter did set in for good at last  it was with no great rigor .  from time to time news reached the palace of the king s welfare .  the tidings were cheering .  his presence was effecting all that the fairy had hoped .   so queen claribel ought to have been happy .  but she was determined not to be .  she did nothing but cry and abuse the fairy  declaring that she would never see her dear brave heart again  and that if ever her baby came she was sure it would not live  or that there would be something dreadful the matter with it .    it is not fair   she kept saying   it is a shame that i should suffer so .    and even when on christmas eve a beautiful little girl was born  as pretty and lively and healthy as could be wished  and even though the next day brought the announcement of the king s immediate return  claribel still nursed her resentment  though in the end it came to be directed entirely against the fairy .  for when she saw brave heart again  his tender affection and his delight in his little daughter made it impossible for her not to  forgive him   as she expressed it  though she could not take any interest in his accounts of his visit to the north and all he had been able to do there .   a great feast was arranged in honor of the christening of the little princess .  all the grand people of the neighborhood were bidden to it  nor  you may be sure  did the good king forget the poorer folk .  the four fairies were invited  for it was a matter of course that they should be the baby s godmothers .  and though the queen would gladly have excluded the northern fairy  she dared not even hint at such a thing .   but she resolved in her own mind to do all in her power to show that she was not the welcome fairy .   on such occasions  when human beings were honored by the presence of fairy visitors  these distinguished guests were naturally given precedence of all others  otherwise very certainly they would never have come again .  even among fairies themselves there are ranks and formalities  and the queen well knew that the first place was due to the northern spirit .  but she gave instructions that this rule should be departed from  and the snow fairy  as she was sometimes called  found herself placed at the king s left hand  separated from him by her sister of the west  instead of next to him on the right  which seat  on the contrary  was occupied by the fairy of the south .  she glanced round her calmly  but took no notice  and the king  imagining that by her own choice perhaps  she had chosen the unusual position  made no remark .  and the feast progressed with the accustomed splendor and rejoicing .   but at the end  when the moment arrived at which the four godmothers were expected to state their gifts to the baby  the queen s spite could be no longer concealed .    i request   she exclaimed   that for reasons well known to herself  to the king  and to myself  the northern fairy s gift may be the last in order instead of the first .    the king started and grew pale .  the beautiful  soft voiced fairy of the south  in her glowing golden draperies  would fain have held back  for her affection for her sterner sister was largely mingled with awe .  but the snow fairy signed to her imperiously to speak .    i bestow upon the princess sweet heart   she said  half tremblingly   the gift of great beauty .     and i   said the spirit of the east  who came next  her red robes falling majestically around her  her dark hair lying smoothly in its thick masses on her broad  low forehead   i give her great powers of intellect and intelligence .     and i   said the western fairy  with a bright  breezy flutter of her sea green garments   health  perfect health and strength of body  as my gift to the pretty child .     and you   said the queen bitterly   you  cold hearted fairy  who have done your best to kill me with misery  who came between my husband and me  making him neglect me as he never would have done but for your influence  what will you give my child .  will you do something to make amends for the suffering you caused .  i would rather my pretty baby were dead than that she lived to endure what i have of late endured .     life and death are not mine to bestow or to withhold   said the northern spirit calmly  as she drew her white garments more closely round her with a majestic air .   so your rash words  foolish woman  fortunately for you all  cannot touch the child .  but something  much  i can do  and i will .  she shall not know the suffering you dread for her with so cowardly a fear .  she shall be what you choose to fancy i am .  and instead of the name you have given her  she shall be known for what she is  princess ice heart .    she turned to go  but the king on one hand  her three sisters on the other  started forward to detain her .    have pity .   exclaimed the former .    sister  bethink you   said the latter  the western fairy adding beseechingly  the tears springing in her blue eyes  which so quickly changed from bright to sad   say something to soften this hard fate .  undo it you cannot  i know .  or  at least  allow me to mitigate it if i can .    the snow fairy stopped  in truth  she was far from hard hearted or remorseless  and already she was beginning to feel half sorry for what she had done .    what would you propose .   she said coldly .   the fairy of the west threw back her auburn hair with a gesture of impatience .    i would i knew .   she said .    tis a hard knot you have tied  my sister .  for that which would mend the evil wrought seems to me impossible while the evil exists  the cure and the cessation of the disease are one .  how could the heart of ice be melted till tender feelings warm it  and how can tender feelings find entrance into a feelingless heart .  alas .  alas .  i can but predict what sounds like a mockery of your trouble   she went on  turning to the king  though indeed by this time she might have included the queen in her sympathy  for claribel stood  horrified at the result of her mad resentment  as pale as brave heart himself .   hearken .   and her expressive face  over which sunshine and showers were wont to chase each other as on an april day  for such  as all know  is the nature of the changeful  lovable spirit of the west  for once grew still and statue like  while her blue eyes pierced far into the distance .   the day on which the princess of the icy heart shall shed a tear  that heart shall melt  but then only .    the northern fairy murmured something under her breath  but what the words were no one heard  for it was not many that dared stand near to her  so terribly cold was her presence .  the graceful spirit of the south fluttered her golden locks  and with a little sigh drew her radiant mantle round her  and kissed her hand in farewell  while the thoughtful eyed  mysterious eastern fairy linked her arm in that of her western sister  and whispered that the solution of the problem should have her most earnest study .  and the green robed spirit tried to smile through her tears in farewell as she suffered herself to be led away .   so the four strange guests departed  but their absence was not followed by the usual outburst of unconstrained festivity .  on the contrary  a sense of sorrow and dread hung over all who remained  and before long everyone not immediately connected with the palace respectfully but silently withdrew  leaving the king and queen to their mysterious sorrow .   claribel flew to the baby s cradle .  the little princess was sleeping soundly  she looked rosy and content  a picture of health .  her mother called eagerly to the king .    she seems just as usual   she exclaimed .   perhaps  oh .  perhaps after all i have done no harm .    for  strange to say  her resentment against the northern fairy had died away .  she now felt nothing but shame and regret for her own wild temper .   perhaps   she went on   it was but to try me  to teach me a lesson  that the snow fairy uttered those terrible words .    brave heart pitied his wife deeply  but he shook his head .    i dare not comfort you with any such hopes   he said   my poor claribel .  the fairy is true  true as steel  if you could but have trusted her .  had you seen her  as i have done  full of tenderest pity for suffering  you could never have so maligned her .    claribel did not answer  but her tears dropped on the baby s face .  the little princess seemed annoyed by them .  she put up her tiny hand and  with a fretful expression  brushed them off .   and that very evening the certainty came .   the head nurse sent for the queen while she was undressing the child  and the mother hastened to the nursery .  the attendants were standing round in the greatest anxiety  for  though the baby looked quite well otherwise  there was the strangest coldness over her left side  in the region of the heart .  the skin looked perfectly colorless  and the soft cambric and still softer flannel of the finest which had covered the spot were stiff  as if they had been exposed to a winter night s frost .    alas .   exclaimed claribel  but that was all .  it was no use sending for doctors  no use doing anything .  her own delicate hand when she laid it on the baby s heart was  as it were  blistered with cold .  the next morning she found it covered with chilblains .   but the baby did not mind .  she flourished amazingly  heart or no heart .  she was perfectly healthy  ate well  slept well  and soon gave signs of unusual intelligence .  she was seldom put out  but when angry she expressed her feelings by loud roars and screams  though with never a tear .  at first this did not seem strange  as no infant sheds tears during the earliest weeks of its life .  but when she grew to six months old  then to a year  then to two and three  and was near her fourth birthday without ever crying  it became plain that the prediction was indeed to be fulfilled .   and the name  ice heart  clung to her .  in spite of all her royal parents  commands to the contrary   princess ice heart  she was called far and near .  it seemed as if people could not help it .   sweet heart we cannot name her  for sweet she is not   was murmured by all who came in contact with her .   and it was true .  sweet she certainly was not .  she was beautiful and healthy and intelligent  but she had no feeling .  in some ways she gave little trouble .  her temper  though occasionally violent  was  as a rule  placid  she seemed contented in almost all circumstances .  when her good old nurse died  she remarked coolly that she hoped her new attendant would dress her hair more becomingly  when king brave heart started on some of his distant journeys she bade him good bye with a smile  observing that if he never came home again it would be rather amusing  as she would then reign instead of him  and when she saw her mother break into sobs at her unnatural speech she stared at her in blank astonishment .   and so things went on until ice heart reached her seventeenth year .  by this time she was  as regarded her outward appearance  as beautiful as the fondest of parents could desire  she was also exceedingly strong and healthy  and the powers of her mind were unusual .  her education had been carefully directed  and she had learnt with ease and interest .  she could speak in several languages  her paintings were worthy of admiration  as they were skillful and well executed  she could play with brilliancy on various instruments .  she had also been taught to sing  but her voice was metallic and unpleasing .  but she could discuss scientific and philosophical subjects with the sages of her father s kingdom like one of themselves .   and besides all this care bestowed upon her training  no stone had been left unturned in hopes of awakening in the unfortunate girl some affection or emotion .  every day the most soul stirring poetry was read aloud to her by the greatest elocutionists  the most exciting and moving dramas were enacted before her  she was taken to visit the poor of the city in their pitiable homes  she was encouraged to see sad sights from which most soft hearted maidens would instinctively flee .  but all was in vain .  she would express interest and ask intelligent questions with calm  unmoved features and dry eyes .  even music  from which much had been hoped  was powerless to move her to aught but admiration of the performers  skill or curiosity as to the construction of their instruments .  there was but one peculiarity about her  which sometimes  though they could not have explained why  seemed to ice heart s unhappy parents to hint at some shadowy hope .  the sight of tears was evidently disagreeable to her .  more certainly than anything else did the signs of weeping arouse one of her rare fits of anger  so much so that now and then  for days together  the poor queen dared not come near her child  and tears were to her a frequent relief from her lifelong regrets .   so beautiful and wealthy and accomplished a maiden was naturally not without suitors  and from this direction  too  at first  queen claribel trusted fondly that cure might come .    if she could but fall in love   she said  the first time the idea struck her .    my poor dear .   replied the king   to see  you must have eyes  to love  you must have a heart .     but a heart she has   persisted the mother .   it is only  as it were  asleep  frozen  like the winter stream which bursts forth again into ever fresh life and movement with the awaking spring .    so lovers were invited  and lovers came and were made welcome by the dozen .  lovers of every description  rich and poor  old and young  handsome and ugly  so long as they were of passable birth and fair character  king brave heart was not too particular  in the forlorn hope that among them one fortunate wight might rouse some sentiment in the lovely statue he desired to win .  but all in vain .  each prince  or duke  or simple knight  duly instructed in the sad case  did his best  one would try poetry  another his lute  a third sighs and appeals  a fourth  imagining he had made some way  would attempt the bold stroke of telling ice heart that unless she could respond to his adoration he would drown himself .  she only smiled  and begged him to allow her to witness the performance  she had never seen anyone drown .  so  one by one  the troupe of aspirants  some in disgust  some in strange fear  some in annoyance  took their departure  preferring a more ordinary spouse than the bewitched though beautiful princess .   and she saw them go with calmness  though  in one or two cases she had replied to her parents that she had no objection to marry prince so and so  or count such another  if they desired it  it would be rather agreeable to have a husband if he gave her plenty of presents and did all she asked .   though a sighing and moaning lover  or a man who is always twiddling a fiddle or making verses i could not stand   she would add contemptuously .   so king brave heart thought it best to try no such experiment .  and in future no gentleman was allowed to present himself except with the understanding that he alone who should succeed in making princess ice heart shed a tear would be accepted as her betrothed .   this proclamation diminished at once the number of suitors .  indeed  after one or two candidates had failed  no more appeared  so well did it come to be known that the attempt was hopeless .   and for more than a year princess ice heart was left to herself  very much  apparently  to her satisfaction .   but all this time the mystic sisters were not idle or forgetful .  several of the aspirants to ice heart s hand had been chosen by them and conveyed to the neighborhood of the palace by their intermediacy from remote lands .  and among these  one of the few who had found some slight favor in the maiden s eyes was a special prot  g   of the western fairy  the young and spirited prince francolin .   he was not one of the sighing or sentimental order of swains  he was full of life and adventure and brightness  and his heart was warm and generous .  he admired the beautiful girl  but he pitied her still more  and this pity was the real motive which made him yield to the fairy s proposal that he should try again .    you pleased the poor child   she said  when she arrived one day at the prince s home to talk over her new idea .   you made her smile by your liveliness and fun .  for i was there when you little knew it .  the girl has been overdosed with sentimentality and doleful strains .  i believe we have been on a wrong track all this time .     what do you propose .   said francolin  gravely  for he could be serious enough when seriousness was called for .   she did not actually dislike me  but that is the most that can be said  and however i may feel for her  however i may admire her beauty and intelligence  nothing would induce me to wed a bride who could not return my affection .  indeed  i could scarcely feel any for such a one .     ah no .  i agree with you entirely   said the fairy .   but listen  my power is great in some ways .  i am well versed in ordinary enchantment  and am most willing to employ my utmost skill for my unfortunate god daughter .    she then unfolded to him her scheme  and obtained his consent to it .    now is your time   she said  in conclusion .   i hear on the best authority that ice heart is feeling rather dull and bored at present .  it is some time since she has had the variety of a new suitor  and she will welcome any distraction .    and she proceeded to arrange all the details of her plan .   so it came to pass that very shortly after the conversation i have related there was great excitement in the capital city of the kingdom of the four orts .  after an interval of more than a year a new suitor had at length presented himself for the hand of the princess ice heart .  only the king and queen received the news with melancholy indifference .    he may try as the others have done   said brave heart to the messenger announcing the arrival of the stranger at the gates  accompanied by a magnificent retinue   but it is useless .   for the poor king was fast losing all hope of his daughter s case  he was growing aged and care worn before his time .    does he know the terms attached to his acceptance .   inquired the queen .   yes  the messenger from the unknown candidate for the hand of the beautiful ice heart had been expressly charged to say that the prince jocko  such was the new comer s name  was fully informed as to all particulars  and prepared to comply with the conditions .   the princess  parents smiled somewhat bitterly .  they had no hope  but still they could not forbid the attempt .    prince jocko .   said the king   not a very prince like name .  however  it matters little .    a few hours later the royal pair and their daughter  with all their attendants  in great state and ceremony  were awaiting their guest .  and soon a blast of trumpets announced his approach .  his retinue was indeed magnificent  horsemen in splendid uniforms  followed by a troop of white mules with negro riders in gorgeous attire  then musicians  succeeded by the prince s immediate attendants  defiled before the great marble steps in front of the palace  at the summit of which the king  with the queen and princess  was seated in state .   ice heart clapped her hands .     tis as good as a show   she said   but where is the prince .    as she said the word the cort  ge halted .  a litter  with closely drawn curtains  drew up at the foot of the steps .    gracious .   exclaimed the princess   i hope he is not a molly coddle   but before there was time to say more the curtains of the litter were drawn aside  and in another moment an attendant had lifted out its occupant  who forthwith proceeded to ascend the steps .   the parents and their daughter stared at each other and gasped .   prince jocko was neither more nor less than a monkey .   but such a monkey as never before had been seen .  he was more comical than words can express  and when at last he stood before them  and bowed to the ground  a three cornered hat in his hand  his sword sticking straight out behind  his tail sweeping the ground  the effect was irresistible .  king brave heart turned his head aside .  queen claribel smothered her face in her handkerchief .  princess ice heart opened her pretty mouth wide and forgot to close it again  while a curious expression stole into her beautiful eyes .   was it a trick .   no  prince jocko proceeded to speak .   he laid his little brown paw on his heart  bowed again  coughed  sneezed  and finally began an oration .  if his appearance was too funny  his words and gestures were a hundred times more so .  he rolled his eyes  he declaimed  he posed and pirouetted like a miniature dancing master  and his little cracked voice rose higher and higher as his own fine words and expressions increased in eloquence .   and at last a sound  which never before had been heard  save faintly  made everyone start .  the princess was laughing as if she could no longer contain herself .  clear  ringing  merry laughter  which it did one s heart good to hear .  and on she went  laughing ever  till  she flung herself at her mother s feet  the tears rolling down her cheeks .    oh  mamma .   she exclaimed   i never    and then she went off again .   but prince jocko suddenly grew silent .  he stepped up to ice heart and  respectfully raising her hand to his lips  gazed earnestly  beseechingly into her face  his own keen sharp eyes gradually growing larger and deeper in expression  till they assumed the pathetic  wistful look of appeal one often sees in those of a noble dog .    ah  princess .   he murmured .   and ice heart stopped laughing .  she pressed her hand to her side .    father .  mother .   she cried   help me .  help me .  am i dying .  what has happened to me .   and  with a strange  long drawn sigh she sank fainting to the ground .   there was great excitement in the palace  hurrying to and fro  fetching of doctors  and much alarm .  but when the princess had been carried indoors and laid on a couch  she soon revived .  and who can describe the feelings of the king and queen when she turned to them with a smile such as they had never seen on her face before .    dearest father  dearest mother   she said   how i love you .  those strange warm drops that filled my eyes seem to have brought new life to me   and as the queen passed her arm round the maiden she felt no chill of cold such as used to thrill her with misery every time she embraced her child .    sweet heart .  my own sweet heart .   she whispered .   and the princess whispered back   yes  call me by that name always .    all was rejoicing when the wonderful news of the miraculous cure spread through the palace and the city .  but still the parents  hearts were sore  for was not the king s word pledged that his daughter should marry him who had effected this happy change .  and this was no other than jocko  the monkey .   the prince had disappeared at the moment that ice heart fainted  and now with his retinue he was encamped outside the walls .  all sorts of ideas occurred to the king .    i cannot break my word   he said   but we might try to persuade the little monster to release me from it .    but the princess would not hear of this .    no   she said .   i owe him too deep a debt of gratitude to think of such a thing .  and in his eyes i read more than i can put in words .  no  dear father .  you must summon him at once to be presented to our people as my affianced husband .    so again the cort  ge of prince jocko made its way to the palace  and again the litter  with its closely drawn curtains  drew up at the marble steps .  and sweet heart stood  pale  but calm and smiling  to welcome her ridiculous betrothed .   but who is this that quickly mounts the stairs with firm and manly tread .  sweet heart nearly swooned again .    jocko .   she murmured .   where is jocko .  why  this is prince francolin .     yes  dear child   said a bright voice beside her  and  turning round  sweet heart beheld the western fairy  who  with her sisters  had suddenly arrived .   yes  indeed .  francolin  and no other .    the universal joy may be imagined .  even the grave fairy of the north smiled with pleasure and delight  and  as she kissed her pretty god daughter  she took the girl s hand and pressed it against her own heart .    never misjudge me  sweet heart   she whispered .   cold as i seem to those who have not courage to approach me closely  my heart  under my icy mantle  is as warm as is now your own .    and so it was .   where can we get a better ending than the time honored one .  francolin and sweet heart were married  and lived happy ever after  and who knows but what  in the kingdom of the four orts  they are living happily still .   if only we knew the way thither  we might see for ourselves if it is so .              widow townsend s visitor .   the fire crackled cheerfully on the broad hearth of an old fashioned fireplace in an old fashioned public house in an old fashioned village  down in that part of the old dominion called the  eastern shore .   a cat and three kittens basked in the warmth  and a decrepit yellow dog  lying full in the reflection of the blaze  wrinkled his black nose approvingly  as he turned his hind feet where his fore feet had been .  over the chimney hung several fine hams and pieces of dried beef .  apples were festooned along the ceiling  and other signs of plenty and good cheer were scattered profusely about .  there were plants  too  on the window ledges  horse shoe geraniums  and dew plants  and a monthly rose  just budding  to say nothing of pots of violets that perfumed the whole place whenever they took it into their purple heads to bloom .  the floor was carefully swept  the chairs had not a speck of dust upon leg or round  the long settle near the fireplace shone as if it had been just varnished  and the eight day clock in the corner had had its white face newly washed  and seemed determined to tick the louder for it .   two arm chairs were drawn up at cozy distance from the hearth and each other  a candle  a newspaper  a pair of spectacles  a dish of red cheeked apples  and a pitcher of cider  filled a little table between them .  in one of these chairs sat a comfortable looking woman about forty five  with cheeks as red as the apples  and eyes as dark and bright as they had ever been  resting her elbow on the table and her head upon her hand  and looking thoughtfully into the fire .   this was widow townsend   relict  of mr .  levi townsend  who had been mouldering into dust in the neighboring churchyard for seven years and more .  she was thinking of her dead husband  possibly because all her work being done  and the servant gone to bed  the sight of his empty chair at the other side of the table  and the silence of the room  made her a little lonely .    seven years   so the widow s reverie ran   it seems as if it were more than fifty  and christmas nigh here again  and yet i don t look so very old neither .  perhaps it s not having any children to bother my life out  as other people have .  they may say what they like  children are more plague than profit  that s my opinion .  look at my sister jerusha  with her six boys .  she s worn to a shadow  and i am sure they have done it  though she never will own it .    the widow took an apple from the dish and began to peel it .    how fond mr .  townsend used to be of these apples .  he ll never eat any more of them  poor fellow  for i don t suppose they have apples where he has gone to .  heigho .  i remember very well how i used to throw apple peel over my head when i was a girl to see who i was going to marry .    mrs .  townsend stopped short and blushed  for in those days she did not know mr .  t .   and was always looking eagerly to see if the peel had formed a capital s .  her meditations took a new turn .    how handsome sam payson was  and how much i use to care about him .  i wonder what has become of him .  jerusha says he went away from our village just after i did  and no one has ever heard of him since .  what a silly thing that quarrel was .  if it had not been for that     here came a long pause  during which the widow looked very steadfastly at the empty arm chair of levi townsend  deceased .  her fingers played carelessly with the apple peel  she drew it safely towards her  and looked around the room .    upon my word  it is very ridiculous  and i don t know what the neighbors would say if they saw me .    still the plump fingers drew the red peel nearer .    but then they can t see me  that s a comfort  and the cat and old bose never will know what it means .  of course i don t believe anything about it .    the peel hung gracefully from her hand .    but still  i should like to try  it would seem like old times  and     over her head it went  and curled up quietly on the floor at a little distance .  old bose  who always slept with one eye open  saw it fall  and marched deliberately up to smell it .    bose  bose  don t touch .   cried his mistress  and bending over it with beating heart  she turned as red as fire .  there was as handsome a capital s as any one could wish to see .   a great knock came suddenly at the door .  bose growled  and the widow screamed and snatched up the apple peel .    it s mr .  t .   it s his spirit come back again  because i tried that silly trick   she thought fearfully to herself .   another knock  louder than the first  and a man s voice exclaimed    hello  the house .     who is it .   asked the widow  somewhat relieved to find that the departed levi was still safe in his grave on the hillside .    a stranger   said the voice .    what do you want .     to get a lodging here for the night .    the widow deliberated .    can t you go on .  there s a house half a mile farther  if you keep to the right hand side of the road  and turn to the left after you get by      it s raining cats and dogs  and i m very delicate   said the stranger  coughing .   i m wet to the skin  don t you think you can accommodate me .   i don t mind sleeping on the floor .     raining  is it .  i didn t know that   and the kind hearted little woman unbarred the door very quickly .   come in  whoever you may be  i only asked you to go on because i am a lone woman  with only one servant in the house .    the stranger entered  shaking himself like a newfoundland dog upon the step  and scattering a little shower of drops over his hostess and her nicely swept floor .    ah  that looks comfortable after a man has been out for hours in a storm   he said  as he caught sight of the fire  and striding along toward the hearth  followed by bose  who sniffed suspiciously at his heels  he stationed himself in the arm chair  mr .  townsend s arm chair .  which had been kept  sacred to his memory  for seven years .  the widow was horrified  but her guest looked so weary and worn out that she could not ask him to move  but busied herself in stirring up the blaze that he might the sooner dry his dripping clothes .   a new thought struck her  mr .  t .  had worn a comfortable dressing gown during his illness  which still hung in the closet at her right .  she could not let this poor man catch his death  by sitting in that wet coat .  if he was in mr .  townsend s chair  why should he not be in mr .  townsend s wrapper .  she went nimbly to the closet  took it down  fished out a pair of slippers from a boot rack below  and brought them to him .    i think you had better take off your coat and boots  you will have the rheumatic fever  or something like it  if you don t .  here are some things for you to wear while they are drying .  and you must be hungry  too  i will go into the pantry and get you something to eat .    she bustled away   on hospitable thoughts intent   and the stranger made the exchange with a quizzical smile playing around his lips .  he was a tall  well formed man  with a bold but handsome face  sun burned and heavily bearded  and looking anything but  delicate   though his blue eyes glanced out from under a forehead as white as snow .  he looked around the kitchen with a mischievous air  and stretched out his feet decorated with the defunct boniface s slippers .    upon my word  this is stepping into the old man s shoes with a vengeance .  and what a hearty  good humored looking woman she is .  kind as a kitten   and he leaned forward and stroked the cat and her brood  and then patted old bose upon the head .  the widow  bringing in sundry good things  looked pleased at his attention to her dumb friends .    it s a wonder bose does not growl  he generally does if strangers touch him .  dear me  how stupid .    the last remark was neither addressed to the stranger nor to the dog but to herself she had forgotten that the little stand was not empty  and there was no room on it for the things she held .    oh  i ll manage it   said her guest  gathering up paper  candle  apples  and spectacles  it was not without a little pang that she saw them in his hand  for they had been her husband s  and were placed each night  like the arm chair  beside her  and depositing them on the settle .    give me the table cloth  ma am  i can spread it as well as any woman  i ve learned that along with scores of other things  in my wanderings .  now let me relieve you of those dishes  they are far too heavy for those hands   the widow blushed   and now please  sit down with me  or i cannot eat a morsel .     i had supper long ago  but really i think i can take something more   said mrs .  townsend  drawing her chair nearer to the table .    of course you can  my dear lady  in this cold fall weather people ought to eat twice as much as they do in warm .  let me give you a piece of this ham  your own curing  i dare say .     yes  my poor husband was very fond of it .  he used to say that no one understood curing ham and drying beef better than i .     he was a most sensible man  i am sure .  i drink your health  ma am  in this cider .    he took a long draught  and set down his glass .    it is like nectar .    the widow was feeding bose and the cat  who thought they were entitled to a share of every meal eaten in the house   and did not quite hear what he said .    fine dog  ma am  and a very pretty cat .     they were my husband s favorites   and a sigh followed the answer .    ah  your husband must have been a very happy man .    the blue eyes looked at her so long  that she grew flurried .    is there anything more i can get for you  sir .   she asked  at last .    nothing  thank you  i have finished .    she rose to clear the things away .  he assisted her  and somehow their hands had a queer knack of touching as they carried the dishes to the pantry shelves .  coming back to the kitchen  she put the apples and cider in their old places  and brought out a clean pipe and a box of tobacco from an arched recess near the chimney .    my husband always said he could not sleep after eating supper late unless he smoked   she said .   perhaps you would like to try it .     not if it is to drive you away   he answered  for she had her candle in her hand .    oh  no  i do not object to smoke at all .   she put the candle down  some faint suggestion about  propriety  troubled her  but she glanced at the old clock  and felt reassured .  it was only half past nine .   the stranger pushed the stand back after the pipe was lit  and drew her easy chair a little nearer the fire  and his own .    come  sit down   he said  pleadingly   it s not late  and when a man has been knocking about in california and all sorts of places  for a score of years  he is glad enough to get into a berth like this  and to have a pretty woman to speak to once again .     california .  have you been in california .   she exclaimed  dropping into the chair at once .  unconsciously  she had long cherished the idea that sam payson  the lover of her youth  with whom she had so foolishly quarreled  had pitched his tent  after many wanderings  in that far off land .  her heart warmed to one who  with something of sam s looks and ways about him  had also been sojourning in that country  and who very possibly had met him  perhaps had known him intimately .  at that thought her heart beat quick  and she looked very graciously at the bearded stranger  who  wrapped in mr .  townsend s dressing gown  wearing mr .  townsend s slippers  and sitting in mr .  townsend s chair  beside mr .  townsend s wife  smoked mr .  townsend s pipe with such an air of feeling most thoroughly and comfortably at home .    yes  ma am .  i ve been in california for the last six years .  and before that i went quite round the world in a whaling ship .     good gracious .    the stranger sent a puff of smoke curling gracefully over his head .    it s very strange  my dear lady  how often you see one thing as you go wandering about the world after that fashion .     and what is that .     men  without house or home above their heads  roving here and there  and turning up in all sorts of odd places  caring very little for life as a general thing  and making fortunes just to fling them away again  and all for one reason .  you don t ask me what that is .  no doubt you know already very well .     i think not  sir .     because a woman has jilted them .    here was a long pause  and mr .  townsend s pipe emitted short puffs with surprising rapidity .  a guilty conscience needs no accuser  and the widow s cheek was dyed with blushes as she thought of the absent sam .    i wonder how women manage when they get served in the same way   said the stranger musingly   you never meet them roaming up and down in that style .     no   said mrs .  townsend  with some spirit   if a woman is in trouble she must stay at home and bear it  the best way she can .  and there s more women bearing such things than we know of  i dare say .     like enough .  we never know whose hand gets pinched in a trap unless they scream .  and women are too shy or too sensible  which you choose  for that .     did you ever  in all your wanderings  meet any one by the name of samuel payson .   asked the widow  unconcernedly .   the stranger looked toward her  she was rummaging the table drawer for her knitting work  and did not notice him .  when it was found  and the needles in motion  he answered her .    payson  sam payson .  why  he was my most intimate friend .  do you know him .     a little  that is  i used to  when i was a girl .  where did you meet him .     he went with me on the whaling voyage i told you of  and afterward to california .  we had a tent together  and some other fellows with us  and we worked the same claim for more than six months .     i suppose he was quite well .     strong as an ox .     and  and happy .   pursued the widow  bending closer over her knitting .    hum  the less said about that the better  perhaps .  but he seemed to enjoy life after a fashion of his own .  and he got rich out there  or rather  i will say  well off .    mrs .  townsend did not pay much attention to that part of the story .  evidently she had not finished asking questions  but she was puzzled about her next one .  at last she brought it out beautifully    was his wife with him in california .    the stranger looked at her with twinkling eyes .    his wife  ma am .  why  bless you  he has not got any wife .     oh  i thought  i mean i heard   here the little widow remembered the fate of ananias and sapphira  and stopped short before she told such a tremendous fib .    whatever you heard of his marrying was all nonsense  i can assure you .  i knew him well  and he had no thoughts of the kind about him .  some of the boys used to tease him about it  but he soon made them stop .     how .     he just told them frankly that the only woman he ever loved had jilted him years before  and married another man .  after that no one ever mentioned the subject to him  except me .    mrs .  townsend laid her knitting aside  and looked thoughtfully into the fire .    he was another specimen of the class of men i was speaking of .  i have seen him face death a score of times as quietly as i face the fire .   it matters very little what takes me off   he used to say   i ve nothing to live for  and there s no one that will shed a tear for me when i am gone .   it s a sad thought for a man to have  isn t it .    mrs .  townsend sighed as she said she thought it was .    but did he ever tell you the name of the woman who jilted him .     i know her first name .     what was it .     maria .    the plump little widow almost started out of her chair  the name was spoken so exactly as sam would have said it .    did you know her  too .   he asked  looking keenly at her .    yes .     intimately .     yes .     where is she now .  still happy with her husband  i suppose  and never giving a thought to the poor fellow she drove out into the world .     no   said mrs .  townsend  shading her face with her hand  and speaking unsteadily   no  her husband is dead .     ah .  but still she never thinks of sam .    there was a dead silence .    does she .     how can i tell .     are you still friends .     yes .     then you ought to know  and you do .  tell me .     i m sure i don t know why i should .  but if i do  you must promise me  on your honor  never to tell him  if you ever meet him again .     madam  what you say to me never shall be repeated to any mortal man  upon my honor .     well  then  she does remember him .     but how .     as kindly  i think  as he could wish .     i am glad to hear it  for his sake .  you and i are the friends of both parties  we can rejoice with each other .    he drew his chair much nearer hers  and took her hand .  one moment the widow resisted  but it was a magnetic touch  the rosy palm lay quietly in his  and the dark beard bent so low that it nearly touched her shoulder .  it did not matter much .  was he not samuel s dear friend .  if he was not the rose  had he not dwelt very near it  for a long  long time .    it was a foolish quarrel that parted them   said the stranger  softly .    did he tell you about it .     yes  on board the whaler .     did he blame her much .     not so much as himself .  he said that his jealousy and ill temper drove her to break off the match  but he thought sometimes if he had only gone back and spoken kindly to her  she would have married him after all .     i am sure she would   said the widow piteously .   she has owned it to me more than a thousand times .     she was not happy  then  with another .     mr .   that is to say  her husband  was very good and kind   said the little woman  thinking of the lonely grave out on the hillside rather penitently   and they lived very pleasantly together .  there never was a harsh word between them .     still  might she not have been happier with sam .  be honest  now  and say just what you think .     yes .     bravo .  that is what i wanted to come at .  and now i have a secret to tell you  and you must break it to her .    mrs .  townsend looked rather scared .    what is it .     i want you to go and see her  wherever she may be  and say to her   maria    what makes you start so .     nothing  only you speak so like some one i used to know  once in a while .     do i .  well  take the rest of the message .  tell her that sam loved her through the whole  that  when he heard she was free  he began to work hard at making a fortune .  he has got it  and he is coming to share it with her  if she will let him .  will you tell her this .    the widow did not answer .  she had freed her hand from his  and covered her face with it .  by and by she looked up again  he was waiting patiently .    well .     i will tell her .    he rose from his seat  and walked up and down the room .  then he came back  and leaning on the mantel piece  stroked the yellow hide of bose with his slipper .    make her quite understand that he wants her for his wife .  she may live where she likes and how she likes  only it must be with him .     i will tell her .     say he has grown old  but not cold  that he loves her now perhaps better than he did twenty years ago  that he has been faithful to her all through his life  and that he will be faithful till he dies .    the californian broke off suddenly .  the widow answered still   i will tell her .     and what do you think she will say .   he asked  in an altered tone .    what can she say but come .     hurrah .    the stranger caught her out of her chair as if she had been a child  and kissed her .    don t  oh  don t .   she cried out .   i am sam s maria .     well  i am maria s sam .    off went the dark wig and the black whiskers  there smiled the dear face she had not forgotten .  i leave you to imagine the tableau  even the cat got up to look  and bose sat on his stump of a tail  and wondered if he was on his heels or his head .   the widow gave one little scream  and then she    but  stop .  quiet people like you and me  dear reader  who have got over all these follies  and can do nothing but turn up our noses at them  have no business here .  i will only add that two hearts were very happy  that bose concluded after a while that all was right  and so lay down to sleep again  and that one week afterward  on christmas eve  there was a wedding at the house that made the neighbors stare .  the widow had married her first love .              the old man s christmas .   by ella wheeler wilcox .   i .   though there was wrong on both sides  they never would have separated had it not been for the old man .   he was ben s father  and ben was an only child  a spoiled  selfish  high tempered lad  who had grown up with the idea that his father  anson english  or the  old man   as his dutiful son called him  was much richer than he really was  and that he had no need of any personal effort  any object in life  aside from the pursuit of pleasure .   ben s mother had died when he was fifteen years old and his father had never married again .  yet it was not any allegiance to her memory which had kept anson english from a second marriage .  he remembered her  to be sure  and scarcely a day passed without his mentioning her .  but after her death  as during her weary life  he used her name as a synonym for all that was undesirable .  he compared everybody to   liz beth   and always to her disadvantage .  he had a word of praise and encouragement and approval for every housewife in the neighborhood except  his own .  whatever went wrong  in doors or out    liz beth  was the direct or indirect cause .   during the first five years of her married life  elizabeth made strenuous exertions to please her husband .  she wept her sweet eyes dim over her repeated failures .  then she found that she had been attempting an impossible labor  and grew passively indifferent  an indifference which lasted until death kindly released her .   elizabeth had been a tidy housekeeper during these first years .    you d scrub and scour a man out  er house an  home .   was all the praise her husband gave her for her order and cleanliness  and to his neighbors  to whom he was fond of paying informal visits  he would often say   liz beth s at it again  sweepin  and cleanin   so i cleared out .  never see her without out a broom in her hand .  i d a good deal rather have a little more dirt  than so much tearin   round .   liz beth tires me  with her ways .    yet  when in the indifference of despair which seized upon elizabeth before her death  she allowed her house to look after itself  anson was no better satisfied .    i ve come over to find a place to set down   he would tell his neighbors .    liz beth s let things  cumulate  till the house is a sight to see  she s gettin  dreadful slack  somehow .  a man likes order when he goes home to rest from all his cares .    even when she died she displeased him by choosing a busy season for the occasion .    just like  liz beth  to die in hayin  time   he said .   everything got to stop  hay spoilin   men idle .  women never seem to have no system about work matters  no power of plannin  things  to make it convenient like for men folks .    yet after she was gone  anson found how much help she had been to him  how wonderful her economy had been  how light her expenditures .  he knew he could never find any one to replace her  in these respects  and as money considerations were the main ones in his mind he believed it would be the better economy to remain a widower  and hire his work done .   so during those most critical years of ben s life  he had been without a woman s guidance or care .   at eighteen he was all that arrogance  conceit  selfishness  and high temper could render him .  yet he was a favorite with the fair sex for all that  as he had a manly figure  and a warm  caressing way when he chose  that won their admiration and pleased their vanity .   anson english favored early marriages  and began to think it would be better all around if ben should bring a wife home .   she could do the work better than hired help  and keep the money all in the family .  and ben would not waste his time and means on half a dozen  as he was now doing  but would stay at home  no doubt  and settle down into a sensible  practical business man .  yes  ben ought to marry  and his father told him so .   ben smiled .    i m already thinking of it   he said .  he had expected opposition from his father  and was surprised at his suggestion .    yes   continued the  old man   as ben already designated him   i d like to see you settle down before you re twenty one .  but you want to make a good choice .  there s abby wilson  now .  she s got the muscle of a man  and ain t afraid of anything .  and her father has a fine property  a growin  property .  abby ll make a man a good  vigorous helpmate  and she ll bring him money in time .  you d better shine up to abby  ben .    ben gave a contemptuous laugh .   i d as soon marry a dressed up boy   he said .   she s more like a boy than a girl in her looks and in her ways .  i have other plans in my mind  father  more to my taste .  i mean to marry edith gilman  if she ll take me  and i think she will .    a dark frown contracted anson english s brow .    edith gilman .   he repeated   why  that puny schoolma m  with her baby face and weak voice   ll never help you to get a livin   ben .  what are you thinkin  of .     of love  father  i guess .  i love her  and that s all there is of it .  and i shall marry her  if she ll take me  and you can like it or lump it  as you please .  she s a good girl  and if she s treated well all round  she ll make a good wife  and she s the only woman that can put the check rein on me  when i get in my tempers .  she ll make a man of me yet .     but she can t work   insisted the father .   she looks as white and puny as  liz beth did the year she died .     she s overworked in the school room .  i mean to take her home  and give her a rest .  i don t ask any woman to marry me and be my drudge .  i expect my wife will keep help .    the old man groaned aloud .  ben s ideas were positively ruinous .  if he married this girl  it would add to  not decrease  the family expenses .  but it was useless to oppose .  ben would do as he pleased  the old man saw that plainly  and he might as well submit .   he did submit  and ben married edith on his twenty first birthday  and brought her home .   ii .   edith was a quiet little creature  with a soft voice  and a pale  sweet face  and frail figure .  she came up to anson english when she entered the house  and put her hands timidly upon his arms .    i want you to love me   she said   i have had no father or mother since i can remember .  i want to call you father  and i want to make you happy if i can .     well  i ll tell you how   the old man retorted .   discharge the hired girl  and make good bread .  that ll make me happy    and he laughed harshly .   edith shrank from his rough words  so void of the sympathy and love she longed for .  but she discharged the girl within a week  and tried to make good bread .  it was not a success  however  and the old man was not slow to express his dissatisfaction .  edith left the table in tears .    another dribbler   liz beth was always cryin  just that way over every little thing   sighed the old man .   edith eventually conquered the difficulties of bread making  and became a famous cook .  but she did not please her husband s father any the better by this achievement .    you re always a fixin  up some new sort of trash for the table   he said to her one day .   dessert is it  you call it .   nuff to make a man s patience desert him to see sugar and flour wasted so .   liz beth liked your fancy cooking  but i cured her of it .     yes  and you killed her too   cried edith  for the first time since her marriage losing control of her temper and answering back .   everybody says you worried her into the grave .  but you won t succeed so well with me .  i will live just to defy you  if no more .  and i ll show you that i ll not bear everything  too .    it was all over in a moment  and it was not repeated .  indeed  edith was kinder and gentler and more submissive in her manner after that for days  as sweet natures always are when they have once broken over the rules which govern their lives .   yet the old man always spoke of edith as a virago after that .    she s worse n  liz beth   he said   and she had a temper of her own at times that would just singe things .    ben passed most of his evenings and a good part of his days at the village  store .   he came home the worse for drink occasionally  and he was absolutely indifferent to all the work and care of the farm and family .    she s just like  liz beth   the old man said to his neighbors   she don t make home entertainin  for her husband .  but ben isn t balanced like me  and he goes wrong .  he s excitable .  i never was .  the right kind of a woman could keep him at home .    after a child came to them matters seemed to mend for a time .  so long as the infant lay pink and helpless in its mother s arms or in its crib  it was a bond to unite them all .   so soon as it began to be an active child  with naughty ways which needed correction  it was another element of discord .   the old man did not think edith capable of controlling the child  and ben was hasty and harsh  and he did not like to hear the baby cry .  so he stayed more and more at the store  and was an object of fear to the child and of reproach to the mother when he did return .   they drifted farther apart  and the old man constantly widened the breach between them .  they had been married six years  and the baby girl was four years old  when ben struck edith a blow  one day  and told her to take her child and leave the house .   in less than an hour she had gone  no one knew whither .    she ll come back  more s the pity   the old man said .    liz beth  she started off to leave me once  but she concluded to come back and try it over again .    but edith did not come back .  months afterward they heard of her in a distant part of the state teaching school and supporting her child .   ben applied for a divorce on the plea of desertion .  edith never appeared against him  and he obtained it .   iii .   one year from the time edith left him  he married abby wilson .  she had grown into a voluptuous though coarse maturity  and was dashing in dress and manner .  her father had recently died  leaving her a fine property .  she had always coveted ben  and did not delay the nuptials from any sense of delicacy  but rather hastened the hour which should make him legally her own .   the old man was highly pleased at the turn affairs had taken .  after all these years ben was united to the woman he had chosen for him so long ago  and now surely ben would settle down  and take the care off his shoulders  shoulders which were beginning to feel the weight of years of labor .  in truth  the old man was breaking down .   he fell ill of a low fever soon after ben s second marriage  and when he rose from his bed he seemed to have grown ten years older .  he was more childish in his fault finding  and more irritable than ever before  and this new wife of ben s had little patience with him .  she was not at all like edith .  she bullied him  and frightened him into silence when he began to find fault with her extravagances .  for she was extravagant  there was no denying that .  she cared only for show and outward appearance .  she neglected her home duties  and often left the old man to prepare his own food  while she and ben dashed over the country  or through the neighboring villages  behind the blooded span she had insisted upon his purchasing soon after their marriage .   poor old anson english .  he was nearing his sixtieth year now  and he looked and seemed much older .  ben was his only earthly tie  and the hope and stay of his old age .  and he was but a reed  a reed .  his father saw that at last .  ben would never develop into a practical business man .  he was unstable  lazy  and selfish .  and this new wife seemed to encourage him in every extravagant folly  instead of restraining him as the old man had hoped .  and someway ben had never been the same since edith went away .  he had been none too good or kind to his father before that  but since then  well  when she went  it seemed to anson that she took with her whatever of gentleness or kindness lurked in ben s nature  and left only its brutality and selfishness .   and strive as he would to banish the feeling  the old man missed the child .   ah  no .  he was not happy in this new state of affairs  which he had so rejoiced over at the first .  he grew very old during the next two years .  like all men who worry the lives of women in the domestic circle  he was cowardly at heart .  and ben s new wife frightened him into silent submission by her masculine assumption of authority and her loud voice and well defined muscle .   he spoke little at home now  but he still paid frequent visits to his neighbors  and he remained firm in the adam like idea that elizabeth had been the root of all evil in his life .    yes  ben s letting the place run down pretty bad   he confessed to a neighbor who had broached the subject .   ben s early trainin  wasn t right .   liz beth  she let him do  bout as he pleased .  liz beth never had no notions of how a boy should be trained .  he d a  come out all right if i d a  managed him from the start .    strange to say  he never was known to speak one disparaging word of abby  ben s second wife .  her harshness and neglect were matters of common discussion in the neighborhood  but the old man  who had been so bitter and unjust toward his own wife and edith  seemed to feel a curious respect for this amazon who had subjugated him .  or  perhaps  he remembered how eager he had been for the marriage  and his pride kept him silent .  certain it is that he bore her neglect  and later her abuse  with no word of complaint  and even spoke of her sometimes with praise .    she s a brave one  abby is   he would say .   she ain t afraid of nothin  or nobody .  ef she d a  been a man  she d a  made a noise in the world .    ben drank more and more  and abby dressed and drove in like ratio .  the farm ran down  and debts accumulated  debts which abby refused to pay with her money  and the old man saw the savings of a long life of labor squandered in folly and vice .   people said it was turning his brain  for he talked constantly of his poverty  often walking the streets in animated converse with himself .  and at length he fell ill again  and was wildly delirious for weeks .  it was a high fever  and when it left him  he was totally blind  and quite helpless .   he needed constant care and attention .  he could not be left alone even for an hour  ben was seldom at home  and abby rebelled at the confinement and restraint it imposed upon her .  hired help refused to take the burden of the care of the troublesome old man without increased wages  and ben could not and abby would not incur this added expense .  servants gave warning  ben drank more deeply and prolonged his absences from home  and abby finally carried out a resolve which had at first caused even her hard heart some twinges .   she made an application to the keeper of the county poor to admit her husband s father to the department of the incurably insane  which was adjacent to the poor house .    he s crazy   she said   just as crazy as can be .  we can t do anything with him .  he needs a strong man to look after him .  ben s never at home  and he has everything to look after any way  and can t be broken of his rest  and the old man talks and cries half the night .  i m not able to take care of him  i seem to be breaking down myself  with all i have to endure  and besides it isn t safe to have him in the house .  i think he s getting worse all the time .  he d be better off  and we all would  if he was in the care of the county .    the authorities looked into the matter  and found that at least a portion of the lady s statements were true .  it was quite evident that the old man would be better off in the county house than he was in the home of his only son .  so he was taken away  and abby had her freedom at last .    we are going to take you where you will have medical treatment and care  it is your daughter s request   they told him in answer to his trembling queries .    oh .  yes  yes  abby thinks i ll get my sight back  i suppose  if i m doctored up .  well  maybe so  but i m pooty old  pooty old for the doctors to patch up .  but abby has a powerful mind to plan things  a powerful mind .   liz beth never would a  thought of sending me away   liz beth was so easy like .  abby ought to a  been a man  she had .  she d a  flung things .    so he babbled on as they carried him to the poor house .   it was november  and the holidays were close at hand .  thanksgiving  christmas  new year .  abby meant to enjoy them  and invited all her relatives to a time of general feasting and merrymaking .    i feel as if a great nightmare were lifted off my heart and brain  now the old man has gone   she said .   he will be so much better off  and get so much more skillful treatment  you know  in a place like that .  they are very kind in that institution  and so clean and nice  and he will have plenty of company to keep him from being lonesome .  we have been all through it  during the last year  or else we never should have sent him there .  it is really an excellent home for him .    iv .   it was just a year later when a delicate  sweet faced woman was shown through the wards of that  excellent home  for the poor and unfortunate .  she walked with nervous haste  and her eyes glanced from room to room  and from face to face  as if seeking  yet dreading  some object .   presently the attendant pushed open a partly closed door  which led into a small  close room  ventilated only by one high  narrow window .    this is the room  i believe   he said  and the lady stepped in  and paused .  the air was close and impure  and almost stifled her .   on the opposite side of the room she saw a large crib with a cover or lid which could be closed and locked when necessary  but which was raised now .  in this crib  upon a hard mattress and soiled pillow  lay the emaciated form of an old man .  he turned his sightless eyes toward the door as he heard the sound of footsteps .    what is wanted .   he asked  feebly   does anybody want me .  has anybody come for me .     o father  father .   cried the woman in a voice choked with sobs .   don t you know me .  it is i  and i have come to take you away  to take you away home with me .  will you go .    a glow of delight shone over the old man s wasted face  like the last rays of the sunlight over a winter landscape .  he half arose upon his elbow  and leaned forward as if trying to see the speaker .    why  it s abby  it s abby  come at last .   he said .   you called me father  didn t you  and you was crying  and it made your voice sound kind o  strange and broken like .  but you must be abby come to take me home .  oh  i thought you d come at last  abby .  it seems a long  long time since i came away .  and you ve never been to see me  no  nor ben  either .  but you ve come at last  abby  you ve come at last .  let me take your hand  daughter  for i can t see yet .  they don t seem to help me here as you thought they would .  and i m so hungry  abby .   do you think you could manage to get the old man a little something to eat before we start home .    the woman had grown paler and paler as she listened to these words which the old man poured out in eager haste  like one whose thoughts and feelings long pent within himself for want of a listener now rushed forth pell mell into speech .    he does not know me   she whispered   he does not know me .  well  i will not undeceive him now .  he is happy in this delusion   let him keep it for the present .   then  aloud  she said    you are hungry  father .  do you not have food enough here .     oh  i have my share  abby  i have my share .  but my appetite s varying  and sometimes when they bring it i can t eat it  and then when i want it most i can t get it .  i m one of many here  and i ve been so lonesome  abby .  but then i knew you d come for me all in good time .  and  ben  how is ben  abby .  does he want to see his old father again .  ah  ben was a nice little boy  a nice little boy .  but  liz beth wan t no kind of a mother for such a high strung lad .  and then he hadn t oughter married that sickly sort of girl that ran off an  left him .  sakes alive .  what a temper she had .  it sort of broke ben down living with her as long as he did .  but he remembers his old father at last  don t he .  and he wants to have me home to die .  ah  ben has a good heart after all .     i must not tell him  i must not   whispered the woman as she listened .   bitter to me as his deception is  i must let him remain in it .   then with a sudden bracing of the nerves  and a visible effort  she said    ben is away from home now  father .  he will not be there to meet you  but you ll not mind that  i shall make you so comfortable  i want you at home during the holidays .    so he went out from the horror and loneliness and gloom of the poor house  to the comfortable home which edith had provided for herself and child in the years since she left ben .  eva was a precocious little maiden of nine now  wise and womanly beyond her years .  so soon as edith learned of the old man s desolate fate  she resolved to bring him home .  eva could attend to his wants during the day  while she was in the school room  and the interrupted studies could be pursued in the evening .  or she could hire assistance if he were as troublesome as report had said .  he had been a harsh old man  and had helped to widen the breach between her and ben .  but he was the father of the man she had married  and she could not let him die in the poor house .  so she brought him home .    don t i hear a child s voice .   he asked  as eva came dancing out to greet them .   who is it  abby .     why  it s your own little granddaughter eva   cried the child  clasping his withered hand in her two soft palms .   don t you remember me .  mamma says you used to love me .    edith s heart stood still .  surely now he would understand .  and would he be angry and harsh with her .   the old man s face lighted .    ah  i see  i see   he said musingly   abby and ben have taken the little one home .  it must be edith is dead .  she was such a puny thing .   then turning his face to the woman who was guiding his faltering footsteps  he asked    and is edith dead .     yes   she answered quietly   edith is dead .   and added  to you   in a whisper .    he must never be undeceived   she thought .   it would be too severe a blow  the truth might kill him .   and to eva she said a little later    dear  your grandfather is very ill  and not quite right in his mind .  he thinks my name is abby  and you must not correct him or dispute any strange thing he may say .    the journey left the old man very weak indeed  but he talked almost constantly .    it was so good of you  abby  to take the little girl home   he would say .   but i knowed you had a good heart  and ben too .  he was fond of his old father  spite of his rough ways .  it was pooty lonesome  pooty lonesome  off there at that place  that institute where you sent me .  some folks said it was the poor house  but i knew better  i knew better .  ben and you would never send me there .  i s pose it was a good place  but they had too many patients .  sometimes i was cold and hungry and all alone for hours and hours .  oh  it s good to be back home with you  you  abby  but why don t ben come .     ben is away  father .     oh  yes  yes .  business  i suppose .  ben ll turn out all right at last .  i always thought so .  after he sort o  outgrows  liz beth s trainin  .  but i hope he ll get back for christmas .  somehow i ve been thinkin  lately  bout the christmas days when ben was a little boy .  we allus put something in his stockin  that night  no matter if twan t no more n a sweet cake .  sakes alive .  how he prized things he found in his stockin  christmas mornin s .  i got to thinkin   bout it all last christmas out at that there institute  and i just laid an  bawled like a baby  i was so home sick like .  seemed to me if i could just see ben s face again  i d ask nothin  more of heaven .  and now i think if i can just hear his voice again  it ll be enough .  do you think he ll git home for christmas  abby .     i hope so  dear father  but i cannot tell .   edith answered softly  her heart seeming to break in her breast as she listened .   she knew very well that ben would not go across the street to see the father he had deserted  and that she could never send for him to come to her house  to pay even a last visit of mercy .    what will i do  how can i explain to him  when christmas comes and ben does not appear .   she thought .   but the way was shown her by that great peace maker who helps us out of all difficulties at last .   christmas eve  the old man s constant chatter grew flighty and incoherent .  he talked of people and things unknown to edith  and spoke his mother s name many times .  then he fell asleep .  in the morning he seemed very weak  and his voice was fainter .    such a strange dream as i have had   lis beth   he said  as edith put her hand on his brow  and smoothed back the thin  white hair .    such a strange dream  i thought ben had grown into a man  and had left me alone  all alone to die .  i m so glad to be awake and find it isn t true .  how dark it is  and how long the night seems .  to morrow is christmas .  did you put something in ben s stockings   lis beth .  i have forgotten .     yes   answered edith  in a choked voice .    and it s gettin  colder   lis beth .  hadn t you better look after ben a little .  see if he s covered up well in his crib .  you re so careless   lis beth  the boy ll take his death o  cold yet .  and he s all i ve got .  he ll make a fine man  a fine man if you don t spoil him   lis beth .  but you hain t no real sense for trainin  a boy  somehow .  is he covered up .  it s bitter  bitter cold .     he is well covered   edith answered .  the old man seemed to doze again .  then he roused a little .    it s dawn   he said .   i see the light breaking .  little ben ll be crawling out for his stockin  pooty quick  i oughter had the fire made afore this  to warm his little toes .  strange you couldn t a  waked me   liz beth .  you don t never seem to have no foresight .    then the old man fell back on edith s arm  dead .              the christmas goblins .   by charles dickens .   in an old abbey town  a long  long while ago there officiated as sexton and gravedigger in the churchyard one gabriel grubb .  he was an ill conditioned cross grained  surly fellow  who consorted with nobody but himself and an old wicker bottle which fitted into his large  deep waistcoat pocket .   a little before twilight one christmas eve  gabriel shouldered his spade  lighted his lantern  and betook himself toward the old churchyard  for he had a grave to finish by next morning  and feeling very low  he thought it might raise his spirits  perhaps  if he went on with his work at once .   he strode along until he turned into the dark lane which led to the churchyard  a nice  gloomy  mournful place into which the towns people did not care to go except in broad daylight  consequently he was not a little indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about a merry christmas .  gabriel waited until the boy came up  then rapped him over the head with his lantern five or six times to teach him to modulate his voice .  and as the boy hurried away  with his hand to his head  gabriel grubb chuckled to himself and entered the churchyard  locking the gate behind him .   he took off his coat  put down his lantern  and getting into an unfinished grave  worked at it for an hour or so with right good will .  but the earth was hardened with the frost  and it was no easy matter to break it up and shovel it out .  at any other time this would have made gabriel very miserable  but he was so pleased at having stopped the small boy s singing that he took little heed of the scanty progress he had made when he had finished work for the night  and looked down into the grave with grim satisfaction  murmuring as he gathered up his things    brave lodgings for one  brave lodgings for one  a few feet of cold earth when life is done .     ho .  ho .   he laughed  as he set himself down on a flat tombstone  which was a favorite resting place of his  and drew forth his wicker bottle .   a coffin at christmas .  a christmas box .  ho .  ho .  ho .     ho .  ho .  ho .   repeated a voice close beside him .    it was the echoes   said he  raising the bottle to his lips again .    it was not   said a deep voice .   gabriel started up and stood rooted to the spot with terror  for his eyes rested on a form that made his blood run cold .   seated on an upright tombstone close to him was a strange  unearthly figure .  he was sitting perfectly still  grinning at gabriel grubb with such a grin as only a goblin could call up .    what do you here on christmas eve .   said the goblin  sternly .    i came to dig a grave  sir   stammered gabriel .    what man wanders among graves on such a night as this .   cried the goblin .    gabriel grubb .  gabriel grubb .   screamed a wild chorus of voices that seemed to fill the churchyard .    what have you got in that bottle .   said the goblin .    hollands  sir   replied the sexton  trembling more than ever  for he had bought it of the smugglers  and he thought his questioner might be in the excise department of the goblins .    who drinks hollands alone  and in a churchyard on such a night as this .     gabriel grubb .  gabriel grubb .   exclaimed the wild voices again .    and who  then  is our lawful prize .   exclaimed the goblin  raising his voice .   the invisible chorus replied   gabriel grubb .  gabriel grubb .     well  gabriel  what do you say to this .   said the goblin  as he grinned a broader grin than before .   the sexton gasped for breath .    what do you think of this  gabriel .     it s  it s very curious  sir  very curious  sir  and very pretty   replied the sexton  half dead with fright .   but i think i ll go back and finish my work  sir  if you please .     work .   said the goblin   what work .     the grave  sir .     oh .  the grave  eh .  who makes graves at a time when other men are merry  and takes a pleasure in it .    again the voices replied   gabriel grubb .  gabriel grubb .     i m afraid my friends want you  gabriel   said the goblin .    under favor  sir   replied the horror stricken sexton   i don t think they can  they don t know me  sir  i don t think the gentlemen have ever seen me .     oh .  yes  they have .  we know the man who struck the boy in the envious malice of his heart because the boy could be merry and he could not .    here the goblin gave a loud  shrill laugh which the echoes returned twenty fold .    i  i am afraid i must leave you  sir   said the sexton  making an effort to move .    leave us .   said the goblin   ho .  ho .  ho .    as the goblin laughed he suddenly darted toward gabriel  laid his hand upon his collar  and sank with him through the earth .  and when he had had time to fetch his breath he found himself in what appeared to be a large cavern  surrounded on all sides by goblins ugly and grim .    and now   said the king of the goblins  seated in the centre of the room on an elevated seat  his friend of the churchyard   show the man of misery and gloom a few of the pictures from our great storehouses .    as the goblin said this a cloud rolled gradually away and disclosed a small and scantily furnished but neat apartment .  little children were gathered round a bright fire  clinging to their mother s gown  or gamboling round her chair .  a frugal meal was spread upon the table and an elbow chair was placed near the fire .  soon the father entered and the children ran to meet him .  as he sat down to his meal the mother sat by his side and all seemed happiness and comfort .    what do you think of that .   said the goblin .   gabriel murmured something about its being very pretty .    show him some more   said the goblin .   many a time the cloud went and came  and many a lesson it taught to gabriel grubb .  he saw that men who worked hard and earned their scanty bread were cheerful and happy .  and he came to the conclusion it was a very respectable sort of a world after all .  no sooner had he formed it than the cloud closed over the last picture seemed to settle on his senses and lull him to repose .  one by one the goblins faded from his sight  and as the last one disappeared he sank to sleep .   the day had broken when he awoke  and found himself lying on the flat gravestone  with the wicker bottle empty by his side .  he got on his feet as well as he could  and brushing the frost off his coat  turned his face toward the town .   but he was an altered man  he had learned lessons of gentleness and good nature by his strange adventures in the goblin s cavern .              the song of the star .   by rev .  c .  h .  mead .    oh  boys  you can count me out on that  all i can get goes to my mother and sisters for christmas .    the speaker was a manly little newsboy  with good features  a clean face and bright eyes .  his clothes looked neat  though they were adorned with numerous patches .    but see here  will .  christmas only comes once a year  and why shouldn t we fellers have our banquet as well as the silk stockings .  what would they know about things going on in the world anyway  if we newsboys didn t supply  em with papers .  all in favor of having a banquet  hold up yer hands .    up went a score of hands  some dirty  some clean and some speckled  but will s hand remained down .   see here  will  what s the reason you won t stay by us .    the boy hesitated a moment and then said   boys  it s mighty close times up at our house  fried chicken and pound cake don t come our way  turkeys roost too high for us  and  and  well  boys  if you must know it  about the only good thing we kids have up there is our mother s love .  see these patches .  my mother put them on .  see these stockings .  my mother has been mending this same pair of stockings for more than a year  and she washes and irons them after i ve gone to bed at night .  every stitch of mother s needle and thread is a stitch of love  and one night not long ago  i opened my eyes and saw my mother s tears dropping on the sleeve of my coat at the same time she was putting the patch on this elbow .  i tell you  boys  the best thing i ve got in the world is my mother  and the best christmas gift i ever had is my mother s love .  if i had a million dollars  i d give them all to my mother in return for her love .  no  no  boys  no banquet for me  as long as i know my mother is starving herself that we children may have more to eat .     well   replied one of the boys   if i had a mother like that  maybe i d feel the same way  but all we get at our house is a good licking from a drunken mother  and i m going in for a square meal at christmas  if i never has another .    the boys  gathered on the sidewalk by one of the parks  were suddenly startled by a cry  look out there .   and the next moment a runaway horse dashed into their midst  little will was knocked over  and was soon carried into a neighboring drug store  all unconscious of what had happened .  it was soon discovered that his arm was broken  and his body bruised in a number of places .  the moment he regained consciousness and found what had occurred  he said    take me to my mother  she will take care of me somehow  though this isn t exactly the kind of a christmas gift i meant she should have .  say  boys  one of you go up to our house  and tell her easy about this  don t burst in sudden and scare her  but tell her it isn t dangerous  and  well  just tell her i love her .    the boys wiped their eyes and one of them said   this busts up our banquet  fellers  i ll go and tell will s mother  and  say  fellers  shan t i tell her we will give our banquet money to help her out at christmas .    a hearty  you bet we will   was the response  as big tom sped away to carry the news to will s mother  while kind hands helped carry the injured boy to his home .  it was a poor home into which he was borne  but everything was as neat and tidy as could be .  a woman stood at the door  and it needed but one glance to know that she was the mother of will .  poverty and hunger had failed to rob her of her beauty  and there was an air of refinement about her that told of better days and happier surroundings .    christmas hasn t come yet  mother   said will   but i have .  don t you worry  i ll come out of this all right  and we will have a good christmas yet .    the mother kissed him tenderly as she said   no  i will not worry  so long as i have god  and you  and josie  and maggie  and tot .  when christmas comes round  will  it will be a good day whatever it brings .     it will bring yer heaps of things  mrs .  sandford   blurted out big tom   for we fellers has given up havin  a banquet  and are going to bring yer something that will can t bring now .  don t yer worry a bit   and here the rough fellow burst into tears  and rushed out of the house .   a few more days  and then christmas eve came round  and a bright night it was .  will lay sleeping on the bed  his mother near by  pretending to read  but in reality using the dear old bible as a shield to hide the tears that trickled down her cheeks .  the mother was thinking  and thinking fast  too .  it was only a little over thirteen years since her father had closed the door in her face and told her never to return .  the man she loved was not the fashionable fop her father had selected for her as a husband  and secretly she had given her hand to the man to whom long before she had given her heart .  all went well  until three years ago  when her husband died suddenly  and she found herself with no means and four children to take care of .  too proud to apply to her father for help  she struggled on as best she could  leaning hard on the god whom her mother had taught her to love .   her children were a comfort to her  for they had inherited the natural goodness of both their parents .  her tears now fell fast  for as she thought  she also listened to the voices of her two youngest children who were standing over by the window together .    say  maggie  does yer see dat bright star up dere .  i wonder if dat is de star what de shepherds seen .  if it is  it seems to be looking right down at us .  maybe jesus is in dat star  and if he is  he won t forget us  will he .    and tot looked at maggie as the latter said   jesus loved little children  tot  when he was on the earth  and i guess he loves them yet .  that s a very bright star  it must be the one that was seen by the shepherds at bethlehem .     i think so  too   said tot   and may be josie will hear some of dem  good tidings  while she is out .  oh .  maggie  jesus must love mother  she is so good  and i think he has sent that star to tell us to look out for good news .    and where was josie all this time .  the mother thought she had gone into a neighbor s  where she frequently went  and so felt no anxiety .   out in the streets of the big city  side by side walked plenty and poverty  wealth and wretchedness  happiness and hunger  gladness and grief .  some carried bundles in their arms  while others carried burdens in their hearts .  over all  the good god watched  and down upon all the bright star shone .  but what is that .  suddenly on one of the streets the people stopped and listened .  on the steps of a stoop leading up to a lighted mansion stood a little girl who looked like a bright angel from heaven .  far above  overhead  shone the bright star that maggie and tot had seen  it was their star and it was her star  for josie  too  had discovered it  and somehow felt that the star that had brought  good tidings of great joy  to the shepherds on bethlehem s plains  had come again and to bring once more  good tidings .   she had mounted the steps to get nearer the star  and then all unconscious of the people  in a rich  sweet voice  she sang     i think  when i read that sweet story of old  when jesus was here among men  how he called little children  as lambs to his fold  i should like to have been with him then .   i wish that his hands had been placed on my head  that his arms had been thrown around me  that i might have seen his kind look  when he said   let the little ones come unto me .    as she sang  her gaze was fixed on the star  and even her hands were lifted toward it .  the people looked at her  an angel had appeared in their midst  her face  her voice  her upturned eyes  her uplifted hands  held them spell bound  until some one looking up in the direction she pointed  cried out   see that star .   heavenward went the gaze of the multitude  and once more there seemed to come to them a voice  saying   fear not  for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy  which shall be to all people .   the face of josie was illumined and even the multitude that had gathered  failed to alarm her .  the star with its  good tidings  was over her head and in her heart as well .   who are you  my child .   said a gentleman who had come up on the steps where she stood .   please  sir  i am josie sandford .   the gentleman gave a start and said   sandford  josie sandford .  pray where do you live  josie .   she told him  and in response to other questions  told of mother  brother and sisters .    oh  sir  do you see the star .  i am sure it has some  good tidings  for us at our house  and i must hurry home and tell mother all about it .  good bye .    away sped the child until she reached her home  and then entering the room quietly  she went up to her mother and said   have you seen the star  mother .   maggie and tot cried out   we ve seen it  come  mother  and look quick .   the mother went quietly to the window  and there beheld a star of wonderful brightness  and as she gazed  her face took on a new light and into her heart came a great peace .  the sleeping boy was awakened by the voices  and he  too  made his way to the window and looked at the star .   at evening time it shall be light .    it had come  and  something else had come  too  for steps were heard on the stairs  followed by a knock on the door  on opening which  in came a company of newsboys headed by big tom .  they bore bundles and baskets  provisions and poultry  sunshine and sugar  toys and turnips  good will and grapes  cheer and celery  and things that no one but those who had lacked for them  would ever have thought of .  big tom was the spokesman for the happy company .    if yer please  mrs .  sandford   he said   there s our banquet .  we wasn t going to come until to morrow morning  but when we got the things all together  we just couldn t wait any longer  so we ve brought  em to night  and if it isn t too soon  ma am  we wishes you  and will  and josie  and maggie  and tot a  merry christmas   doesn t we  boys .     indeed we does .   responded the boys .  the faces of that mother and her children were a sight to behold .  smiles and tears greeted the boys  and the mother and her three girls had a kiss for each of them .  then tot said   i knowed it .  i knowed it .  de star had jesus in it  and i knowed he see maggie and me looking up at it .     well  boys   said mrs .  sandford   you shall have your banquet  for i want you all to take christmas dinner with us to morrow .     yes  boys  you shall all take dinner with mrs .  sandford and her children to morrow  but it must be at the home of her parents and not here   said a gentleman who had not been noticed as he stood in the hallway .   mrs .  sandford started as the owner of the voice entered the room  and little josie sprang toward him at the same moment .  she resembled her mother and was her namesake as well .  the gentleman stretched out his arms toward mrs .  sandford as he said to her    josie  can you forgive me for the harshness with which i drove you years ago from my door .  god only knows how i have suffered  and for years i have hunted high and low for you  and have advertised time and again .  but all was in vain  until to night i saw your face and heard your voice once more  as my grandchild  josie  stood singing on the steps and gazing at the star .  in her i found you again  and oh  how your mother and i have prayed for this time to come .    long before he had finished  the daughter was in her father s arms once more  and the children were clinging to their new found grandparent .  the newsboys looked on in wonder  and suddenly little tot ran to the window and then cried out   oh  grandpa  the star is here yet  and it shines brighter than before   and she threw a kiss up to the star .   christmas morning came and found them all in a home of plenty .  a chair that had long stood vacant at that table  was once more filled  and near it were four other chairs for the new found grand children .  was it a  merry christmas   did you inquire .  just ask those newsboys who came at two o clock if they ever had such a banquet before or since  or whether they ever saw a home in which the  star of bethlehem  shone with greater splendor .  and over the earth the star still shines  and will continue to shine until all mankind shall yet have a  merry christmas .               indian pete s christmas gift .   by herbert w .  collingwood .   the moon was just peeping over the pines as pete shivershee slunk down the road from the lumber camp into the forest .  pete did not present a surpassingly dignified appearance as he skulked through the clearing  but he was not a very dignified person even at his best .   most persons would have said  i think  that pete s method of departure was hardly appropriate for one who had been selected by the citizens of carter s camp to go on an important mission .  but pete had his own reasons for his actions .  he crept along behind the stumps and logs till he reached the forest .  then  as if the shadow gave him fresh courage and dignity  he drew himself upright  and started at a sharp trot down the road toward the village .   we have said that pete had reasons for his conduct .  they were good ones .  in the first place  he was an indian .  not a  noble son of the forest   such as cooper loved to picture  but a mean  dirty  yellow faced  injun .   lazy and worthless  picking up a living about the lumber camps  working as little as he could  and eating and drinking as much as possible  such was the messenger .  the mission was worse yet .   it was christmas eve .  the snow covered the ground  and the ice had stilled for the time the mouth of the roaring river .  it was saturday night as well  and for some time past the lumbermen had been considering the advisability of keeping the good old holiday with some form of celebration suited to the occasion .   the citizens of carter s camp were not remarkably fastidious .  they knew but one form of celebration  and they had no thought of hunting out new ones .  the one thing needful to make a celebration completely successful was  liquor .  this they must have in order to do justice to the day .   the temperance laws of carter s were very strict .  not that the moral sentiment of the place was particularly high  but it had been noticed that the amounts of labor and whisky were in inverse proportion .  the more whisky  the less labor .  it was a pure question of political economy .  the foreman had often stated that he would prosecute to the fullest extent of the law the first man caught bringing whisky into camp .  the foreman did not attempt  perhaps  to deny that his knowledge of the law was somewhat crude .  he had forcibly stated  however  that should a case be brought before him  he would himself act as judge and jury  while his fist and foot would take the place of witness and counsel .  there was something so terrible in this statement  coming as it did from the largest man in camp  that very little whisky had thus far been brought in .   christmas had come  and the drinking element in carter s camp proposed that pete shivershee  the  injun   be sent to town for a quantity of the liquid poison  that the drinkers might  enjoy  themselves .   bill gammon found pete curled up by the stove .  he took him out of doors and explained the business in hand .  bill prided himself somewhat on his ability to  git work out of injuns .   pete muttered only  all right .   he took the money bill gave him  and then slunk away down the road for the forest  as we have seen him .              bill felt so confident of the success of his experiment that he did not hesitate to inform the boys that pete was  dead sure  to return .  he would stake his reputation upon it .   pete was in a hard position .  if he loved anything in this world  it was whisky .  if there was anything he feared  it was bill s fist .  the two were sure to go together .  the money jingling in his pocket suggested unlimited pleasures  but over every one hung bill s hard fist .  he ran several miles through the forest  till  turning a corner of the road  he came upon a little clearing  in which stood a small log house .  pete knew the place well .  here lived jeff hunt with his wife  a french woman  and their troop of children .   jeff was a person of little importance by the side of his wife  though  like all  lords of creation   he considered himself the legal and proper head of the family  as well as one of the mainstays of society .  his part of the family government consisted  for the most part  in keeping the house supplied with wood and water  and in smoking his comfortable pipe in the corner  while his wife bent over her tub .   mrs .  hunt was the only woman near the camp  and so all the laundry work fell to her .  laundry work in the pine woods implies mending and darning  as well as washing and ironing  and the poor little woman had her hands full of work surely .  it was rub  rub  rub  day after day  over the steaming tub  with the children running about like little wolves  and jeff kindly giving his advice from his comfortable corner .  and even after the children were in bed at night  she must sit up and mend the clean clothes .   what a pack of children there were .  how rough and strong they seemed  running about all day  all but poor little marie  the oldest .  she had never been strong  and now at last she was dying of consumption .  she could not sit up at all  but lay all day on the little bed in the corner  watching her mother with sad  beautiful eyes .   the brave little frenchwoman s heart almost failed her at times  as she saw how day by day the little form grew thinner  the eyes more beautiful  the cheeks more flushed .  she knew the signs too well  but there was nothing she could do .   pete was a regular visitor at jeff s and always a welcome one .  his work was to carry the washing to and from camp .  he came nearer to feeling like a man at jeff s house than at any other place he knew of .  everyone but mrs .  hunt and little marie called him only  injun   but they always said  mr .  shivershee .   the  meester shivershee  of the little frenchwoman was the nearest claim to respectability that pete felt able to make .  one night while carrying home the clothes  he dropped them in the mud .  he never minded the whipping bill gammon gave him half as much as he did poor mrs .  hunt s tears  to think how her work had gone for nothing .   as pete came trotting down the road  jeff stood in front of his house chopping stove wood from a great log .  a lantern  hung on a stump  provided light for his purpose .  pete stopped from sheer force of habit in front of the house  and jeff  glad of any chance to interrupt his work  paused to talk with him .    walk in  injun   said jeff  hospitably .   yer clo es ain t quite ready  but the woman will hev  em all up soon  walk in .    it suddenly came over pete that this was his night for taking the clothes home  but his present errand was of far more importance than mere laundry work .    me no stop .  i goin  ter town .  great work .  large bizness .   by which vague hints he meant no doubt to impress jeff with a sense of the dignity of his mission  and yet cunningly to keep its object concealed .    goin  to town  be ye .  great doin s ter camp ter morrer  i s pose .  i ll be round ef i kin git away  but walk in  injun  an  git yer supper  an  see the wimmin   and jeff opened the door for pete to pass in .   the thought of supper was too much for pete and he slunk in after jeff and stood in the corner by the door .  the room was hardly an inviting one  and yet if pete had been a white man some thoughts of  home  sweet home   must have passed through his mind .  but he was only a despised  injun .    a rough board table was laid for supper at one side of the room .  in the corner little marie lay with the firelight falling over her poor thin face .  pete must have felt  as he looked at her  like some hopeless convict gazing through his prison bars upon some fair saint passing before him .  she seemed to be in another world than his  there seemed between them a gulf that could not be bridged .  three of the larger children were sobbing in the corner  while the rest formed a sorrowful group about an old box in which were two or three simple plants frozen and yellow .  mrs .  hunt was frying pork over the hot stove .  as she looked up at pete  he noticed that she had been crying .   jeff was the very prince of hosts .  he made haste to make pete feel at home .    set by  injun .  so the boys is goin  ter kinder cellybrate ter morrer  be they .    but pete felt that his mission must not be disclosed .   what matter is with kids .   he asked  to change the subject .    oh  they re jest a yellin  about them flowers   explained jeff .   ye see they hev been a trainin  some posies indoors against ter morrer  ye know .  ter morrer s christmas  ye see  an  them kids they hed an idee they d hev some flowers fer ter dekerate thet corner where the little gal is .  little gals  when they ain t well  like sech things  ye know .    pete nodded .  he was not aware of this love of diminutive females  but it would not show very good breeding to appear ignorant .    wall  ye see   continued jeff   they kep the flowers away from the little gal  meanin  ter s prise her like .  but jest this afternoon they gut ketched by the frost  an  now there they be stiffer n stakes .  it is kinder bad  ain t it   specially ez it s christmas  too .     what crissmus .   put in pete .    oh  christmas .  wall  it s a sorter day like .  it s somethin  like other days  an  yet it ain t .  but then  injun  i don t s pose ye would understand ef i wuz ter tell ye .   and jeff concealed his own ignorance  as many wiser and better men have done  by assuming a tone too lofty for his audience .   but mrs .  hunt could explain  even if jeff could not .  she paused on the way to the stove with a dish of pork in her hand .    it eez the day of the good lord  meester shivershee .  it eez the day when the good lord he was born  and when all people should be glad .   but the little woman belied her own creed as she thought of little marie and the dead flowers .   i hardly think pete gained a very clear idea of the day  even from mrs .  hunt s explanation .  it was  i fear  all greek to him .    what flowers fer .   he asked  as  in response to jeff s polite invitation  he  sat by  and began supper .    wall  it s a sorter idee of the wimmin   explained jeff .   looks kinder pooty to see flowers round  ye see  kinder slicks up a room like .  all these things hez ter come inter keepin  house  ye see  injun .   with which broad explanation jeff helped himself to a piece of pork .   but mrs .  hunt was bound to explain too .  her explanation was certainly more poetic .    it eez the way we show our love for the good lord  meester shivershee .  what is more beautiful than the flowers .  we take the flowers  and with much love we place them upon the walls  and we make others happy with them  and the good lord  who loves us all  he is pleased    but here  seeing the sobbing children and the frozen plants  she could not help wiping her eyes upon her apron .   the little sufferer on the bed saw this action .  her voice was almost gone .   never mind  mamma   she whispered  but the beautiful eyes were filled with tears  for she knew that mamma would mind  that she could not help it .   pete listened to all this attentively .   injun  that he was  of course he could not understand it all  and yet he could hardly help seeing something of the sorrow that the loss of the flowers had brought upon the family .  he finished his supper  and then slunk out at the door again .  jeff followed him out .    little gal ever git well .   asked pete .    no  i don t s pose she will   answered jeff .   there ain t no hopes held out fer her .  makes it kinder bad  ye see .  nice  clever little gal as ever lived  too .  stop in an  git yer clo es when ye come back  will ye .     all right   muttered pete  as he trotted away toward the town .              i wonder what pete was thinking about as he ran through the forest .  an  injun s  thoughts on any ordinary subject cannot be very deep  yet when one comes from such a scene as pete had just witnessed  and when such sad eyes as marie s haunt one all along a lonely road  even an  injun s  thoughts must be worth noticing .  let us imagine what pete s thoughts were as he shuffled mile after mile through the snow .  the scene he had just left rose before his dulled  injun  mind .  how kind mrs .  hunt had always been to him .  she was the only one that called him  mister .   how queer it was that the children should cry because the flowers were killed .  how little marie had looked at him .  somehow pete could not drive those sad eyes away .  they seemed to be looking at him from every stump  from every tree .  they were filled with tears now  could it be because the flowers were frozen .   it is no wonder that when at last the few lingering village lights came into view  pete was wondering how he could help matters out .   it was quite late  and most of the shops were closed .  only here and there some late worker showed a light .  the bar rooms were open full blast  and as pete glided down the sawdust street it needed all the remembrance of bill s fist to keep him from parting with a portion of the jingling money for an equal amount of good cheer .  but the fist had the best of it  and he went straight on to the last bar room .  surely bill was right .  nothing but a miracle could stop him .   but the miracle was performed  and when pete least expected it .   pete knew better than to go into the front door of the bar room .  he knew how well he and all his race are protected by the government .  it had been decided that no one should be allowed to sell liquor to an  injun   at least at the regular bar .  if an  injun   however  could so far lose sight of his personal dignity as to come sneaking in at the back door  and pay an extra price for his liquor  whose business was it .   pete knew the way of bar tenders .  he had been in the business before .  he did not go in at the front door where the higher bred white men were made welcome  but slunk down an alley by the side of the building  meaning to go in the back way .   there was no light in the store next the bar room .  it was a milliner s store and had been closed for some hours .  but in the back room two women were working away anxious to finish a hat  evidently intended for some village belle s christmas .  pete stopped in the dark alley for a moment to watch them .   a man sat asleep in a chair by the stove  but the women worked on with tireless fingers .  the hat was growing more and more brilliant under their quick touches .  by their side stood a basket of artificial flowers and bright ribbons .  it seemed to pete that he had never before seen anything so beautiful .  here were flowers  why could he not get some for the little sick girl .   it was a severe struggle for the poor  injun   out there in the dark alley .  the thought of the thrashing he would receive on the one hand  and the sad eyes of marie on the other .  what could he do .  but even an  injun  can remember a kindness .  it may have been a miracle  or it may have been just the out cropping of the desire to repay a kindness which even an  injun  is said to possess .  at any rate the eyes conquered and pete braved the fist of bill .  for fear that he should lose courage  he pushed against the door of the room  and entered without ceremony .   there was a great commotion  i can assure you .  the idea of an  injun  pushing his way into the back parlor of a milliner s shop was too much of a revolutionary proceeding to pass unnoticed .  the women dropped their work with a little scream  while the man started from his chair with most violent intent upon poor pete .    what be ye after here  injun .   he growled .   hump yerself outer here  git a goin  .    but pete pulled out his money  at the sight of which the standing army of the milliner s store paused .  money has smoothed over many an outrage .  it might perhaps excuse even such an action on the part of an  injun .     i want flowers   pete said  pointing to the basket .   give me flowers  i pay .     oh  ye wanter buy sum of them artyficial flowers  do ye .  this is a pooty time o  night ter come flower huntin   ain t it .  jest pick out yer flowers  an  then climb out .    and he held the basket out at arm s length for pete to select .   pete took a great red rose  and a white flower .  there was not very much of a stock to select from  but pete  with  injun  instinct  selected the largest and gaudiest .    them is wurth about ten shillins   figured up the merchant  taking the money from pete s hand .   pete carefully placed the flowers in the pocket of his ragged coat  and started for the door .  the milliner s man  rendered affable by the most surprising bargain he had just made  naturally wished to retain the patronage of such a model customer .    want anything in our line  injun  jest call round an  we ll please ye .  only come a little afore bed time when ye come again .   but pete slunk out at the door and did not hear him .   pete s money was nearly gone  but he had a scheme in his head .  he slunk in at the back door of the bar room  and obtained his jug  and what whiskey he could buy with the rest of his money .  then up the street he ran again  out of town  stopping only once at the pump to fill the jug to the top with water .  resolutely fastening in the stopper  and not even raising the jug to his mouth  he started for camp at his long  swinging trot  with the jug in his hand .  mile after mile was passed over  yet pete did not stop till jeff hunt s cabin came in sight .  hiding his jug behind a log  he crept up to the window and looked in .   the light was burning on the table  while mrs .  hunt sat nodding over her work .  she had been mending the clothes so that pete could take them back with him .  tired out  she had fallen asleep .  the box of frozen plants still stood by the table .  pete grinned as he saw them  thinking of the great flowers in his pocket .  marie was asleep .  over her head were hung long clusters of moss  with masses of ground pine and red berries .   pete stole to the door and went in .  mrs .  hunt woke with a start  but at sight of pete smiled in her weary way .  pete made up his bundle of clothes  and then pulled out the great red rose and the white flower .  he laid them on the table with   flowers fer little gal .  sick .  make her think crissmus .  good flowers .  all color .  no fade .  no smell .  no wear out .   then  catching up his bundle  he slunk away without waiting for mrs .  hunt s thanks .              when bill gammon woke in the morning  he found the jug at the foot of his bunk .  but pete was nowhere to be seen .  he had left the jug and fled .   the christmas celebration at carter s was a very tame affair .  many were the curses showered upon pete  and had that worthy been present  i doubt if even the thought of the famous miracle would have sustained him in the beating he would have received .  but if pete s conduct produced such a sad effect upon the festivities at carter s  the joy it caused at jeff hunt s cabin made matters even .  the glad christmas sun  glad with the promise of the  old  old story   came dancing and sparkling over the trees  and looked down in wonderful tenderness upon the humble cabin .  the first bright beams fell upon the bed where little marie was lying .  they showed her the rose and the white flower nestling in the evergreens .  the children came and stood in wonder before the rude flowers .  how wonderful they were .  where could they have come from .   the face of the little girl was more patient than before .  the eyes seemed more tender  and yet not so sad .  perhaps the glad sun  the same good sun that had looked upon that far away tomb from which the stone had rolled  whispered to her  as it played about her face  how soon the stone would roll from her life  how soon she would forget all her care and trouble  and enter the land of sunshine and flowers .  it may be that the good old christmas sun even hunted out poor despised pete  and told him something of its happiness .  i am sure he deserved it .  let us hope so at any rate .                my christmas dinner .   it was on the twentieth of december last that i received an invitation from my friend  mr .  phiggins  to dine with him in mark lane  on christmas day .  i had several reasons for declining this proposition .  the first was that mr .  p .  makes it a rule  at all these festivals  to empty the entire contents of his counting house into his little dining parlor  and you consequently sit down to dinner with six white waistcoated clerks  let loose upon a turkey .  the second was that i am not sufficiently well read in cotton and sugar  to enter with any spirit into the subject of conversation .  and the third was  and is  that i never drink cape wine .  but by far the most prevailing reason remains to be told .  i had been anticipating for some days  and was hourly in the hope of receiving  an invitation to spend my christmas day in a most irresistible quarter .  i was expecting  indeed  the felicity of eating plum pudding with an angel  and  on the strength of my imaginary engagement  i returned a polite note to mr .  p .   reducing him to the necessity of advertising for another candidate for cape and turkey .   the twenty first came .  another invitation  to dine with a regiment of roast beef eaters  at clapham .  i declined this also  for the above reason  and for one other  viz .   that  on dining there ten christmas days ago  it was discovered  on sitting down  that one little accompaniment of the roast beef had been entirely overlooked .  would it be believed .   but i will not stay to mystify  i merely mention the fact .  they had forgotten the horseradish .   the next day arrived  and with it a neat epistle  sealed with violet colored wax  from upper brook street .   dine with the ladies  at home on christmas day .   very tempting  it is true  but not exactly the letter i was longing for .  i began  however  to debate within myself upon the policy of securing this bird in hand  instead of waiting for the two that were still hopping about the bush  when the consultation was suddenly brought to a close  by a prophetic view of the portfolio of drawings fresh from boarding school  moths and roses on embossed paper   to say nothing of the album  in which i stood engaged to write an elegy on a java sparrow  that had been the favorite in the family for three days .  i rung for gilt edged  pleaded a world of polite regret  and again declined .   the twenty third dawned  time was getting on rather rapidly  but no card came .  i began to despair of any more invitations  and to repent of my refusals .  breakfast was hardly over  however  when the servant brought up  not a letter  but an aunt and a brace of cousins from bayswater .  they would listen to no excuse  consanguinity required me  and christmas was not my own .  now my cousins kept no albums  they are really as pretty as cousins can be  and when violent hands  with white kid gloves  are laid on one  it is sometimes difficult to effect an escape with becoming elegance .  i could not  however  give up my darling hope of a pleasanter prospect .  they fought with me in fifty engagements  that i pretended to have made .  i showed them the court guide  with ten names obliterated  being those of persons who had not asked me to mince meat and mistletoe  and i ultimately gained my cause by quartering the remains of an infectious fever on the sensitive fears of my aunt  and by dividing a rheumatism and a sprained ankle between my sympathetic cousins .   as soon as they were gone  i walked out  sauntering involuntarily in the direction of the only house in which i felt i could spend a  happy  christmas .  as i approached  a porter brought a large hamper to the door .   a present from the country   thought i   yes  they do dine at home  they must ask me  they know that i am in town .   immediately afterward a servant issued with a letter  he took the nearest way to my lodgings  and i hurried back by another street to receive the so much wished for invitation .  i was in a state of delirious delight .   i arrived  but there was no letter .  i sat down to wait  in a spirit of calmer enjoyment than i had experienced for some days  and in less than half an hour a note was brought to me .  at length  the desired despatch had come  it seemed written on the leaf of a lily with a pen dipped in dew .  i opened it  and had nearly fainted with disappointment .  it was from a stock broker  who begins an anecdote of mr .  rothschild before dinner  and finishes it with the fourth bottle  and who makes his eight children stay up to supper and snap dragon .  in macadamizing a stray stone in one of his periodical puddings  i once lost a tooth  and with it an heiress of some reputation .  i wrote a most irritable apology  and despatched my warmest regards in a whirlwind .   december the twenty fourth  i began to count the hours  and uttered many poetical things about the wings of time .  alack .  no letter came   yes  i received a note from a distinguished dramatist  requesting the honor  etc .  but i was too cunning for this  and practiced wisdom for once .  i happened to reflect that his pantomime was to make its appearance on the night after  and that his object was to perpetrate the whole programme upon me .  regret that i could not have the pleasure of meeting mr .  paulo  and the rest of the literati to be then and there assembled  was of course immediately expressed .   my mind became restless and agitated .  i felt  amidst all these invitations  cruelly neglected .  they served  indeed  but to increase my uneasiness  as they opened prospects of happiness in which i could take no share .  they discovered a most tempting dessert  composed of forbidden fruit .  i took down  childe harold   and read myself into a sublime contempt of mankind .  i began to perceive that merriment is only malice in disguise  and that the chief cardinal virtue is misanthropy .   i sat  nursing my wrath   till it scorched me  when the arrival of another epistle suddenly charmed me from this state of delicious melancholy and delightful endurance of wrong .  i sickened as i surveyed  and trembled as i opened it .  it was dated      but no matter  it was not the letter .  in such a frenzy as mine  raging to behold the object of my admiration condescend  not to eat a custard  but to render it invisible  to be invited perhaps to a tart fabricated by her own ethereal fingers  with such possibilities before me  how could i think of joining a  friendly party    where i should inevitably sit next to a deaf lady  who had been  when a little girl  patted on the head by wilkes  or my lord north  she could not recollect which  had taken tea with the author of  junius   but had forgotten his name  and who once asked me  whether mr .  munden s monument was in westminster abbey or st .  paul s .    i seized a pen  and presented my compliments .  i hesitated  for the peril of precariousness of my situation flashed on my mind  but hope had still left me a straw to catch at  and i at length succeeded in resisting this late and terrible temptation .   after the first burst of excitement  i sunk into still deeper despondency .  my spirit became a prey to anxiety and remorse .  i could not eat  dinner was removed with unlifted covers .  i went out .  the world seemed to have acquired a new face  nothing was to be seen but raisins and rounds of beef .  i wandered about like lear  i had given up all .  i felt myself grated against the world like a nutmeg .  it grew dark  i sustained a still gloomier shock .  every chance seemed to have expired  and everybody seemed to have a delightful engagement for the next day .  i alone was disengaged  i felt like the last man .  to morrow appeared to have already commenced its career  mankind had anticipated the future   and coming mince pies cast their shadows before .    in this state of desolation and dismay  i called  i could not help it  at the house to which i had so fondly anticipated an invitation  and a welcome .  my protest must here however be recorded  that though i called in the hope of being asked  it was my fixed determination not to avail myself of so protracted a piece of politeness .  no  my triumph would have been to have annihilated them with an engagement made in september  payable three months after date .  with these feelings  i gave an agitated knock  they were stoning the plums  and did not immediately attend .  i rung  how unlike a dinner bell it sounded .  a girl at length made her appearance  and  with a mouthful of citron  informed me that the family had gone to spend their christmas eve in portland place .  i rushed down the steps  i hardly knew whither .  my first impulse was to go to some wharf and inquire what vessels were starting for america .  but it was a cold night  i went home and threw myself on my miserable couch .  in other words  i went to bed .   i dozed and dreamed away the hours till day break .  sometimes i fancied myself seated in a roaring circle  roasting chestnuts at a blazing log  at others  that i had fallen into the serpentine while skating  and that the humane society were piling upon me a pelion  or rather a vesuvius of blankets .  i awoke a little refreshed .  alas .  it was the twenty fifth of the month  it was christmas day .  let the reader  if he possess the imagination of milton  conceive my sensations .   i swallowed an atom of dry toast  nothing could calm the fever of my soul .  i stirred the fire and read zimmermann alternately .  even reason  the last remedy one has recourse to in such cases  came at length to my relief  i argued myself into a philosophic fit .  but  unluckily  just as the lethean tide within me was at its height  my landlady broke in upon my lethargy  and chased away by a single word all the little sprites and pleasures that were acting as my physicians  and prescribing balm for my wounds .  she paid me the usual compliment  and then   do you dine at home to day  sir .   abruptly inquired she .  here was a question .  no spanish inquisitor ever inflicted such complete dismay in so short a sentence .  had she given me a sphynx to expound  a gordian tangle to untwist  had she set me a lesson in algebra  or asked me the way to brobdingnag  had she desired me to show her the north pole  or the meaning of a melodrama   any or all of these i might have accomplished .  but to request me to define my dinner  to inquire into its latitude  to compel me to fathom that sea of appetite which i now felt rushing through my frame  to ask me to dive into futurity  and become the prophet of pies and preserves .   my heart died within me at the impossibility of a reply .   she had repeated the question before i could collect my senses around me .  then  for the first time it occurred to me that  in the event of my having no engagement abroad  my landlady meant to invite me .   there will at least be the two daughters   i whispered to myself   and after all  lucy matthews is a charming girl  and touches the harp divinely .  she has a very small  pretty hand  i recollect  only her fingers are so punctured by the needle  and i rather think she bites her nails .  no  i will not even now give up my hope .  it was yesterday but a straw  to day it is but the thistledown  but i will cling to it to the last moment .  there are still four hours left  they will not dine till six .  one desperate struggle  and the peril is past  let me not be seduced by this last golden apple  and i may yet win my race .   the struggle was made   i should not dine at home .   this was the only phrase left me  for i could not say that  i should dine out .   alas .  that an event should be at the same time so doubtful and so desirable .  i only begged that if any letter arrived  it might be brought to me immediately .   the last plank  the last splinter  had now given way beneath me .  i was floating about with no hope but the chance of something almost impossible .  they had  left me alone   not with my glory  but with an appetite that resembled an avalanche seeking whom it might devour .  i had passed one dinnerless day  and half of another  yet the promised land was as far from sight as ever .  i recounted the chances i had missed .  the dinners i might have enjoyed  passed in a dioramic view before my eyes .  mr .  phiggins and his six clerks  the clapham beef eaters  the charms of upper brook street  my pretty cousins  and the pantomime writer  the stock broker  whose stories one forgets  and the elderly lady who forgets her stories  they all marched by me  a procession of apparitions .  even my landlady s invitation  though unborn  was not forgotten in summing up my sacrifices .  and for what .   four o clock .  hope was perfectly ridiculous .  i had been walking upon the hair bridge over a gulf  and could not get into elysium after all .  i had been catching moonbeams  and running after notes of music .  despair was my only convenient refuge  no chance remained  unless something should drop from the clouds .  in this last particular i was not disappointed  for  on looking up  i perceived a heavy shower of snow  yet i was obliged to venture forth  for being supposed to dine out  i could not of course remain at home .  where to go i knew not  i was like my first father   the world was all before me .   i flung my coat round me  and hurried forth with the feelings of a bandit longing for a stiletto .  at the foot of the stairs  i staggered against two or three smiling rascals  priding themselves upon their punctuality .  they had just arrived  to make the tour of turkey .  how i hated them .   as i rushed by the parlor  a single glance disclosed to me a blazing fire  with lucy and several lovely creatures in a semi circle .  fancy  too  gave me a glimpse of a sprig of mistletoe  i vanished from the house  like a spectre at day break .   how long i wandered about is doubtful .  at last i happened to look through a kitchen window  with an area in front  and saw a villain with a fork in his hand  throwing himself back in his chair choked with ecstasy .  another was feasting with a graver air  he seemed to be swallowing a bit of paradise  and criticising its flavor .  this was too much for mortality  my appetite fastened upon me like an alligator .  i darted from the spot  and only a few yards further discerned a house with rather an elegant exterior  and with some ham in the window that looked perfectly sublime .  there was no time for consideration  to hesitate was to perish .  i entered  it was indeed  a banquet hall deserted .   the very waiters had gone home to their friends .  there  however  i found a fire  and there  to sum up all my folly and felicity in a single word  i dined .              the poor traveler .   by charles dickens .    dickens  introduction to this story describes his going to rochester on christmas eve and seeing there a quaint old charity  which provided for the entertainment of  six poor travelers who not being rogues or proctors might receive gratis for one night lodging  entertainment and fourpence each .   in honor of the day a special meal is provided for the travelers then in the charity .  after the meal  when the travelers have gathered around the fire  their entertainer gives them the reason for the unwonted feast as  christmas eve  my friends  when the shepherds  who were poor travelers  too  in their way  heard the angels sing   on earth  peace  good will toward men .    then each traveler was invited to relate a story  and among those told was the following .    in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety nine  a relative of mine came limping down  on foot  to the town of chatham .  he was a poor traveler  with not a farthing in his pocket .   my relative came down to chatham to enlist in a cavalry regiment  if a cavalry regiment would have him  if not  to take king george s shilling from any corporal or sergeant who would put a bunch of ribbons in his hat .  his object was to get shot  but he thought he might as well ride to death as be at the trouble of walking .   my relative s christian name was richard  but he was better known as dick .  he dropped his own surname on the road down  and took up that of doubledick .  he was passed as richard doubledick  age  twenty two  height  five foot ten  native place  exmouth  which he had never been near in his life .  there was no cavalry in chatham when he limped over the bridge with half a shoe to his dusty feet  so he enlisted into a regiment of the line  and was glad to get drunk and forget all about it .   you are to know that this relative of mine had gone wrong  and run wild .  his heart was in the right place  but it was sealed up .  he had been betrothed to a good and beautiful girl  whom he had loved better than she  or perhaps even he  believed  but in an evil hour he had given her cause to say to him solemnly   richard  i will never marry any other man .  i will live single for your sake  but mary marshall s lips   her name was mary marshall   never address another word to you on earth .  go  richard .  heaven forgive you .   this finished him .  this brought him down to chatham .  this made him private richard doubledick  with a determination to be shot .   there was not a more dissipated and reckless soldier in chatham barracks  in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety nine  than private richard doubledick .  he associated with the dregs of every regiment  he was as seldom sober as he could be  and was constantly under punishment .  it became clear to the whole barracks that private richard doubledick would very soon be flogged .   now the captain of richard doubledick s company was a young gentleman not above five years his senior  whose eyes had an expression in them which affected private richard doubledick in a very remarkable way .  they were bright  handsome  dark eyes   what are called laughing eyes generally  and  when serious  rather steady than severe   but they were the only eyes now left in his narrowed world that private richard doubledick could not stand .  unabashed by evil report and punishment  defiant of everything else and everybody else  he had but to know that those eyes looked at him for a moment  and he felt ashamed .  he could not so much as salute captain taunton in the street like any other officer .  he was reproached and confused   troubled by the mere possibility of the captain s looking at him .  in his worst moments  he would rather turn back  and go any distance out of his way  than encounter those two handsome  dark  bright eyes .   one day  when private richard doubledick came out of the black hole  where he had been passing the last eight and forty hours  and in which retreat he spent a good deal of his time  he was ordered to betake himself to captain taunton s quarters .  in the stale and squalid state of a man just out of the black hole  he had less fancy than ever for being seen by the captain  but he was not so mad yet as to disobey orders  and consequently went up to the terrace overlooking the parade ground  where the officers  quarters were  twisting and breaking in his hands  as he went along  a bit of the straw that had formed the decorative furniture of the black hole .    come in .   cried the captain  when he knocked with his knuckles at the door .  private richard doubledick pulled off his cap  took a stride forward  and felt very conscious that he stood in the light of the dark  bright eyes .   there was a slight pause .  private richard doubledick had put the straw in his mouth  and was gradually doubling it up into his windpipe and choking himself .    doubledick   said the captain   do you know where you are going to .     to the devil  sir   faltered doubledick .    yes   returned the captain .   and very fast .    private richard doubledick turned the straw of the black hole in his mouth  and made a miserable salute of acquiescence .    doubledick   said the captain   since i entered his majesty s service  a boy of seventeen  i have been pained to see many men of promise going that road  but i have never been so pained to see a man determined to make the shameful journey as i have been  ever since you joined the regiment  to see you .    private richard doubledick began to find a film stealing over the floor at which he looked  also to find the legs of the captain s breakfast table turning crooked  as if he saw them through water .    i am only a common soldier  sir   said he .   it signifies very little what such a poor brute comes to .     you are a man   returned the captain  with grave indignation   of education and superior advantages  and if you say that  meaning what you say  you have sunk lower than i had believed .  how low that must be  i leave you to consider  knowing what i know of your disgrace  and seeing what i see .     i hope to get shot soon  sir   said private richard doubledick   and then the regiment and the world together will be rid of me .    the legs of the table were becoming very crooked .  doubledick  looking up to steady his vision  met the eyes that had so strong an influence over him .  he put his hand before his own eyes  and the breast of his disgrace jacket swelled as if it would fly asunder .    i would rather   said the young captain   see this in you  doubledick  than i would see five thousand guineas counted out upon this table for a gift to my good mother .  have you a mother .     i am thankful to say she is dead  sir .     if your praises   returned the captain   were sounded from mouth to mouth through the whole regiment  through the whole army  through the whole country  you would wish she had lived to say  with pride and joy   he is my son .      spare me  sir   said doubledick .   she would never have heard any good of me .  she would never have had any pride and joy in owning herself my mother .  love and compassion she might have had  and would have always had  i know  but not  spare me  sir .  i am a broken wretch  quite at your mercy .   and he turned his face to the wall  and stretched out his imploring hand .    my friend    began the captain .    god bless you  sir .   sobbed private richard doubledick .   i have heard from private richard doubledick s own lips  that he dropped down upon his knee  kissed that officer s hand  arose  and went out of the light of the dark  bright eyes  an altered man .   in that year  one thousand seven hundred and ninety nine  the french were in egypt  in italy  in germany  where not .  napoleon bonaparte had likewise begun to stir against england in india  and most men could read the signs of the great troubles that were coming on .  in the very next year  when we formed an alliance with austria against him .  captain taunton s regiment was on service in india .  and there was not a finer non commissioned officer in it   no  nor in the whole line   than corporal richard doubledick .              in eighteen hundred and one  the indian army were on the coast of egypt .  next year was the year of the proclamation of the short peace  and they were recalled .  it had then become well known to thousands of men  that wherever captain taunton  with the dark  bright eyes  led  there  close to him  ever at his side  firm as a rock  true as the sun  and brave as mars  would be certain to be found  while life beat in their hearts  that famous soldier  sergeant richard doubledick .   eighteen hundred and five  besides being the great year of trafalgar  was a year of hard fighting in india .  that year saw such wonders done by a sergeant major  who cut his way single handed through a solid mass of men  recovered the colors of his regiment  which had been seized from the hand of a poor boy shot through the heart  and rescued his wounded captain  who was down  and in a very jungle of horses  hoofs and sabres   saw such wonders done  i say  by this brave sergeant major  that he was specially made the bearer of the colors he had won  and ensign richard doubledick had risen from the ranks .   sorely cut up in every battle  but always reinforced by the bravest of men   for the fame of following the old colors  shot through and through  which ensign richard doubledick had saved  inspired all breasts   this regiment fought its way through the peninsular war  up to the investment of badajos in eighteen hundred and twelve .  again and again it had been cheered through the british ranks until the tears had sprung into men s eyes at the mere hearing of the mighty british voice  so exultant in their valor  and there was not a drummer boy but knew the legend  that wherever the two friends  major taunton  with the dark  bright eyes  and ensign richard doubledick  who was devoted to him  were seen to go  there the boldest spirits in the english army became wild to follow .   one day  at badajos   not in the great storming  but in repelling a hot sally of the besieged upon our men at work in the trenches  who had given way   the two officers found themselves hurrying forward  face to face  against a party of french infantry  who made a stand .  there was an officer at their head  encouraging his men   a courageous  handsome  gallant officer of five and thirty  whom doubledick saw hurriedly  almost momentarily  but saw well .  he particularly noticed this officer waving his sword  and rallying his men with an eager and excited cry  when they fired in obedience to his gesture  and major taunton dropped .   it was over in ten minutes more  and doubledick returned to the spot where he had laid the best friend man ever had  on a coat spread upon the wet clay .  major taunton s uniform was opened at the breast  and on his shirt were three little spots of blood .    dear doubledick   said he   i am dying .     for the love of heaven  no .   exclaimed the other  kneeling down beside him  and passing his arm round his neck to raise his head .   taunton .  my preserver  my guardian angel  my witness .  dearest  truest  kindest of human beings .  taunton .  for god s sake .    the bright  dark eyes  so very  very dark  now  in the pale face  smiled upon him  and the hand he had kissed thirteen years ago laid itself fondly on his breast .    write to my mother .  you will see home again .  tell her how we became friends .  it will comfort her  as it comforts me .    he spoke no more  but faintly signed for a moment toward his hair as it fluttered in the wind .  the ensign understood him .  he smiled again when he saw that  and  gently turning his face over on the supporting arm as if for rest  died  with his hand upon the breast in which he had revived a soul .   no dry eye looked on ensign richard doubledick that melancholy day .  he buried his friend on the field  and became a lone  bereaved man .  beyond his duty he appeared to have but two remaining cares in life   one  to preserve the little packet of hair he was to give to taunton s mother  the other  to encounter that french officer who had rallied the men under whose fire taunton fell .  a new legend now began to circulate among our troops  and it was  that when he and the french officer came face to face once more  there would be weeping in france .   the war went on  and through it went the exact picture of the french officer on the one side  and the bodily reality upon the other  until the battle of toulouse was fought .  in the returns sent home appeared these words   severely wounded  but not dangerously  lieutenant richard doubledick .    at midsummer time  in the year eighteen hundred and fourteen  lieutenant richard doubledick  now a browned soldier  seven and thirty years of age  came home to england invalided .  he brought the hair with him  near his heart .  many a french officer had he seen since that day  many a dreadful night  in searching with men and lanterns for his wounded  had he relieved french officers lying disabled  but the mental picture and the reality had never come together .   though he was weak and suffered pain  he lost not an hour in getting down to frome in somersetshire  where taunton s mother lived .  in the sweet  compassionate words that naturally present themselves to the mind to night   he was the only son of his mother  and she was a widow .    it was a sunday evening  and the lady sat at her quiet garden window  reading the bible  reading to herself  in a trembling voice  that very passage in it  as i have heard him tell .  he heard the words   young man  i say unto thee  arise .    he had to pass the window  and the bright  dark eyes of his debased time seemed to look at him .  her heart told her who he was  she came to the door quickly  and fell upon his neck .    he saved me from ruin  made me a human creature  won me from infamy and shame .  o god  forever bless him .  as he will  he will .     he will .   the lady answered .   i know he is in heaven .   then she piteously cried   but o my darling boy  my darling boy .    never from the hour when private richard doubledick enlisted at chatham had the private  corporal  sergeant  sergeant major  ensign  or lieutenant breathed his right name  or the name of mary marshall  or a word of the story of his life  into any ear except his reclaimer s .  that previous scene in his existence was closed .  he had firmly resolved that his expiation should be to live unknown  to disturb no more the peace that had long grown over his old offences  to let it be revealed  when he was dead  that he had striven and suffered  and had never forgotten  and then  if they could forgive him and believe him  well  it would be time enough  time enough .   but that night  remembering the words he had cherished for two years   tell her how we became friends .  it will comfort her  as it comforts me   he related everything .  it gradually seemed to him as if in his maturity he had recovered a mother  it gradually seemed to her as if in her bereavement she had found a son .  during his stay in england  the quiet garden into which he had slowly and painfully crept  a stranger  became the boundary of his home  when he was able to rejoin his regiment in the spring  he left the garden  thinking was this indeed the first time he had ever turned his face toward the old colors with a woman s blessing .   he followed them  so ragged  so scarred and pierced now  that they would scarcely hold together  to quatre bras and ligny .  he stood beside them  in an awful stillness of many men  shadowy through the mist and drizzle of a wet june forenoon  on the field of waterloo .  and down to that hour the picture in his mind of the french officer had never been compared with the reality .   the famous regiment was in action early in the battle  and received its first check in many an eventful year  when he was seen to fall .  but it swept on to avenge him  and left behind it no such creature in the world of consciousness as lieutenant richard doubledick .   through pits of mire and pools of rain  along deep ditches  once roads  that were pounded and ploughed to pieces by artillery  heavy wagons  tramp of men and horses  and the struggle of every wheeled thing that could carry wounded soldiers  jolted among the dying and the dead  so disfigured by blood and mud as to be hardly recognizable for humanity  dead  as to any sentient life that was in it  and yet alive   the form that had been lieutenant richard doubledick  with whose praises england rang  was conveyed to brussels .  there it was tenderly laid down in hospital  and there it lay  week after week  through the long  bright summer days  until the harvest  spared by war  had ripened and was gathered in .   slowly laboring  at last  through a long  heavy dream of confused time and place  presenting faint glimpses of army surgeons whom he knew  and of faces that had been familiar to his youth   dearest and kindest among them  mary marshall s  with a solicitude upon it more like reality than anything he could discern   lieutenant richard doubledick came back to life .  to the beautiful life of a calm autumn evening sunset  to the peaceful life of a fresh  quiet room with a large window standing open  a balcony beyond  in which were moving leaves and sweet smelling flowers  beyond  again  the clear sky  with the sun full in his sight  pouring its golden radiance on his bed .   it was so tranquil and so lovely that he thought he had passed into another world .  and he said in a faint voice   taunton  are you near me .    a face bent over him .  not his  his mother s .    i came to nurse you .  we have nursed you many weeks .  you were moved here long ago .  do you remember nothing .     nothing .    the lady kissed his cheek  and held his hand  soothing him .    where is the regiment .  what has happened .  let me call you mother .  what has happened  mother .     a great victory  dear .  the war is over  and the regiment was the bravest in the field .    his eyes kindled  his lips trembled  he sobbed  and the tears ran down his face .  he was very weak  too weak to move his hand .   from that time  he recovered .  slowly  for he had been desperately wounded in the head  and had been shot in the body  but making some little advance every day .  when he had gained sufficient strength to converse as he lay in bed  he soon began to remark that mrs .  taunton always brought him back to his own history .  then he recalled his preserver s dying words  and thought   it comforts her .    one day he awoke out of a sleep  refreshed  and asked her to read to him .  but the curtain of the bed  softening the light  which she always drew back when he awoke  that she might see him from her table at the bedside where she sat at work  was held undrawn  and a woman s voice spoke  which was not hers .    can you bear to see a stranger .   it said softly .   will you like to see a stranger .     stranger .   he repeated .  the voice awoke old memories  before the days of private richard doubledick .    a stranger now  but not a stranger once   it said in tones that thrilled him .   richard  dear richard  lost through so many years  my name     he cried out her name  mary   and she held him in her arms  and his head lay on her bosom .              well .  they were happy .  it was a long recovery  but they were happy through it all .  the snow had melted on the ground  and the birds were singing in the leafless thickets of the early spring  when those three were first able to ride out together  and when people flocked about the open carriage to cheer and congratulate captain richard doubledick .   but even then it became necessary for the captain  instead of returning to england  to complete his recovery in the climate of southern france .  they found a spot upon the rh  ne  within a ride of the old town of avignon  and within view of its broken bridge  which was all they could desire  they lived there  together  six months  then returned to england .  mrs .  taunton  growing old after three years  though not so old as that her bright  dark eyes were dimmed  and remembering that her strength had been benefited by the change  resolved to go back for a year to those parts .  so she went with a faithful servant  who had often carried her son in his arms  and she was to be rejoined and escorted home  at the year s end  by captain richard doubledick .   she wrote regularly to her children  as she called them now   and they to her .  she went to the neighborhood of aix  and there  in their own ch  teau near the farmer s house she rented  she grew into intimacy with a family belonging to that part of france .  the intimacy began in her often meeting among the vineyards a pretty child  a girl with a most compassionate heart  who was never tired of listening to the solitary english lady s stories of her poor son and the cruel wars .  the family were as gentle as the child  and at length she came to know them so well that she accepted their invitation to pass the last month of her residence abroad under their roof .  all this intelligence she wrote home  piecemeal as it came about  from time to time  and at last enclosed a polite note  from the head of the ch  teau  soliciting  on the occasion of his approaching mission to that neighborhood  the honor of the company of that man so justly celebrated  captain richard doubledick .   captain doubledick  now a hardy  handsome man in the full vigor of life  broader across the chest and shoulders than he had ever been before  dispatched a courteous reply  and followed it in person .  traveling through all that extent of country after three years of peace  he blessed the better days on which the world had fallen .  the corn was golden  not drenched in unnatural red  was bound in sheaves for food  not trodden underfoot by men in mortal fight .  the smoke rose up from peaceful hearths  not blazing ruins .  the carts were laden with the fair fruits of the earth  not with wounds and death .  to him who had so often seen the terrible reverse  these things were beautiful indeed  and they brought him in a softened spirit to the old ch  teau near aix upon a deep blue evening .   it was a large ch  teau of the genuine old ghostly kind  with round towers  and extinguishers  and a high leaden roof  and more windows than aladdin s palace .  the entrance doors stood open  as doors often do in that country when the heat of the day is past  and the captain saw no bell or knocker  and walked in .   he walked into a lofty stone hall  refreshingly cool and gloomy after the glare of a southern day s travel .  extending along the four sides of this hall was a gallery  leading to suites of rooms  and it was lighted from the top .  still no bell was to be seen .    faith   said the captain  halting  ashamed of the clanking of his boots   this is a ghostly beginning .    he started back  and felt his face turn white .  in the gallery  looking down at him  stood the french officer  the officer whose picture he had carried in his mind so long and so far .  compared with the original  at last  in every lineament how like it was .   he moved and disappeared  and captain richard doubledick heard his steps coming quickly down into the hall .  he entered through an archway .  there was a bright  sudden look upon his face  much such a look as it had worn in that fatal moment .   monsieur le capitaine richard doubledick .  enchanted to receive him .    he has not remembered me  as i have remembered him  he did not take such a note of my face  that day  as i took of his   thought captain richard doubledick .   how shall i tell him .     you were at waterloo   said the french officer .    i was   said captain richard doubledick .   and at badajos .    left alone with the sound of his own stern voice in his ears  he sat down to consider .  what shall i do  and how shall i tell him .  at that time  unhappily  many deplorable duels had been fought between english and french officers arising out of the recent war  and these duels  and how to avoid this officer s hospitality  were the uppermost thought in captain richard doubledick s mind .    his mother  above all   the captain thought .   how shall i tell her .     spirit of my departed friend   said he   is it through thee these better thoughts are rising in my mind .  is it thou who hast shown me  all the way i have drawn to meet this man  the blessings of the altered time .  is it thou who hast sent thy stricken mother to me  to stay my angry hand .  is it from thee the whisper comes  that this man did his duty as thou didst   and as i did  through thy guidance  which has wholly saved me here on earth   and that he did no more .    he sat down  with his head buried in his hands  and  when he rose up  made the second strong resolution in his life   that neither to the french officer  nor to the mother of his departed friend  nor to any soul  while either of the two was living  would he breathe what only he knew .  and when he touched that french officer s glass with his own  that day at dinner  he secretly forgave him in the name of the divine forgiver of injuries .              the legend of the christmas tree .   most children have seen a christmas tree  and many know that the pretty and pleasant custom of hanging gifts on its boughs comes from germany  but perhaps few have heard or read the story that is told to little german children  respecting the origin of this custom .  the story is called  the little stranger   and runs thus   in a small cottage on the borders of a forest lived a poor laborer  who gained a scanty living by cutting wood .  he had a wife and two children who helped him in his work .  the boy s name was valentine  and the girl was called mary .  they were obedient  good children  and a great comfort to their parents .  one winter evening  this happy little family were sitting quietly round the hearth  the snow and the wind raging outside  while they ate their supper of dry bread  when a gentle tap was heard on the window  and a childish voice cried from without   oh  let me in  pray .  i am a poor little child  with nothing to eat  and no home to go to  and i shall die of cold and hunger unless you let me in .    valentine and mary jumped up from the table and ran to open the door  saying   come in  poor little child .  we have not much to give you  but whatever we have we will share with you .    the stranger child came in and warmed his frozen hands and feet at the fire  and the children gave him the best they had to eat  saying   you must be tired  too  poor child .  lie down on our bed  we can sleep on the bench for one night .    then said the little stranger child   thank god for all your kindness to me .    so they took their little guest into their sleeping room  laid him on the bed  covered him over  and said to each other   how thankful we ought to be .  we have warm rooms and a cozy bed  while this poor child has only heaven for his roof and the cold earth for his sleeping place .    when their father and mother went to bed  mary and valentine lay quite contentedly on the bench near the fire  saying  before they fell asleep   the stranger child will be so happy to night in his warm bed .    these kind children had not slept many hours before mary awoke and softly whispered to her brother   valentine  dear  wake  and listen to the sweet music under the window .    then valentine rubbed his eyes and listened .  it was sweet music indeed  and sounded like beautiful voices singing to the tones of a harp    o holy child  we greet thee .  bringing sweet strains of harp to aid our singing .    thou  holy child  in peace art sleeping  while we our watch without are keeping .    blest be the house wherein thou liest .  happiest on earth  to heaven the highest .    the children listened  while a solemn joy filled their hearts  then they stepped softly to the window to see who might be without .   in the east was a streak of rosy dawn  and in its light they saw a group of children standing before the house  clothed in silver garments  holding golden harps in their hands .  amazed at this sight  the children were still gazing out of the window  when a light tap caused them to turn round .  there stood the stranger child before them clad in a golden dress  with a gleaming radiance round his curling hair .   i am the little christ child   he said   who wanders through the world bringing peace and happiness to good children .  you took me in and cared for me when you thought me a poor child  and now you shall have my blessing for what you have done .    a fir tree grew near the house  and from this he broke a twig  which he planted in the ground  saying   this twig shall become a tree  and shall bring forth fruit year by year for you .    no sooner had he done this than he vanished  and with him the little choir of angels .  but the fir branch grew and became a christmas tree  and on its branches hung golden apples and silver nuts every christmas tide .   such is the story told to german children concerning their beautiful christmas trees  though we know that the real little christ child can never be wandering  cold and homeless  again in our world  inasmuch as he is safe in heaven by his father s side  yet we may gather from this story the same truth which the bible plainly tells us  that any one who helps a christian child in distress  it will be counted unto him as if he had indeed done it unto christ himself .   inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren  ye have done it unto me .               the peace egg .   by juliana horatia ewing .   every one ought to be happy at christmas .  but there are many things which ought to be  and yet are not  and people are sometimes sad even in the christmas holidays .   the captain and his wife were sad  though it was christmas eve .  sad  though they were in the prime of life  blessed with good health  devoted to each other and to their children  with competent means  a comfortable house on a little freehold property of their own  and  one might say  everything that heart could desire .  sad  though they were good people  whose peace of mind had a firmer foundation than their earthly goods alone  contented people  too  with plenty of occupation for mind and body .  sad  and in the nursery this was held to be past all reason  though the children were performing that ancient and most entertaining play or christmas mystery  known as  the peace egg   for their benefit and behoof alone .   the play was none the worse that most of the actors were too young to learn parts  so that there was very little of the rather tedious dialogue  only plenty of dress and ribbons  and of fighting with the wooden swords .  but though robert  the eldest of the five children  looked bonny enough to warm any father s heart  as he marched up and down with an air learned by watching many a parade in barrack square and drill ground  and though nicholas did not cry in spite of falling hard  and dora  who took the part of the doctor  treading accidentally on his little finger in picking him up  still the captain and his wife sighed nearly as often as they smiled  and the mother dropped tears as well as pennies into the cap which tom  as the king of egypt  brought round after the performance .   ii .   many  many years back the captain s wife had been a child herself  and had laughed to see the village mummers act  the peace egg   and had been quite happy on christmas eve .  happy  though she had no mother .  happy  though her father was a stern man  very fond of his only child  but with an obstinate will that not even she dared thwart .  she had lived to thwart it  and he had never forgiven her .  it was when she married the captain .  the old man had a prejudice against soldiers  which was quite reason enough  in his opinion  for his daughter to sacrifice the happiness of her future life by giving up the soldier she loved .  at last he gave her her choice between the captain and his own favor and money .  she chose the captain  and was disowned and disinherited .   the captain bore a high character  and was a good and clever officer  but that went for nothing against the old man s whim .  he made a very good husband too  but even this did not move his father in law  who had never held any intercourse with him or his wife since the day of their marriage  and who had never seen his own grand children .   amid the ups and downs of their wanderings  the discomforts of shipboard and of stations in the colonies  bad servants  and unwonted sicknesses  the captain s tenderness never failed .  if the life was rough the captain was ready .  he had been  by turns  in one strait or another  sick nurse  doctor  carpenter  nursemaid and cook to his family  and had  moreover  an idea that nobody filled these offices quite so well as himself .  withal  his very profession kept him neat  well dressed  and active .  in the roughest of their ever changing quarters he was a smart man  and never changed his manner from that of the lover of his wife s young days .   as years went and children came  the captain and his wife grew tired of traveling .  new scenes were small comfort when they heard of the death of old friends .  one foot of the dear  old  dull home sky was dearer  after all  than miles of the unclouded heavens of the south .  the grey hills and over grown lanes of her old home haunted the captain s wife by night and day  and home sickness  that weariest of all sicknesses  began to take the light out of her eyes before their time .  it preyed upon the captain too .  now and then he would say  fretfully   i should like a resting place in our own country  however small  before everybody is dead .  but the children s prospects have to be considered .   the continued estrangement from the old man was an abiding sorrow also  and they had hopes that  if only they could get home  he might be persuaded to peace and charity this time .   at last they were sent home .  but the hard old father still would not relent .  he returned their letters unopened .  this bitter disappointment made the captain s wife so ill that she almost died  and in one month the captain s hair became iron gray .  he reproached himself for having ever taken the daughter from her father   to kill her at last   as he said .  and  thinking of his own children  he even reproached himself for having robbed the old widower of his only child .  after two years at home his regiment was ordered again on foreign duty .  he failed to effect an exchange  and they prepared to move once more  from chatham to calcutta .  never before had the packing to which she was so well accustomed  been so bitter a task to the captain s wife .   it was at the darkest hour of this gloomy time that the captain came in  waving above his head a letter which changed all their plans .   now close by the old home of the captain s wife there had lived a man  much older than herself  who yet had loved her with a devotion as great as that of the young captain .  she never knew it  for when he saw that she had given her heart to his younger rival  he kept silence  and he never asked for what he knew he might have had  the old man s authority in his favor .  so generous was the affection which he could never conquer  that he constantly tried to reconcile the father to his children whilst he lived  and  when he died  he bequeathed his house and small estate to the woman he had loved .    it will be a legacy of peace   he thought  on his death bed .   the old man cannot hold out when she and her children are constantly in sight .  and it may please god that i shall know of the reunion i have not been permitted to see with my eyes .    and thus it came about that the captain s regiment went to india without him  and that the captain s wife and her father lived on opposite sides of the same road .   iii .   the eldest of the captain s children was a boy .  he was named robert  after his grandfather  and seemed to have inherited a good deal of the old gentleman s character  mixed with gentler traits .  he was a fair  fine boy  tall and stout for his age  with the captain s regular features  and  he flattered himself  the captain s firm step and martial bearing .  he was apt  like his grandfather  to hold his own will to be other people s law  and  happily for the peace of the nursery  this opinion was devoutly shared by his brother nicholas .  though the captain had left the army  robin continued to command an irregular force of volunteers in the nursery  and never was colonel more despotic .  his brothers and sisters were by turn infantry  cavalry  engineers  and artillery  according to his whim .   the captain alone was a match for his strong willed son .    if you please  sir   said sarah  one morning  flouncing in upon the captain  just as he was about to start for the neighboring town    if you please  sir  i wish you d speak to master robert .  he s past my powers .     i ve no doubt of it   thought the captain  but he only said   well  what s the matter .     night after night do i put him to bed   said sarah   and night after night does he get up as soon as i m out of the room  and says he s orderly officer for the evening  and goes about in his night shirt and his feet as bare as boards .    the captain fingered his heavy moustache to hide a smile  but he listened patiently to sarah s complaints .    it ain t so much him i should mind  sir   she continued   but he goes round the beds and wakes up the other young gentlemen and miss dora  one after another  and when i speak to him  he gives me all the sauce he can lay his tongue to  and says he s going round the guards .  the other night i tried to put him back in his bed  but he got away and ran all over the house  me hunting him everywhere  and not a sign of him  till he jumps out on me from the garret stairs and nearly knocks me down .   i ve visited the outposts  sarah   says he   all s well .   and off he goes to bed as bold as brass .     have you spoken to your mistress .   asked the captain .    yes  sir   said sarah .   and missis spoke to him  and he promised not to go round the guards again .     has he broken his promise .   asked the captain  with a look of anger  and also of surprise .    when i opened the door last night  sir   continued sarah  in her shrill treble   what should i see in the dark but master robert a walking up and down with the carpet brush stuck in his arm .   who goes there .   says he .   you awdacious boy .   says i   didn t you promise your ma you d leave off them tricks .    i m not going round the guards   says he   i promised not .  but i m for sentry duty to night .   and say what i would to him  all he had for me was   you mustn t speak to a sentry on duty .   so i says   as sure as i live till morning  i ll go to your pa   for he pays no more attention to his ma than to me  nor to any one else .     please to see that the bed is taken out of my dressing room   said the captain .   i will attend to master robert .    with this sarah had to content herself  and she went back to the nursery .  robert was nowhere to be seen  and made no reply to her summons .  on this the unwary nursemaid flounced into the bed room to look for him  when robert  who was hidden beneath a table  darted forth  and promptly locked her in .    you re under arrest   he shouted  through the keyhole .    let me out .   shrieked sarah .    i ll send a file of the guard to fetch you to the orderly room  by and by   said robert   for  preferring frivolous complaints .    and he departed to the farmyard to look at the ducks .   that night  when robert went up to bed  the captain quietly locked him into his dressing room  from which the bed had been removed .    you re for sentry duty  to night   said the captain .   the carpet brush is in the corner .  good evening .    as his father anticipated  robert was soon tired of the sentry game in these new circumstances  and long before the night had half worn away he wished himself safely undressed and in his own comfortable bed .  at half past twelve o clock he felt as if he could bear it no longer  and knocked at the captain s door .    who goes there .   said the captain .    mayn t i go to bed  please .   whined poor robert .    certainly not   said the captain .   you re on duty .    and on duty poor robert had to remain  for the captain had a will as well as his son .  so he rolled himself up in his father s railway rug  and slept on the floor .   the next night he was very glad to go quietly to bed  and remain there .   iv .   the captain s children sat at breakfast in a large  bright nursery .  it was the room where the old bachelor had died  and now her children made it merry .  this was just what he would have wished .   they all sat round the table  for it was breakfast time .  there were five of them  and five bowls of boiled bread and milk smoked before them .  sarah  a foolish  gossiping girl  who acted as nurse till better could be found  was waiting on them  and by the table sat darkie  the black retriever  his long  curly back swaying slightly from the difficulty of holding himself up  and his solemn hazel eyes fixed very intently on each and all of the breakfast bowls .  he was as silent and sagacious as sarah was talkative and empty headed .  though large  he was unassuming .  pax  the pug  on the contrary  who came up to the first joint of darkie s leg  stood defiantly on his dignity  and his short stumps  .  he always placed himself in front of the bigger dog  and made a point of hustling him in doorways and of going first downstairs .   robert s tongue was seldom idle  even at meals .   sarah  who is that tall old gentleman at church  in the seat near the pulpit .   he asked .   he wears a cloak like what the blues wear  only all blue  and is tall enough for a life guardsman .  he stood when we were kneeling down  and said  almighty and most merciful father  louder than anybody .    sarah knew who the old gentleman was  and knew also that the children did not know  and that their parents did not see fit to tell them as yet .  but she had a passion for telling and hearing news  and would rather gossip with a child than not gossip at all .   never you mind  master robin   she said  nodding sagaciously .   little boys aren t to know everything .     ah  then  i know you don t know   replied robert   if you did  you d tell .     i do   said sarah .    you don t   said robin .    your ma s forbid you to contradict  master robin   said sarah   and if you do i shall tell her .  i know well enough who the old gentleman is  and perhaps i might tell you  only you d go straight off and tell again .     no  no  i wouldn t .   shouted robin .   i can keep a secret  indeed i can .  pinch my little finger  and try .  do  do tell me  sarah  there s a dear sarah  and then i shall know you know .   and he danced round her  catching at her skirts .   to keep a secret was beyond sarah s powers .    do let my dress be  master robin   she said   you re ripping out all the gathers  and listen while i whisper .  as sure as you re a living boy  that gentleman s your own grandpapa .    robin lost his hold on sarah s dress  his arms fell by his side  and he stood with his brows knit for some minutes  thinking .  then he said  emphatically   what lies you do tell  sarah .     oh  robin .   cried nicholas  who had drawn near  his thick curls standing stark with curiosity   mamma said  lies  wasn t a proper word  and you promised not to say it again .     i forgot   said robin   i didn t mean to break my promise .  but she does tell  ahem .   you know what .     you wicked boy .   cried the enraged sarah   how dare you say such a thing  and everybody in the place knows he s your ma s own pa .     i ll go and ask her   said robin  and he was at the door in a moment  but sarah  alarmed by the thought of getting into a scrape herself  caught him by the arm .    don t you go  love  it ll only make your ma angry .  there  it was all my nonsense .     then it s not true .   said robin  indignantly .   what did you tell me so for .     it was all my jokes and nonsense   said the unscrupulous sarah   but your ma wouldn t like to know i ve said such a thing .  and master robert wouldn t be so mean as to tell tales  would he  love .     i m not mean   said robin stoutly   and i don t tell tales  but you do  and you tell you know what  besides .  however  i won t go this time  but i ll tell you what  if you tell tales of me to papa any more  i ll tell him what you said about the old gentleman in the blue cloak .   with which parting threat robin strode off to join his brothers and sisters .   v .   after robert left the nursery he strolled out of doors  and  peeping through the gate at the end of the drive  he saw a party of boys going through what looked like a military exercise with sticks and a good deal of stamping  but  instead of mere words of command  they all spoke by turns  as in a play .  not being at all shy  he joined them  and asked so many questions that he soon got to know all about it .  they were practicing a christmas mumming play  called  the peace egg .   why it was called thus they could not tell him  as there was nothing whatever about eggs in it  and so far from being a play of peace  it was made up of a series of battles between certain valiant knights and princes .  the rehearsal being over  robin went with the boys to the sexton s house  he was father to one of the characters called the  king of egypt   where they showed him the dresses they were to wear .  these were made of gay colored materials  and covered with ribbons  except that of the  black prince of paradine   which was black  as became his title .  the boys also showed him the book from which they learned their parts  and which was to be bought at the post office store .    then are you the mummers who come round at christmas  and act in people s kitchens  and people give them money  that mamma used to tell us about .   said robin .   the boy hesitated a moment and then said   well  i suppose we are .     and do you go out in the snow from one house to another at night  and oh  don t you enjoy it .   cried robin .    we like it well enough   the lad admitted .   robin bought a copy of  the peace egg .   he was resolved to have a nursery performance  and to take the chief part himself .  the others were willing for what he wished  but there were difficulties .  in the first place  there are eight characters in the play  and there were only five children .  they decided among themselves to leave out the  fool   and mamma said that another character was not to be acted by any of them  or indeed mentioned   the little one who comes in at the end   robin explained .  mamma had her reasons  and these were always good .  she had not been altogether pleased that robin had bought the play .  it was a very old thing  she said  and very queer  not adapted for a child s play .  if mamma thought the parts not quite fit for the children to learn  they found them much too long  so in the end she picked out some bits for each  which they learned easily  and which  with a good deal of fighting  made quite as good a story of it as if they had done the whole .  what may have been wanting otherwise was made up for by the dresses  which were charming .   robin was st .  george  nicholas the valiant slasher  dora the doctor  and the other two hector and the king of egypt .   and now we ve no black prince .   cried robin in dismay .    let darkie be the black prince   said nicholas .    when you wave your stick he ll jump for it  and then you can pretend to fight with him .     it s not a stick  it s a sword   said robin .    however  darkie may be the black prince .     and what s pax to be .   asked dora   for you know he will come if darkie does  and he ll run in before everybody else too .     then he must be the fool   said robin   and it will do very well  for the fool comes in before the rest  and pax can have his red coat on  and the collar with the little bells .    vi .   robin thought that christmas would never come .  to the captain and his wife it seemed to come too fast .  they had hoped it might bring reconciliation with the old man  but it seemed they had hoped in vain .   there were times now when the captain almost regretted the old bachelor s bequest .  the familiar scenes of her old home sharpened his wife s grief .  to see her father every sunday in church  with marks of age and infirmity upon him  but with not a look of tenderness for his only child  this tried her sorely .    she felt it less abroad   thought the captain .   a home in which she frets herself to death  is after all  no great boon .    christmas eve came .    i m sure it s quite christmas enough now   said robin .   we ll have  the peace egg  to night .    so as the captain and his wife sat sadly over their fire  the door opened  and pax ran in shaking his bells  and followed by the nursery mummers .  the performance was most successful .  it was by no means pathetic  and yet  as has been said  the captain s wife shed tears .    what is the matter  mamma .   said robert  abruptly dropping his sword and running up to her .    don t tease mamma with questions   said the captain   she is not very well  and rather sad .  we must all be very kind and good to poor dear mamma   and the captain raised his wife s hand to his lips as he spoke .  robin seized the other hand and kissed it tenderly .  he was very fond of his mother .  at this moment pax took a little run  and jumped on to mamma s lap  where  sitting facing the company  he opened his black mouth and yawned  with a ludicrous inappropriateness worthy of any clown .  it made everybody laugh .    and now we ll go and act in the kitchen   said nicholas .    supper at nine o clock  remember   shouted the captain .   and we are going to have real frumenty and yule cakes  such as mamma used to tell us of when we were abroad .     hurray .   shouted the mummers  and they ran off  pax leaping from his seat just in time to hustle the black prince in the doorway .  when the dining room door was shut  robert raised his hand  and said  hush .    the mummers pricked their ears  but there was only a distant harsh and scraping sound  as of stones rubbed together .    they re cleaning the passages   robert went on   and sarah told me they meant to finish the mistletoe  and have everything cleaned up by supper time .  they don t want us  i know .  look here  we ll go real mumming instead .  that will be fun .    nicholas grinned with delight .    but will mamma let us .   he enquired .    oh  it will be all right if we re back by supper time   said robert  hastily .   only of course we must take care not to catch cold .  come and help me to get some wraps .    the old oak chest in which spare shawls  rugs  and coats were kept was soon ransacked  and the mummers  gay dresses hidden by motley wrappers .  but no sooner did darkie and pax behold the coats  etc .   than they at once began to leap and bark  as it was their custom to do when they saw any one dressing to go out .  robin was sorely afraid that this would betray them  but though the captain and his wife heard the barking they did not guess the cause .   so the front door being very gently opened and closed  the nursery mummers stole away .   vii .   it was a very fine night .  the snow was well trodden on the drive  so that it did not wet their feet  but on the trees and shrubs it hung soft and white .    it s much jollier being out at night than in the daytime   said robin .    much   responded nicholas  with intense feeling .    we ll go a wassailing next week   said robin .   i know all about it  and perhaps we shall get a good lot of money  and then we ll buy tin swords with scabbards for next year .  i don t like these sticks .  oh  dear  i wish it wasn t so long between one christmas and another .     where shall we go first .   asked nicholas  as they turned into the high road .    this is the first house   he said .   we ll act here   and all pressed in as quickly as possible .  once safe within the grounds  they shouldered their sticks  and marched with composure .    you re going to the front door   said nicholas .   mummers ought to go to the back .     we don t know where it is   said robin  and he rang the front door bell .  there was a pause .  then lights shone  steps were heard  and at last a sound of much unbarring  unbolting  and unlocking .  it might have been a prison .  then the door was opened by an elderly  timid looking woman  who held a tallow candle above her head .    who s there .   she said   at this time of night .     we re christmas mummers   said robin  stoutly   we didn t know the way to the back door  but        and don t you know better than to come here .   said the woman .   be off with you  as fast as you can .     you re only the servant   said robin .   go and ask your master and mistress if they wouldn t like to see us act .  we do it very well .     you impudent boy  be off with you .   repeated the woman .   master d no more let you nor any other such rubbish set foot in this house        woman .   shouted a voice close behind her  which made her start as if she had been shot   who authorizes you to say what your master will or will not do  before you ve asked him .  the boy is right .  you are the servant  and it is not your business to choose for me whom i shall or shall not see .     i meant no harm  sir  i m sure   said the housekeeper   but i thought you d never        my good woman   said her master   if i had wanted somebody to think for me  you re the last person i should have employed .  i hire you to obey orders  not to think .     i m sure  sir   said the housekeeper  whose only form of argument was reiteration   i never thought you would have seen them        then you were wrong   shouted her master .   i will see them .  bring them in .    he was a tall  gaunt old man  and robin stared at him for some minutes  wondering where he could have seen somebody very like him .  at last he remembered .  it was the old gentleman of the blue cloak .   the children threw off their wraps  the housekeeper helping them  and chattering ceaselessly  from sheer nervousness .    well  to be sure   said she   their dresses are pretty  too .  and they seem quite a better sort of children  they talk quite genteel .  i might ha  knowed they weren t like common mummers  but i was so flusterated hearing the bell go so late  and        are they ready .   said the old man  who had stood like a ghost in the dim light of the flaring tallow candle  grimly watching the proceedings .    yes  sir .  shall i take them to the kitchen  sir .         for you and the other idle hussies to gape and grin at .  no .  bring them to the library   he snapped  and then stalked off  leading the way .   the housekeeper accordingly led them to the library  and then withdrew  nearly falling on her face as she left the room by stumbling over darkie  who slipped in last like a black shadow .   the old man was seated in a carved oak chair by the fire .    i never said the dogs were to come in   he said .    but we can t do without them  please   said robin  boldly .   you see there are eight people in  the peace egg   and there are only five of us  and so darkie has to be the black prince  and pax has to be the fool  and so we have to have them .     five and two make seven   said the old man  with a grim smile   what do you do for the eighth .     oh  that s the little one at the end   said robin  confidently .   mamma said we weren t to mention him  but i think that s because we re children .   you re grown up  you know  so i ll show you the book  and you can see for yourself   he went on  drawing  the peace egg  from his pocket   there  that s the picture of him  on the last page  black  with horns and a tail .    the old man s stern face relaxed into a broad smile as he examined the grotesque woodcut  but when he turned to the first page the smile vanished in a deep frown  and his eyes shone like hot coals with anger .  he had seen robin s name .    who sent you here .   he asked  in a hoarse voice .   speak  and speak the truth .  did your mother send you here .    robin thought the old man was angry with them for playing truant .  he said  slowly   n  no .  she didn t exactly send us  but i don t think she ll mind our having come if we get back in time for supper .  mamma never forbid our going mumming  you know .     i don t suppose she ever thought of it   nicholas said candidly  wagging his curly head from side to side .    she knows we re mummers   said robin   for she helped us .  when we were abroad  you know  she used to tell us about the mummers acting at christmas  when she was a little girl  and so we thought we d be mummers  and so we acted to papa and mamma  and so we thought we d act to the maids  but they were cleaning the passages  and so we thought we d really go mumming  and we ve got several other houses to go to before supper time  we d better begin  i think   said robin  and without more ado he began to march round and round  raising his sword  and the performance went off quite as creditably as before .   as the children acted the old man s anger wore off .  he watched them with an interest he could not repress .  when nicholas took some hard thwacks from robert without flinching  the old man clapped his hands  and after the encounter was over  he said he would not have had the dogs excluded on any consideration .  it was just at the end  when they were all marching round and round  holding on by each other s swords  over the shoulder   and singing  a mumming we will go  etc .    that nicholas suddenly brought the circle to a stand still by stopping dead short  and staring up at the wall before him .    what are you stopping for .   said robert  turning indignantly around .    look there .   cried nicholas  pointing to a little painting which hung above the old man s head .   robin looked  and said abruptly   it s dora .     which is dora .   asked the old man in a strange  sharp tone .    here she is   said robin and nicholas in one breath  as they dragged her forward .    she s the doctor   said robin   and you can t see her face for her things .  dor  take off your cap and pull back that hood .  there .  oh  it is like her .    it was the portrait of her mother as a child  but of this the nursery mummers knew nothing .  the old man looked as the peaked cap and hood fell away from dora s face and fair curls  and then he uttered a sharp cry  and buried his head upon his hands .  the boys stood stupefied  but dora ran up to him  and putting her little hands on his arms  said  in childish pitying tones   oh  i am so sorry .  have you got a headache .  may robin put the shovel in the fire for you .  mamma has hot shovels for her headaches .   and though the old man did not speak or move  she went on coaxing him  and stroking his head  on which the hair was white .  at this moment pax took one of his unexpected runs  and jumped on to the old man s knee  in his own particular fashion  and then yawned at the company .  the old man was startled  and lifted his face suddenly .  it was wet with tears .    why  you re crying .   exclaimed the children with one breath .    it s very odd   said robin  fretfully .   i can t think what s the matter to night .  mamma was crying too when we were acting  and papa said we weren t to tease her with questions  and he kissed her hand  and i kissed her hand too .  and papa said we must all be very good and kind to poor dear mamma  and so i mean to be  she s so good .  and i think we d better go home  or perhaps she ll be frightened   robin added .    she s so good  is she .   asked the old man .  he had put pax off his knee  and taken dora on to it .    oh  isn t she .   said nicholas  swaying his curly head from side to side as usual .    she s always good   said robin  emphatically   and so s papa .  but i m always doing something i oughtn t to   he added  slowly .   but then  you know  i don t pretend to obey sarah .  i don t care a fig for sarah  and i won t obey any woman but mamma .     who s sarah .   asked the grandfather .    she s our nurse   said robin   and she tells  i mustn t say what she tells  but it s not the truth .  she told one about you the other day   he added .    about me .   said the old man .    she said you were our grandpapa .  so then i knew she was telling you know what .     how did you know it wasn t true .   the old man asked .    why  of course   said robin   if you were our mamma s father  you d know her  and be very fond of her  and come to see her .  and then you d be our grandfather  too  and you d have us to see you  and perhaps give us christmas boxes .  i wish you were   robin added with a sigh .   it would be very nice .     would you like it .   asked the old man of dora .   and dora  who was half asleep and very comfortable  put her little arms about his neck as she was wont to put them around the captain s  and said   very much .    he put her down at last  very tenderly  almost unwillingly  and left the children alone .  by and by he returned  dressed in the blue cloak  and took dora up again .    i will see you home   he said .   the children had not been missed .  the clock had only just struck nine when there came a knock on the door of the dining room  where the captain and his wife still sat by the yule log .  she said  come in   wearily  thinking it was the frumenty and the christmas cakes .   but it was her father  with her child in his arms .   viii .   the captain had many friends who knew of the sad estrangement between his wife and her father .  some of them were in church the next day  which was christmas day  when the captain s wife came in .  they would have hid their faces  but for the startling sight that met the gaze of the congregation .  the old grandfather walked into church abreast of the captain .    they ve met in the porch   whispered one under the shelter of his hat .    they can t quarrel publicly in a place of worship   said another  turning pale .    she s gone into his seat   cried a girl in a shrill whisper .    and the children after her   added her sister  incautiously aloud .   there was now no doubt about the matter .  the old man in his blue cloak stood for a few moments politely disputing the question of precedence with his handsome son in law .  then the captain bowed and passed in  and the old man followed him .   by the time that the service was ended everybody knew of the happy peacemaking  and was glad .  one old friend after another came up with blessings and good wishes .  this was a proper christmas  indeed  they said .  there was a general rejoicing .   but only the grandfather and his children knew that it was hatched from  the peace egg .                  end of the project gutenberg ebook a budget of christmas tales by charles dickens and others
