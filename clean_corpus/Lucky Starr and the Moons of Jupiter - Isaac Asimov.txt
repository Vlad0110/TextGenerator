traitor .            robot .        preface  back in the     s  i wrote a series of six derring do novels about david  lucky  starr and his battles against malefactors within the solar system .  each of the six took place in a different region of the system and in each case i made use of the astronomical facts   as they were then known .   now more than a quarter century later  these novels are being published in new editions  but what a quarter century it has been .  more has been learned about the worlds of our solar system in this last quarter century than in all the thousands of years that went before .   lucky starr  and the moons of jupiter was written in      .  in late       however  the jupiter probe  pioneer x  passed by jupiter and recorded an enormous magnetic field containing dense concentrations of charged particles .  the large satellites of jupiter are buried in that field and the intensity of radiation would certainly make it difficult or even impossible for manned ships to maneuver in their neighborhood .   lucky s trip through the satellite system would have to be adjusted to take the intense radiation into account if i were writing the book today .  and in       a   th satellite of jupiter  was discovered  a very small one only a few miles across  with an orbit quite similar to that of jupiter ix .  i d have mentioned it if i were doing the book now .         i hope my gentle readers enjoy the book anyway  as an adventure story  but please don t forget that the advance of science can outdate even the most conscientious science fiction writer and that my astronomical descriptions are no longer accurate in all respects .   isaac asimov     trouble on jupiter nine  jupiter was almost a perfect circle of creamy light  half the apparent diameter of the moon as seen from earth  but only one seventh as brightly lit because of its great distance from the sun .  even so  it was a beautiful and impressive sight .   lucky starr gazed at it thoughtfully .  the lights in the control room were out and jupiter was centered on the visiplate  its dim light making lucky and his companion something more than mere shadows .  lucky said   if jupiter were hollow  bigman  you could dump thirteen hundred planets the size of earth into it and still not quite fill it up .  it weighs more than all the other planets put together .    john bigman jones  who allowed no one to call him anything but bigman  and who was five feet two inches tall if he stretched a little  disapproved of anything that was big  except lucky .  he said   and what good is all of it .  no one can land on it .  no one can come near it .     we ll never land on it  perhaps   said lucky   but we ll be coming close to it once the agrav ships are developed .            with the sirians on the job   said bigman  scowling in the gloom   it s going to take ms to make sure that happens .     well  bigman  we ll see .    bigman pounded his small right fist into the open palm of his other hand .   sands of mars  lucky  how long do we have to wait here .    they were in lucky s ship  the shooting starr  which was in an orbit about jupiter  having matched velocities with jupiter nine  the giant planet s outermost satellite of any size .   that satellite hung stationary a thousand miles away .  officially  its name was adrastea  but except for the largest and closest  jupiter s satellites were more popularly known by numbers .  jupiter nine was only eighty nine miles in diameter  merely an asteroid  really  but it looked larger than distant jupiter  fifteen million miles away .  the satellite was a craggy rock  gray and forbidding in the sun s weak light  and scarcely worth interest .  both lucky and bigman had seen a hundred such sights in the asteroid belt .   in one way  however  it was different .  under its skin a thousand men and billions of dollars labored to produce ships that would be immune to the effects of gravity .   nevertheless  lucky preferred watching jupiter .  even at its present distance from the ship  actually three fifths of the distance of venus from earth at then closest approach   jupiter showed a disc large enough to reveal its colored zones to the naked eye .  they showed in fault pink and greenish blue  as though a child had dipped ms fingers in a watery paint and trailed them across jupiter s image .        lucky almost forgot the deadliness of jupiter in its beauty .  bigman had to repeat his question in a louder voice .    hey  lucky  how long do we have to wait here .     you know the answer to that  bigman .  until commander donahue comes to pick us up .     i know that part .  what i want to know is why we have to wait for him .     because he s asked us to .     oh  he has .  who does the cobber think he is .     the head of the agrav project   lucky said patiently .    you don t have to do what he says  you know  even if he is .    bigman had a sharp and deep realization of lucky s powers .  as full member of the council of science  that selfless and brilliant organization that fought the enemies of earth within and without the solar system  lucky starr could write his own ticket even against the most high ranking .   but lucky was not quite ready to do that .  jupiter was a known danger  a planet of poison and unbearable gravity  but the situation on jupiter nine was more dangerous still because the exact points of danger were unknown   and until lucky could know a bit more  he was picking his way forward carefully .    be patient  bigman   he said .   bigman grumbled and flipped the lights on .   we re not staring at jupiter all day  are we .    he walked over to the small venusian creature bobbing up and down in its enclosed water filled cage in the corner of the pilot room .  he peered fondly down at it  his wide mouth grinning with pleasure .  the      v frog always had that effect on bigman  or indeed  on anyone .   the v frog was a native of the venusian oceans   a tiny thing that seemed  at times  all eyes and feet .  its body was green and froglike and but six inches long .  his twa big eyes protruded like gleaming blackberries  and its sharp  strongly curved beak opened and closed at irregular intervals .  at the moment its six legs were retracted  so that the v frog hugged the bottom of its cage  but when bigman tapped the top cover  they unfolded like a carpenter s rule and became stilts .     it was an ugly little thing but bigman loved it when he was near it .  he couldn t help it .  anyone else would feel the same .  the v frog saw to that .   carefully bigman checked the carbon dioxide cylinder that kept the v frog s water well saturated and healthful and made sure that the water temperature in the cage was at ninety five .   the warm oceans of venus were bathed by and saturated with an atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide .  free oxygen  nonexistent on venus except in the man made domed cities at the bottom of its ocean shallows  would have been most uncomfortable for the v frog .    bigman said   do you think the weed supply is enough .   and as though the v frog heard the remark  its beak snipped a green tendril off the native venusian weed that spread through the cage  and chewed slowly .   lucky said   it will hold till we land on jupiter nine   and then both men looked up sharply as the receiving signal sounded its unmistakable rasp .   a stern  aging face was centered on the visiplate    see lucky starr and the oceans of venus .        after lucky s fingers had quickly made the necessary adjustments .    donahue at this end   said a voice briskly .    yes  commander   said lucky .   we ve been waiting for you .     clear locks for tube attachment  then .    on the commander s face  written in an expression as clear as though it consisted of letters the size of class i meteors  was worry   trouble and worry .   lucky had grown accustomed to just that expression on men s faces in these past weeks .  on chief councilman hector conway s for instance .  to the chief councilman  lucky was almost a son and the older man felt no need to assume any pretense of confidence .   conway s rosy face  usually amiable and self assured under its crown of pure white hair  was set in a troubled frown .    i ve been waiting for a chance to talk to you for months .     trouble .   lucky asked quietly .  he had just returned from mercury less than a month earlier  and the intervening time had been spent in his new york apartment .   i didn t get any calls from you .     you earned your vacation   conway said gruffly .   i wish i could afford to let it continue longer .     just what is it  uncle hector .    the chief councilman s old eyes stared firmly into those of the tall  lithe youngster before him and seemed to find comfort in those calm  brown ones .   sirius .   he said .   lucky felt a stir of excitement within him .  was it the great enemy at last .   it had been centuries since the pioneering expedi       tions from earth had colonized the planets of the nearer stars .  new societies had grown up on those worlds outside the solar system .  independent societies that scarcely remembered their earthly origin .   the sirian planets formed the oldest and strongest of those societies .  the society had grown up on new worlds where an advanced science was brought to bear on untapped resources .  it was no secret that the sirianss strong in the belief that they represented the best of mankind  looked forward to the time when they might rule all men everywhere  and that they considered earth  the old mother world  their greatest enemy .   in the past they had done what they could to support the enemies of earth at home  but never yet had they felt quite strong enough to risk open war .   but now .    what  s this about sinus .   asked lucky .   conway leaned back .  his fingers drummed lightly on the table .  he said   sirius grows stronger each year .  we know that but their worlds are underpopulated  they have only a few millions .  we still have more human beings in our solar system than exist in all the galaxy besides .  we have more ships and more scientists  we still have the edge .  but  by space  we won t keep that edge if things keep on as they ve been going .     in what way .     the sirians are finding out things .  the council has definite evidence that sirius is completely up to date on our agrav research .     what .   lucky was startled .  there were few things more top secret than the agrav project .  one of the reasons actual construction had been confined to one of the outer satellites of jupiter had been for the sake    see lucky starr and the pirates of the asteroids .        of better security .   great galaxy  how has that happened .    conway smiled bitterly .   that is indeed the question .  how has that happened .  all sorts of material are leaking out to them  and we don t know how .  the agrav data is most critical .  we ve tried to stop it .  there isn t a man on the project that hasn t been thoroughly checked for loyalty .  there isn t a precaution we haven t taken .  yet material still leaks .  we ve planted false data and that s gone out .  we know it has from our own intelligence information .  we ve planted data in such ways that it couldn t go out  and yet it has .     how do you mean couldn t go out .     we scattered it so that no one man   in fact  no half dozen men   could possibly be aware of it all .  yet it went .  it would mean that a number of men would have to be co operating in espionage and that s just unbelievable .     or that some one man has access everywhere   said lucky .    which is just as impossible .  it must be something new  lucky .  do you see the implication .  if sirius has learned a new way of picking our brains  we re no longer safe .  we could never organize a defense against them .  we could never make plans against them .     hold it  uncle hector .  great galaxy  give yourself a minute .  what do you mean when you say they re picking our brains .   lucky fixed his glance keenly on the older man .   the chief councilman flushed .   space  lucky  i m getting desperate .  i can t see how else this can be done .  the sirians must have developed some form of mind reading  of telepathy .     why be embarrassed at suggesting that .  i suppose      it s possible .  we know of one practical means of telepathy at least .  the venusian v frogs .     all right   said conway .   i ve thought of that  too  but they don t have venusian v frogs .  i know what s been going on in v frog research .  it takes thousands of them working in combination to make telepathy possible .  to keep thousands of them anywhere but on venus would be awfully difficult  and easily detectable  too .  and without v frogs  there is no way of managing telepathy .     no way we ve worked out   lucky said softly   so far .  it is possible that the sirians are ahead of us in telepathy research .     without v frogs .     even without v frogs .     i don t believe it   conway cried violently .   i can t believe that the sirians can have solved any problem that has left the council of science so completely helpless .    lucky almost smiled at the older man s pride in the organization  but had to admit that there was something more than merely pride there .  the council of science represented the greatest collection of intellect the galaxy had ever seen  and for a century not one sizable piece of scientific advance anywhere in the galaxy had come anywhere but from the council .   nevertheless lucky couldn t resist a small dig .  he said   they re ahead of us in robotics .     not really   snapped conway .   only in its applications .  earthmen invented the positronic brain that made the modern mechanical man possible .  don t forget that .  earth can take the credit for all the basic developments .  it s just that sinus builds more robots       and   he hesitated   has perfected some of the engineering details .     so i found out on mercury   lucky said grimly .     yes  i know  lucky .  that was dreadfully close .     but it s over .  let s consider what s facing us now .  the situation is this  sinus is conducting successful espionage and we can t stop them .     yes .     and the agrav project is most seriously affected .     yes .     and i suppose  uncle hector  that what you want me to do is to go out to jupiter nine and see if i can learn something about this .    conway nodded gloomily .   it s what i m asking you to do .  it s unfair to you .  i ve gotten into the habit of thinking of you as my ace  my trump card  a man i can give any problem and be sure it will be solved .  yet what can you do here .  there s nothing council hasn t tried and we ve located no spy and no method of espionage .  what more can we expect of you .     not of myself alone .  i ll have help .     bigman .   the older man couldn t help smiling .    not bigman alone .  let me ask you a question .  to your knowledge  has any information concerning our v frog research on venus leaked out to the sirians .     no   said conway .   none has  to my knowledge .     then i ll ask to have a v frog assigned to me .     a v frog .  one v frog .     that s right .     but what good win that do you .  the mental field of a single v frog is terribly weak .  you won t be able to read minds .      see lucky starr and the big sun of mercury .        true  but i might be able to catch whiffs of strong emotion .    conway said thoughtfully   you might do that .  but what good would that do .      i m not sure yet .  still  it will be an advantage previous investigators haven t had .  an unexpected emotional surge on the part of someone there might help me  might give me grounds for suspicion  might point the direction for further investigation .  then  too       yes .     if someone possesses telepathic power  developed either naturally or by use of artificial aids  i might detect something much stronger than just a whiff of emotion .  i might detect an actual thought  some distinct thought  before the individual learns enough from my mind to shield his thoughts .  you see what i mean .     he could detect your emotions  too .     theoretically  yes  but i would be listening for emotion  so to speak .  he would not .    conway s eyes brightened .   it s a feeble hope  but  by space  it s a hope .  i ll get you your v frog  .   .   .  but one thing  david   and it was only at moments of deep concern that he used lucky s real name  the one by which the young councilman had been known all through childhood    i want you to appreciate the importance of this .  if we don t find out what the sirians are doing  it means they are really ahead of us at last .  and that means war can t be delayed much longer .  war or peace hangs on this .     i know   said lucky softly .      the commander is angry  and so it came about that lucky starr  earthman  and his small friend  bigman jones  born and bred on mars   traveled beyond the asteroid belt and into the outer reaches of the solar system .  and it was for this reason also that a native of venus  not a man at all  but a small mind reading and mind influencing animal  accompanied them .   they hovered  now  a thousand miles above jupiter nine and waited as a flexible conveyer tube was made fast between the shooting starr and the commander s ship .  the tube linked air lock to air lock and formed a passageway which men could use in going from one ship to the other without having to put on a space suit .  the air of both ships mingled  and a man used to space  taking advantage of the absence of gravity  could shoot along the tube after a single initial push and guide himself along those places where the tube curved with the gentle adjusting force of a well placed elbow .     see david starr  space ranger .           the commander s hands were the first part of him visible at the lock opening .  they gripped the lip of the opening and pushed in such a way that the commander himself leapfrogged out and came down in the shooting starr s localized artificial gravity field  or pseudo grav field  as it was usually termed  with scarcely a stagger .  it was neatly done  and bigman  who had high standards indeed for all forms of spacemen s techniques  nodded in approval .    good day  councilman starr   said donahue gruffly .  it was always a matter of difficulty whether to say  good morning    good afternoon   or  good evening  in space  where  strictly speaking  there was neither morning  afternoon  nor evening .   good day  was the neutral term usually adopted by spacemen .    good day  commander   said lucky .   are there any difficulties concerning our landing on jupiter nine that account for this delay .     difficulties .  well  that s as you look at it .   he looked about and sat down on one of the small pilot s stools .   tve been in touch with council headquarters but they say i must treat with you directly  so i m here .    commander donahue was a wiry man  with an air of tension about him .  his face was deeply lined  his hair grayish but showing signs of having once been brown .  his hands had prominent blue veins along their backs  and he spoke in an explosive fashion  rapping out his phrases in a quick succession of words .    treat with me about what  sir .   asked lucky .    just this  councilman .  i want you to return to earth .     why  sir .         the commander did not look directly at lucky as he spoke .   we have a morale problem .  our men have been investigated and investigated and investigated .  they ve all come through clear each time  and each time a new investigation is started .  they don t like it and neither would you .  they don t like being under continual suspicion .  and i m completely on their side .  our agrav ship is almost ready and this is not the time for my men to be disturbed .  they talk of going on strike .    lucky said calmly   your men may have been cleared but there is still leakage of information .    donahue shrugged .   then it must come from elsewhere .  it must .  .  .   he broke off and a sudden incongruous note of friendliness entered his voice .   what s that .    bigman followed his eyes and said at once   that s our v frog  commander  i m bigman .    the commander did not acknowledge the introduction .  he approached the v frog instead  staring into the enclosed water filled cage .   that s a venus creature  isn t it .     that s right   said bigman .    i ve heard of them .  never saw one  though .  cute little jigger  isn t it .    lucky felt a grim amusement .  he did not find it strange that in the midst of a most serious discussion the commander should veer off into an absorbed admiration for a small water creature from venus .  the v frog itself made that inevitable .   the small creature was looking back at donahue now out of its black eyes  swaying on its extensible legs and clicking its parrot beak gently .  in all the known      universe its means of survival was unique .  it had no defensive weapons  no armor of any sort .  it had no claws or teeth or horns .  its beak might bite  but even that bite could do no harm to any creature larger than itself .   yet it multiplied freely along the weed covered surface of the venusian ocean  and none of the fierce predators of the ocean s deeps disturbed it  simply because the v frog could control emotion .  they instinctively caused all other forms of life to like them  to feel friendly toward them  to have no wish whatever to hurt them .  so they survived .  they did more than that .  they flourished .   now this particular v frog was filling donahue  quite obviously  with a feeling of friendliness  so that the army man pointed a finger at it through the glass of its cage and laughed to see it cock its head and sink down along its collapsing legs  as donahue moved his finger downward .    you don t suppose we could get a few of these for jupiter nine  do you  starr .   he asked .   we re great ones for pets here .  an animal here and there makes for a breath of home .     it s not very practical   said lucky .   v frogs are difficult to keep .  they have to be maintained in a carbon dioxide saturated system  you know .  oxygen is mildly poisonous to them .  that makes things complicated .     you mean they can t be kept in an open fish bowl .     they can be at tunes .  they re kept so on venus  where carbon dioxide is dirt cheap and where they can always be turned loose in the ocean if they seem to be unhappy .  on a ship  though  or on an airless       world  you don t want to bleed carbon dioxide continuously into the air  so a closed system is best .     oh .   the commander looked a bit wistful .    to return to our original subject of discussion   said lucky briskly   i must refuse your suggestion that i leave .  i have an assignment and i must carry it through .    it seemed to take a few seconds for the commander to emerge from the spell cast by the v frog .  his face darkened .   i m sure you don t understand the entire situation .   he turned suddenly  looking down at big man .   consider your associate  for instance .    the small martian  with a stiffening of spine  began to redden .   i m bigman   he said .   i told you that before .     not very big a man  nevertheless   said the commander .   and though lucky placed a soothing hand on the little fellow s shoulder at once  it didn t help .  bigman cried   bigness isn t on the outside  mister .  my name is bigman  and i m a big man against you or anyone you want to name regardless of what the yardstick says .  and if you don t believe it .   .   .   he was shrugging his left shoulder vigorously .   let go of me  lucky  will you .  this cobber here .  .  .     will you wait just one minute  bigman .   lucky urged .   let s find out what the commander is trying to say .    donahue had looked startled at bigman s sudden verbal assault .  he said   i m sure i meant no harm in my remark .  if i ve hurt your feelings  i m sorry .     my feelings hurt .   said bigman  his voice squeaking .   me .  listen  one thing about me  i never lose      my temper and as long as you apologize  we ll forget about it .   he hitched at his belt and brought the palms of his hands down with a smart slap against the knee high orange and vermilion boots that were the heritage of his martian farm boy past and without which he would never be seen in public  unless he substituted others with an equally garish color scheme  .    i want to be very plain with you  councilman   said donahue  turning to lucky once more .   i have almost a thousand men here at jupiter nine  and they re tough  all of them .  they have to be .  they re far from home .  they do a hard job .  they run great risks .  they have their own outlook on life now and it s a rough one .  for instance  they haze newcomers and not with a light hand  either .  sometimes newcomers can t stand it and go home .  sometimes they re hurt .  if they come through  everything s fine .    lucky said   is this officially permitted .     no .  but it is permitted unofficially .  the men have to be kept happy somehow  and we can t afford to alienate them by interfering with their horseplay .  good men are hard to replace out here .  not many people are willing to come to the moons of jupiter  you know .  then  too  the initiation is helpful in weeding out the misfits .  those that don t pass would probably fail hi other respects eventually .  that is why i made mention of your friend .    the commander raised his hands hurriedly .   now make no mistake .  i agree that he is big on the inside and capable and anything else you want .  but will he be a match for what lies ahead .  will you  councilman .     you mean the hazing .         it will be rough  councilman   said donahue .   the men know you are coming .  news gets around somehow .     yes  i know   murmured lucky .   the commander scowled .   in any case  they know you are to investigate them and they will feel no kindness toward you .  they are in an ugly mood and they will hurt you  councilman starr .  i am asking you not to land on jupiter nine for the project s sake  for my men s sake  and for your own .  there you have it as plainly as i can put it .    bigman stared at the change that came over lucky .  his usual look of calm good nature was gone .  his dark brown eyes turned hard  and the straight lines of his lean and handsome face were set in something that bigman rarely saw there  bitter anger .  every muscle of lucky s tall body seemed tense .   lucky said ringingly   commander donahue  i am a member of the council of science .  i am responsible only to the head of the council and to the president of the solar federation of worlds .  i outrank you and you will be bound by my decisions and orders .    i consider the warning you have just given me to be evidence of your own incompetence .  don t say anything  please  hear me out .  you are obviously not in control of your men and not fit to command men .  now hear this  i will land on jupiter nine and i will conduct my investigations .  i will handle your men if you cannot .    he paused while the other gasped and vainly attempted to find his voice .  he rapped out   do you understand  commander .        commander donahue  his face congested almost beyond recognition  managed to grind out   i will take this up with the council of science .  no arrogant young whipsnap can talk like that to me  councilman or no councilman .  i will match my record as a leader of men against that of anyone in the service .  furthermore  my warning to you will be on record also and if you are hurt on jupiter nine  i will run the risk of court martial gladly .  i will do nothing for you .  in fact  i hope   i hope they teach you manners  you .  .  .    he was past speech once more .  he turned on his heel  toward the open lock  connected still with the space tube to bis own ship .  he clambered in  missing a hand hold in his anger and stumbling badly   bigman watched with awe as the commander s heels disappeared down the tube .  the other s anger had been so intense a thing that the little martian had seemed to feel it in his own mind as though waves of heat were rolling in upon him .   bigman said   wow  that cobber was really going .  you had him rocking .    lucky nodded .   he was angry .  no doubt about it .    bigman said   listen  maybe he s the spy .  he d know the most .  he d have the best chance .     he d also be the most thoroughly investigated  so your theory is doubtful .  but at least he s helped us out in a little experiment  so when i see him next i will have to apologize .     apologize .   bigman was horrified .  it was his firm view that apologies were strictly something that other people had to do .   why .     come  bigman  do you suppose i really meant those things i said .          you weren t angry .     not really .     it was an act .     you could call it that .  i wanted to make him angry  really angry  and   succeeded .  i could tell that firsthand .     firsthand .     couldn t you .  couldn t you feel the anger just pouring out of him all over you .     sands of mars .  the v frog .     of course .  it received the commander s anger and rebroadcast it on to us .  i had to know if one v frog could do it .  we tested it back on earth  but until i tried it under actual field conditions  i wasn t sure .  now i am .     it broadcast fine .     i know .  so at least it proves we have a weapon  one weapon  after all .       the agrav corridor   good deal   said bigman fiercely .   then we re on our way .     hold it   said lucky at once .   hold everything  my friend .  this is a non specific weapon .  we ll sense strong emotion but we may never sense one that will give us the key to the mystery .  it s like having eyes .  we may see  but we may not see the right thing  not ever .     you will   said bigman confidently .   dropping down toward jupiter nine reminded bigman very strongly of similar maneuvers in the asteroid belt .  as lucky had explained on the voyage outward  most astronomers considered jupiter nine to have been a true asteroid to begin with  a rather large one that had been captured by jupiter s tremendous gravity field many millions of years previously .   in fact  jupiter had captured so many asteroids that here  fifteen million miles from the giant planet  there was a kind of miniature asteroid belt belonging to jupiter alone .  the four largest of these asteroid satellites  each from forty to a hundred miles in diameter  were          jupiter twelve  eleven  eight  and nine .  in addition there were at least a hundred additional satellites of more than a mile in diameter  unnumbered and unregarded .  their orbits had been plotted only in the last ten years when jupiter nine was first put to use as an anti gravity research center  and the necessity of traveling to and from it had made the population of surrounding space important .   the approaching satellite swallowed the sky and became a rough world of peaks and rocky channels  un softened by any touch of air in the billions of years of its history .  bigman  still thoughtful  said   lucky  why in space do they call this jupiter nine  anyway .  it isn t the ninth one out from jupiter according to the atlas .  jupiter twelve is a lot closer .    lucky smiled .   the trouble with you  bigman  is that you re spoiled .  just because you were born on mars  you think mankind has been cutting through space ever since creation .  look boy  it s only a matter of a thousand years since mankind invented the first spaceship .     i know that   said bigman indignantly .   i m not ignorant .  i ve had schooling .  don t go shoving your big brain all over the place .    lucky s smile expanded  and he rapped bigman s skull with two knuckles .   anybody home .    bigman s fist whipped toward lucky s abdomen  but lucky caught it in midair and held the little fellow motionless .    if s as simple as this  bigman .  before space travel was invented  men were restricted to earth and all they knew about jupiter was what they could see in a telescope .  the satellites are numbered in the order they were discovered  see .         oh   said bigman  and yanked free .   poor ancestors .   he laughed  as he always did  at the thought of human beings cooped up on one world  peering out longingly  even as he struggled to free himself from lucky s grip .   lucky went on .   the four big satellites of jupiter are numbered one  two  three  and four  of course  but the numbers are hardly ever used .  the names io  europa  ganymede  and callisto are familiar names .  the nearest satellite of all  a small one  is jupiter five  while the farther ones have numbers up to twelve .  the ones past twelve weren t discovered till after space travel was invented and men had reached mars and the asteroid belt  .   .   .  watch out now .  we ve got to adjust for landing .    it was amazing  thought lucky  how you could consider tiny a world eighty nine miles in diameter as long as you were nowhere near it .  of course  such a world is tiny compared to jupiter or even to earth .  place it gently on earth and its diameter is small enough to allow it to fit within the state of connecticut without lapping over  and its surface area is less than that of pennsylvania .   and yet  just the same  when you came to enter the small world  when you found your ship enclosed in a large lock and moved by gigantic grapples  working against a gravitational force of almost zero but against full inertia  into a large cavern capable of holding a hundred ships the size of the shooting starr  it no longer seemed so small .   and then when  you came across a map of jupiter nine on the wall of an office and studied the network of      underground caverns and corridors within which a complicated program was being carried out  it began to seem actually large .  both horizontal and vertical projections of the work volume of jupiter nine were shown on the map  and though only a small portion of the satellite was being used  lucky could see that some of the corridors penetrated as much as two miles beneath the surface and that others spread out just under the surface for nearly a hundred miles .    a tremendous job   he said softly to the lieutenant at his side .   lieutenant augustus nevsky nodded briefly .  his uniform was spotless and gleaming .  he had a stiff little blond mustache  and his wide set blue eyes had a habit of staring straight ahead as though he were at perpetual attention .   he said with pride   we re still growing .    he had introduced himself a quarter of an hour earlier  as lucky and bigman had stepped from the ship  as the personal guide assigned them by commander donahue .   lucky said with some amusement   guide .  or guardian  lieutenant .  you are armed .    any trace of feeling was carefully washed out of the other s face .   my arms are regulation for officers on duty  councilman .  you will find you will need a guide here .    but he seemed to relax  and there was ordinary human feeling about him as he listened to the visitors  awed praise of the project .  he said   of course the absence of any significant gravitational field makes certain engineering tricks feasible that wouldn t work on      earth .  underground corridors require practically no support .    lucky nodded  then said   i understand that the first agrav ship is about ready for take off .    the lieutenant said nothing for a moment .  his face blanked free  again  of emotion or feeling .  then he said stiffly   i will show you your quarters first .  it can be most easily reached by agrav  if i can persuade you to use an agrav cor       hey  lucky   called bigman in sudden excitement .   look at this .    lucky turned .  it was only a half grown cat  gray as smoke  with the look of solemn sadness that cats usually have  and a back that arched readily against bigman s curved fingers .  she was purring .   lucky said   the commander said they went for pets here .  is this one yours  lieutenant .    the officer flushed .   we all have shares in it .  there are a few other cats around  too .  they come on the supply ships sometimes .  we ve got some canaries  a parakeet  white mice  goldfish .  things like that .  nothing like your whatever it is  though .   and his eyes  as they looked quickly at the v frog s bowl tucked under lucky s arm  contained a spark of envy .   but bigman was concentrating on the cat there was no native animal life on mars and the furry pets of earth always had the charm of novelty to him .    he likes me  lucky .     it s a she   said the lieutenant  but bigman paid no attention .  the cat  tail hoisted into a stiff vertical with only the tip drooping  walked past him  doubling sharply so as to present first one side  then the other  to bigman s gentle stroking .       and then the purring stopped  and through bigman s mind stabbed one pure touch of fevered and hungry desire .   it startled him for a moment  and then he noticed that the cat had stopped purring and was squatting slightly in the tense hunting posture dictated by its millions of years old instincts .   her green slitted eyes stared directly at the v frog .  but the emotion  so feline in its touch  was gone almost as soon as it had come .  the cat padded softly over to the glass container lucky was holding and stared in curiously  purring with contentment .  the cat  too  liked the v frog .  it had to .  lucky said   you were saying  lieutenant  we would have to reach our quarters by agrav .  were you going to explain what that means .    the lieutenant  who had also been staring fondly at the v frog  paused to gather his wits before answering .   yes .  it s simple enough .  we have artificial gravity fields here on jupiter nine as on any asteroid or on any space ship for that matter .  they are arranged at each of the main corridors  end to end  so that you can fall the length of them in either direction .  it s like dropping straight down a hole on earth .   lucky nodded .   how fast do you drop .    well  that s the point .  ordinarily  gravity pulls constantly and you fall faster and faster .  .  .     which is why i ask my question   interposed lucky dryly .    but not under agrav controls .  agrav is really a grav  no gravity  you see .  agrav can be used to absorb gravitational energy or store it or transfer it .  the point is you only fall so fast  you see  and no faster .       with a gravitational field in the other direction  too  you can even slow down .  an agrav corridor with two pseudo grav fields is very simple and it has been used as a steppingstone to an agrav ship which works in a single gravitational field .  now engineers  quarters  which is where your rooms will be  is only a little over a mile from here and the most direct route is by corridor a   .  ready .     we will be once you explain how we re to work agrav .     that s hardly a problem .   lieutenant nevsky presented each with a light harness  adjusting them over the shoulders and at the waist  talking rapidly about the controls .   and then he said   if you ll follow me  gentlemen  the corridor is just a few yards in this direction .    bigman hesitated at the opening of the corridor .  he was not afraid of space in itself  or of drops in themselves .  but all his life he had been used to bridging gaps under martian gravity or less .  this time the pseudo grav field was at full earth normal  and under its influence the corridor was a brilliantly lighted hole  plummeting  apparently  straight downward  even though in actuality  bigman s mind told him  it paralleled the satellite s surface closely .   the lieutenant said   now this is the lane for travel in the direction of engineers  quarters .  if we were to approach from the other side   down  would appear to be in the other direction .  or we could make  up  and  down  change places by appropriate adjustments of our agrav controls .    he looked at the expression on bigman s face and      said   you ll get the idea as you go along .  it becomes second nature after a while .    he stepped into the corridor and didn t drop an inch .  it was as though he were standing on an invisible platform .   he said earnestly   have you set the dial at zero .     bigman did so  and instantly all sensation of gravity vanished .  he stepped into the corridor .   now the lieutenant s hand on the central knob of his own controls turned it sharply  and he sank  gathering speed .  lucky followed him  and bigman  who would sooner have fallen the length of the corridor under double gravity and been smashed to pulp than fail to do anything lucky did  took a deep breath and let himself fall .    turn back to zero   called the lieutenant   and you ll be moving at constant velocity .  get the feel of it   periodically they approached and passed through luminous green letters that glowed keep to this side  once there was the flash of a man passing  falling  really  in the other direction .  he was moving much more rapidly than they were .    are there ever any collisions  lieutenant .   asked lucky .    not really   said the lieutenant .   the experienced dropper watches for people who might be overtaking him or whom he might be overtaking  and it s easy enough to slow down or speed up .  of course the boys will bump on purpose sometimes .  it s a kind of rowdy fun that ends with a broken collarbone sometimes .   he looked quickly at lucky .   our boys play rough .    lucky said   i understand .  the commander warned me .        bigman  who had been staring downward through the well lit tunnel into which he was sinking  cried in sudden exhilaration   hey  lucky  this is fun when you get used to it   and turned his controls into the positive region .   he sank faster  his head moving down to a level with lucky s feet  then farther down at an increasing rate .   lieutenant nevsky cried out in instant alarm   stop that  you fool .  turn back into the negatives .    lucky called out an imperious   bigman  slow down .    they caught up to him  the lieutenant angrily exclaiming .   don t ever do that .  there are all sort of barriers and partitions along these corridors  and if you don t know your way  you ll be slamming into one just when you think you re safe .     here  bigman   said lucky .   hold the v frog .  that will give you some responsibility and make you behave  perhaps     aw  lucky   said bigman  abashed .   i was just kicking my heels a bit .  sands of mars  lucky .  .  .     all right   said lucky .   no harm done   and bigman brightened at once .   bigman looked down again .  falling at a constant rate was not quite the same as free fall in space .  in space  nothing seemed to move .  a space ship might be traveling at a velocity of hundreds of thousands of miles an hour and there would still be the sensation of motion lessness all about .  the distant stars never moved .   here  though  the sense of motion was all about .  the lights and openings and various attachments that lined the corridor walls flashed past .   in space  one expected that there would be no  up       and  down   but here there was none either and it seemed wrong .  as long as he looked  down  past his feet  it seemed  down  and that was all right .  when he looked  up   however  there would be a quick sensation that  up  was really  down   that he was standing head downward falling  up .   he looked toward his feet again quickly to get rid of the sensation .   the lieutenant said   don t bend too far forward  bigman .  the agrav works to keep you lined up in the direction of fall  but if you bend over too much  you ll start tumbling .    bigman straightened .   the lieutenant said   there s nothing fatal about tumbling .  anyone who s used to agrav can straighten himself out again .  beginners would find it troublesome  however .  we ll decelerate now .  move the dial into the negatives and keep it there .  about minus five .    he was slowing as he spoke  moving above them .  his feet dangled at bigman s eye level .   bigman moved the dial  trying desperately to line himself up with the lieutenant .  and as he slowed   up  and  down  became definite  and in the wrong way .  he was standing on his head .   he said   hey  the blood s rushing to my head .    the lieutenant said sharply   there are footholds along the sides of the corridor .  hook one with the toe of your foot as you reach it and let go quickly .    he did so as he said this .  his head swung outward  and head and feet reversed position .  he continued swinging and stopped himself with a quick hand tap against the wall .   lucky followed suit  and bigman  flailing widely with his short legs  managed to catch one of the footholds      at last .  he whirled sharply and caught the wall with his elbow just a trifle too hard for comfort but managed to line up properly .   at least he was head up again .  he wasn t falling any more  but rising  as though he had been shot out of a cannon and rising against gravity more and more slowly  but at least he was head up .   when they were moving at a slow crawl  bigman  looking uneasily toward his feet  thought  we re going to be falling again .  and suddenly the corridor looked like an endlessly deep well and his stomach tightened .   but the lieutenant said   adjust to zero   and at once they stopped slowing down .  they just moved upward  as though in a smooth  slow elevator  until they reached a cross level at which the lieutenant  seizing a foothold with one toe  brought himself to a feathery stop .    engineers  quarters  gentlemen   he said .    and   added lucky starr gently   a reception committee .    for men were waiting for them in the corridor now  fifty of them at least .   lucky said   you said they liked to play rough  lieutenant  and maybe they want to play now .    he stepped firmly out into the corridor .  bigman  nostrils flaring with excitement and grateful to be on the firm pseudo grav of a solid floor  clutched the v frog s cage tightly and was at lucky s heels  facing the waiting men of jupiter nine .      initiation .   lieutenant nevsky tried to make his voice crackle with authority as he placed his hand on the butt of his blaster .   what are you men doing here .    there was a small murmur from the men  but by and large they remained quiet .  eyes turned to the one of them who stood in front  as though they were waiting for him to speak .   the leader of the men was smiling  and his face was crinkled into an expression of apparent good will .  his straight hair  parted in the middle  had a light orange tint to it .  his cheekbones were broad and he chewed gum .  his clothing was of synthetic fiber  as was true of that of the others  but unlike the others   his shirt and trousers were ornamented with brass buttons that were large and bulky .  four on his shirt front  one each on the two shirt pockets  and four down the side of each pants leg  fourteen altogether .  they seemed to serve no purpose  to be only for show .    all right  summers   said the lieutenant  turning to this man   what are the men doing here .    summers spoke now in a soft  wheedling voice .            well  now  lieutenant  we thought it would be nice to meet the new man .  he ll be seeing a lot of us .  he ll be asking questions .  why shouldn t we meet him now .    he looked at lucky starr as he spoke  and for a moment there was a touch of ice in that glance that swallowed up all the show of softness .   the lieutenant said   you men should be at work .     have a heart  lieutenant   said summers  chewing even more slowly and leisurely .   we ve been working .  now we want to say hello .    the lieutenant was obviously uncertain as to his next move .  he looked doubtfully at lucky .   lucky said   which rooms are to be ours  lieutenant .     rooms  a and  b  sir .  to find them        i l find them .  i m sure one of these men will direct me .  and now  lieutenant nevsky  that you ve directed us to our quarters  i think your assignment is completed .  i ll be seeing you again .     i can t leave .   said lieutenant nevsky in a low  appalled whisper .    i think you can .     sure you can  lieutenant   said summers  grinning more broadly than ever .   a simple hello won t hurt the boy .   there was a snicker of laughter from the men behind him .   and besides  you ve been asked to leave .    bigman approached lucky and muttered in an urgent whisper .   lucky  let me give the v frog to the lieutenant i can t fight and hold it  too .     you just hold it   said lucky .   i want it exactly here .  .  .  .  good day  lieutenant .  dismissed .    the lieutenant hesitated  and lucky said in a tone      that  for all its softness  bit like steel .   that s an order  lieutenant .    lieutenant nevsky s face assumed a soldierly rigidity .  he said sharply   yes  sir .    then  surprisingly  he hesitated one further moment and glanced down at the v frog in the crook of big man s arm  as it chewed idly at a fern frond .   take care of that little thing .   he turned and was in the agrav corridor in two steps  disappearing almost at once in a rush of speed .   lucky turned to face the men again .  he was under no illusions .  they were grim faced and they meant business  but unless he could face them down and prove that he meant business as well  his mission would come to nothing against the rock of their hostility .  he would have to win them over somehow .   summers  smile had become the least bit wolfish .  he said   well  now  friend  the uniform boy is gone .  we can talk .  fm red summers .  what s your name .    lucky smiled in return .   my name is david starr .  my friend s name is bigman .     seems to me i heard you called lucky when all that whispering was going on a while back .     i m called lucky by my friends .     isn t that nice .  do you want to stay lucky .     do you know a good way .     matter of fact  lucky starr  i do .   suddenly his face contorted itself into a bitter scowl .   get off jupiter nine .    there was a hoarse roar of approval from the others  and a few voices took up the cry of  get off .  get off .        they crowded closer  but lucky stood his ground .   i have important reasons to stay on jupiter nine .     in that case  i m afraid you aren t lucky   said summers .   you re a greenhorn and you look soft  and soft greenhorns get hurt on jupiter nine .  we worry about you .     i think i won t get hurt .     that s what you think  eh .   said summers .   ar mand  come here .    from the ranks behind him  a huge man stepped forward  round faced  beefy of build  with large shoulders and a barrel chest .  he topped lucky s six feet one by half a head and looked down at the young councilman with a smile that showed yellowed  wide spaced teeth .   the men were beginning to take seats on the floor .  they shouted to one another with lighthearted cheer  as though they were about to watch a ball game .   one called out   hey  armand  watch out you don t step on the kid .    bigman started  and glared furiously in the direction of the voice but could not identify the speaker .   summers said   you could still leave  starr .    lucky said   i have no intention of doing so  particularly at a moment when you seem to be planning some sort of entertainment .     not for you   said summers .   now listen  starr  we re ready for you .  we ve been ready since we got word that you were coming .  we ve had enough of you little tinhorns from earth and we aren t taking any more .  i ve got men stationed on various levels .  we ll know if the commander tries to interfere  and if he does  then by jupiter  we re ready to go on strike .  am i right  men .         right .   came back the multiple roar .    and the commander knows it   said summers   and i don t think he ll interfere .  so this gives us our chance to give you our initiation and after that i ll ask you again if you want to leave .  if you re conscious  that is .     you re going to a lot of trouble for nothing   said lucky .   what harm am i doing you .     you won t be doing us any   said summers .   i guarantee that .    bigman said  in his tense  high pitched voice   look  you cobber  you re talking to a councilman .  have you stopped to figure what happens if you fool with the council of science .    summers looked at him suddenly  put his fists on his hips  and bent his head back to laugh .   hey  men  it talks .  i was wondering what it was .  it looks as though lucky snoop has brought along his baby brother for protection .    bigman went dead white  but under the cover of the laughter lucky stooped and spoke through stiff lips .   your job is to hang on to the v frog  bigman .  i ll take care of summers .  and  great galaxy  bigman  stop broadcasting anger .  i can t get a thing on the v frog except that .    bigman swallowed hard twice  three tunes .   summers said softly   now  councilman snoop  can you maneuver under agrav .     i just have  mr .  summers .     well  we ll just have to test you and make sure .  we can t have anyone around who hasn t learned all the agrav ropes .  it s too dangerous .  right  men .     right .   they roared again .    armand here   said summers  and his hand rested      on one of armand s huge shoulders   is our best teacher .  you ll know all about agrav maneuvering when you re through with him .  or you will know if you stay out of his way .  i suggest you get out into the agrav corridor now .  armand will join you .    lucky said   if i choose not to go .     then we ll throw you into the corridor anyway and armand goes after you .    lucky nodded .   you seem determined .  are there any rules to this lesson i m going to get .    there was wild laughter  but summers held up his arms .   just keep out of armand s way  councilman .  that  s the only rule you ll have to remember .  we ll be at the lip of the corridor watching .  if you try to crawl out of agrav before you ve completed your lesson  we ll throw you back in  and there are men stationed at other levels  watching  and they re ready to do the same .    bigman cried   sands of mars  your man outweighs lucky by fifty pounds and he s an expert with agrav .    summers turned on him in mock surprise .   no .  i never thought of that .  what a shame .   there was laughter from the men .   on your way  starr .  get into the corridor  armand .  drag him in if you have to .     he won t have to   said lucky .  he turned and moved into the open space of the wide agrav corridor .  as his feet drifted out into empty air  his fingers caught gently at the wall  twisting him in a slow  turning motion that he stopped with another touch against the wall .  he stood there in midair  facing the men .   there was some murmuring at lucky s maneuver  and armand nodded  speaking for the first time in a rolling appreciative bass .   hey  mister  that s not bad .    summers  lips suddenly set and with a frown newly      creasing his forehead  struck armand a sharp blow on the back .   don t talk  you idiot .  get in after him and give it to him .    armand moved forward slowly .  he said   hey  red  let s not make too much of this .    summers  face contorted in fury .   get in there .  and you do what i said .  i told you what he is .  if we don t get rid of him  they ll be sending more .   his words were a harsh whisper that didn t carry .   armand stepped into the corridor and stood face to face with lucky .   lucky starr waited in what was almost absence of mind .  he was concentrating on the faint whiffs of emotion brought him by the v frog .  some he could recognize without difficulty  both as to their nature and their owner .  red summers was easiest to detect  fear and niggling hate mixed with an undertone of anxious triumph .  armand loosed a small leak of tension .  occasionally there were sharp pinpoints of excitement from one or another  and sometimes lucky could identify the owner because it coincided with a happy shout or a threatening one .  all of it had to be sorted out from the steady trickle of bigman s anger  of course .   but now he was staring into armand s small eyes and he was aware that the other was bobbing up and down  a few inches either way .  armand s hand fingered his chest control .   lucky was instantly alert .  the other was alternating the gravitational direction  moving the controls this way and that .  was he expecting to confuse lucky .   lucky was sharply aware that for all his experience with space he was inexperienced in the type of weight       lessness brought about by agrav  for this was a weightlessness that wasn t absolute  as in space  but one that could be changed at will .   and suddenly armand dropped as though he had stepped through a trap door   except that he dropped upward .   as armand s large legs moved up past lucky s head  they parted and came together as if to catch lucky s head in a vise .   automatically lucky s head snapped back  but as it did so  his legs moved forward  his body swinging about its center of gravity  and for a moment  he was off balance and flailing helplessly .  a roar of laughter arose from the watching men .   lucky knew what was wrong .  he should have dodged by gravity .  if armand moved up  lucky should have adjusted controls to move up with him or to race down past him .  and now it would take the pull of gravity to straighten him out .  at gravity zero  he would tumble indefinitely .   but before bis fingers could touch his controls  armand was past the top of his rise and was gathering speed downward .  as he dropped past lucky once more  his elbow caught lucky a sharp jab in the hip .  he dropped farther and his thick fingers clutched at lucky s ankles  carrying him down  down .  armand pulled strongly downward and reached up to seize lucky s shoulders .  his harsh breath stirred lucky s hair .  he said   you need a lot of training  mister .    lucky brought up his own arms head high and broke the other s hold sharply .   lucky dialed gravity up and helped ms upward movement by bringing his foot sharply down on the      other s shoulder  accelerating ms own pace and slowing the other s .  to his own senses it now seemed that he was falling head downward and there was a tenseness about that sensation that seemed to be slowing his reactions .  or was it his agrav controls which were somewhat sluggish .  he tested them and lacked the experience to be certain  yet felt that they were .   armand was on him now  bellowing  thrusting against him  attempting to use his own greater mass of body to maneuver lucky hard against the wall .   lucky wriggled his hand toward the controls in order to reverse the direction of gravity .  he readied his knees for an upward thrust to coincide and lurch armand out of position .   but it was annand s field that shifted first  and it was lucky who was lurched out of position .   annand s feet shot backward now  striking the wall of the corridor as it was flashing by and angling the pair  by recoil  against the opposite wall .  lucky struck bruisingly and skidded along it some feet before his ankle caught one of the metal railings and his body swung away and into the open corridor .   armand whispered hotly in lucky s ear   had enough  mister .  just tell red you ll leave .  i don t want to hurt you bad .    lucky shook his head .  strange  he thought  that ar mand s gravitational field had beaten his own to the shift .  he had felt armand s hand move to the controls and he was certain his own controls had moved first .   twisting suddenly  lucky placed his elbow sharply in the pit of armand s stomach .  armand grunted  and in that split second lucky got his legs between himself      and the other s and straightened them .  the two men flew apart and lucky was free .   he shot away an instant before armand returned  and then for the next few minutes lucky concentrated only on staying away .  he was learning the use of the controls and they were sluggish .  it was only by skillful use of the footholds along the walls and lightning like head to foot reversals that he managed to avoid armand .   and then while he was drifting feather fashion  allowing armand to shoot past him  he turned his agrav controls and found no response at all .  there was no change in the gravitational field direction  no sudden sensation of accelerating one way or the other .   instead  armand was on him again  grunting  and lucky found himself crashing with stunning force against the corridor wall .      needle guns and neighbors  bigman felt fully confident of lucky s ability to handle any overgrown mass of beef  and though he felt a sharp anger at the unsympathetic crowd  he felt no fear .   summers had approached the lip of the corridor and so had another  a gangling  dark complexioned fellow who barked out events as they occurred in a raucous voice  as though it were a flight polo game on the subetherics .   there were cheers when armand first slammed lucky against the corridor wall .  bigman discounted those with contempt .  of course that shouting fool would try to make it look good for his own side .  wait till lucky got the feel of the agrav technique  he would cut that armand guy into ribbons .  bigman was sure of it .   but then when the dark fellow yelled   armand has him now in a head lock .  he s maneuvering for a second fall  feet against the wall  retract and extend and there s the crash  a beauty .   bigman felt the beginnings of uneasiness .   he edged close to the corridor himself .  no one paid          any attention to him .  it was one advantage of his small size .  people who didn t know him tended to discount him as a possible danger  to ignore him .   bigman looked down and saw lucky pushing away from the wall  armand drifting nearby  waiting .    lucky .   he yelled shrilly .   stay away .    his cry was lost in the hubbub  but the dark man s voice as it was lowered in a conversational aside to red summers was not .  bigman caught it .   the dark man said   give the snoop some power  red .  there won t be any excitement .    and summers growled in response   i don t want excitement .  i want armand to finish the job .    bigman didn t get the significance of the short exchange for a moment  but only for a moment .  and then his eyes darted sharply in the direction of red summers  whose hands  held closely against his chest  were manipulating some small object bigman could not identify .    sands of mars .   bigman cried breathlessly .  he sprang back .   you .  summers .  you foul fighting cobber .    this was another one of those tunes when bigman was glad he carried a needle gun even in the face of lucky s disapproval .  lucky considered it an unreliable weapon  as it was too hard to focus accurately  but bigman would sooner doubt the fact that he was as tall as any six footer as doubt his own skill .   when summers didn t turn at bigman s shout  bigman clenched his fist about the weapon  of which only half inch of snout  narrowing to a needlepoint  showed between the second and third fingers of his right hand  and squeezed just tightly enough to activate it .       simultaneously there was a flash of light six inches in front of summers  nose  and a slight pop .  it was not very impressive .  only air molecules were being ionized .  summers jumped  however  and panic  transmitted by the v frog  rose sharply .    everybody   called bigman .   freeze .  freeze .  you split head  underlipped miseries .   another needle gun discharge popped the air  this time over summers  head where all could see it plainly .   few people might have handled needle guns  which were expensive and hard to get licenses for  but everybody knew what a needle gun discharge looked like  if only from subetheric programs  and everyone knew the damage it could do .   it was as though fifty men had stopped breathing .  bigman was bathed in the cold drizzle of human fear from fifty frightened men .  he backed against the wall .  he said   now listen  all of you .  how many of you know that this cobber summers is gimmicking my friend s agrav controls .  this fight is fixed .    summers said desperately  through clenched teeth   you re wrong .  you re wrong .     am i .  you re a brave man  summers  when you ve got fifty against two .  let s see you stay brave against a needle gun .  they re hard to aim  of course  and i might miss .    he clenched his fist again  and this time the pop of the discharge was sharply ear splitting and the flash dazzled all the spectators but bigman  who  of them all  was the only one who knew exactly when to close his eyes for a moment .   summers emitted a strangled yell .  he was untouched except that the top button on his shirt was gone .       bigman said   nice aiming if i do say so myself  but i suppose having a run of luck is too much to ask .  i d advise you not to move  summers .  pretend you re stone  you cobber  because if you do move  i ll miss and feeling a chunk of your skin go will hurt you worse than just losing a button .    summers closed his eyes .  his forehead was glistening with perspiration .  bigman calculated the distance and clenched twice .   pow .  smack .  two more buttons gone .    sands of mars  my lucky day .  isn t it nice that you ve arranged to have no one come around to interfere .  well  one more   for the road .    and this tune summers yelled in agony .  there was a rent in the shirt and reddened skin showed .    aw   said bigman   not on the nose .  now i m rattled and i ll probably miss the next by two inches  .  .  .  unless you re ready to say something  summers .     all right   yelled the other .    i ve fixed it .    bigman said mildly   your man was heavier .  your man had experience and still you couldn t leave it a fair fight .  you don t take any chances  do you .  drop what you re holding  .   .   .  don t the rest of you move  though .  from here on in  it s a fair fight in the corridor .  no one s moving until someone climbs out of the corridor .    he paused and glared as his fist with the needle gun moved slowly from side to side .   but if it s your ball of gristle that comes back  i ll just be a bit disappointed .  and when i m disappointed  there s no telling what i ll do .  i just might be disappointed and mad enough to fire this needle gun into the crowd  and there isn t a thing in the world any of you can do to stop me from      clenching my fist ten times .  so if there are ten of you bored with living  just hope that your boy beats lucky starr .    bigman waited there desperately  his right hand holding the needle gun  his left arm crooked over the v frog in its container .  he longed to order summers to bring the two men back  to end the fight  but he dared not risk lucky s anger .  he knew lucky well enough to know that the fight couldn t be allowed to end by default on lucky s side .   a figure whizzed past the line of sight  then another .  there was a crash as of a body hitting a wall  then a second and a third .  then silence .   a figure drifted back  with a second gripped firmly by one ankle .   the person in control came lightly out into the corridor  the person being held followed and dropped like a sack of sand .   bigman let out a shout .  the man standing was lucky .  his cheek was bruised and he limped  but it was armand who was unconscious .   they brought armand back to consciousness with some difficulty .  he had a lump on his skull resembling a small grapefruit  and one eye was swollen closed .  though his lower lip was bleeding  he managed a painful smile and said   by jupiter  this kid s a wildcat .    he got to his feet and threw his arms about lucky in a bear hug .   it was like tangling with ten men after he got his bearings .  he s all right .    surprisingly  the men were cheering wildly .  the v frog transmitted relief first  swallowed up at once by excitement .       armand s smile widened  and he dabbed at the blood with the back of his hand .   this councilman is all right .  anyone who still doesn t like him has to fight me  too .  where s red .    but red summers was gone .  so was the instrument he had dropped at bigman s order .   annand said   listen  mr .  starr  i ve got to tell you .  this wasn t my idea  but red said we had to get rid of you or you d make trouble for all of us .    lucky raised his hand .   that s a mistake .  listen  all of you .  there ll be no trouble for any loyal earthman .  i guarantee it .  this fight is off the record .  it was a bit of excitement  but we can forget it .  next time we meet  we all meet fresh .  nothing s happened .  right .    they cheered madly and there were shouts of  he s all right  and  up the council .    lucky was turning to go when armand said   hey  wait .   he drew in a vast breath and pointed a thick finger .   what s this .   he was pointing to the v frog .    a venusian animal   said lucky .   a pet of ours .     it s cute .   the giant simpered down at it .  the others crowded close to stare at it and make appreciative comments  to seize lucky s hand and assure him that they had been on his side all along .   bigman  outraged at the shoving  finally yelled   let s get to quarters  lucky  or i swear i ll kill a few of these guys .    there was an instant silence and men squeezed back to make a path for lucky and bigman .   lucky winced as bigman applied cold water to the bruised cheek in the privacy of their quarters .        he said   some of the men were saying something about needle guns in that final crush  but in the confusion i didn t get the story straight .  suppose you tell me  bigman .    reluctantly bigman explained the circumstances .   lucky said thoughtfully   i realized that my controls were off  but i assumed mechanical failure particularly since they came back after my second fall .  i didn t know you and red summers were fighting it out over me .    bigman grinned .   space  lucky  you didn t think i d let that character pull a trick like that .     there might have been some way other than needle guns .     nothing else would have frozen them so   said bigman  aggrieved .   did you want me to shake my finger at them and say   naughty  naughty .   besides  i had to scare the green bejeebies out of them .     why .   lucky said sharply .    sands of mars  lucky  you spotted the other guy two falls when the fighting was fixed  and i didn t know if you had enough left to make out .  i was going to make summers call the fight off .     that would have been bad  bigman .  we would have gained nothing .  there would have been men convinced the cry of  foul  was an unsportsmanlike fake .     i knew you d figure that  but i was nervous .     no need to be .  after my controls started responding properly  things went fairly well .  armand was certain he had me  and when he found there was still fight in me  the fight seemed to go out of him .  that happens sometimes with people who have never had to lose .       when they don t win at once  it confuses them  and they don t win at all .     yes  lucky   said bigman  grinning .   lucky was silent for a minute or two  then he said   i don t like that  yes  lucky .   what did you do .     well     bigman applied the final touch of flesh tint to hide the bruise and stepped back to consider his handiwork critically    i couldn t help but hope that you d win  now could i .     no  i suppose not .     and i told everyone in that place that if armand won  i would shoot as many of them as i could .     you weren t serious .     maybe i was .  anyway  they thought i was  they were sure i was after they saw me needle four buttons off that cobber s shirt .  so there were fifty guys there  even including summers  who were sweating themselves blind hoping you would win and armand lose .    lucky said   so that s it .     well  i couldn t help it if the v frog was there and transmitted all those thoughts to you too  could i .     so all the fight went out of armand because his mind was blanketed with wishes he would lose .   lucky looked chagrined .    remember  lucky .  two foul falls .  it wasn t a fair fight .     yes  i know .  well  maybe i needed the help at that .    the door signal flashed at that moment  and lucky raised his eyebrows .   who s this  i wonder .   he pressed the button that retracted the door into its slot .   a chunky man  with thinning hair and china blue       eyes that stared at them unblinkingly  stood in the doorway .  in one hand he held an oddly shaped piece of gleaming metal  which his limber fingers turned end for end .  occasionally the piece ducked between fingers  traveling from thumb to pinkie and back as though it had a life of its own .  bigman found himself watching it  fascinated .   the man said   my name is harry norrich .  i m your next door neighbor .     good day   said lucky .    you re lucky starr and bigman jones  aren t you .  would you care to come to my place a few minutes .  visit a bit  have a drink .     that s kind of you   said lucky .   we ll be glad to join you .    norrich turned somewhat stiffly and led the way down the corridor to the next door .  one hand touched the corridor wall occasionally .  lucky and bigman followed  the latter holding the v frog .    won t you come in  gentlemen .   he stood aside to let them enter .   please sit down .  i ve heard a great deal about you already .     like what .   asked bigman .    like lucky s fight with big armand and bigman s marksmanship with a needle gun .  it s all over the place .  i doubt there s anyone on jupiter nine who won t hear of it by morning .  it s one of the reasons i asked you in .  i wanted to talk to you about it .    he poured a reddish liquor carefully into two small glasses and offered them .  for a moment lucky put his hand some three inches to one side of the glass  waited without result  then reached over and took it from norrich s hand .  lucky put the drink to one side .        what s that on your worktable .   asked bigman .   norrich s room  in addition to the usual furnishings  had something that looked like a worktable running the length of one wall with a bench before it .  on the work table was a series of metal gimmicks spread out loosely  and in the center was an odd structure  six inches high and very uneven hi outline .    this thing .   norrich s hand slid delicately along the surface of the table and came to rest on the structure .   it s a threedee .     a what .     a three dimensional jigsaw .  the japanese had them for thousands of years  but they ve never caught on elsewhere .  they re puzzles  made up of a number of pieces that fit together to form some sort of structure .  this one  for instance  will be the model of an agrav generator when it s finished .  i designed and made this puzzle myself .    he lifted the piece of metal he was holding and placed it carefully in a little slot in the structure .  the piece slid in smoothly and held in place .    now you take another piece .   his left hand moved gently over the structure  while his right felt among the loose pieces  came up with one  and moved it into place .   bigman  fascinated  moved forward  then jumped back at a sudden animal howl from beneath the table .   a dog came squirming out from beneath the table and put its forefeet on the bench .  it was a large german shepherd dog and it stood now looking mildly at bigman .   bigman said nervously   here  now  i stepped on it by accident .          it s only mutt   said norrich .   he won t hurt anyone without better cause than being stepped on .  he s my dog .  he s my eyes .     your eyes .    lucky said softly   mr .  norrich is blind  bigman .       death enters the game  bigman shrank back .   i m sorry .     no need to be sorry   norrich said cheerfully .   i m used to it and i can get along .  i m holding a master technician s rank and i m in charge of constructing experimental jigs .  i don t need anyone to help me  either  any more than i need help in my threedees .     i imagine the threedees offer good exercise   said lucky .   bigman said   you mean you can put those things together without even being able to see them .  sands of mars .     it s not as hard as you might think .  i ve been practicing for years and i make them myself so i know the tricks of them .  here  bigman  here s a simple one .  it s just an egg shape .  can you take it apart .    bigman received the light alloy ovoid and turned it in his hands  looking over the pieces that fit together smoothly and neatly .    in fact   norrich went on   the only thing i really need mutt for is to take me along the corridors .   he leaned down to scratch the dog behind one ear  and        the dog permitted it  opening his mouth wide in a sleepy yawn  showing large white fangs and a length of pink lolling tongue .  lucky could feel the warm thickness of norrich s affection for the dog pour out via the v frog .    i can t use the agrav corridors   norrich said   since i d have no way of telling when to decelerate  so i have to walk through ordinary corridors and mutt guides me .  it makes for the long way around  but it s good exercise  and with all the walking mutt and i know jupiter nine better than anybody  don t we  mutt .   .  .  .  have you got it yet  bigman .     no   said bigman .   it s all one piece .     not really .  here  give it to me .    bigman handed it over  and norrich s skinful fingers flew over the surface .   see this little square bit here .  you push it and it goes in a bit .  grab the part that comes out the other end  give it half a turn clockwise  and it pulls out altogether .  see .  now the rest conies apart easily .  this  then this  then this  and so on .  lin   up the pieces in order as they come out  there are only eight of them  then put them back in reverse order .  put the key piece in last  and it will lock everything into place .    bigman stared dubiously at the individual pieces and bent close over them .   lucky said   i believe you wanted to discuss the reception committee i met up with when i arrived  mr .  norrich .  you said you wanted to talk about my fight with armand .     yes  councilman  yes .  i wanted you to understand .  i ve been here on jupiter nine since agrav project started and i know the men .  some leave when their hitch is up  some stay on  greenhorns join up  but       they re all the same in one way .  they re very insecure .     why .     for several reasons .  in the first place  there is danger involved in the project .  we ve had dozens of accidents and lost hundreds of men .  i lost my eyes five years ago and i was fortunate in a way .  i might have died .  secondly  the men are isolated from friends and family while they re here .  really isolated .    lucky said   i imagine there are some people who enjoy the isolation .    he smiled grimly as he said that .  it was no secret that men who in one way or another had gotten entangled with the law sometimes managed to find work on some of the pioneer worlds .  people were always needed to work under domes in artificial atmospheres with pseu do grav fields  and those who volunteered were usually not asked too many questions .  nor was there anything very wrong with that .  such volunteers aided earth and its people under difficult conditions  and that  in a way  was a payment for misdeeds .   norrich nodded at lucky s words .   i see you re not naive about it and i m glad .  leaving the officers and the professional engineers to one side  i imagine a good half of the men here have criminal records on earth  and most of the rest might have such records if the police knew everything .  i doubt that one in five gives his real name .  anyway  you see where tension comes in when investigator after investigator arrives .  you re all looking for sirian spies  we know that  but each man thinks that maybe his own particular trouble will come out and he ll be dragged back to jail on earth .  they all want to go back to earth  but they want to go back anonymously  not at the other end of a set of wrist      locks .  that s why red summers could rouse them so .     and is summers something special that he takes the lead .  a particularly bad record on earth .    bigman looked up briefly from his threedee to say bitterly   murder  maybe .     no   said norrich with instant energy .   you ve got to understand about summers .  he s had an unfortunate life  broken home  no real parents .  he got into the wrong crowds .  he s been in prison  yes  for being involved in some minor rackets .  if he d stayed on earth  his life would have been one long waste .  but he s come to jupiter nine .  he s made a new life here .  he came out as a common laborer and he educated himself .  he s learned low grav construction engineering  force field mechanics  and agrav techniques .  he s been promoted to a responsible position and has done wonderful work .  he s respectable  admired  well liked .  he s found out what it is to have honor and position and he dreads nothing more than the thought of going back to earth and his old life .     sure  he hates it so much   said bigman   that he tried to kill lucky by gimmicking the fight .     yes   said norrich  frowning   i heard he was using a sub phase oscillator to kill the councilman s control response .  that was stupid of him  but he was in panic .  look  fundamentally the man is goodhearted .  when my old mutt died       your old mutt .   asked lucky .    i had a seeing eye dog before this one which i also called mutt .  it died in a force field short circuit that killed two men besides .  he shouldn t have been there  but sometimes a dog will wander off on his own adventures .  this one does  too  when i m not using him        but he always comes back .   he leaned down to slap his dog s flank lightly  and mutt closed one eye and thumped his tail against the floor .    anyway  after old mutt died  it looked for a while as though i mightn t get another and i would have to be sent home .  i m no use here without one .  seeing eye dogs are in short supply  there are waiting lists .  the administration here at jupiter nine didn t want to pull any strings because they weren t anxious to publicize the fact that they were employing a blind man as construction engineer .  the economy bloc in congress is always waiting for something like that to make bad publicity out of .  so it was summers who came through .  he used some contacts he had on earth and got me mutt here .  it wasn t exactly legal  it was even what you might call the black market  but summers risked his position here to do a friend a favor and i owe him a great deal .  i m hoping you ll remember summers can do and has done things like that and that you ll go easy on him for his actions earlier today .    lucky said   i m not taking any action against him .  i had no intention of doing so even before our conversation .  still  i m sure that summers  real name and record are known to the council and i ll be checking on the facts .    norrich flushed   by all means  do so .  you ll find he s not so bad .     i hope so .  but tell me something .  through all that has just taken place  there was no attempt on the part of the project administration to interfere .  do you find this strange .    norrich laughed shortly .   not at all .  i don t think commander donahue would have cared much if you d      been killed  except for the trouble it would have taken to hush it up .  he s got bigger troubles on his mind than you or your investigation .     bigger troubles .     sure .  the head of this project is changed every year  army policy of rotation .  donahue is the sixth boss we ve had and far and away the best .  i ve got to say that .  he s cut through red tape and he hasn t tried to make an army camp out of the project .  he s given the men leeway and let them raise a bit of cain now and then so he s gotten results .  now the first agrav ship will be ready to take off any time .  some say it s a matter of days .     that soon .     could be .  but the point is that commander donahue is due to be relieved in less than a month .  a delay now could mean that the launching of the agrav ship won t take place until donahue s successor comes in .  donahue s successor would get to ride in it  have the fame  go down in the history books  and donahue would miss out .     no wonder he didn t want you on jupiter nine   bigman said hotly .   no wonder he didn t want you  lucky .    lucky shrugged .   don t waste temper  bigman .    but bigman said   the dirty cobber .  sirius can gobble up earth for all he cares as long as he can get to ride his miserable ship .   he lifted a clenched fist  and there was a muted growl from mutt .   norrich said sharply   what are you doing  bigman .     what .   bigman was genuinely astonished .   i m not doing a thing .          are you making a threatening gesture .    bigman lowered his arm quickly .   not really .     you ve got to be careful around mutt .  he s been trained to take care of me .   .   .   .  look  i ll show you .  just step toward me and make believe you re going to throw a punch at me .    lucky said   that s not necessary .  we understand       please   said norrich .   there s no danger .  i ll stop mutt in time .  as a matter of fact  it s good practice for him .  everyone on the project is so careful of me that i swear i don t know if he remembers his training .  go ahead  bigman .    bigman stepped forward and raised his arm halfheartedly .  at once mutt s ears flattened  his eyes slitted  his fangs stood sharply revealed  his leg muscles tensed for a spring  and a harsh growl issued from the recesses of his throat .   bigman drew back hastily  and norrich said   down  mutt .   the dog subsided .  lucky could sense  clearly  the gathering and relaxation of tension in bigman s mind and the fond triumph in norrich s .   norrish said   how are you doing with the threedee egg  bigman .    the little martian  in exasperation  said   i ve given up .  i ve got two pieces put together and that s all i can do .    norrich laughed .   just a matter of practice  that s all .  look .    he took the two pieces out of bigman s hand and said   no wonder .  you ve got these together wrong .  he flipped one piece end for end  brought the two together again  added another piece and another until he      held seven pieces in the shape of a loose ovoid with a hole through it .  he picked up the eighth and key piece  slipped it in  gave it a half turn counterclockwise  pushed it the rest of the way  and said   finished .    he tossed the completed egg into the air and caught it  while bigman watched in chagrin .   lucky got to his feet .   well  mr .  norrich  we ll be seeing you again .  i ll remember your remarks about summers and the rest .  thank you for the drink .   it still rested untouched on the desk .    nice to have met you   said norrich  rising and shaking hands .   it was some time before lucky could fall asleep .  he lay in the darkness of his room hundreds of feet below the surface of jupiter nine  listening to bigman s soft snoring in the adjoining room  and thought of the events of the day .  over and over them he went .   he was bothered .  something had happened that shouldn t have  or something had not happened that should have .   but he was weary and everything was a bit unreal and twisted in the half world of half sleep .  something hovered at the edge of awareness .  he clutched at it  but it slipped away .   and when morning came there was nothing left of it .   bigman called out to lucky from his own room as lucky was drying himself under the soft jets of warm air after his shower .   the little martian yelled   hey  lucky  i ve recharged the v frog s carbon dioxide supply and dumped in more weed .  you ll be taking it down to our meeting with that blasted commander  won t you .          we certainly will  bigman .     it s all set then .  how about letting me tell the commander what i think of him .     now  bigman .     nuts .  it s me for the shower now .    like all men of the solar system brought up on planets other than earth  bigman reveled in water when he could get at it  and a shower for him was a leisurely  loving experience .  lucky braced himself for a session of the tenor caterwauling that bigman called singing .   the intercom sounded after bigman was well launched into some dubious fragment of melody that sounded piercingly off key and just as lucky completed dressing .   lucky stepped to it and activated reception .   starr speaking .     starr .   commander donahue s lined face showed in the visi panel .  his lips were narrow and compressed and his whole expression was one of antagonism as he gazed at lucky .   i have heard some story of a fight between yourself and one of our workers .     yes .     i see you have not been hurt .    lucky smiled .   all s well .     you ll remember i warned you .     i am making no complaints .     since you aren t  and in the interest of the project  i would like to ask if you plan making any report concerning it .     unless it turns out to have some direct bearing on the problem which concerns me here  the incident will never be mentioned by me .     good .   donahue looked suddenly relieved .   i won       der if i could extend that attitude to our meeting this morning .  our meeting might be taped for confidential records and i would prefer       there will be no need to discuss the matter  commander .     very good .   the commander relaxed into what was almost cordiality .   i ll be seeing you in an hour then .    lucky was dimly aware that bigman s shower had stopped and that his singing had subsided to a humming .  now the humming stopped  too  and there was a moment of silence .   lucky said into the transmitter   yes  commander  good     when bigman exploded into a wild  near incoherent shout    lucky .    lucky was on his feet with smooth speed and at the door connecting the two rooms in two strides .   but bigman was in the doorway before him  eyes big with horror .   lucky .  the v frog .  it s dead .  it s been killed .       a robot enters the game  the v frog s plastic cage was shattered and shriveled  and the floor was wet with its watery contents .  the v frog  half covered with the fronds it fed upon  was quite  quite dead .   now that it was dead and unable to control emotion  lucky could look at it without the enforced fondness that he  as well as all others that came within its radius of influence  had felt .  he felt anger  however   mostly at himself for having allowed himself to be overreached .   bigman  fresh from his shower  with only his shorts on  clenched and unclenched his fists .   it s my fault  lucky .  it s all my fault .  i was yelling so loud in the shower i never heard anyone come in .    the phrase  come in  was not quite appropriate .  the killer had not simply come in  he had burnt his way in .  the lock controls were fused and melted away with what had obviously been an energy projector of fairly large caliber .   lucky stepped back to the interphone .   commander donahue .             yes  what happened .  is anything wrong .    i ll see you in an hour .   he broke connections and returned to the grieving bigman .  he said somberly   it s my fault  bigman .  uncle hector said the sirians had not yet discovered the facts concerning the emotional powers of the v frog  and i accepted that too thoroughly .  if i had been a little less optimistic about sirian ignorance  neither one of us would ever have left that little creature out of our sight for a second .    lieutenant nevsky called for them  standing at attention as lucky and bigman left their quarters .   he said in a low voice   i am glad  sir  that you were unharmed in yesterday s encounter .  i would not have left you  sir  had you not strictly ordered me to .     forget it  lieutenant   lucky said absently .  his mind kept returning to that moment just before sleep the preceding night when  for a brief instant  a thought had hovered at the outskirts of consciousness  then vanished .  but it would not come now  and finally lucky s mind sped to other matters .   they had entered the agrav corridor now  and this time it seemed crowded with men  streaming accurately and unconcernedly in both directions .  there was a  beginning of the work day  atmosphere all about .  though men worked underground here and there was no day or night  yet the old twenty four hour schedule held .  mankind brought the familiar rotation of the earth to all the worlds on which he lived .  and though men might work in shifts the clock round  the largest number always worked on the  day shift  from nine to five  solar standard time .   it was nearly nine now  and there was a bustle       through the agrav corridors as men traveled to the work posts .  there was a feel of  morning  almost as strong as though there were a sun low in the eastern sky and dew on the grass .   two men were sitting at the table when lucky and bigman entered the conference room .  one was commander donahue  whose face bore the appearance of a carefully controlled tension .  the commander rose and coldly introduced the other  james panner  the chief engineer and civilian head of the project .  panner was a stocky man with a swarthy face  dark deep set eyes  and a bull neck .  he wore a dark shirt open at the collar and without insignia of any sort .   lieutenant nevsky saluted and retired .  commander donahue watched the door close and said   since that leaves the four of us  let s get to business .     the four of us and a cat   said lucky  stroking a small creature that hitched its forepaws on the table and stared at him solemnly .   this isn t the same cat i saw yesterday  is it .    the commander frowned .   perhaps .  perhaps not .  we have a number of cats on the satellite .  however  i presume we re not here to discuss pets .    lucky said   on the contrary  commander  i think it will do as a topic of conversation to begin with and i chose it deliberately .  do you remember my own pet  sir .     your little venusian creature .   said the commander with sudden warmth .   i remember it .  it was     he stopped in confusion as though wondering  in the v frog s absence  what the reason for his enthusiasm concerning it might be .        the little venusian creature   said lucky   had peculiar abilities .  it could detect emotion .  it could transmit emotion .  it could even impose emotion .    the commander s eyes opened wide  but panner said in a husky voice   i once heard a rumor to that effect  councilman .  i laughed .     you needn t have .  it is true .  in fact  commander donahue  my purpose in asking for this interview was to make arrangements to have every man on the project interviewed by me in the presence of the v frog .  i wanted an emotional analysis .    the commander still seemed half stunned .   what would that prove .     perhaps nothing .  still  i meant to try it .    panner intervened .   meant to try it .  you use the past tense  councilman starr .    lucky stared solemnly at the two project officials .   my v frog is dead .    bigman said furiously   killed this morning .    the commander said   who killed it .     we don t know  commander .    the commander sat back in his chair .   then your little investigation is over  i suppose  till the animal can be replaced .    lucky said   there will be no waiting .  the mere fact of the v frog s death has told me a great deal  and the matter becomes much more serious .     what do you mean .    all stared .  even bigman looked up at lucky in profound surprise .   lucky said   i told you that the v frog has the capacity to impose emotion .  you yourself  commander donahue  experienced that .  do you recall your feelings       when you saw the v frog on my ship yesterday .  you were under considerable strain  yet when you saw the v frog    do you remember your feelings  sir .     i was rather taken with the creature   the commander faltered .    can you think why  as you look back at the moment now .     no  come to think of it .  ugly creature .     yet you liked it .  you couldn t help yourself .  could you have harmed it .     i suppose not .     i m certain you couldn t .  no one with emotions could have .  yet someone did .  someone killed it .    panner said   do you intend to explain the paradox .     easily explained .  no one with emotions  a robot  however  does not have emotions .  suppose that somewhere on jupiter nine there is a robot  a mechanical man  in the perfect form of a human being .     you mean a humanoid .   exploded commander donahue .   impossible .  such things exist only in fairy tales .    lucky said   i think  commander  you are not aware of how skillful the sirians are in the manufacture of robots .  i think they might be able to use some man on jupiter nine  some thoroughly loyal man  as model  build a robot in his shape and substitute it for him .  such a humanoid robot could have special senses that would enable it to be the perfect spy .  it might  for instance  be able to see in the dark or sense things through thicknesses of matter .  it would certainly be able to transmit information through the subether by some built in device .    the commander shook his head .   ridiculous .  a man      could easily have killed the v frog .  a desperate man frightened to an extreme might have overcome this    this mental influence the animal exerted .  have you thought of that .     yes  i have   said lucky .   but why should a man be so desperate  why so wild to kill a harmless v frog .  the most obvious reason is that the v frog represented a desperate danger  that it was not harmless at all .  the only danger a v frog might have to the killer would involve the animal s capacity to detect and transmit the killer s emotions .  suppose those emotions would be an immediate giveaway to the fact that the killer was a spy .     how could it be .   panner asked .   lucky turned to look at him .   what if our killer had no emotions at all .  wouldn t a man without emotions be revealed at once as a robot .   .  .  .  or take it another way altogether .  why kill only the v frog .  having gotten into our rooms  having risked so much  having found one of us in the shower and one at the intercom and both unsuspecting and unready  why did not the killer kill us instead of the v frog .  for that matter  why not kill us and the v frog .     no time  probably   said the commander .    there s another and more plausible reason   said lucky .   do you know the three laws of robotics  the rules of behavior that all robots are built to follow .     i know them generally   the commander said .   i can t quote them .     i can   said lucky   and with your permission i will  so that i may make a point .  the first law is this  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  the       second law is  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .  the third law is  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .    panner nodded .   all right  councilman  what does that prove .     a robot can be ordered to kill the v frog  which is an animal .  it will risk its existence  since self preservation is only third law  to obey orders  which is second law .  but it cannot be ordered to kill bigman or myself  since we are humans  and first law takes precedence over all .  a human spy would have killed us and the v frog  a robot spy would have killed only the v frog .  it all points to the same thing  commander .    the commander considered that for long minutes  sitting motionless  the lines on his tired face grooving deeper .  then he said   what do you propose to do .  x ray every man on the project .     no   said lucky at once .   it s not that simple .  successful espionage is going on elsewhere than here .  if there is a humanoid robot here  there are probably others elsewhere .  it would be well to catch as many of the humanoids as possible  all of them if we can .  if we act too eagerly and openly to catch the one under our hands  the others may be snatched away for use at another time .     then what do you propose doing .     to work slowly .  once you suspect a robot  there are ways of making it give itself away without its being aware of it .  and i don t start completely from scratch .  for instance  commander  i know you are not a robot       since i detected emotion in you yesterday .  in fact  i deliberately induced anger in you to test my v frog  and for that i ask your pardon .    donahue s face had gone mauve .   i  a robot .     as i said  i used you only to test my v frog .    panner said dryly   you have no reason to feel sure about me  councilman .  i never faced your v frog .     that is right   said lucky .   you are not cleared yet .  remove your shirt .     what .   cried panner indignantly .   why .    lucky said mildly   you have just been cleared .  a robot would have had to obey that order .    the commander s fist banged down on his desk .   stop it .  this ends right here .  i will not have you testing or annoying my men in any way .  i have a job to do on this satellite  councilman starr  i have an agrav ship to get into space  and i m getting it into space .  my men have been investigated and they re clear .  your story about a robot is flimsy  and i m not going along with it .    i told you yesterday  starr  that i didn t want you on this satellite disturbing my men and wrecking their morale .  you saw fit yesterday to address me in insulting fashion .  you say now it was just to test your animal  which makes it no less insulting .  for that reason  i feel no need to co operate with you and i am not doing so .  let me tell you exactly what i have done .    i ve cut off all communication with earth .  i ve put jupiter nine under emergency orders .  i have the powers of a military dictator now .  do you understand .    lucky s eyes narrowed a trifle .   as councilman of the council of science  i outrank you .     how do you intend to enforce your rank .  my men      will obey me and they have their orders .  you will be restrained forcibly if you try in any way  by word or deed  to interfere with my orders .     and what are your orders .     tomorrow   said commander donahue   at   p . m .   solar standard time  the first functioning agrav ship in existence will make its first flight from jupiter nine to jupiter one  the satellite lo .  after we re back    after we re back  councilman starr  and not one hour sooner   you may conduct your investigation .  and if you then want to get in touch with earth and arrange court martial proceedings  i will be ready for you .    commander donahue stared firmly at lucky starr .   lucky said to panner   is the ship ready .    pfanner said   i think so .    donahue said scornfully .   we leave tomorrow .  well  councilman starr  do you go along with me or will i have to have you arrested .    the silence that followed was a tense one .  bigman virtually held his breath .  the commander s hands were clenching and unclenching  and his nose was white and pinched .  panner slowly fumbled a stick of gum out of his shirt pocket  stripped it of its plastofoil coating with one hand  and crumpled it into his mouth .   and then lucky clasped his hands loosely  sat back in his chair  and said   i ll be glad to co operate with you  commander .       blindness  bigman was at once outraged .   lucky .  are you going to let him stop the investigation just like that .    lucky said   not exactly  bigman .  we ll be on board the agrav ship and we ll continue it there .     no sir   the commander said flatly   you will not be on board .  don t think that for an instant .    lucky said   who will be on board  commander .  yourself  i presume .     myself .  also panner  as chief engineer .  two of my officers  five other engineers  and five ordinary crewmen .  all these were chosen some time ago .  myself and panner  as responsible heads of the project  the five engineers to handle the ship itself  the remainder in return for their services to the project .    lucky said thoughtfully   what type of service .    panner interrupted to say   the best example of what the commander is talking about is harry norrich  who      bigman stiffened in surprise .   you mean the blind fellow .            panner said   you know him then .     we met him last evening   said lucky .    well   said panner   norrich was here at the very beginning of the project .  he lost his sight when he threw himself between two contacts to keep a force field from buckling .  he was in the hospital five months and his eyes were the one part of him that couldn t be restored .  by his act of bravery  he kept the satellite from having a chunk the size of a mountain blown out of it .  he saved the lives of two hundred people and he saved the project  since a major accident at the beginning might have made it impossible to get further appropriations out of congress .  that sort of thing is what earns one the honor of a place on the maiden voyage of the agrav ship .     it s a shame he won t be able to see jupiter up close   said bigman .  then  his eyes narrowing   how ll he get around on board ship .    panner said   we ll be taking mutt  fm sure .  he s a well behaved dog .     that s all i want to know then   said bigman heatedly .   if you cobbers can take a dog  you can take lucky and me .    commander donahue was looking at his wristwatch impatiently .  now he put the palms of his hands flat on the table  and made as though to rise .   we have finished our business then  gentlemen .     not quite   lucky said .   there s one little point to be cleared up .  bigman puts it crudely  but he s quite right .  he and i will be on the agrav ship when it leaves .     no   said commander donahue .   impossible .          is the added mass of two individuals too great for the ship to handle .    panner laughed .   we could move a mountain .     do you lack room then .    the commander stared at lucky in hard displeasure .   i will not give any reason .  you are not being taken only because it is my decision that you not be taken .  is that clear .    there was a glint of satisfaction in his eyes  and lucky did not find it hard to guess that he was squaring accounts for the tongue lashing lucky had given him aboard the lucky starr .   lucky said quietly   you had better take us  commander .    donahue smiled sardonically .   why .  am i to be relieved of duty at the orders of the council of science .  you won t be able to communicate with earth till i return  and after that they can relieve me of duty if they wish .     i don t think you ve thought it through  commander   said lucky .   they might relieve you of duty retroactive to this moment .  in fact  i assure you they will do so .  as far as the government records are concerned  then  it will appear that agrav ship made its first flight not under your command but under the command  officially  of your successor  whoever he might be .  the records of the trip might even be adjusted to show  officially  that you were not on board .    commander donahue went white .  he rose and for a moment seemed on the point of throwing himself bodily at lucky .   lucky said   your decision  commander .        donahue s voice was most unnatural when it finally came .   you may come .    lucky spent the remainder of the day in the record rooms  studying the files on various men employed on the project  while bigman  under panner s guidance  was taken from laboratory to laboratory and through tremendous testing rooms .   it was only after the evening meal when they returned to quarters that they had a chance to be alone together .  lucky s silence then was not extraordinary  since the young councilman was never talkative at the best of times  but there was a small crease between his eyes that bigman recognized as a sure sign of concern .   bigman said   we aren t making any progress  are we  lucky .    lucky shook his head   nothing startling  i ll admit    he had brought a book film with him from the project s library  and bigman caught a flash of its title  advanced robotics .  methodically lucky threaded the beginnings of the film through the viewer .   bigman stirred restlessly .   are you going to be all tied up with that film  lucky .     i m afraid so  bigman .     do you mind then if i visit norrich next door for company .     go ahead .   lucky had the viewer over his eyes and he was leaning back  his arms crossed loosely across his chest .   bigman closed the door and remained standing just outside for a moment  a little nervous .  he should discuss this with lucky first  he knew he should  and yet the temptation .  .  .        he told himself  i m not going to do anything .  i ll just check something .  if i m wrong  i m wrong and why bother lucky .  but if it checks out  then i ll really have something to tell him .   the door opened at once when he rang  and there was norrich  blind eyes fixed in the direction of the doorway  seated before a desk on which a checkerboard design carried odd figures .   he said   yes .     this is bigman   said the little martian .    bigman .  come in .  sit down .  is councilman starr with you .    the door closed again  and bigman looked about in the brightly lit room .  his mouth tightened .   he s busy .  but as for me  i m filled up on agrav today .  dr .  panner took me all over  only i don t understand a thing of it hardly .    norrich smiled .   you re not exactly in a minority  but if you ignore the mathematics  some of it isn t too hard to understand .     no .  mind explaining it then .   bigman sat down in a large chair and bent to look under norrich s workbench .  mutt lay there with his head between his fore paws and one eye brightly fixed on bigman .    keep him talking  thought bigman .  keep him talking till i find a hole  or make one .     look here   norrich said .  he held up one of the round counters he had been holding .   gravity is a form of energy .  an object  such as this piece i m holding which is under the influence of a gravitational field but is not allowed to move is said to have potential energy .  if i were to release the piece  that potential energy would be converted to motion   or kinetic energy  as it      is called .  since it continues under the influence of the gravitational field as it falls  it falls faster and faster and faster .   he dropped the counter at this point  and it fell .    until  splash   said bigman .  the counter hit the floor and rolled .   norrich bent as though to retrieve it and then said   would you get it for me  bigman .  i m not sure where it rolled .    bigman suppressed his disappointment .  he picked it up and returned it .   norrich said   now until recently that was the only thing that could be done with potential energy  it could be converted into kinetic energy .  of course the kinetic energy could be used further .  for instance  the falling water of niagara falls could be used to form electricity  but that s a different thing .  in space  gravity results in motion and that ends it .    consider the jovian system of moons .  we re at jupiter nine  way out .  fifteen million miles out .  with respect to jupiter  we ve got a tremendous quantity of potential energy .  if we try to travel to jupiter one  the satellite io  which is only         miles from jupiter  we are in a way  falling all those millions of miles .  we pick up tremendous speeds which we must continually counteract by pushing in the opposite direction with a hyperatomic motor .  it takes enormous energy .  then  if we miss our mark by a bit  we re in constant danger of continuing to fall  in which case there s only one place to go  and that s jupiter   and jupiter is instant death .  then  even if we land safely on lo  there s the problem of getting back to jupiter nine  which means       lifting ourselves all those millions of miles against jupiter s gravity .  the amount of energy required to maneuver among jupiter s moons is just prohibitive .     and agrav .   asked bigman .    ah .  now that s a different thing .  once you use an agrav converter  potential energy can be converted into forms of energy other than kinetic energy .  in the agrav corridor  for instance  the force of gravity in one direction is used to charge the gravitational field in the other direction as you fall .  people falling in one direction provide the energy for people falling in the other .  by bleeding off the energy that way  you yourself  while falling  need never speed up .  you can fall at any velocity less than the natural falling velocity .  you see .    bigman wasn t quite sure he did but he said   go on .     in space it s different .  there s no second gravitational field to shift the energy to .  instead  it is con   verted to hyperatomic field energy and stored so .  by doing this  a space ship can drop from jupiter nine to io at any speed less than the natural falling speed without having to use any energy to decelerate .  virtually no energy is expended except in the final adjustment to io s orbital speed .  and safety is complete  since the ship is always under perfect control .  jupiter s gravity could be completely blanketed  if necessary .    going back to jupiter nine still requires energy .  there is no getting around that .  but now you can use the energy you had previously stored in the hyperatomic field condenser to get you back .  the energy of jupiter s own gravitational field is used to kick you back .    bigman said   it sounds good .   he squirmed in his      seat .  he wasn t getting anywhere .  suddenly he said   what s that you re fooling with on your desk .     chess   said norrich .   do you play .     a little   bigman confessed .   lucky taught me  but it s no fun playing with him .  he always wins .   then he asked  offhand   how can you play chess .     you mean because i m blind .     uh       it s all right .  i m not sensitive about being blind .   .  .  .  it s easy enough to explain .  this board is magnetized and the pieces are made of a light magnetic alloy so that they stick where they re put and don t go tumbling if i move my arm about carelessly .  here  try it  bigman .    bigman reached for one of the pieces .  it came up as though stuck in syrup for a quarter of an inch or so  then was free .    and you see   said norrich   they re not ordinary chess pieces .     more like checkers   grunted bigman .    again so i don t knock them over .  they re not completely flat  though .  they ve got raised designs which i can identify easily enough by touch and which resemble the ordinary pieces closely enough so that other people can learn them in a moment and play with me .  see for yourself .        bigman had no trouble .  the circle of raised points was obviously the queen  while the little cross in the center of another piece signified the king .  the pieces with grooves slanting across were the bishops  the raised circle of squares the rooks  the pointed horse s ears the knights  and the simple round knobs the pawns .       bigman felt stymied .  he said   what are you doing now .  playing a game by yourself .     no  solving a problem .  the pieces are arranged just so  you see  and there s one way and only one in which white can win the game in exactly three moves and i m trying to find that way .    bigman said suddenly   how can you tell white from black .    norrich laughed .   if you ll look closely  you ll see the white pieces are grooved along the rims and the black pieces aren t .     oh .  then you have to remember where all the pieces are  don t you .     that s not hard   norrich said .   it sounds as though you would need a photographic memory  but actually all i have to do is pass my hand over the board and check the pieces any time .  you ll notice the squares are marked off by little grooves  too .    bigman found himself breathing hard .  he had forgotten about the squares on the checkerboard  and they were grooved off .  he felt as though he were playing a kind of a chess game of ms own  one in which he was being badly beaten .    mind if i watch .   he said sharply .   maybe i can figure out the right moves .     by all means   said norrich .   i wish you could .  i ve been at this for half an hour and i m getting frustrated .    there was silence for a minute or more  and then bigman rose  his body tense and catlike in its effort to make no noise .  he drew a small flashlight from one pocket and stepped toward the wall in little motions .  norrich never moved from his bowed position over the      chessboard .  bigman threw a quick glance toward mutt  but the dog made no move  either .   bigman reached the wall and  hardly breathing  put one hand lightly and noiselessly over the light patch .  at once  the light in the room went out and a profound darkness rested everywhere .   bigman remembered the direction in which norrich s chair was .  he raised the flashlight .   he heard a muted thump and then norrich s voice calling out in surprise and a little displeasure   why did you put out the light  bigman .     that does it   yelled bigman in triumph .  he let the flashlight s beam shine full on norrich s broad face .   you re not blind at all  you spy .       the agrav ship  norrich cried out   i don t know what you re doing  but space  man  don t do anything sudden or mutt will jump you .     you know exactly what i m doing   said bigman   because you can see well enough i m drawing my needle gun  and i think you ve heard i m a dead shot .  if your dog moves in my direction  it s the end for him .     don t hurt mutt .  please .    bigman was taken aback by the sudden anguish in the other s voice .  he said   just keep him quiet then and come with me and no one will be hurt .  we ll go see lucky .  and if we pass anyone in the corridor  don t you say anything but  good day .   i ll be right beside you  you know .    norrich said   i can t go without mutt .     sure you can   said bigman .   it s only five steps down the corridor .  even if you were really blind  you could manage that   a fellow who can do threedees and all .    lucky lifted the viewer from his head at the sound of          the door opening and said   good day  norrich .  where s mutt .    bigman spoke before the other had a chance to answer .   mutt s in norrich s room  and norrich doesn t need him .  sands of mars .  lucky  norrich isn t any blinder than we are .     what .    norrich began   your friend is quite mistaken  mr .  starr .  i want to say      bigman snapped .   quiet  you .  i ll talk  and then when you re invited  you can make some remarks .    lucky folded his arms .   if you don t mind  mr .  norrich  i d like to hear what bigman has on his mind .  and meanwhile  bigman  suppose you put away the needle gun .    bigman did so with a grimace .  he said   look  lucky  i suspected this cobber from the beginning .  those threedee puzzles of his set me to thinking .  he was just a little too good .  i got to wondering right away that he might be the spy .     that s the second time you ve called me a spy   norrich cried .   i won t stand for that .     look  lucky   said bigman  ignoring norrich s outcry   it would be a clever move to have a spy a supposed blind man .  he could see an awful lot no one would think he was seeing .  people wouldn t cover up .  they wouldn t hide things .  he could be staring right at some vital document and they d think   it s only poor norrich .  he can t see .   more likely they wouldn t give it a thought at all .  sands of mars  it would be a perfect setup .    norrich was looking more astonished with every       moment .   but i am blind .  if it s the threedee puzzles or the chess  i ve explained       oh  sure  you ve explained   bigman said scornfully .   you ve been practicing explanations for years .  how come you sit in the privacy of your room with the lights on  though .  when i walked in  lucky  about half an hour ago  the light was on .  he hadn t just put it on for me .  the switch was too far away from where he was sitting .  why .     why not .   said norrich .   it makes no difference to me whether it s on or not  so it might as well be on as long as i m awake for the convenience of those who come visiting  like you .     all right   said bigman .   that shows how he can think up an explanation for everything   how he can play chess  how he can identify the pieces  everything .  once he almost forgot himself .  he dropped one of his chess pieces and bent to pick it up when he remembered just in time and asked me to do it for him .     usually   said norrich   i can tell where something drops by the sound .  this piece rolled .     go on  explain   said bigman .   it won t help you because there s one thing you can t explain .  lucky  i was going to test him .  i was going to put out the light  then flash my pocketlight in his eyes at full intensity .  if he weren t blind  he d be bound to jump or blink his eyes anyway .  i was sure i d get him .  but i didn t even have to go that far .  as soon as i put out the light  the poor cobber forgets himself and says   why did you put out the light .   .   .  .  how did he know i put out the light  lucky .  how did he know .     but     norrich began .   bigman drove on .   he can feel chess pieces and      threedee puzzles and all that but he can t feel light going out .  he had to see that .    lucky said   i think it s time to let mr .  norrich say something .    norrich said   thank you .  i may be blind  councilman  but my dog is not .  when i put out the light at night  it makes no difference to me  as i said before  but to mutt it signals bedtime and he goes to his own corner .  now i heard bigman tiptoe to the wall in the direction of the light switch .  he was trying to move without sound  but a man who has been blind for five years can hear the lightest tiptoe .  a moment after he stopped walking i heard mutt jump into his corner .  it didn t take much brain power to figure out what had happened .  bigman was standing at the light switch and mutt was turning in for the night .  obviously he had put out the light .    the engineer turned his sightless face in the direction first of bigman  then of lucky  as though straining his ears for an answer .   lucky said   yes  i see .  it seems we owe you an apology .    bigman s gnomelike face screwed up unhappily .   but lucky      lucky shook his head .   let go  bigman .  never hang on to a theory after it s been exploded .  i hope you understand  mr .  norrich  that bigman was only doing what he felt to be his duty .     i wish he had asked a few questions before acting    said norrich  coldly   now may i go .  do you mind .     you may go .  as an official request  however  please make no mention of what has occurred to anyone .  that s quite important .         norrich said   it comes under the heading of false arrest  i imagine  but we ll let it go .  i won t mention this .   he walked to the door  reached the signal patch with a minimum of fumbling  and walked out .   bigman turned almost at once to lucky .   it was a trick .  you shouldn t have let him go .    lucky  rested his chin on the palm of his right hand  and his calm  brown eyes were thoughtful .   no  bigman  he isn t the man we re after .     but he s got to be  lucky .  even if he s blind  really blind  it s an argument against him .  sure  lucky   bigman grew excited again  his small hands clumping into fists   he could get close to the v frog without seeing it .  he could kill it .    lucky shook his head .   no  bigman .  the v frog s mental influence doesn t depend on its being seen .  it s direct mental contact .  that s the one fact we can t get around .   he said slowly   it had to be a robot who did that .  it had to be  and norrich is no robot .     well  how do you know he    .   but bigman stopped .    i see you ve answered your own question .  we sensed his emotion during our first meeting  when the v frog was still with us .  he has emotions  so he s not the robot and he s not the man we re looking for .    but even as he said so  there was a look of deep trouble on his face and he tossed the book film on advanced robotics to one side as though despairing of help from it .   the first agrav ship ever to be built was named jovian moon and it was not like any ship lucky had ever seen .  it was large enough to be a luxury liner of      space  but the crew and passenger quarters were abnormally crowded forward  .  since nine tenths of the ship s volume consisted of the agrav converter and the hyperatomic force field condensers .  from the midsec tion  curved vanes  ridged into a vague resemblance to bat s wings  extended on either side .  five to one side  five to the other  ten in all .   lucky had been told that these vanes  in cutting the lines of force of the gravitational field  converted the gravity into hyperatomic energy .  it was as prosaic as that  and yet they gave the ship an almost sinister appearance .   the ship rested now in a gigantic pit dug into jupiter nine .  the lid  of reinforced concrete  had been retracted  and the whole area was under normal jupiter nine gravity and exposed to the normal airlessness of jupiter nine s surface .   nevertheless the entire personnel of the project  nearly a thousand men  were gathered in this natural amphitheater .  lucky had never seen so many men in space suits at one time .  there was a certain natural excitement because of the occasion  a certain almost hysterical restlessness that manifested itself in horseplay made possible by the low gravity .   lucky thought grimly  and one of those men in space suits is no man at all .   but which one .  and how could he tell .   commander donahue made his short speech of dedication to a group of men grown silent  impressed despite themselves  while lucky  looking up at jupiter  glanced at a small object near it that was not a star but a tiny sliver of light  curved like the paring of a small fingernail  almost too small for the curve to be seen .  if there       had been any air in the way  instead of jupiter nine s airless vacuum  that small curve would have been blurred into a formless spot of light .   lucky knew the tiny crescent to be ganymede  jupiter three  jupiter s largest satellite and worthy moon of the giant planet .  it was nearly three times the size of earth s moon  it was larger than the planet mercury .  it was almost as large as mars .  with the agrav fleet completed  ganymede would quickly become a major world of the solar system .   commander donahue christened the ship at last in a voice husky with emotion  and then the assembled audience  in groups of five and six  entered the air filled interior of the satellite through the various locks .   only those who were to be aboard the jovian moon remained .  one by one they climbed the ramp to the entrance lock  commander donahue first .   lucky and bigman were last to board .  commander donahue turned away from the air lock as they entered  stiffly unfriendly .   bigman leaned toward lucky  to say tightly   did you notice  lucky  that red summers is on board .     i know .     he s the cobber who tried to kill you .     i know  bigman .    the ship was lifting now in what was at first a majestic creep .  the surface gravity of jupiter nine was only one eightieth of earth  and though the weight of the ship was still in the hundreds of tons  that was not the cause of the initial slowness .  even were gravity absent altogether  the ship would still retain its full content of matter and all the inertia that went with it .  it       would still be just as hard to put all that matter into motion  or  if it came to that  to stop it or change its direction of travel  once it had begun moving .   but first slowly  then more and more rapidly  the pit was left behind .  jupiter nine shrank beneath them and became visible in the visiplatps as a rugged gray rock .  the constellations powdered the black sky and jupiter was a bright marble .   james panner approached them and placed an arm on the shoulder of each man .   would you two gentlemen care to join me in my cabin for a meal .  there ll be nothing to watch here in the viewing room for a while .   his wide mouth pulled back in a grin that swelled the cords of his thick neck and made it seem no neck at all but a mere continuation of head .    thank you   lucky said .   it s kind of you to invite us .     well   said panner   the commander isn t going to and the men are a little leery of you  too .  i don t want you to get too lonely .  it will be a long trip .     aren t you leery of me  dr .  panner .   lucky asked dryly .    of course not .  you tested me  remember  and i passed .    panner s cabin was a small one in which the three barely fitted .  it was obvious that the quarters in this  the first agrav ship  were as cramped as engineering ingenuity could make them .  panner broke out three cans of ship ration  the concentrated food that was universally eaten on space ships .  it was almost home to lucky and bigman  the smell of heating rations  the feeling of crowding walls  outside of which was the        infinite emptiness of space  and  sounding through those walls  the steady vibrating hum of hyperatomic motors converting field energies into a directional thrust or  at the very least  powering the energy consuming innards of the ship .   if ever the ancient belief of the  music of the spheres  could be said to have come literally true  it was in that hum of hyperatomics that was the very essential of space flight .   panner said   we re past jupiter nine s escape velocity now  which means we can coast without danger of falling back to its surface .    lucky said   that means we re in free fall down to jupiter .     with fifteen million miles to fall  yes .  once we ve piled up enough velocity to make it worthwhile  we ll shift to agrav .      he took a watch out of his pocket as he spoke .  it was a large disc of gleaming  featureless metal .  he pressed a small catch  and luminous figures appeared upon its face .  a glowing line of white encircled it  turning red in a sweeping arc until the redness closed in upon itself and the arc turned white again .   lucky said   are we scheduled to enter agrav so soon .     not very long   said panner .  he placed the watch on the table  and they ate silently .   panner lifted the watch again .   a little under a minute .  it should be completely automatic .   although the chief engineer spoke calmly enough  the hand that held the watch trembled very slightly .   panner said   now   and there was silence .  complete silence .        the hum of the hyperatomics had stopped .  the very power to keep the ship s lights on and its pseudo grav field in operation were now coming from jupiter s gravitational field .   panner said   on the nose .  perfect .   he put away his watch  and though the smile on his broad  homely face was a restrained one  it virtually shouted relief .   we re actually on an agrav ship now in full agrav operation .    lucky was smiling  too .   congratulations .  i m pleased to be on board .     i imagine you are .  you worked hard enough for it .  poor donahue .    lucky said gravely    i m sorry i had to push the commander so hard  but i had no choice .  one way or another  i had to be on board .    panner s eyes narrowed at the sudden gravity in lucky s voice .   had to be .     had to be .  it seems almost certain to me that on board this ship at the present moment is the spy we re looking for .        in the vitals of the ship  panner stared blankly .  then   why .     the sirians would certainly want to know how the ship actually worked .  if their method of spying is foolproof  as it has been till now  why not continue it on board the ship .     what you re saying  then  is that one of the fourteen men on board the jovian moon is a robot .     that is exactly what i mean .     but the men aboard ship have been chosen long since .     the sirians would know the reasons for choosing and the method of choice just as they know everything else about the project and they would maneuver their humanoid robot so as to have him chosen .     that s giving them a lot of credit   muttered panner .    i admit it   said lucky .   there is an alternative .     which is .     that the humanoid robot is aboard as a stowaway .     very unlikely   said panner .    but quite possible .  it might easily have boarded the            ship in the confusion before the commander made his christening speech .  i tried to watch the ship then  but it was impossible .  furthermore  nine tenths of the ship seems to be made up of engine compartment  so there must be plenty of room to hide .    panner thought about it .   not as much room as you might think .     still we must search the ship .  will you do that  dr .  panner .     i .     certainly .  as chief engineer  you would know the contents of the engine compartment better than anyone else .  we ll go with you .     wait .  it s a fool s errand .     if there is no stowaway  dr .  panner  we have still gained something .  we ll know we can restrict our consideration to the men legally aboard ship .     just three of us .    lucky said quietly   whom can we trust to help us  when anyone we might ask might be the robot we re looking for .  let us not discuss this any further  dr .  panner .  are you willing to help us search the ship .  i am asking your help in my capacity as a member of the council of science .    reluctantly panner got to his feet .   i suppose i must then .    they clambered down the hand holds of the narrow shaft leading to the first engine level .  the light was subdued and  naturally  indirect  so that the huge structures on either side cast no shadow .   there was no sound  no slightest hum to indicate activity or to show that vast forces were being trapped        and dealt with .  bigman  looking about  was appalled to find that nothing seemed familiar  that of the ordinary workings of a space ship  such as that of their own shooting starr  nothing seemed left .    everything s closed in   he said .   panner nodded and said in a low voice   everything is as automatic as possible .  the need for human intervention has been cut to the minimum .     what about repairs .     there shouldn t have to be any   the engineer said grimly .   we have alternate circuits and duplicated equipment at every step  all allowing for automatic cut in after self check .    panner moved ahead  guiding them through the narrow openings but moving always slowly as though at any moment he expected someone  or some thing  to hurl itself murderously upon them .   level by level  methodically moving out from the central shaft along the side channels  panner probed each bit of room with the sureness of the expert .   eventually they came to a halt at the very bottom  hard against the large tail jets through which the glowing hyperatomic forces  when the ship was in ordinary flight  pressed backward to push the ship forward .   from within the ship the test jets showed as four smooth pipes  each twice as thick as a man  burrowing into the ship and ending in the tremendous featureless structures that housed the hyperatomic motors .   bigman  said   hey  the jets .  inside .     no   said panner .    why not .  a robot could hide there fine .  it s open space  but what s that to a robot .     hyperatomic thrusts   said lucky   would be plenty       to it and there ve been a number of those till an hour ago .  no  the jets are out .     well  then   said panner   there s no one anywhere in the engine compartments .  no thing  either .     you re sure .     yes .  there isn t a place we haven t looked  and the route i followed made it impossible for anything to get around and behind us .    their voices made small echoes in the lengths of shafts behind them .   bigman said   sands of mars  that leaves us with the fourteen regulars .    lucky said thoughtfully   less than that .  three of the men aboard ship showed emotion  commander donahue  harry norrich  red summers .  that leaves eleven .    panner said   don t forget me .  i disobeyed an order .  that leaves ten .     that raises an interesting point   said lucky .   do you know anything about robotics .     i .   said panner .   never dealt with a robot in my life .     exactly   said lucky .   earthmen invented the positronic robot and developed most of the refinements  yet  except for a few specialists  the earth technician knows nothing about robotics  simply because we don t use robots to any extent .  it isn t taught in the schools and it doesn t come up in practice .  i myself know the three laws and not too much more .  commander donahue couldn t even quote the three laws .  the sirians  on the other hand  with a robot saturated economy  must be past masters at all the subtleties of robotics .          now i spent a good deal of time yesterday and today with a book film on advanced robotics  that i found in the project library .  it was the only book on the subject  by the way .     so .   said panner .    it became obvious to me that the three laws aren t as simple as one might think .   .   .   .  let us move on  by the way .  we can give the engine levels a double check on the way back .   he was moving across this lowest level as he spoke  looking with keen interest at his surroundings .   lucky continued   for instance  i might think it would only be necessary to give each man on the ship a ridiculous order and note whether it be obeyed .  as a matter of fact  i did think so .  but that isn t necessarily true .  it is theoretically possible to adjust the positronic brain of a robot to obey only those orders that belong naturally to the line of its duties .  orders that are contrary to those duties or irrelevant to them may still be obeyed provided that they are preceded by certain words which act as a code or by the person who gives the orders identifying himself in a certain way .  in this manner a robot can be handled in all ways by its proper overseers and yet be insensitive to strangers .    panner  who had placed his hands on the holds that would guide the men up to the next higher level  released them .  he turned to face lucky .   he said   you mean when you told me to take off my shirt and i didn t obey  that meant nothing .     i say it could have meant nothing  dr .  panner  since taking off your shirt at that moment was no part of your regular duties  and my order might not have been stated in the proper form .          then you re accusing me of being a robot .     no .  it isn t likely that you are .  the sirians  in choosing some member of the project to replace by a robot  would scarcely choose the chief engineer .  for the robot to do that job properly  it would have to know so much about agrav that the sirians couldn t supply the knowledge .  or  if they could  they would have no need to spy .     thanks   said panner  sourly  turning toward the hand holds again  but now bigman s voice rang out .    hold it  panner .   the small martian had his ready needle gun in his fist .  he said   wait a minute  lucky  how do we know he knows anything about agrav .  we re just assuming that .  he never showed us any knowledge .  when the jovian moon shifted to agrav  where was he .  sitting on his squatter in his quarters with us  that s where he was .    lucky said   i thought of that  too  bigman  and that s one reason i brought panner down here .  he s obviously acquainted with the engines .  i ve watched him inspect everything and he couldn t have done it with such assurance if he weren t an expert on the workings .     does that suit you  martian .   panner demanded with suppressed anger .   bigman put his needle gun away  and without a further word panner scrambled up the ladder .   they stopped off at the next level  working through it a second time .   panner said   all right  that leaves ten men  two army officers  four engineers  four workmen .  what dp you propose to do .  x ray each of them separately .  something like that .          lucky shook his head .   that s too risky .  apparently the sirians have been known to use a cute little trick to protect themselves .  they ve been known to use robots to carry messages or to perform tasks which the individual giving the orders wanted to be kept secret .  now obviously a robot can t keep a secret if a human being asks him  in the proper fashion  to reveal it .  what the sirians do  then  is to install an explosive device in the robot which is triggered by any attempt to force the robot to give away the secret .     you mean if you put an x ray on the robot  it will explode .     there s a very good chance that it would .  its greatest secret is its identity  and it may be triggered for every attempt to discover that identity that the sirians could think of .   lucky added regretfully   they hadn t counted on a v frog  there was no trigger against that .  they had to order the robot to kill the v frog directly .  or that might have been preferable anyway  since it managed to keep the robot alive undetected .     wouldn t the robot be harming humans nearby if it exploded .  wouldn t it be breaking first law .   asked panner with a trace of sarcasm .    it wouldn t .  it would have no control over the explosion .  the triggering would be the result of the sound of a certain question or the sight of a certain action  not the result of anything the robot itself would do .    they crawled up to still another level .    then what do you expect to do  councilman .   demanded panner .    i don t know   lucky said frankly .   the robot must be made to give itself away somehow .  the three laws        however modified and fancified  must apply .  it s only a question of being sufficiently acquainted with robotics to know how to take advantage of those laws .  if i knew how to force the robot into some action that would show it to be non human without activating any explosive device with which it might be equipped  if i could manipulate the three laws so as to force one to conflict with another sufficiently strongly to paralyze the creature completely  if i      panner broke in impatiently   well  if you expect help from me  councilman  it s no use .  i ve told you already i know nothing of robotics .   he whirled suddenly .   what s that .    bigman looked about  too .   i didn t hear anything .    wordlessly panner squeezed past them  dwarfed by the bending metal tube on either side .   he had gone almost as far as he could  the other two following  when he muttered   someone might have squeezed in among the rectifiers .  let me pass again .    lucky stared  frowning  into what was almost a forest of twisting cables that enclosed them in a complete dead end .   lucky said   it seems clear to me .     we can test it for sure   panner said tightly .  he had opened a panel in the wall nearby and now he reached in cautiously  looking over his shoulder .    don t move   he said .   bigman said testily   nothing s happened .  there s nothing there .    panner relaxed .   i know it .  i asked you not to move because i didn t want to slice an arm off when i established the force field .           what force field .     i ve shorted a force field right across the corridor .  you can t move out of there any more than you could if you were encased in solid steel three feet thick .    bigman yelled   sands of mars  lucky  he is the robot .   his hand lunged .   panner cried at once   don t try the needle gun .  kill me and how do you ever get out .   he stared at them  dark eyes sparking  his broad shoulders hunched .   remember  energy can get through a force field but matter can t  not even air molecules .  you re airtight in there .  kill me and you ll suffocate long before anyone happens to come across you down here .     i said he was the robot   said bigman in raging despair .   panner laughed shortly   you re wrong .  i m not a robot .  but if there is one  i know who it is .        down the line of moons   who .   bigman demanded at once .   but it was lucky who answered .   obviously he thinks it s one of us .     thanks .   said panner .   how would you explain it .  you mentioned stowaways  you talked about people forcing their way on board the jovian moon .  talk about nerve .  aren t there two people who did force their way on board .  didn t i witness the process .  you two .     true enough   said lucky .    and you brought me down here so you could investigate every inch of the ship s workings .  you tried to keep me busy with stories about robots hoping i wouldn t notice that you two were going over the whole ship with a microscope .    bigman said   we have a right to do it .  this is lucky starr .     he says he s lucky starr .  if he s a member of the council of science  he can prove it and he knows how .  if i had any brains  i d have demanded identification before taking you down .               it s not too late now   lucky said calmly .   can you see clearly from that distance .   he held up one arm  palm forward  and peeled the sleeve back .    i m not coming any closer   panner said angrily .   lucky said nothing to that .  he let his wrist tell the story .  the skin along the inner surface of his wrist seemed merely exposed skin  but years before it had been treated hormonally in a most complicated fashion .  responding to nothing more than a disciplined effort of lucky s will  an oval spot on the wrist darkened and slowly turned black .  within it  little yellow specks formed in the familiar patterns of the big dipper and of orion .   panner gasped as though the breath had been forcibly knocked out of his lungs .  few human beings had the occasion to see this sign of the council  but all above the age of childhood knew it for what it was    the final and unforgeable identification insigne of the councilman of science .   panner was left with no choice .  silently  reluctantly  he released the force field and stepped back .   bigman came out  raging   i ought to bend in your skull  you lopsided      lucky pulled him back .   forget it  bigman .  the man had as much right to suspect us as we had to suspect him .  settle down .    panner shrugged .   it seemed logical .     i admit it did .  i think we can trust each other now .     you  maybe   the chief engineer said pointedly .   you re identified .  what about this little loudmouth with you .  who identifies him .    bigman squawked incoherently and lucky stepped in between the two .   i identify him and take full responsibility for him .   .   .   .  now i propose that we get        back to passenger quarters before a search is organized for us .  everything that went on down here is  of course  strictly confidential .    then  as though nothing had happened  they resumed the climb upward .   the room assigned to them contained a two decker bed and a washstand out of which a small trickle of water could be urged .  nothing more .  even the cramped and spartan quarters on board the shooting starr were luxury to this .   bigman sat cross legged on the upper bed  while lucky sponged his neck and shoulders .  they talked in whispers  conscious of the listening ears that might be present on the other side of the walls .   bigman said   look  lucky  suppose i go up to each person on board ship  i mean  each of the ten we don t know about .  suppose i deliberately pick a fight with each one  call them a few names  things like that .  wouldn t it turn out that the guy who doesn t take a punch at me is the robot .     not at all .  he might not want to break shipboard discipline  or he might know what a handy fellow you are with a needle gun  or he might not want to get into a wrangle with the council of science  or he might just not like to hit a man smaller than himself .     aw  come on  lucky .   bigman was silent for a minute  then he said cautiously    i ve been thinking  how can you be sure the robot is aboard ship .  i keep thinking maybe it stayed back on jupiter nine .  it s possible .     i know it s possible and yet i m sure the robot is here on board ship .  that s just it .  fm sure and i don t know why i m sure   said lucky  his eyes dark with       thought .  he leaned against the bed and tapped his teeth with the knuckle of one finger .   that first day we landed on jupiter nine  something happened .     what .     if i only knew .  i had it  i knew what it was  or thought i did  just before i went to sleep that night  and it vanished .  i haven t been able to get it back .  if i were on earth  i d submit to a psycho probe .  great galaxy  i swear i would .     i ve tried every trick i could .  thinking hard  getting my mind off it altogether .  when we were with panner down in the engine levels  i tried talking my fool head off .  i thought if i would just keep discussing every aspect of the matter  the thought was bound to pop into my head .  it didn t .    but it s there just the same .  it s because of the thought that i must feel so sure the robot is one of the men aboard ship .  i ve made the subconscious deduction .  if i could only put my finger on it  i d have the whole answer .  if i could only put my finger on it   he sounded almost despairing .   bigman had never seen lucky with quite that look of frustrated loss in his face .  he said  worried   hey  we d better get some sleep .     yes  we d better .    minutes later  in the darkness  bigman whispered   hey  lucky  what makes you so sure i m not the robot myself .    lucky whispered back   because the sirians couldn t bear to build a robot with such an ugly face   and lifted his elbow to ward off a flying pillow .   the days passed .  halfway to jupiter  they passed the inner and more sparsely populated belt of small       moons  of which only six  seven  and ten were numbered .  jupiter seven was visible as a bright star  but the others were far enough away to melt into the background of the constellations .   jupiter itself had grown to the size of the moon as seen from earth .  and because the ship was approaching the planet with the sun squarely to its rear  jupiter remained in the  full  phase .  its entire visible surface was ablaze with sunlight .  there was no shadow of night advancing across it .   yet though the size of the moon  it was not so bright as the moon by any means .  its cloud decked surface reflected eight times as much of the light that reached it  as did the bare powdered rock of the moon .  the trouble was that jupiter only received one twenty seventh of the light per square mile that the moon did .  the result was that it was only one third as bright at that moment as the moon appeared to be to human beings on earth .   yet it was more spectacular than the moon .  its belts had become quite distinct  brownish streaks with soft fuzzy edges against a creamy white background .  it was even easy to make out the flattened straw colored oval that was the great red spot as it appeared at one edge  crossed the face of the planet  then disappeared at the other .   bigman said   hey  lucky  jupiter looks as though it isn t really round .  is that just an optical illusion .     not at all   said lucky .   jupiter really isn t round .  it s flattened at the poles .  you ve heard that earth is flattened at the poles  haven t you .     sure .  but not enough to notice .     of course not .  consider .  earth is twenty five thousand miles about its equator and rotates in twenty four       hours  so that a spot on its equator moves just over a thousand miles an hour .  the resulting centrifugal force bulges the equator outward so that the diameter of the earth across its middle is about twenty seven miles more than the diameter from north pole to south pole .  the difference in the two diameters is only about a third of one per cent so that from space earth looks like a perfect sphere .     oh .     now take jupiter .  it is         miles about its equator  eleven times the circumference of earth  yet it rotates about its axis in only ten hours  five minutes less than that  to be exact .  a point on its equator is moving at a speed of almost twenty eight thousand miles an hour  or twenty eight times as fast as any point on earth .  there s a great deal more centrifugal force and a much larger equatorial bulge  especially since the material in jupiter s outer layers is much lighter than that hi the earth s crust .  jupiter s diameter across its equator is nearly six thousand miles more than its diameter from north pole to south pole .  the difference in the diameters is a full fifteen per cent  and that s an easy thing to see .    bigman stared at the flattened circle of light that was jupiter and muttered   sands of mars .    the sun remained behind them and unseen as they sank toward jupiter .  they crossed the orbit of callisto  jupiter four  outermost of jupiter s major satellites  but did not see it to advantage .  it was a world one and a half million miles from jupiter and as large as mercury  but it was on the other side of its orbit  a small pea close to jupiter and heading into eclipse in its shadow .        ganymede  which was jupiter three  was close enough to show a disc one third as wide as the moon seen from earth .  it lay off to one side so that part of its night surface could be seen .  it was three quarters full even so  pale white  and featureless .   lucky and bigman found themselves ignored by the rest of the crew .  the commander never spoke to them or even looked at them  but moved past with eyes fixed on nothingness .  norrich  when he was led past by mutt  nodded cheerfully as he always did when he detected the presence of humans .  when bigman answered the greeting  however  the pleasant look vanished from his face .  a gentle pressure on mutt s harness started the dog moving and he was gone .   the two found it more comfortable to eat in their own quarters .   bigman grumbled .   who in space do they think they are .  even that guy panner gets busy all at once when i m around .    lucky said   in the first place  bigman  when the commander makes it so obvious that we re in his bad books  subordinates don t fall over themselves being friendly .  secondly  our dealings with a few of the men have been unpleasant .    bigman said thoughtfully   i met red summers today  the cobber .  there he was coming out of the engine room and there i was  facing him .     what happened .  you didn t .  .  .     i didn t do anything .  i just stood there waiting for him to start something  hoping he would start something  but he just smiled and moved around me .    everyone aboard the jovian moon was watching the day ganymede eclipsed jupiter .  it wasn t a true eclipse .        ganymede covered only a tiny part of jupiter .  ganymede was         miles away  not quite half the size of the moon as seen from earth .  jupiter was twice the distance  but it was a swollen globe now  fourteen times as wide as ganymede  menacing and frightening .   ganymede met jupiter a little below the latter s equator  and slowly the two globes seemed to melt together .  where ganymede cut in  it made a circle of dimmer light  for ganymede had far less of an atmosphere than jupiter had and reflected a considerably smaller portion of the light it received .  even if that had not been so  it would have been visible as it cut across jupiter s belts .   the remarkable part was the crescent of blackness that hugged ganymede s rear as the satellite moved completely onto jupiter s disk .  as the men explained to one another in breathless whispers  it was ganymede s shadow falling on jupiter .   the shadow  only its edge seen  moved with ganymede  but slowly gained on it .  the sliver of black cut finer and finer until in the mid eclipse region  when jupiter  ganymede  and the jovian moon all made a straight line with the sun  the shadow was completely gone  covered by the world that cast it .   thereafter  as ganymede continued to move on  the shadow began to advance  appearing before it  first a sliver  then a thicker crescent  until both left jupiter s globe .   the entire eclipse lasted three hours .   the jovian moon reached and passed the orbit of ganymede when that satellite was at the other end of its seven day orbit about jupiter .        there was a special celebration when that happened .  men with ordinary ships  not often  to be sure  had reached ganymede and landed on it  but no one  not one human being  had ever penetrated closer than that to jupiter .  and now the jovian moon did .   the ship passed within one hundred thousand miles of europa  jupiter two .  it was the smallest of jupiter s major satellites  only nineteen hundred miles in diameter .  it was slightly smaller than the moon  but its closeness made it appear twice the size of the moon as seen from earth .  dark markings could be made out that might have been mountain ranges .  ship s telescopes proved they were exactly that .  the mountains resembled those on mercury  and there was no sign of moon like craters .  there were brilliant patches  too  resembling ice fields .   and still they sank downward  and left europa s orbit behind .   io was the innermost of jupiter s major satellites  in size almost exactly equal to earth s moon .  its distance from jupiter  moreover  was only         miles  or little more than that of the moon from earth .   but there the kinship ended .  whereas earth s gentle gravitational field moved the moon about itself in the space of four weeks  io  caught in jupiter s gravity  whipped about in its slightly larger orbit in the space of forty two hours .  where the moon moved about earth at a speed of a trifle over a thousand miles an hour  io moved about jupiter at a speed of twenty two thousand miles an hour  and a landing upon it was that much more difficult .   the ship  however  maneuvered perfectly .  it cut in ahead of io and wiped out agrav at just the proper moment .        with a bound  the hum of the hyperatomics was back  filling the ship with what seemed a cascade of sound after the silence of the past weeks .   the jovian moon curved out of its path  finally  subject once again to the accelerating effect of a gravitational field  that of lo .  it was established in an orbit about the satellite at a distance of less than ten thousand miles  so that lo s globe filled the sky .   they circled about it from dayside to nightside  coming lower and lower .  the ship s batlike agrav fins were retracted in order that they might not be torn off by io s thin atmosphere .   then  eventually  there was the keen whistling that came with the friction of ship against the outermost wisps of that atmosphere .   velocity dropped and dropped  so did altitude .  the ship s sidejets curved it to face stern downward toward io  and the hyperatomic jets sprang into life  cushioning the fall .  finally  with one last bit of drop and the softest jar  the jovian moon came to rest on the surface of io .   there was wild hysteria on board the jovian moon .  even lucky and bigman had their backs pounded by men who had been avoiding them constantly all voyage long .   one hour later  in the darkness of io s night  with commander donahue in the lead  the men of the jovian moon  each in his space suit  emerged one by one onto the surface of jupiter one .   sixteen men .  the first human beings ever to land on io .   correction  thought lucky .  fifteen men .   and one robot .       the skies and snows of io  it was jupiter they stopped to look at .  it was jupiter that held them frozen .  there was no talk about it  no babble over the helmet radios .  it was beyond talk .   jupiter was a giant globe which  from rim to rim  extended one eighth of the way across the visible sky .  had it been full  it would have been two thousand times as bright as the earth s full moon  but the night shadow cut a third of it away .   the bright zones and dark belts that crossed it were not merely brown now .  they were close enough to show full clear color  pink  green  blue  and purple  amazingly bright .  the edges of the bands were ragged and slowly changed shape as they watched  as though the atmosphere were being whipped into gigantic and turbulent storms  as most probably it was .  io s clear  thin atmosphere didn t obscure the smallest detail of that colored shifting surface .   the great red spot was heaving ponderously into sight .  it gave the impression of a funnel of gas  swirling lazily .   they watched for a long time  and jupiter did not            change position .  the stars moved past it  but jupiter remained fixed where it was  low in the western sky .  it could not move  since io presented only one side to jupiter as it revolved .  on nearly half of io s surface jupiter never rose  and on nearly half it never set .  in an in between region of the satellite  a region making up nearly a fifth of the total surface  jupiter remained forever on the horizon  part showing  part hidden .    what a place for a telescope .   murmured bigman on the wave length allotted to lucky during the pre landing briefing .   lucky said   they ll have one soon and a lot of other equipment .    bigman touched lucky s face plate to attract his attention and pointed quickly .   look at norrich .  poor guy  he can t see any of this .    lucky said   i noticed him before .  he s got mutt with him .     yes .  sands of mars  they go to trouble for that norrich .  that dog suit is a special job .  i was watching them put it on the dog when you were keeping tabs on the landing .  they had to test to make sure he could hear the orders and obey them and if he d let norrich use him once norrich got into a space suit .  apparently it all worked out .    lucky nodded .  on impulse he moved rapidly in norrich s direction .  io s gravity was just a trifle over that of the moon  and both he and bigman could handle that neatly .   a few long  flat strides did the job .   norrich   said lucky  shifting to the engineer s wave length .   one cannot tell direction of a sound when it comes       out of earphones  of course  and norrich s blind eyes looked about helplessly .   who is it .     lucky starr .   he was facing the blind man  and through the face plate could make out clearly the look of intense joy on norrich s face .   you re happy to be here .     happy .  you might call it that .  is jupiter very beautiful .     very .  would you want me to describe it to you .     no .  you don t have to .  i ve seen it by telescope when   when i had eyes  and i can see it in my mind now .  it s just that .  .  .  i don t know if i can make you understand .  we re some of the few people to stand on a new world for the first time .  do you realize what a special group that makes us .    his hand reached down to stroke mutt s head and contacted only the metal of the dog s helmet  of course .  through the curved face plate  lucky could see the dog s lolling tongue  and his uneasy eyes turning restlessly this way and that  as though disturbed by the strange surroundings or by the presence of his master s voice without the familiar body that went with it .   norrich said quietly   poor mutt .  the low gravity has him all confused .  i won t keep him out much longer .    then  with an increase of passion again   think of all the trillions of people in the galaxy .  think how few of them have had the luck to be the first on a world .  you can almost name them all off .  janofski and sterling were the first men on the moon  ching the first man on mars  lubell and smith on venus .  add them all up .  even count in all the asteroids and all the plan        ets outside the solar system .  add up all the firsts and see how few there are .  and we re among those few .  i m among those few .    he flung his arms out as though he were ready to embrace the whole satellite .   and i owe that to summers  too .  when he worked out a new technique for manufacturing the lead contact point   it was just a matter of a bent rotor  but it saved two million dollars and a year s time  and he not even a trained mechanic    they offered to let him be in the party as reward .  you know what he said .  he said i deserved it in his place .  they said sure  but i was blind  and he reminded them why i was blind and said he wouldn t go without me .  so they took us both .  i know you two don t think much of summers  but that s what i think of when i think of him .    the commander s voice sounded ringingly in all helmets   let s get to work  men .  jupiter will stay where it is .  look at it later .    for hours the ship was unloaded  equipment was set up  tents unfurled .  temporary air tights were prepared for possible use as oxygen supplied headquarters outside the ship .   the men were not to be kept from watching the unusual sky  though .  as it happened  all three of jupiter s other large satellites were in the sky .   europa was closest  appearing somewhat smaller than earth s moon .  it was a crescent  near the eastern horizon .  ganymede  appearing smaller still  was nearer zenith and half full .  callisto  only a quarter the width of earth s moon  was nudging close to jupiter and         like jupiter  was some two thirds full .  all three together gave not one quarter the light of earth s full moon and were completely inconspicuous in the presence of jupiter .   bigman said exactly that .   lucky looked down at his small martian friend after having studied the eastern horizon thoughtfully .   you think nothing could beat jupiter  do you .     not out here   bigman said stoutly .     then keep watching   said lucky .   in io s thin atmosphere there was no twilight to speak of and no warning .  there was a diamondlike sparkle along the frost covered top line of the ridge of low hills  and seven seconds later the sun had topped the horizon .   it was a tiny seed pearl of a sun  a little circle of brilliant white  and for all the light that giant jupiter cast  the pigmy sun cast much  much more .   they got the telescope up in time to catch callisto vanishing behind jupiter .  one by one  all three satellites would do the same .  io  although it kept only one face to jupiter  revolved about it in forty two hours .  that meant that the sun and all the stars seemed to march around io s skies in those forty two hours .   as for the satellites  io moved faster than any of them  so it kept overtaking them in the race about jupiter .  it overtook the farthest and slowest  callisto  most rapidly  so callisto circled io s heavens in two days .  ganymede took four days and europa seven .  each traveled from east to west and each in due turn was to pass behind jupiter .        the excitement in the case of the callisto eclipse  which was the first to be witnessed  was extreme .  even mutt seemed to be affected by it .  he had grown increasingly used to low gravity  and norrich gave him periods of freedom during which he floundered grotesquely about and tried vainly to inspect by nose the numerous strange things he encountered .  and in the end  when callisto reached jupiter s glowing curve and passed behind  and all the men grew silent  mutt  too  sat on his swathed haunches and  tongue lolling  stared upward at the sky .   but it was the sun they were really waiting for .  its apparent motion was faster than that of any of the satellites .  it gained on europa  whose crescent thinned to nothingness  and passed behind it  remaining in eclipse for something less than thirty seconds .  it emerged  and then europa was a crescent again  with its horns facing in the other direction now .   ganymede had plunged behind jupiter before the sun could reach it  and callisto  having emerged from behind jupiter  was below the horizon .   it was the sun and jupiter now  those two .   the men watched greedily as the seed pearl sun climbed higher in the sky .  as it did  jupiter s phase grew narrower  its lighted portion always  of course  facing the sun .  jupiter became a  half moon   then a fat crescent  then a thin one .   in io s thin atmosphere the sunlit sky was a deep purple  and only the dimmer stars had been blotted out .  against that background there burnt the gigantic crescent in the sky  bulging out toward the relentlessly approaching sun .        it was like david s pebble hurled from some cosmic slingshot toward goliath s forehead .   the light of jupiter shrank still further and became a yellowish curved thread .  the sun was almost touching .   it did touch and the men cheered .  they had masked their face plates in order to watch  but now that was no longer necessary  for the light had dimmed to bearable dimensions .   yet it had not vanished entirely .  the sun had moved behind the edge of jupiter but it still shone murkily through that giant planet s thick  deep atmosphere of hydrogen and helium .   jupiter itself was now completely blanked out  but its atmosphere had sprung to life  refracting and bending the sunlight through itself and around the curve of the planet  a smoothly bending film of milky light .   the film of light spread as the sun moved farther behind jupiter .  it curved back on itself until faintly  very faintly  the two horns of light met on jupiter s other side .  jupiter s vanished body was outlined in light and one side bulged with it .  it was a diamond ring in the sky  big enough to hold two thousand globes the size of the moon as seen from earth .   and still the sun moved farther behind jupiter so that the light began to fade and grow dim  and dimmer  until finally it was gone and  except for the pale crescent of europa  the sky was black and belonged to the stars .    it will stay like this five hours   said lucky to big man .   then everything will repeat itself in reverse as the sun comes out         and this happens every forty two hours .   said big man  awed .    that s right   said lucky .   panner approached them the next day and called out to them   how are you .  we re almost done here .   he spread his arm about in a broad circle to indicate the loan valley  now littered with equipment .   we ll be leaving soon  you know  and we ll leave most of this stuff here .     we will .   said bigman  surprised .    why not .  there s nothing living on the satellite to disturb the stuff and there s no weather to speak of .  everything s coated for protection against the ammonia in the atmosphere and it will keep nicely till a second expedition comes round .   his voice was suddenly lower .   is there anyone else on your private wave length  councilman .     my receivers don t detect anyone .     do you want to take a walk with me .   he headed out  out of the shallow valley and up the gentle slope of the surrounding hills .  the other two followed .   panner said   i must ask your pardon if i seemed unfriendly on board ship .  i thought it better so .     there are no hard feelings   lucky assured him .    i thought i d try an investigation of my own  you see  and i thought it safer not to seem hand in glove with you .  i was sure that if i only watched carefully  i would catch someone giving himself away  doing something non human  if you know what i mean .  i failed  i m afraid .    they had reached the top of the first rise and panner       looked back .  he said with amusement   look at that dog  will you .  he s getting the real feel of low gravity .    mutt had learned a lot in the past few days .  his body arched and straightened as he lunged in low  twenty foot leaps  and he seemed to indulge in them for the sheerest pleasure .   panner switched ms radio to the wave length that had been reserved for norrich s use in calling mutt and shouted   hey  mutt  hey  boy  come  mutt   and whistled .   the dog heard  of course  and bounded high in the air .  lucky switched to the dog s wave length and heard ms delighted barking .   panner waved ms arm and the dog headed toward them  then stopped and looked back as though wondering if he did right to leave his master .  he approached more slowly .   the men walked onward again .  lucky said   a sirian robot built to fool a man would be a thorough job .  casual examination wouldn t detect the fraud .     mine wasn t casual examination   protested pan ner .   lucky s voice held more than a tinge of bitterness .    i m beginning to think that the examination by anyone but an experienced robotics man can be nothing but casual .    they were passing over a drift of snowlike material  glittering in jupiter light  and bigman looked down upon it in amazement .    this thing melts if you look at it   he said .  he picked some up in his gauntleted hand  and it melted down and ran off like butter on a stove .  he looked       back  and where the three had stepped were deep indentations .   lucky said   it s not snow  it s frozen ammonia  bigman .  ammonia melts at a temperature eighty degrees lower than ice does  and the heat radiating from our suits melts it that much faster .    bigman lunged forward to where the drifts lay deeper  gouging holes wherever he stepped  and shouted   this is fun .    lucky called   make sure your heater is on if you re going to play in the snow .     it s on   yelled bigman  and running down a ridge with long low leaps  he flung himself headlong into a bank .  he moved like a diver in slow motion  hit the drifted ammonia  and  for a moment  disappeared .  he floundered to his feet .    it s like diving into a cloud  lucky .  you hear me .  come on  try it .  more fun than sand skiing on the moon .     later  bigman   lucky said .  then he turned to panner .   for instance  did you try in any way to test any of the men .    out of the corner of his eye lucky could see bigman plunging into a bank for a second time  and  after a few moments had elapsed  his eyes turned full in that direction .  another moment and he called out anxiously   bigman .   then  more loudly and much more anxiously   bigman .    he started running .   bigman s voice came  weak and gasping .   breath .  .  .  knocked out .  .  .  hit rock  .  .  .  river down here  .   .  .     hold on i ll be with you .   lucky and panner  too  were devouring space with their strides .        lucky knew what had happened  of course .  the surface temperature of io was not far removed from the melting point of ammonia .  underneath the ammonia drifts  melting ammonia could be feeding hidden rivers of that foul smelling  choking substance that existed so copiously on the outer planets and their satellites .   there was the rattle of bigman s coughing in his ear .   break in air hose  .   .   .  ammonia getting in  .   .   .  choking .    lucky reached the hole left by bigman s diving body and looked down .  the ammonia river was plainly visible  bubbling slowly downhill over sharp crags .  it must have been against one of those that bigman s air hose had been damaged .    where are you  bigman .    and though bigman answered feebly   here   he was nowhere to be seen .       fall .   lucky jumped recklessly into the exposed river  drifting gently downward under the pull of io s weak gravity .  he was angry at the slowness of his fall  at bigman for the childish enthusiasms that seized him so suddenly  and   unpredictably   at himself for not having stopped bigman when he might .   lucky hit the stream  and ammonia sprayed high in the air  then fell back with surprising quickness .  io s thin atmosphere could not support the small droplets even at low gravity .   there was no sense of buoyancy to the ammonia river .  lucky had not expected any to speak of .  liquid ammonia was less dense than water and had less lifting power .  nor was the force of the current great under io s weak pull .  had bigman not damaged his air hose  it would have been only a matter of walking out of the river and through any of the drifts that might have packed it round .   as it was  .   .   .   lucky splashed downstream furiously .  somewhere ahead the small martian must be struggling feebly            against the poisonous ammonia .  if the break in the hose was large enough  or had grown large enough  to allow liquid ammonia to enter  lucky would be too late .   he might be too late  already  and his chest constricted and tightened at the thought .   a form streaked past lucky  burying itself in the powdered ammonia .  it disappeared  leaving a tunnel into which ammonia slowly collapsed .    panner   lucky said tentatively .    here i am .   the engineer s arm fell upon lucky s shoulder from behind .   that was mutt .  he came running when you yelled .  we were both on his wave length .    together they forged through the ammonia on the track of the dog .  they met him  returning .   lucky cried eagerly   he s got bigman .    bigman s arms feebly enfolded the dog s suit encased haunches  and though that hampered mutt s movements  low gravity enabled the dog to make respectable headway through use of shoulder muscles alone .   even as lucky bent for bigman  the little martian s straining hold relaxed and he fell .   lucky scooped him up .  he wasted no time on investigation or talk .  there was only one thing to do .  he turned up bigman s oxygen flow to full capacity  slung him over his shoulders  and ran for the ship .  even allowing for io s gravity he had never run so recklessly in his life .  with such haste did he kick the ground away when coming down from each hurtling  horizontal stride that the effect was almost one of low level flying .        panner pumped along in the rear  and mutt stayed excitedly at lucky s heels .   lucky used the communal wave length to alert the others even as he was running and one of the air tights was made ready .   lucky hurtled inside the air tight  scarcely breaking his stride .  the flap closed behind him and the interior flooded with additional air under pressure to make up the loss during the flap s opening .   with flying fingers he unbuckled bigman s helmet  then more slowly drew off the rest of the suit .   he felt for the heartbeat and  to his relief  found it .  the air tight was equipped  of course  with a first aid kit .  he made the necessary injections for general stimulation and waited for warmth and plentiful oxygen to do the rest .   and eventually bigman s eyes fluttered and focused with difficulty on lucky .  his lips moved and made the word  lucky   though no sound was involved .   lucky laughed with relief and finally took the time to remove his own space suit .   on board the jovian moon harry norrich stopped at the open door of the compartment within which big man was completing his recuperation .  his unseeing  china blue eyes were warm with pleasure .    how s the invalid .    bigman struggled up in his bunk and shouted   fine .  sands of mars  i feel great .  if it weren t that lucky wants to keep me down  i d be up and around .    lucky grunted his disbelief .   bigman ignored that .  he said   hey  let mutt come in .  good old mutt .  here  boy  here .    mutt  the hold on his harness released  trotted over       to bigman  his tail wagging furiously and his intelligent eyes doing everything but talk a greeting .   bigman s small arm embraced the dog s neck in a bear hug .   boy  there s a friend .  you heard what he did  norrich  didn t you .     everyone did   and it was plain to see that norrich took a great personal pride in his dog s accomplishment .    i just barely remember it   bigman said   before i blacked out altogether .  i got that lungful of ammonia and couldn t seem to straighten out .  i rolled downhill  just going through the ammonia snow as though it were nothing .  then there was this thing coming at me and i was sure it was lucky when i heard the sound of something moving .  but he knocked enough of the snow off us to let some of the jupiter light come in and i could just make out it was mutt .  the last thing i remember was grabbing him .     and a good thing  too   lucky said .   the extra time that would have been required for me to find you would have been your finish .    bigman shrugged .   aw  lucky  you make such a big deal out of it .  nothing would have happened if i hadn t just caught the hose on a rock and torn it .  at that if i had had enough brains to turn up my oxygen pressure  i could have kept the ammonia out .  it was just the first lungful that seemed to put me out of kilter .  i couldn t think .    panner passed by  just then  and looked .   how are you  bigman .     sands of mars .  looks like everyone thinks i m an invalid or something .  there s nothing wrong with me .    .       even the commander stopped by and managed to find his tongue long enough to grunt at me .     well   said panner   maybe he s getting over his mad .     never   said bigman .   he just wants to make sure his first flight won t be spoiled by a casualty .  he wants his record pure white  that s all .    panner laughed .   all set for the take off .    lucky said   are we leaving io .     any hour .  the men are reloading the equipment we re taking with us and securing what we leave behind .  if you two can make the pilot room once we re underway  do so .  we ll get a better look at jupiter than ever .    he tickled mutt behind one ear and left  they radioed jupiter nine that they were leaving io  as days earlier they had radioed that they had surfaced on the satellite .   bigman said   why don t we call earth .  chief councilman conway ought to know we ve made it .     officially   said lucky   we haven t made it all the way until we ve returned to jupiter nine .    he did not add aloud that he was not at all anxious to return to jupiter nine  still less anxious to talk to conway .  he had  after all  accomplished nothing on this trip   his brown eyes surveyed the control room .  the engineers and crewmen were at their stations for the takeoff .  the commander  his two officers and panner  however  were in the control room .   lucky wondered again about the officers as time and again he had wondered about each of the ten men whom the v frog had not had a chance to eliminate .        he had spoken to each of them on occasion  as had panner even more frequently .  he had searched thek quarters .  he and panner together had gone over thek records .  nothing had resulted .   he would be going back to jupiter nine with the robot unlocated  and thereafter location would be harder than ever and he might have to report back to council headquarters with news of failure .   once more  desperately  the thought of x rays entered his mind  or some other means of forceful inspection .  as always  he thought at once of the possibility of triggering off an explosion  probably a nuclear explosion .   it would destroy the robot .  it would also kill thir teen men and blow up a priceless ship .  worst of all  it would show no safe way of detecting the humanoid robots which  lucky felt certain  were preying in other parts of the solar confederation .   he was startled by panner s sudden cry   here we go .    there was the familiar distant whoosh of the initial thrust  the gathering backward press of accelerations  and io s surface dropped away  faster and faster .   the visiplate could not center jupiter in its entirety   it was too large .  it centered the great red spot instead and followed it in its rotation about the globe .   panner said   we ve gone into agrav again  yes  but it s only temporary  just to let io pull away from us .     but we re still falling toward jupiter   bigman said .    that s right  but only till the proper moment is reached .  then we go into hyperatoroic drive and       plunge toward jupiter on a hyperbolic orbit .  once that is established  we cut the drive and let jupiter do the work .  our closest approach will be about         miles .  jupiter s gravity will zoom us around as though we were a pebble in a slingshot and shoot us out again .  at the proper point our hyperatomic drive cuts in again .  by taking advantage of the slingshot effect  we actually save a bit on energy over the alternative of leaving directly from io  and we get some super close ups of jupiter .    he looked at his watch .   five minutes   he said .   he was referring  as lucky knew  to the moment when the ship would switch from agrav to hyper atomic drive and begin to curve off into the planned orbit about jupiter .   still staring at his watch  panner said   the time is selected so that we come out heading toward jupiter nine as squarely as possible .  the fewer side adjustments we have to make  the more energy we save .  we ve got to come back to jupiter nine with as much of our original energy store as possible .  the more we come back with  the better agrav looks .  i ve set my goals at eighty five per cent .  if we can come back with ninety  that would be superlative .    bigman said   suppose you come back with more energy than you had when you left .  how would that be .     super superlative  bigman  but impossible .  there s something called the second law of thermodynamics that stands in the way of making a profit on the deal or  for that matter  of breaking even .  we ve got to take some loss .   he smiled broadly and said   one minute .    and at the appropriate second the sound of the       hyperatomics filled the ship with its muted murmurings  and panner placed his watch in his pocket with a satisfied expression .    from here on in   he said   until actual landing maneuvers at the jupiter nine approach  everything is quite automatic .    he had no sooner said that when the humming ceased again  the lights in the room flickered and went out .  almost at once they went on again  but now there was a little red sign on the control panel that said  emergency .   panner sprang to his feet .   what in space  .  .   .  .     he left the pilot room at a run  leaving the others staring after him and at one another in various degrees of horror .  the commander had gone dead white  ms lined face a tired mask .   lucky  with sudden decision  followed panner  and bigman  of course  followed lucky .   they came upon one of the engineers clambering out of the engine compartment .  he was panting .   sir .     what is it  man .   snapped panner .   the agrav is off  sir .  it can t be activated .     what about the hyperatomics .     the main reserve is shorted .  we cut it just in time to keep it from blowing .  if we touch it  the whole ship will go up .  every bit of the stored energy will blow .      then we re working on the emergency reservoir .      that s right .    panner s swarthy face was congested with blood .   what good is that .  we can t set up an orbit about jupiter with the emergency reservoir .  out of the way .  let me down there .         the engineer stepped aside  and panner swung into the shaft .  lucky and bigman were at his heels .   lucky and bigman had not been in the engine compartment since that first day aboard the jovian moon .  the scene was different now .  there was no august silence  no sensation of mighty forces quietly at work .   instead  the puny sound of men rose high about them .   panner sprang off into the third level .   now what s wrong .   he called .   exactly what s wrong .    men parted to let him through and they all huddled over the gutted insides of a complex mechanism  pointing things out in tones of mingled despair and anger .   there were sounds of other footsteps coming down the rungs of the shaft  and then the commander himself made his appearance .   he spoke to lucky  who was standing gravely to one side .   what is it  councilman .   it was the first time he had addressed lucky since they had left jupiter nine .   lucky said   serious damage of some sort  commander .     how did it happen .  panner .    panner looked up from the close examination of something that had been held out to him .  he shouted in annoyance   what in space do you want .    commander donahue s nostrils flared .   why has something been allowed to go wrong .     nothing has been allowed to go wrong .     then what do you call this .     sabotage  commander .  deliberate  murdering sabotage .     what .          five gravitic relays have been completely smashed and the necessary replacements have been removed and can t be located .  the hyperatomic thrust control has been fused and shorted beyond repair .  none of it happened by accident .    the commander stared at his chief engineer .  he said  hollowly   can anything be done .     maybe the five relay replacements can be located or cannibalized out of the rest of the ship .  i m not sure .  maybe a makeshift thrust control can be set up .  it would take days anyway and i couldn t guarantee results .     days .   cried the commander .   it can t take days .  we re fatting toward jupiter .    there was a complete silence for a few moments  and then panner put into words what all of them knew .   that s right  commander .  we re failing toward jupiter and we can t stop ourselves in time .  it means we re through  commander .  we re all dead men .        jupiter close up  it was lucky who broke the deadly silence that followed  in sharp  incisive tones .   no man is dead while he has a mind capable of thought .  who can handle this ship s computer most rapidly .    commander donahue said   major brant .  he s the regular trajectory man .     is he up in the control room .     yes .     let s get to him .  i want the detailed planetary ephemerae  .   .   .  panner  you stay here with the men and get to work cannibalizing and improvising .     what good will it    .   panner began .   lucky cut in at once .   perhaps no good at all .  if so  we ll hit jupiter and you ll die after having wasted a few hours of labor .  now i ve given you an order .  get to work .     but .  .  .   commander donahue seemed stuck after that one word .   lucky said   as councilman of science  i m assuming command of this vessel .  if you wish to dispute that  i ll have bigman lock you in your cabin and you            can argue it out at the court martial proceedings  assuming we survive .    lucky turned away and moved quickly up the central shaft .  bigman motioned commander donahue up with a quick jerk of his thumb and followed last .   panner looked after them scowling  turned savagely to the engineers  and said   all right  you bunch of corpses .  no use waiting for it with our fingers in our mouths .  hop to it .    lucky strode into the control room .   the officer at the controls said   what s wrong down there .   his lips were white .    you re major brant   said lucky   we haven t been formally introduced  but never mind that .  i m councilman david starr  and you re taking orders from me .  get at that computer and do what you re told with all the speed you have .    lucky had the planetary ephemerae before him .  like all great reference works  it was in book form rather than film .  the turning of pages  after all  made for the more rapid location of a specific piece of information  than did the long drawn out unwinding of film from end to end .   he turned the pages now with practiced hand  searching among the rows and columns of numbers that located the position of every chunk of matter in the solar system over ten miles in diameter  and some under  at certain standard tunes  together with their planes of revolution and velocity of motion .   lucky said   take the following co ordinates as i call them out  together with the line of motion  and calculate the characteristics of the orbit and the posi        tion of the point at this moment and for succeeding moments for the space of forty eight hours .    the major s fingers flew as figures were converted by the special punch machine into a coded tape which was fed into the computer .   even while that was taking place  lucky said   calculate from our present position and velocity our orbit with respect to jupiter and the point of intersection with the object whose orbit you have just calculated .    again the major worked .   the computer spat out its results in coded tape that wound on to a spool and dictated the tapping of a typewriter that spelled out the results in figures .   lucky said   at the point of intersection  what is time discrepancy between our ship and the object .    again the major worked .  he said   we miss it by four hours  twenty one minutes  and forty four seconds .     calculate how the velocity of the ship must be altered in order to hit the point squarely .  use one hour from now as the starting time .    commander donahue broke in .   we can t do anything this close to jupiter  councilman .  the emergency power won t break us away .  don t you understand that .     i m not asking the major to break us away  commander .  i m asking him to accelerate the ship toward jupiter  for whatever our reserve power is worth .    the commander rocked back on his heels .   toward jupiter .    the computer was making the calculation and the results were coming in .  lucky said   can you accelerate by that much on the power available .         .   major brant said shakily   i think so .     then do it .    commander donahue said again   toward jupiter .     yes .  exactly .  io isn t the innermost of jupiter s satellites .  amalthea is closer  jupiter five .  if we can intersect its orbit properly  we can land on it .  if we miss it  well  then  we will have hurried death by two hours .    bigman felt a surge of sudden hope .  he could never entirely despair while lucky was in action  but until that moment he had not seen what it was that lucky intended doing .  he remembered now his earlier conversation with lucky on the subject .  the satellites were numbered in order of discovery .  amalthea was a small satellite  just a hundred miles in diameter  and it was discovered only after the four major satellites were known .  so  though the closest to jupiter  it was jupiter five .  somehow one tended to forget that .  because io was called jupiter one  there was always the tendency to think there was nothing between it and the planet itself .   and one hour later the jovian moon began a carefully plotted acceleration toward jupiter  hastening toward the death trap .   they no longer centered the visiplate on any part of jupiter .  though the latter swelled hourly  the center of sight remained on a portion of the star field a considerable distance from jupiter s rim .  the star field was under maximum magnification .  at that point should be jupiter five  streaking for its rendezvous with a ship which was hurtling and straining down  down toward jupiter .  either the ship would be caught        by the speck of rock and saved  or it would miss and be lost forever .    there it is   said bigman in excitement .   that star shows a visible disk .     calculate observed position and motion   ordered lucky   and check with the computed orbit .    this was done .    any correction .   lucky asked .     we ll have to slow down by        never mind the figures .  do it .    jupiter five circled jupiter in twelve hours  moving in its orbit at a speed of nearly three thousand miles an hour .  this was one and a half times as rapid as io s motion and its gravitational field was only one twentieth that of io .  for both reasons  it made the harder target .   major brant s fists trembled on the controls as the all important side thrusts bent the jovian moon s orbit ever so slightly to meet the onrushing jupiter five  slip behind it and round  matching speeds for just those vital moments that would enable the satellite s gravity to establish the ship in an orbit about itself .   jupiter five was a large  brilliant object now .  if it stayed so  good .  if it began to grow smaller  they had missed .   major brant whispered   we ve made it   and bis head fell forward into his shaking palms as he released the controls .   even lucky closed his eyes momentarily in a land of weary relief .   in one way the situation on jupiter five was far different from what it had been on io .  there  all the crew       had been sight seers  the consideration of the heavens had taken precedence over the leisurely preparations in the valley .   here on jupiter five  however  no one emerged from the jovian moon .  what there was to see  no one saw .   the men stayed aboard the ship and worked on the repair of the engines .  nothing else mattered .  if they failed  the landing on jupiter five could only postpone doom and stretch it out into greater agony .   no normal ship could land on jupiter five to rescue them  and no other agrav ship existed or would exist for a year at least .  if they failed  there would be time enough to watch jupiter and the vision of the skies while they waited for death .   yet under less urgent conditions the vision would have been worth watching .  it was io all over again with everything doubled and tripled .   from the point at which the jovian moon landed  jupiter s lower rim seemed to sweep the flat  powdery horizon .  the giant looked so close in the airlessness that a watcher would have imagined he could reach out his hand and bury it in that circle of light .   from the horizon jupiter stretched upward  halfway to zenith .  at the moment the jovian moon landed  jupiter was almost full  and within the unbearable circle of brilliant stripes and colors nearly ten thousand full moons earth variety  could have been placed .  almost one sixteenth of the entire vault of the sky was covered by jupiter .   and because jupiter five circled jupiter in twelve hours  the visible moons   there were four here rather than three as on io  since io itself was now a moon          moved three times as fast as they did on io .  so did all the stars and everything else in the sky  except for frozen jupiter  which one side of the satellite eternally faced and which therefore never moved .   in five hours the sun would rise and it would be exactly the same in appearance as on io  it would be the one thing that hadn t changed .  but it would race toward a four times as large jupiter at three times the speed and make an eclipse a hundred times as terri fyingly beautiful .   but no one saw it .  it took place twice while the jovian moon stayed and no one saw it no one had the time .  no one had the heart  panner finally sat down and stared out of bleary eyes .  the flesh around them was red and puffy .  his voice was a hoarse whisper .    all right .  everyone to your normal stations .  we ll have a dry run .   he hadn t slept in forty hours .  the others had worked in shifts  but panner had stopped neither to eat nor to sleep .   bigman  who had confined himself to unskilled labor  to fetching and carrying  to reading dials under direction and holding levers according to instruction  had no place in a dry run  no station  no duties .  so he wandered somberly about the ship in search of lucky and found him in the control room with commander donahue .   lucky had his shirt off and was wiping his shoulders  forearms  and face on a large plastofluff towel .   as soon as he saw bigman  he said briskly   the ship will be moving  bigman .  we ll be taking off soon .         bigman s eyes raised .   we re only doing a dry run  lucky .     it will work .  that jim panner worked miracles .    commander donahue said stiffly   councilman starr  you have saved my ship .     no  no .  panner deserves the credit .  i think half the engine is being held together with copper wire and mucilage  but it will work .     you know what i mean  councilman .  you drove us on to jupiter five when the rest of us were ready to give up and panic .  you saved my ship  and i will report that fact fully when i stand court martial on earth for having failed to co operate with you on jupiter nine .    lucky flushed in embarrassment .   i can t allow that  commander .  it is important that councilmen avoid publicity .  as far as the official record is concerned  you will have remained in command at all times .  there will be no mention of any actions of mine .     impossible .  i couldn t allow myself to be praised for what you have done .     you will have to .  it s an order .  and let s have no talk of court martials .    commander donahue drew himself up with a kind of pride .   i deserve court martial .  you warned me of the presence of sirian agents .  i did not listen and as a result my ship was sabotaged .     the blame is mine  too   lucky said calmly .   i was on board ship and did not prevent it .  nevertheless  if we can bring back the saboteur  there will be no question of court martial .    the commander said   the saboteur  of course  is        the robot you warned me of .  how i could be so blind .     i m afraid you still don t see entirely .  it wasn t the robot .     not the robot .     a robot could not have sabotaged the ship .  it would have been bringing harm to humans and that would have meant breaking the first law .    the commander frowned as he considered that .   it might not have been aware that it was doing harm .     everyone aboard ship  including the humanoid  understands agrav .  the robot would have known it was doing harm .  in any case i think we have the identity of the saboteur  or will have in a moment    oh .  who is he  councilman starr .     well  consider this for a moment .  if a man so sabotages a ship as to insure that it will either blow up or fall into jupiter  he would be either a madman or a superhumanly dedicated person to stay on board that ship .     yes  i suppose so .      since the time we left io  the air locks have never opened .  if they had there would have been slight drops in air pressure  and the ship s barometer indicates no such drops .  you see  then  the saboteur must never have gotten on the ship at io .  he s still there  unless he s been taken off .     how could he be taken off .  no ship could get to io  except this one .    lucky smiled grimly .   no earth ship .    the commander s eyes widened .   surely no sirian ship  either .         are you sure .     yes  i m sure .   the commander frowned .   and for that matter  wait a moment .  everyone reported on board before we left io .  we wouldn t have left without everyone reported present .     in that case everyone is still on board .     i would presume so .     well   said lucky   panner has ordered all men to stations under emergency conditions .  the where abouts of every man should be fixed during this dry run .  call panner and ask if anyone is missing .    commander donahue turned to the intercom  and signaled panner .   there was some delay  and then panner s voice  infinitely tired  answered .   i was about to call  commander .  the run was successful .  we can take off .  if we re lucky  things will hold till we re back on jupiter nine .    the commander said   very good .  your work will be properly acknowledged  panner .  meanwhile  are all men at stations .    panner s face on the visiplate above the intercom seemed to harden all at once .   no .  by space  i meant to tell you .  we can t locate summers .     red summers   bigman cried in sudden excitement .   that murdering cobber .  lucky  .   .   .     one moment  bigman   lucky said .   dr .  panner  you mean summers isn t in his quarters .     he isn t anywhere .  except that it s impossible  i d say he wasn t on board .     thank you .   lucky reached over to break contact  well  commander .    bigman said   listen  lucky .  you remember once        i told you i met him coming out of the engine room .  what was he doing down there .     we know now   said lucky .    and we know enough to get him   said the commander  white faced .   we re landing on io and  .   .   .     wait   said lucky   first things first .  there is something more important even than a traitor .     what .     the matter of the robot .     that can wait .     perhaps not .  commander  you said that all men reported on board the jovian moon before we left lo .  if so  the report was obviously a false one .     well .     i think we ought to try to find the source of the false report .  a robot can t sabotage a ship  but if a man has sabotaged the ship without the robot s knowledge  it would be very simple for the robot to help that man remain off the ship if its help is requested .     you mean whoever is responsible for the false report that summers was on board ship is the robot .    lucky paused .  he tried not to allow himself to grow too hopeful or feel too triumphant  and yet the argu men seemed perfect .   he said   it seems so .        traitor .   commander donahue said   major levinson  then .   his eyes darkened .   and yet i find that impossible to believe .     find what impossible to believe .   lucky asked .    that he is a robot .  he s the man who took the report .  he keeps our records .  i know him well and i swear that he can t be a robot .     we ll question him  commander .  and one thing     lucky s expression was somber .   don t accuse him of being a robot  don t ask him if he s one or even imply that he might be one .  do nothing to make him feel he s under suspicion .    the commander looked astonished .   why not .     the sirians have a way of protecting their robots .  open suspicion may trigger some explosive device within the major if he is indeed a robot .    the commander exhaled explosively .   space .    major levinson showed the signs of strain that were universal among the men aboard the jovian moon  but he stood at brisk military attention .   yes  sir .              the commander said cautiously   councilman starr has a few questions to ask .    major levinson shifted to face lucky .  he was quite tall  topping even lucky s inches  with fair hair  blue eyes  and a narrow face .   lucky said   all men were reported on board the jovian moon at the tune of take off from io  and you prepared that report .  is that right  major .     yes  sir .     did you see each man individually .     no  sir .  i used the intercom .  each man answered at take off station or in his cabin .     each man .  did you hear each man s voice .  each individual voice .    major levinson looked astonished .   i suppose so .  that s not the sort of thing one remembers  really .     nevertheless it s quite important and i m asking you to remember .    the major frowned and bent his head .   well  now wait .  come to think of it  norrich answered for summers because summers was hi the bathroom .   then  with a sudden spark of excitement  he added   hold on  they re looking for summers right now .    lucky held up a palm .   never mind that  major .  would you get norrich and send him up .    norrich came in on major levinson s arm .  he looked bewildered .  he said   commander  no one seems to be able to find red summers .  what s hap pened to him .    lucky forestalled the commander s answer .  he said   we re trying to find out .  did you report summers present when major levinson checked those aboard before we left io .         the blind engineer reddened .  he said tightly   yes .     the major says you said summers was in the bathroom .  was he .     well  .   .   .  no  he wasn t  councilman .  he had gotten off ship for a moment to pick up some item of equipment he had left behind .  he didn t want the commander chewing him out   pardon me  sir   for carelessness  and he asked me to cover for him .  he said he would be back well before take off .     was he .     i  .  .  .  i thought  .  .  .  i had the impression he was .  mutt barked  i think  and i was sure summers was coming back  but there isn t anything for me to do at take off  so i was turning in for a nap and i guess i just didn t give the matter too much thought at the moment .  then there was the mess in the engine room almost right away  and after that there was no time to think of anything .    panner s voice came over the central intercom with sudden loudness .   warning to all men .  we are taking off .  everyone to stations .    the jovian moon was in space again  lifting itself against jupiter s gravity with powerful surges .  it was expending energy at a rate that would have bankrupted five ordinary vessels and only the fault tremor in the sound of the hyperatomics remained to show that the ship s mechanism depended  in part  on makeshift devices .   panner gloomily pondered on the poor showing the ship would now make energy wise .  he said   as is  i ll get back with only seventy per cent of original energy  when it could have been eighty five or ninety .        if we land on lo and make another take off  we ll get back with only fifty .  and i don t know if we can stand another take off .    but lucky said   we must get summers  and you know why .    with lo growing large sized once again in the visi plate  lucky said thoughtfully   it s not entirely certain we can find him  bigman .    bigman said incredulously   you don t think the sirians actually picked him up  do you .     no  but io s a big place .  if he wanders off to some rendezvous  we might never locate him .  i m counting on his staying put .  he d have to carry air  food  and water with him if he moved  so it would be most logical for him to stay put .  particularly when he d have no reason to expect us to come back .    bigman said   we should have known it was that cobber all along  lucky .  he tried to kill you first thing .  why should he want to do that  if he weren t playing along with the sirians .     true enough  bigman  but remember this  we were looking for a spy .  summers couldn t be the spy .  he had no access to the leaked information .  once it was clear to me that the spy was a robot  that cleared summers on another account .  the v frog had detected emotion  in him  so he couldn t be a robot and therefore couldn t be the spy .  of course that didn t prevent him from be ing a traitor and saboteur  and i should not have allowed the search for a spy to blind me to that possibility .    he shook his head and added   this seems to be a case riddled with disappointment .  if it had been any        one else but norrich who had covered for summers  we would have had our robot .  the trouble is that norrich is the only man who could have had convincingly innocent reason to co operate with summers .  he was friendly with summers  we know that .  then  too  norrich could innocently be ignorant that summers never returned before take off .  after all  he s blind .    bigman said   besides which  he showed emotion  too  so he can t be the robot .    lucky nodded .   true enough .   yet he frowned and grew silent .   down  down they came to io s surface  landing almost in the marks of their previous take off .  the dots and smeared shadows in the valley resolved themselves into the equipment they had set up as they approached .   lucky was surveying the surface intently through the visiplate .   were any air tights left behind on io .     no   said the commander .    then we may have our man .  one air tight  as you may notice  is fully expanded behind that rock formation .  do you have the list of material unaccounted for  n board .    the commander delivered a sheet of paper without comment  and lucky studied it .  he said   bigman and i will go out after him .  i doubt that we ll need help .    the tiny sun was high in the sky  and bigman and lucky walked on their own shadows .  jupiter was a thinnish crescent .   lucky spoke on bigman s wave length .   he must have seen the ship unless he s sleeping .     or unless he s gone   said bigman .    i doubt that he s gone .         and almost at once bigman cried   sands of mars  lucky  look up there .    a figure appeared at the top of the line of rock .  it stood out blackly against the thinning yellow line of jupiter .    don t move   came a low  tired voice on lucky s own wave length .   i m holding a blaster .     summers   said lucky   come down and surrender .    a note of bitter mockery entered the other s strained voice .   i guessed the right wave length  didn t i  councilman .  though it was an easy guess from the size of your friend  .   .   .  get back to your ship or i ll kill you both .    lucky said   don t bluff pointlessly .  at this distance you couldn t hit us in a dozen tries .    bigman added with tenor fury   and i m armed  too  and i can hit you even at this distance .  just remember that and don t even move a finger near the activating button .    lucky said   throw down your blaster and surrender .     never .   said summers .    why not .  to whom are you being loyal .   lucky demanded .   the sirians .  did they promise to pick you up .  if so  they lied to you and betrayed you .  they re not worth loyalty .  tell me where the sirians  base in the jupiter system is located .     you know so much .  figure it out for yourself .     what subwave combination do you use to contact them .     figure that out  too  .     .  don t move any closer .          lucky said   help us out now  summers  and i ll do my best to get you mild treatment on earth .    summers laughed weakly .   the word of a councilman .     yes .     i wouldn t take it .  get back to your ship .     why have you turned against your own world  summers .  what have the sirians offered you .  money .     money .   the other s voice was suddenly furious .   do you want to know what they offered me .  i ll tell you .  a chance at a decent life .   they could hear the tiny gritting sound summers made as his teeth ground together .   what did i have on earth .  misery all my life .  a crowded planet with no decent chance at making a name and a position for myself .  everywhere i went i was surrounded by millions of people clawing at each other for existence  and when i tried to claw also  i was put in jail .  i made up my mind that if ever i could do anything to get back at earth  i would .     what do you expect to get from sirius in the way of a decent life .     they invited me to emigrate to the sirian planets  if you must know .   he paused  and his breathing made small whistling noises .   new worlds out there .  clean worlds .  there s room for men there  they need men and talent .  i d have a chance there .     you ll never get there .  when are they coming for you .    summers was silent  lucky said   face it  man .  they re not coming for you .  they have no decent life for you  no life at all for       you .  only death for you .  you expected them before this  didn t you .     i didn t .     don t lie .  it won t improve the situation for you .  we ve checked the supplies missing from the jovian moon .  we know exactly how much oxygen you smuggled off the ship .  oxygen cylinders are clumsy things to carry even under io s gravity when you have to sneak them off without being caught and in a hurry .  your air supply is almost gone now  isn t it .     i have plenty of air   said summers .   lucky said   i say it s almost gone .  don t you see the sirians aren t coming for you .  they can t come for you without agrav and they haven t got agrav .  great galaxy  man  have you let yourself get so hungry for the sirian worlds that you ll let them kill you in as open and crude a double cross as i ve ever seen .  now  tell me  what have you done for them .    summers said   i did what they asked me to do and that wasn t much .  and if i have any regrets   he shouted in sudden  breathless bravado   if s only that i didn t get the jovian moon .  how did you get away  anyway .  i fixed it .  i fixed the rotten  slimy  .   .   .   he ended  choking .   lucky motioned to bigman and broke into the soaring lope characteristic of running on low gravity worlds .  bigman followed  veering off so as not to offer a single target .   summers  blaster came up and made a thin popping sound  all that was possible in io s thin wisps of atmosphere .  sand kicked up and around  and a crater formed yards from lucky s fleeting figure .    you won t catch me   summers yelled with a kind       of weak violence .   i m not coming back to earth .  they ll come for me .  the sirians will come for me .     up  bigman   said lucky .  he had reached the rock formation .  jumping upward  he caught a projection and hurled himself further upward .  at sixth normal gravity  a man  even in a space suit  could outdo a mountain goat in climbing .   summers screamed thinly .  his hands moved up to his helmet and he leaped backward and disappeared .   lucky and bigman reached the top .  the rock formation was nearly sheer on the other side  with sharp outcroppings breaking the clifflike face .  summers was a spread eagled figure  dropping slowly downward  striking against the face of the rock  and rebounding .   bigman said   let s get lam  lucky   and jumped far outward  wide of the cliff .  lucky followed .   it would have been a killing leap on earth  even on mars .  on io it was little more than a tooth jarring drop .   they hit with bent knees and let themselves roll to take up some of the force of impact .  lucky was on his feet first and made for summers  who lay prone and unmoving .   bigman came up panting .   hey  that wasn t the easiest jump i    what s the matter with the cobber .    lucky said grimly .   he s dead .  i knew his oxygen was low from the way he sounded .  he was almost unconscious .  it s why i rushed him .     you could go a long time being unconscious   said bigman .   lucky shook his head .   he made sure .  he really didn t want to be taken .  just before he jumped  he       opened his helmet to id s poison air and he hit the cliff .    he stepped aside and bigman caught a glimpse of the smashed face .   lucky said   poor fool .     poor traitor .   bigman raged .   he might have had the answer and he wouldn t tell us .  now he can t tell us .    lucky said   he doesn t have to  bigman .  i think i know the answer now .        robotl    you do .   the little martian s voice rose to a squeak .   what is it  lucky .    but lucky said   not now .   he gazed down at summers  whose dead eyes stared sightlessly toward the alien heavens .  he said   summers has one distinction .  he is the first man ever to die on io .    he looked up .  the sun was edging behind jupiter .  the planet was becoming only a faint silvery circle of twilit atmosphere .   lucky said   it will be dark .  let s go back to the ship .    bigman paced the floor of their cabin .  it took only three steps one way  three steps the other  but he paced .  he said   but if you know  lucky  why don t you  .   .   .    lucky said   i can t take ordinary action and risk explosion .  let me do it in my own time and my own way  bigman .    there was a firmness in ms tone that quite subdued bigman .  he changed the subject and said   well  then  why waste any more time on io because of that cobber            out there .  he s dead .  there s nothing more to do about him .     one thing   said lucky .  the door signal flashed and he added   open it  bigman .  it should be norrich .    it was .  the blind engineer stepped in  his dog  mutt  going before .   norrich s blue  unseeing eyes blinked rapidly .  he said   i ve heard about summers  councilman .  it s a terrible thing to think he tried to  .  .  .  to  .  .  .  terrible that he was a traitor .  yet somehow i m sorry for him .    lucky nodded .   i knew you would be .  it s why i asked you to come here .  it s dark out on lo now .  the sun s in eclipse .  when the eclipse is over  will you come out with me to bury summers .     gladly .  we should do that much for any man  shouldn t we .   norrich s hand dropped as if for consolation on mutt s muzzle  and the dog came close and moved softly against his master as though feeling some dim need to offer sympathy .   lucky said   i thought you would want to come along .  after all  you were his friend .  you might want to pay your last respects .     thank you .  i would like to .   norrich s blind eyes were moist .   lucky said to commander donahue just before he placed the helmet over his head   it will be our last trip out .  when we return  we will take off for jupiter nine .     good   the commander said  and there seemed some unspoken understanding as their eyes met .   lucky put on his helmet and in another corner of the pilot room  norrich s sensitive fingers moved delicately over mutt s flexible space suit  making sure all        fastenings were secure .  inside the glass fronted  odd shaped helmet that fitted over mutt s head  mutt s jaws moved in a faintly heard bark .  it was obvious the dog knew he was headed for a trip into low gravity and that he enjoyed the prospect  the first grave on io was done .  it had been dug out of hard  rocky soil by the use of force diggers .  it was filled in with a mound of gravel and topped by an oval boulder as a marker .   the three men stood round it while mutt wandered off in the distance  trying vainly  as always  to examine his surroundings  though metal and glass blocked the use of his sense of smell .   bigman  who knew what lucky expected him to do but didn t know why  waited tensely .   norrich stood with his head bowed and said softly   this was a man who wanted something very much  did wrong for that reason  and has paid for it .     he did what the sirians asked him to do   lucky added .   that was his crime .  he committed sabotage and  .   .   .    norrich stiffened as the pause in lucky s remarks lengthened .  he said   and what .     and he got you on board ship .  he refused to join the crew without you .  you yourself told me that it was only through him that you were assigned to the jovian moon .    lucky s voice grew stern .   you are a robot spy placed here by the sirians .  your blindness makes you seem innocent to the others on the project  but you don t need a sense of sight .  you killed the v frog and covered for summers to get him off the ship .  your       own death meant nothing to you hi the face of orders  as third law states .  and  finally  you fooled me by the display of emotion i caught through the v frog  a synthetic emotion built into you by the sirians .    this was the cue for which bigman had been waiting .  lifting the butt of his blaster high  he hurled himself at norrich  whose incoherent protestations did not coalesce into words .    i knew it was you   bigman shrieked   and i m smashing you .     it s not true   norrich wailed  finding his voice .  he threw up his hands and stumbled backward .   and suddenly mutt was a streak in the pale  white light .  he hurled himself furiously across the quarter mile that separated him from the men  aiming with desperate passion at bigman .   bigman paid no attention .  one hand caught at nor rich s shoulder .  the other swung the blaster upward .   then mutt collapsed .   while he was still ten feet from the struggling pair  his legs stiffened uselessly and he tumbled and rolled past them  coming to a frozen halt at last .  through the glass of his helmet his jaws could be seen hanging open  as though in mid bark .   bigman held his threatening position over norrich as though he  too  were frozen .   lucky approached the animal with quick steps .  he used his force shovel as a kind of unwieldy knife and slit mutt s space suit lengthwise from neck to tail .   then  tensely  he slit through the skin at the back of the neck and probed deftly with his mail shod fingers .  they closed on a small sphere that was not bone .  he lifted the sphere and met resistance .  holding his breath        he snapped the wires that held it in place and stood up  almost weak with relief .  the base of the brain had been the logical place for a mechanism to be activated by the brain  and he had found it .  mutt could endanger no one now .   norrich cried out  as though through instinctive knowledge of his loss .    my dog .  what are you doing to my dog .    lucky said softly   if s no dog  norrich .  never was .  it was a robot .  come  bigman  lead him back to the ship .  i ll carry mutt .    lucky and bigman were in panner s room .  the jovian moon was in flight again  and io was falling rapidly away  already only a bright coin in the sky .    what gave it away .   said panner .   lucky said somberly   a number of things which i never saw .  every clue pointed firmly to mutt  but i was so intent on finding a humanoid robot  so inwardly convinced that a robot had to look human  that i looked past the truth though it stared me in the face .     then when did you see .     when summers killed himself by jumping off the rock .  i stared at him  lying there  and thought of bigman falling through the ammonia snow and nearly dying .  i thought  there s no mutt that can save this one .   .   .   .  and that did it .     how .  i don t understand .     how did mutt save bigman .  when the dog came running up past us  bigman was somewhere under the ice  nowhere to be seen .  yet mutt plunged in  made for bigman without hesitation  and dragged him out .  we accepted that without thought because we somehow expect dogs to find what can t be seen through       their sense of smell .  but mutt s head was enclosed .  he could neither see nor smell bigman  yet had no trouble locating him .  we ought to have seen that unusual sense perception was involved .  we ll find out exactly which when our roboticists work over the carcass .     now that you explain   said panner   it looks plain enough .  the dog had to give itself away because first law compelled it not to allow a human being to come to harm .     that s right   said lucky .   once suspicions of mutt finally penetrated  a few other things started falling into place .  summers had maneuvered norrich on board  yes  but in doing so  he also got mutt on board .  moreover  summers was the one who got mutt for norrich in the first place .  the chances are that there is a spy ring on earth whose only task is to distribute these robot dogs to people working in or near critical research centers .    dogs are perfect spies .  if you find a dog nosing through your papers or walking through a super secret section of a laboratory  are you concerned .  chances are you pet the dog and feed him a dog biscuit .  i checked through mutt as best i could and i think he has a built in subetheric transmitter which keeps him in contact with his sirian masters .  they can see what he sees  hear what he hears .  for instance  they saw the v frog through mutt s eyes  recognized its danger  and directed him to kill it .  he could be made to handle an energy projector with which to fuse the lock of a door .  even if he was caught in the act  there was a good chance we would put it all down to the accidental happenings of a dog playing with a weapon he had found .          but once all this had occurred to me  i was only at the beginning of the practical problem .  i had to try to take the dog intact .  i was sure that any obvious suspicion of mutt would trigger an explosion inside him .  so first i brought norrich and mutt to a safe distance from the ship by suggesting we dig summers  grave .  in that way if mutt did explode  the ship  at least  and its men would escape .  naturally i left a note with commander donahue  to be opened in case i did not return  so that earth would at least investigate dogs in research centers .    i then accused norrich  .   .   .    bigman broke in   sands of mars  lucky  for a while i thought you really meant it when you said norrich had killed the v frog and fooled us with built in emotion .    lucky shook his head .   no  bigman .  if he could fool us with built in emotion  why bother to kill the v frog .  no  i was making sure that if sirians were listening through mutt s senses  they would be convinced i was on the wrong track .  in addition  i was setting up a situation for mutt s benefit .    you see  bigman  under instructions  attacked norrich .  as a seeing eye dog  mutt was built with strong orders to defend his master against attack  and obedience to orders are second law .  usually there s no problem here .  few people attack a blind man and those who do will usually stop if the dog simply growls and bares its fangs .    but bigman persisted in his attack  and mutt  for the first time since being built  had to carry through all the way .  but how could he .  he couldn t hurt big man .  first law .  yet he couldn t allow norrich to be       hurt either .  it was a complete dilemma and mutt went out of commission .  once that happened  i gambled that any bomb he contained could no longer be triggered .  so i removed it and after that we were safe .    panner took a deep breath .   very neat .    lucky snorted .   neat .  i could have done this the first day i landed on jupiter nine  if i had my wits about me .  i almost had it  at that .  the thought was at the edge of my mind constantly and i never caught it .    bigman said   what was it  lucky .  i still don t know .     it was simple enough .  the v frog detected animal emotion as well as human emotion .  we had an example of that when we first landed on jupiter nine .  we detected hunger in the mind of a cat .  then  later  we met norrich and he urged you to aim a blow at him in order to show off mutt s protectiveness .  you did so .  i detected norrich s emotions and yours  bigman  through the v frog  but although mutt showed every outward sign of anger  i detected no trace of such an emotion .  there was the absolute proof as early as that  that mutt had no emotions and was therefore no dog but a robot .  yet i was so convinced that i was looking for some human that my mind refused to see that point .   .   .   .  well  let s go to dinner and visit norrich on the way .  i want to promise him that we ll get him another dog  a real one .    they arose  and bigman said   anyway  lucky  maybe it took some time  but we ve stopped the sirians .    lucky said quietly   i don t know that we ve stopped them  but certainly we ve slowed them down .    about the author  isaac asimov was born in the soviet union to his great surprise .  he moved quickly to correct the situation .  when his parents emigrated to the united states  isaac  three years old at the time  stowed away in their baggage .   he has been an american citizen since the age of eight .   brought up in brooklyn  and educated in its public schools  he eventually found his way to columbia university and  over the protests of the school administration  managed to annex a series of degrees in chemistry  up to and including a ph . d .  he then infiltrated boston university and climbed the academic ladder  ignoring all cries of outrage  until he found himself professor of biochemistry .   meanwhile  at the age of nine  he found the love of his life  in the inanimate sense  when he discovered his first science fiction magazine .  by the time he was eleven  be began to write stories  and at eighteen  he actually worked up the nerve to submit one .  it was rejected .  after four long months of tribulation and suffering  he sold his first story and  thereafter  he never looked back .   in       when he was twenty one years old  he wrote the classic short story   nightfall  and his future was assured .  shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories  and shortly after that he had begun his foundation series .   what was left except quantity .  at the present time  he has published over     books  distributed through every major division of the dewey system of library classification  and shows no signs of slowing up .  he remains as youthful  as lively  and as lovable as ever  and grows more handsome with each year .  you can be sure that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious .   he is married to janet jeppson  psychiatrist and writer  has two children by a previous marriage  and lives in new york city .
