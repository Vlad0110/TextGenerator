the publisher      it was a warm spring night when a fist knocked at the door so hard that the hinges bent .   a man opened it and peered out into the street .  there was mist coming off the river and it was a cloudy night .  he might as well have tried to see through white velvet .   but he thought afterwards that there had been shapes out there  just beyond the light spilling out into the road .  a lot of shapes  watching him carefully .  he thought maybe there   d been very faint points of light     there was no mistaking the shape right in front of him  though .  it was big and dark red and looked like a child   s clay model of a man .  its eyes were two embers .      well .  what do you want at this time of night .      the golem handed him a slate  on which was written   we hear you want a golem .   of course  golems couldn   t speak  could they .      hah .  want  yes .  afford  no .  i   ve been asking around but it   s wicked the prices you   re going for these days        the golem rubbed the words off the slate and wrote   to you  one hundred dollars .      you   re for sale .      no .   the golem lurched aside .  another one stepped into the light .   it was also a golem  the man could see that .  but it wasn   t like the usual lumpen clay things that you occasionally saw .  this one gleamed like a newly polished statue  perfect down to the detailing of the clothes .  it reminded him of one of the old pictures of the city   s kings  all haughty stance and imperious haircut .  in fact  it even had a small coronet molded on to its head .      a hundred dollars .     the man said suspiciously .     what   s wrong with it .  who selling it .      nothing is wrong .  perfect in all detail .  ninety dollars .      sounds like someone wants to get rid of it in a hurry        golem must work .  golem must have a master .      yeah  right  but you hear stories   going mad and making too many things  and that .      not mad .  eighty dollars .      it looks   new     said the man  tapping the gleaming chest .     but no one   s making golems any more  that   s what   s keeping the price up beyond the purse of the small business       he stopped .     is someone making them again .      eighty dollars .      i heard the priests banned making    em years ago .  a man could get in a lot of trouble .      seventy dollars .      who   s doing it .      sixty dollars .      is he selling them to albertson .  or spadger and williams .  it   s hard enough competing as it is  and they   ve got the money to invest in new plant        fifty dollars .   the man walked around the golem .     a man can   t sit by and watch his company collapse under him because of unfair price cutting  i mean to say        forty dollars .      religion is all very well  but what do prophets know about profits  eh .  hmm       he looked up at the shapeless golem in the shadows .     was that thirty dollars i just saw you write .      yes .      i   ve always liked dealing wholesale .  wait one moment .     he went back inside and returned with a handful of coins .     will you be selling any to them other bastards .      no .      good .  tell your boss it   s a pleasure to do business with him .  get along inside  sunny jim .      the white golem walked into the factory .  the man  glancing from side to side  trotted in after it and shut the door .   deeper shadows moved in the dark .  there was a faint hissing .  then  rocking slightly  the big heavy shapes moved away .   shortly afterwards  and around the corner  a beggar holding out a hopeful hand for alms was amazed to find himself suddenly richer by a whole thirty dollars .        the discworld turned against the glittering backdrop of space  spinning very gently on the backs of the four giant elephants that perched on the shell of great a   tuin the star turtle .  continents drifted slowly past  topped by weather systems that themselves turned gently against the flow  like waltzers spinning counter to the whirl of the dance .  a billion tons of geography rolled slowly through the sky .   people look down on stuff like geography and meteorology  and not only because they   re standing on one and being soaked by the other .  they don   t look quite like real science .     but geography is only physics slowed down and with a few trees stuck on it  and meteorology is full of excitingly fashionable chaos and complexity .  and summer isn   t a time .  it   s a place as well .  summer is a moving creature and likes to go south for the winter .   even on the discworld  with its tiny orbiting sun tilting over the turning world  the seasons moved .  in ankh morpork  greatest of its cities  spring was nudged aside by summer  and summer was prodded in the back by autumn .   geographically speaking  there was not a lot of difference within the city itself  although in later spring the scum on the river was often a nice emerald green .  the mist of spring became the fog of autumn  which mixed with fumes and smoke from the magical quarter and the workshops of the alchemists until it seemed to have a thick  choking life of its own .   and time moved on .       autumn fog pressed itself against the midnight windowpanes .   blood ran in a trickle across the pages of a rare volume of religious essays  which had been torn in half .   there had been no need for that  thought father tubelcek .   a further thought suggested that there had been no need to hit him either .  but father tubelcek had never been very concerned about that sort of thing .  people healed  books didn   t .  he reached out shakily and tried to gather up the pages  but slumped back again .   the room was spinning .   the door swung open .  heavy footsteps creaked across the floor   one footstep at least  and one dragging noise .   step .  drag .  step .  drag .   father tubelcek tried to focus .     you .     he croaked .   nod .      pick   up the   books .      the old priest watched as the books were retrieved and piled carefully with fingers not well suited to the task .   the newcomer took a quill pen from the debris  carefully wrote something on a scrap of paper  then rolled it up and placed it delicately between father tubelcek   s lips .   the dying priest tried to smile .      we don   t work like that     he mumbled  the little cylinder wobbling like a last cigarette     we   make   our   own   w        the kneeling figure watched him for a while and then  taking great care  leaned forward slowly and closed his eyes .       commander sir samuel vimes  ankh morpork city guard  frowned at himself in the mirror and began to shave .   the razor was a sword of freedom .  shaving was an act of rebellion .   these days  someone ran his bath  every day .    you wouldn   t think the human skin could stand it  .  and someone laid out his clothes  such clothes .   .  and someone cooked his meals  what meals .    he was putting on weight  he knew  .  and someone even polished his boots  and such boots .    no cardboard soled wrecks but big  well fitting boots of genuine shiny leather  .  there was someone to do nearly everything for him  but there were some things a man ought to do for himself  and one of them was shaving .   he knew that lady sybil mildly disapproved .  her father had never shaved himself in his life .  he had a man for it .  vimes had protested that he   d spent too many years trudging the night time streets to be happy about anyone else wielding a blade anywhere near his neck  but the real reason  the unspoken reason  was that he hated the very idea of the world being divided into the shaved and the shavers .  or those who wore the shiny boots and those who cleaned the mud off them .  every time he saw willikins the butler fold his  vimes   s  clothes  he suppressed a terrible urge to kick the butler   s shiny backside as an affront to the dignity of man .   the razor moved calmly over the stubble of the night .   last night there had been some official dinner .  he couldn   t recall now what it had been for .  he seemed to spend his whole life at the things .  arch  giggling women and braying young men who   d been at the back of the line when the chins were handed out .  and  as usual  he   d come back through the fog bound city in a filthy temper with himself .   he   d noticed a light under the kitchen door and heard conversation and laughter  and had gone in .  willikins was there  with the old man who stoked the boiler  and the head gardener  and the boy who cleaned the spoons and lit the fires .  they were playing cards .  there were bottles of beer on the table .   he   d pulled up a chair  and cracked a few jokes and asked to be dealt in .  they   d been   welcoming .  in a way .  but as the game progressed vimes had been aware of the universe crystallizing around him .  it was like becoming a cogwheel in a glass clock .  there was no laughter .  they   d called him    sir    and kept clearing their throats .  everything was very   careful .   finally he   d mumbled an excuse and stumbled out .  halfway along the passage he   d thought he   d heard a comment followed by   well  maybe it was only a chuckle .  but it might have been a snigger .   the razor carefully circumnavigated the nose .   hah .  a couple of years ago a man like willikins would have allowed him into the kitchen only on sufferance .  and would have made him take his boots off .   so that   s your life now  commander sir samuel vimes .  a jumped up copper to the nobs and a nob to the rest  eh .   he frowned at the reflection in the mirror .   he   d started out in the gutter  true enough .  and now he was on three meat meals a day  good boots  a warm bed at night and  come to that  a wife too .  good old sybil   although she did tend to talk about curtains these days  but sergeant colon had said this happened to wives and was a biological thing and perfectly normal .   he   d actually been rather attached to his old cheap boots .  he could read the street in them  the soles were so thin .  it   d got so that he could tell where he was on a pitch dark night just by the feel of the cobbles .  ah  well     there was something mildly strange about sam vimes   s shaving mirror .  it was slightly convex  so that it reflected more of the room than a flat mirror would do  and it gave a very good view of the outbuildings and gardens beyond the window .   hmm .  going thin on top .  definitely a receding scalp there .  less hair to comb but  on the other hand  more face to wash     there was a flicker in the glass .   he moved sideways and ducked .   the mirror smashed .   there was the sound of feet somewhere beyond the broken window  and then a crash and a scream .   vimes straightened up .  he fished the largest piece of mirror out of the shaving bowl and propped it up on the black crossbow bolt that had buried itself in the wall .   he finished shaving .   then he rang the bell for the butler .  willikins materialized .     sir .      vimes rinsed the razor .     get the boy to nip along to the glazier  will you .      the butler   s eyes flickered to the window and then to the shattered mirror .     yes  sir .  and the bill to go to the assassins    guild again  sir .         with my compliments .  and while he   s out he   s to call in at that shop in five and seven yard and get me another shaving mirror .  the dwarf there knows the kind i like .         yes  sir .  and i shall fetch a dustpan and brush directly  sir .  shall i inform her ladyship of this eventuality  sir .         no .  she always says it   s my fault for encouraging them .         very good  sir     said willikins .   he dematerialized .   sam vimes dried himself off and went downstairs to the morning room  where he opened the cabinet and took out the new crossbow sybil had given to him as a wedding present .  sam vimes was used to the old guard crossbows  which had a nasty habit of firing backwards in a tight corner  but this was a burleigh and stronginthearm made to measure job with the oiled walnut stock .  there was none finer  it was said .   then he selected a thin cigar and strolled out into the garden .   there was a commotion coming from the dragon house .  vimes entered  and shut the door behind him .  he rested the crossbow against the door .   the yammering and squeaking increased .  little gouts of flame puffed above the thick walls of the hatching pens .   vimes leaned over the nearest one .  he picked up a newly hatched dragonette and tickled it under the chin .  as it flamed excitedly he lit his cigar and savored the smoke .   he blew a smoke ring at the figure hanging from the ceiling .     good morning     he said .   the figure twisted frantically .  by an amazing piece of muscle control it had managed to catch a foot around a beam as it fell  but it couldn   t quite pull itself up .  dropping was not to be thought of .  a dozen baby dragons were underneath it  jumping up and down excitedly and flaming .      er   good morning     said the hanging figure .      turned out nice again     said vimes  picking up a bucket of coal .     although the fog will be back later  i expect .      he took a small nugget of coal and tossed it to the dragons .  they squabbled for it .   vimes gripped another lump .  the young dragon that had caught the coal already had a distinctly longer and hotter flame .      i suppose     said the young man     that i could not prevail upon you to let me down .      another dragon caught some thrown coal and belched a fireball .  the young man swung desperately to avoid it .      guess     said vimes .      i suspect on reflection  that it was foolish of me to choose the roof     said the assassin .      probably     said vimes .  he   d spent several hours a few weeks ago sawing through joists and carefully balancing the roof tiles .      i should have dropped off the wall and used the shrubbery .         possibly     said vimes .  he   d set a bear trap in the shrubbery .   he took some more coal .     i suppose you wouldn   t tell me who hired you .         i   m afraid not  sir .  you know the rules .      vimes nodded gravely .     we had lady selachii   s son up before the patrician last week     said vimes .     now  there   s a lad who needs to learn that    no    doesn   t mean    yes  please    .         could be  sir .         and then there was that business with lord rust   s boy .  you can   t shoot servants for putting your shoes the wrong way round  you know .  it   s too messy .  he   ll have to learn right from left like the rest of us .  and right from wrong  too .         i hear what you say  sir .         we seem to have reached an impasse     said vimes .      it seems so  sir .      vimes aimed a lump at a small bronze and green dragon  which caught it expertly .  the heat was getting intense .      what i don   t understand     he said     is why you fellows mainly try it here or at the office .  i mean  i walk around a lot  don   t i .  you could shoot me down in the street  couldn   t you .         what .  like some common murderer  sir .      vimes nodded .  it was black and twisted  but the assassins    guild had honor of a sort .     how much was i worth .         twenty thousand  sir .         it should be higher     said vimes .      i agree .     if the assassin got back to the guild it would be  vimes thought .  assassins valued their own lives quite highly .      let me see now     said vimes  examining the end of his cigar .     guild takes fifty per cent .  that leaves ten thousand dollars .      the assassin seemed to consider this  and then reached up to his belt and tossed a bag rather clumsily towards vimes  who caught it .   vimes picked up his crossbow .     it seems to me     he said     that if a man were to be let go he might well make it to the door with no more than superficial burns .  if he were fast .  how fast are you .      there was no answer .      of course  he   d have to be desperate     said vimes  wedging the crossbow on the feed table and taking a piece of cord out of his pocket .  he lashed the cord to a nail and fastened the other end to the crossbows string .  then  standing carefully to one side  he eased the trigger .   the string moved slightly .   the assassin  watching him upside down seemed to have stopped breathing .   vimes puffed at his cigar until the end was an inferno .  then he took it out of his mouth and leaned it against the restraining cord so that it would have just a fraction of an inch to burn before the string began to smolder .      i   ll leave the door unlocked     he said .     i   ve never been an unreasonable man .  i shall watch your career with interest .      he tossed the rest of the coals to the dragons  and stepped outside .   it looked like being another eventful day in ankh morpork  and it had only just begun .   as vimes reached the house he heard a whoosh  a click  and the sound of someone running very fast towards the ornamental lake .  he smiled .   willikins was waiting with his coat .     remember you have an appointment with his lordship at eleven  sir samuel .         yes  yes     said vimes .      and you are to go and see the heralds at ten .  her ladyship was very explicit  sir .  her exact words were     tell him he   s not to try to wriggle out of it again     sir .         oh  very well .         and her ladyship said please to try not to upset anyone .         tell her i   ll try .         and your sedan chair is outside  sir .      vimes sighed .     thank you .  there   s a man in the ornamental lake .  fish him out and give him a cup of tea  will you .  promising lad  i thought .         certainly  sir .      the chair .  oh  yes  the chair .  it had been a wedding present from the patrician .  lord vetinari knew that vimes loved walking the streets of the city  and so it was very typical of the man that he presented him with something that did not allow him to do so .   it was waiting outside .  the two bearers straightened up expectantly .   sir samuel vimes  commander of the city watch  rebelled again .  perhaps he did have to use the damn thing  but     he looked at the front man and motioned with a thumb to the chair   s door .     get in     he commanded .      but sir           it   s a nice morning     said vimes  taking off his coat again .     i   ll drive myself .             dearest mumm   dad            captain carrot of the ankh morpork city watch was on his day off .  he had a routine .  first he had breakfast in some handy caf   .  then he wrote his letter home .  letters home always gave him some trouble .  letters from his parents were always interesting  being full of mining statistics and exciting news about new shafts and promising seams .  all he had to write about were murders and such things as that .   he chewed the end of his pencil for a moment .       well  it has been an interesting week again  he wrote  i am running around like a flye with a blue bottom and no mistake .  we are opening another watch house at chittling street which is handy for the shades  so now we have no less than   including dolly sisters and long wall  and i am the only captain so i am around at all hours .  personally i sometimes miss the cameradery of the old days when it was just me and nobby and sergeant colon but this is the century of the fruitbat .  sergeant colon is going to retire at the end of the month  he says mrs .  colon wants him to buy a farm  he says he is looking forward to the peace of the country and being close to nature  i   m sure you would wish him well .  my friend nobby is still nobby only more than he was .       carrot absent mindedly took a half eaten mutton chop from his breakfast plate and held it out below the table .  there was an unk .       anyway  back to the jobb  also i am sure i have told you about the cable street particulars  although they are still based in pseudopolis yard  people do not like it when watchmen do not wear uniforms but commander vimes says criminals don   t wear uniforms either so be d mned to the lot of them .       carrot paused .  it said a lot about captain carrot that  even after almost two years in ankh morpork  he was still uneasy about    d mned .          commander vimes says you have to have secret policemen because there are secret crimes         carrot paused again .  he loved his uniform .  he didn   t have any other clothes .  the idea of watchmen in disguise was   well  it was unthinkable .  it was like those pirates who sailed under false colors .  it was like spies .  however  he went on dutifully          and commander vimes knows what he is talking about i am sure .  he says it   s not like old fashioned police work which was catching the poor devils too stupid to run away .  .  anyhow it all means a lot more work and new faces in the watch .       while he waited for a new sentence to form  carrot took a sausage from his plate and lowered it .   there was another unk .   the waiter bustled up .      another helping  mister carrot .  on the house .     every restaurant and eatery in ankh morpork offered free food to carrot  in the certain and happy knowledge that he would always insist on paying .      no  indeed  that was very good .  here we are   twenty pence and keep the change .         how   s your young lady .  haven   t seen her today .         angua .  oh  she   s   around and about  you know .  i shall definitely tell her you asked after her  though .      the dwarf nodded happily  and bustled off .   carrot wrote another few dutiful lines and then said  very softly     is that horse and cart still outside ironcrust   s bakery .      there was a whine from under the table .      really .  that   s odd .  all the deliveries were over hours ago and the flour and grit don   t usually arrive until the afternoon .  driver still sitting there .      something barked  quietly .      and that looks quite a good horse for a delivery cart .  and  you know  normally you   d expect the driver to put a nosebag on .  and it   s the last thursday in the month .  which is payday at ironcrust   s .     carrot laid down his pencil and waved a hand politely to catch the waiter   s eye .      cup of acorn coffee  mr .  gimlet .  to take away .          in the dwarf bread museum  in whirligig alley  mr .  hopkinson the curator was somewhat excited .  apart from other considerations  he   d just been murdered .  but at the moment he was choosing to consider this as an annoying background detail .   he   d been beaten to death with a loaf of bread .  this is unlikely even in the worst of human bakeries  but dwarf bread has amazing properties as a weapon of offense .  dwarfs regard baking as part of the art of warfare .  when they make rock cakes  no simile is intended .      look at this dent here     said hopkinson .     it   s quite ruined the crust .      and your skull too  said death .      oh  yes     said hopkinson  in the voice of one who regards skulls as ten a penny but is well aware of the rarity value of a good bread exhibit .     but what was wrong with a simple cosh .  or even a hammer .  i could have provided one if asked .      death  who was by nature an obsessive personality himself  realized that he was in the presence of a master .  the late mr .  hopkinson had a squeaky voice and wore his spectacles on a length of black tape   his ghost now wore their spiritual counterpart   and these were always the signs of a mind that polished the undersides of furniture and stored paperclips by size .      it really is too bad     said mr .  hopkinson .     and ungrateful  too  after the help i gave them with the oven .  i really feel i shall have to complain .      mr .  hopkinson  are you fully aware that you are dead .      dead .     trilled the curator .     oh  no .  i can   t possibly be dead .  not at the moment .  it   s simply not convenient .  i haven   t even catalogued the combat muffins .      nevertheless .      no  no .  i   m sorry  but it just won   t do .  you will have to wait .  i really cannot be bothered with that sort of nonsense .      death was nonplussed .  most people were  after the initial confusion  somewhat relieved when they died .  a subconscious weight had been removed .  the other cosmic shoe had dropped .  the worst had happened and they could  metaphorically  get on with their lives .  few people treated it as a simple annoyance that might go away if you complained enough .   mr .  hopkinson   s hand went through a tabletop .     oh .      you see .      this is most uncalled for .  couldn   t you have arranged a less awkward time .      only by consultation with your murderer .      it all seems very badly organized .  i wish to make a complaint .  i pay my taxes  after all .      i am death  not taxes .  i turn up only once .   the shade of mr .  hopkinson began to fade .     it   s simply that i   ve always tried to plan ahead in a sensible way        i find the best approach is to take life as it comes .      that seems very irresponsible        it   s always worked for me .       the sedan chair came to a halt outside pseudopolis yard .  vimes left the runners to park it and strode in  putting his coat back on .   there had been a time  and it seemed like only yesterday  when the watch house had been almost empty .  there   d be old sergeant colon dozing in his chair  and corporal nobbs   s washing drying in front of the stove .  and then suddenly it had all changed     sergeant colon was waiting for him with a clipboard .     got the reports from the other watch houses  sir     he said  trotting along beside vimes .      anything special .         bin a bit of an odd murder  sir .  down in one of them old houses on misbegot bridge .  some old priest .  dunno much about it .  the patrol just said it ought to be looked at .         who found him .         constable visit  sir .         oh  gods .         yessir .         i   ll try to get along there this morning .  anything else .         corporal nobbs is sick  sir .         oh  i know that .         i mean off sick  sir .         not his granny   s funeral this time .         nossir .         how many   s he had this year  by the way .         seven  sir .         very odd family  the nobbses .         yessir .         fred  you don   t have to keep calling me    sir    .         got comp   ny  sir     said the sergeant  glancing meaningfully towards a bench in the main office .     come for that alchemy job .      a dwarf smiled nervously at vimes .      all right     said vimes .     i   ll see him in my office .     he reached into his coat and took out the assassin   s money pouch .     put it in the widows and orphans fund  will you  fred .         right .  oh  well done  sir .  any more windfalls like this and we   ll soon be able to afford some more widows .      sergeant colon went back to his desk  surreptitiously opened his drawer and pulled out the book he was reading .  it was called animal husbandry .  he   d been a bit worried about the title   you heard stories about strange folk in the country   but it turned out to be nothing more than a book about how cattle and pigs and sheep should breed .   upstairs  vimes pushed open his office door carefully .  the assassins    guild played to rules .  you could say that about the bastards .  it was terribly bad form to kill a bystander .  apart from anything else  you wouldn   t get paid .  so traps in his office were out of the question  because too many people were in and out of it every day .  even so  it paid to be careful .  vimes was good at making the kind of rich enemies who could afford to employ assassins .  the assassins had to be lucky only once  but vimes had to be lucky all the time .   he slipped into the room and glanced out of the window .  he liked to work with it open  even in cold weather .  he liked to hear the sounds of the city .  but anyone trying to climb up or down to it would run into everything in the way of loose tiles  shifting handholds and treacherous drainpipes that vimes   s ingenuity could contrive .  and vimes had installed spiked railings down below .  they were nice and ornamental but they were  above all  spiky .   so far  vimes was winning .   there was a tentative knock at the door .   it had issued from the knuckles of the dwarf applicant .  vimes ushered him into office  shut the door  and sat down at his desk .      so     he said .     you   re an alchemist .  acid stains on your hands and no eyebrows .         that   s right  sir .         not usual to find a dwarf in that line of work .  you people always seem to toil in your uncle   s foundry or something .      you people  the dwarf noted .     can   t get the hang of metal     he said .      a dwarf who can   t get the hang of metal .  that must be unique .         pretty rare  sir .  but i was quite good at alchemy .         guild member .         not any more  sir .         oh .  how did you leave the guild .         through the roof  sir .  but i   m pretty certain i know what i did wrong .      vimes leaned back .     the alchemists are always blowing things up .  i never heard of them getting sacked for it .         that   s because no one   s ever blown up the guild council  sir .         what  all of it .         most of it  sir .  all the easily detachable bits  at least .      vimes found he was automatically opening the bottom drawer of his desk .  he pushed it shut again and  instead  shuffled the papers in front of him .     what   s your name  lad .      the dwarf swallowed .  this was clearly the bit he   d been dreading .     littlebottom  sir .      vimes didn   t even look up .      ah  yes .  it says here .  that means you   re from the uberwald mountain area  yes .         why   yes  sir     said littlebottom  mildly surprised .  humans generally couldn   t distinguish between dwarf clans .      our constable angua comes from there     said vimes .     now   it says here your first name is   can   t read fred   s handwriting   er        there was nothing for it .     cheery  sir     said cheery littlebottom .      cheery  eh .  good to see the old naming traditions kept up .  cheery littlebottom .  fine .      littlebottom watched carefully .  not the faintest glimmer of amusement had crossed vimes   s face .      yes  sir .  cheery littlebottom     he said .  and there still wasn   t as much as an extra wrinkle there .     my father was jolly .  jolly littlebottom     he added  as one might prod at a bad tooth to see when the pain will come .      really .         and   his father was beaky littlebottom .      not a trace  not a smidgeon of a grin twitched anywhere .  vimes merely pushed the paper aside .      well  we work for a living here  littlebottom .         yes  sir .         we don   t blow things up  littlebottom .         no  sir .  i don   t blow everything up  sir .  some just melts .      vimes drummed his fingers on the desk .     know anything about dead bodies .         they were only mildly concussed  sir .      vimes sighed .     listen .  i know about how to be a copper .  it   s mainly walking and talking .  but there   s lots of things i don   t know .  you find the scene of a crime and there   s some gray powder on the floor .  what is it .  i don   t know .  but you fellows know how to mix things up in bowls and can find out .  and maybe the dead person doesn   t seem to have a mark on them .  were they poisoned .  it seems we need someone who knows what color a liver is supposed to be .  i want someone who can look at the ashtray and tell me what kind of cigars i smoke .         pantweed   s slim panatellas     said littlebottom automatically .      good gods .         you   ve left the packet on the table  sir .      vimes looked down .     all right     he said .     so sometimes it   s an easy answer .  but sometimes it isn   t .  sometimes we don   t even know if it was the right question .      he stood up .     i can   t say i like dwarfs much  littlebottom .  but i don   t like trolls or humans either  so i suppose that   s ok .  well  you   re the only applicant   thirty dollars a month  five dollars living out allowance .  i expect you to work to the job not the clock .  there   s some mythical creature called     overtime     only no one   s even seen its footprints .  if troll officers call you a grit sucker they   re out  and if you call them rocks you   re out .  we   re just one big family and  when you   ve been to a few domestic disputes  littlebottom  i can assure you that you   ll see the resemblance .  we work as a team and we   re pretty much making it up as we go along  and half the time we   re not even certain what the law is  so it can get interesting .  technically you   ll rank as a corporal  only don   t go giving orders to real policemen .  you   re on a month   s trial .  we   ll give you some training just as soon as there   s time .  now  find an iconograph and meet me on misbegot bridge in   damn   better make it an hour   i   ve got to see about this blasted coat of arms .  still  dead bodies seldom get deader .  sergeant detritus .      there was a series of creaks as something heavy moved along the corridor outside and a troll opened the door .      yessir .         this is corporal littlebottom .  corporal cheery littlebottom  whose father was jolly littlebottom .  give him his badge  swear him in  show him where everything is .  very good  corporal .         i shall try to be a credit to the uniform  sir     said littlebottom .      good     said vimes briskly .  he looked at detritus .     incidentally  sergeant  i   ve got a report here that a troll in uniform nailed one of chrysoprase   s henchmen to a wall by his ears last night .  know anything about that .      the troll wrinkled its enormous forehead .     does it say anything    bout him selling bags of slab to troll kids .         no .  it says he was going to read spiritual literature to his dear old mother     said vimes .      did hardcore say he saw dis troll   s badge .         no  but he says the troll threatened to ram it where the sun doesn   t shine     said vimes .   detritus nodded gravely .     dat   s a long way to go just to ruin a good badge     he said .      by the way     said vimes     that was a lucky guess of yours  guessing that it was hardcore .         it come to me in a flash  sir     said detritus .     i fort  what bastard who sells slab to kids deserves bein    nailed up by his ears  sir  and   bingo .  dis idea just formed in my head .         that   s what i thought .      cheery littlebottom looked from one impassive face to the other .  the watchmen   s eyes never left each other   s face  but the words seemed to come from a little distance  as though both of them were reading an invisible script .   then detritus shook his head slowly .     musta been a impostor  sir .     s easy to get helmets like ours .  none of my trolls   d do anything like dat .  dat would be police brutality  sir .         glad to hear it .  just for the look of the thing  though  i want you to check the trolls    lockers .  the silicon anti defamation league are on to this one .         yes  sir .  an    if i find out it was one of my trolls i will be down on dat troll like a ton of rectang   lar buildin    things  sir .         fine .  well  off you go  littlebottom .  detritus will look after you .      littlebottom hesitated .  this was uncanny .  the man hadn   t mentioned axes  or gold .  he hadn   t even said anything like    you can make it big in the watch .     littlebottom felt really unbalanced .      er   i did tell you my name  didn   t i  sir .         yes .  got it down here     said vimes .     cheery littlebottom .  yes .         er   yes .  that   s right .  well  thank you  sir .      vimes listened to them go down the passage .  then he carefully shut the door and put his coat over his head so that no one would hear him laughing .      cheery littlebottom .          cheery ran after the troll called detritus .  the watch house was beginning to fill up .  and it was clear that the watch dealt with all sorts of things  and that many of them involved shouting .   two uniformed trolls were standing in front of sergeant colon   s high desk  with a slightly smaller troll between them .  this troll was wearing a downcast expression .  it was also wearing a tutu and had a small pair of gauze wings glued to its back .         happen to know that trolls don   t have any tradition of a tooth fairy     colon was saying .     especially not one called      he looked down      clinkerbell .  so how about it we just call it breaking and entering without a thieves    guild license .         it   s racial prejudice  not letting trolls have a tooth fairy     clinkerbell muttered .   one of the troll guards upended a sack on the desk .  various items of silverware cascaded over the paperwork .      and this is what you found under their pillows  was it .     said colon .      bless dere little hearts     said clinkerbell .   at the next desk a tired dwarf was arguing with a vampire .     look     he said     it   s not murder .  you   re dead already  right .         he stuck them right in me .         well  i   ve been down to interview the manager and he said it was an accident .  he said he   s got nothing against vampires at all .  he says he was merely carrying three boxes of hb eraser tips and tripped over the edge of your cloak .         i don   t see why i can   t work where i like .         yes  but   in a pencil factory .      detritus looked down at littlebottom and grinned .     welcome to life in der big city  littlebottom  he said .     dat   s an int   restin    name .         is it .         most dwarfs have names like rockheaver or stronginthearm .         do they .      detritus was not one for the fine detail of relationships  but the edge in littlebottom   s voice got through to him .        s a good name  though     he said .      what   s slab .     said cheery .      it are chloric ammonium an    radium mixed up .  it give your head a tingle but melts troll brains .  big problem in der mountains and some buggers are makin    it here in der city and we tryin    to find how it get up dere .  mister vimes is lettin    me run a      detritus concentrated      pub lic a ware ness campaign tellin    people what happens to buggers who sells it to kids       he waved a hand at a large and rather crudely done poster on the wall .  it said          slab  jus    say     aarrghaarrghpleeassennononough    .          he pushed open a door .      dis is der ole privy wot we don   t use no more  you can use it for mixin    up stuff  it the only place we got now  you have to clean it up first    cos it smells like a toilet in here .      he opened another door .     and this der locker room     he said .     you got your own peg and dat  and dere   s dese panels for getting changed behind    cos we knows you dwarfs is modest .  it a good life if you don   t weaken .  mr .  vimes is ok but he a bit weird about some stuff  he keepin    on sayin    stuff like dis city is a meltin    pot an    all der scum floats to der top  and stuff like dat .  i   ll give you your helmet an    badge in a minute but first      he opened a rather larger locker on the other side of the room  which had    dtritus    painted on it      i got to go and hide dis hammer .          two figures hurried out of ironcrust   s dwarf bakery     t   bread wi    t   edge      threw themselves on to the cart and shouted at the driver to leave urgently .   he turned a pale face towards them and pointed to the road ahead .   there was a wolf there .   not a usual kind of wolf .  it had a blond coat  which around its ears was almost long enough to be a mane .  and wolves did not normally sit calmly on their haunches in the middle of a street .   this one was growling .  a long  low growl .  it was the audible equivalent of a shortening fuse .   the horse was transfixed  too frightened to stay where it was but far too terrified to move .   one of the men carefully reached for a crossbow .  the growl rose slightly .  he even more carefully took his hand away .  the growl subsided again .      what is it .         it   s a wolf .         in a city .  what does it find to eat .         oh  why did you have to ask that .         good morning  gentlemen .     said carrot  as he stopped leaning against the wall .     looks like the fog   s rising again .  thieves    guild licenses  please .      they turned .  carrot gave them a happy smile and nodded encouragingly .   one of the men patted his coat in a theatrical display of absent mindedness .      ah .  well .  er .  left the house in a bit of a hurry this morning  must   ve forgotten           section two  rule one of the thieves    guild charter says that members must carry their cards on all professional occasions     said carrot .      he   s not even drawn his sword .     hissed the most stupid of the three strong gang .      he doesn   t need to  he   s got a loaded wolf .          someone was writing in the gloom  the scritching of their pen the only sound .   until a door creaked open .   the writer turned as quick as a bird .     you .  i told you never to come back here .         i know  i know  but it   s that damn thing .  the production line stopped and it got out and it   s killed that priest .         did anyone see it .         in the fog we had last night .  i shouldn   t think so .  but           then it is not  ah ha  a matter of significance .         no .  they   re not supposed to kill people .  well   that is     the speaker conceded     not by smashing them on the head  anyway .         they will if so instructed .         i never told it to .  anyway  what if it turns on me .         on its master .  it can   t disobey the words in its head  man .      the visitor sat down  shaking his head .     yeah  but which words .  i don   t know  i don   t know  this is getting too much  that damn    thing around all the time           making you a fat profit           all right  all right  but this other stuff  the poison  i never           shut up .  i   ll see you again tonight .  you can tell the others that i certainly do have a candidate .  and if you dare come here again            the ankh morpork royal college of heralds turned out to be a green gate in a wall in mollymog street .  vimes tugged on the bell pull .  something clanged on the other side of the wall and immediately the place erupted in a cacophony of hoots  growls  whistles and trumpetings .   a voice shouted .     down  boy .  couchant .  i said couchant .  no .  not rampant .  and thee shall have a sugar lump like a good boy .  william .  stop that at once .  put him down .  mildred  let go of graham .      the animal noises subsided a bit and footsteps approached .  a wicket gate in the main door opened a fraction .   vimes saw an inch wide segment of a very short man .      yes .  are you the meat man .         commander vimes     said vimes .     i have an appointment .      the animal noises started up again .      eh .         commander vimes .     vimes shouted .      oh .  i suppose thee   d better come in .      the door swung open .  vimes stepped through .   silence fell .  several dozen pairs of eyes regarded vimes with acute suspicion .  some of the eyes were small and red .  several were big and poked just above the surface of the scummy pond that occupied a lot of space in the yard .  some were on perches .   the yard was full of animals  but even they were crowded out by the smell of a yard full of animals .  and most of them were clearly very old  which didn   t do anything for the smell .   a toothless lion yawned at vimes .  a lion running  or at least lounging around loose was amazing in itself  but not so amazing as the fact that it was being used as a cushion by an elderly gryphon  which was asleep with all four claws in the air .   there were hedgehogs  and a graying leopard  and molting pelicans .  green water surged in the pond and a couple of hippos surfaced and yawned .  nothing was in a cage  and nothing was trying to eat anything else .      ah  it takes people like that  first time     said the old man .  he had a wooden leg .     we   re quite a happy little family .      vimes turned and found himself looking at a small owl .     my gods     he said .     that   s a morpork  isn   t it .      the old man   s face broke into a happy smile .     ah  i can see thee knows thy heraldry     he cackled .     daphne   s ancestors came all the way from some islands on the other side of the hub  so they did .      vimes took out his badge and stared at the coat of arms embossed thereon .   the old man looked over his shoulder .     that   s not her  o    course     he said  indicating the owl perched on the ankh .     that was her great grandma  olive .  a morpork on an ankh  see .  that is a pun or play on words .  laugh .  i nearly started .  that   s about as funny as you gets round here .  we could do with a mate for her  tell you the truth .  and a female hippo .  i mean  his lordship says we   ve got two hippos  which is right enough  i   m just saying it   s not natural for roderick and keith  i ain   t passing judgment  it   s just not right  that   s all i   m saying .  what was thy name again .         vimes .  sir samuel vimes .  my wife made the appointment .      the old man cackled again .     ah     tis usually so .      moving quite fast despite his wooden leg  the old man led the way through the steaming mounds of multi species dung to the building on the other side of the yard .      i expect this is good for the garden  anyway     said vimes  trying to make conversation .      i tried it on my rhubarb     said the old man  pushing open the door .     but it grew to twenty feet tall  sir  and then spontaneously caught fire .  mind where the wyvern   s been  sir  he   s been ill   oh  what a shame .  never mind  it   ll scrape off beautiful when it dries .  in thee goes  sir .      the hall inside was as quiet and dark as the yard had been full of light and noise .  there was the dry  tombstone smell of old books and church towers .  above him  when his eyes got used to the darkness  vimes could make out hanging flags and banners .  there were a few windows  but cobwebs and dead flies meant that the light they allowed in was merely gray .   the old man had shut the door and left him alone .  vimes watched through the window as he limped back to continue what he had been doing before vimes   s appearance .   what he had been doing was setting up a living coat of arms .   there was a large shield .  cabbages  actual cabbages  had been nailed to it .  the old man said something that vimes couldn   t hear .  the little owl fluttered from its perch and landed on a large ankh that had been glued to the top of the shield .  the two hippos flopped out of their pool and took up station on either side .   the old man unfolded an easel in front of the scene  placed a canvas on it  picked up a palette and brush  and shouted     hup la .      the hippos reared  rather arthritically .  the owl spread its wings .      good gods     murmured vimes .     i always thought they just made it up .         made it up  sir .  made it up .     said voice behind him .     we   d soon be in trouble if we made things up  oh dear me  yes .      vimes turned .  another little old man had appeared behind him  blinking happily through thick glasses .  he had several scrolls under one arm .      i   m sorry i couldn   t meet you at the gate but we   re very busy at the moment     he said  holding out his spare hand .     croissant rouge pursuivant .         er   you   re a small red breakfast roll .     said vimes  nonplussed .      no  no .  no .  it means red crescent .  it   s my title  you see .  very ancient title .  i   m a herald .  you   d be sir samuel vimes  yes .         yes .      red crescent consulted a scroll .     good .  good .  how do you feel about weasels .     he said .      weasels .         we have got some weasels  you see .  i know they   re not strictly a heraldic animal  but we seem to have some on the strength and frankly i think i   m going to have to let them go unless we can persuade someone to adopt them  and that   d upset pardessus chatain pursuivant .  he always locks himself in his shed when he   s upset           pardessus   you mean the old man out there .     said vimes .     i mean   why   s he   i thought you   i mean  a coat of arms is just a design .  you don   t have to paint it from life .      red crescent looked shocked .     well  i suppose if you want to make a complete mockery of the whole thing  yes  you could just make it up .  you could do that     he said .     anyway   not weasels  then .         personally i   d just as soon not bother     said vimes .     and certainly not with a weasel .  my wife said that dragons would           happily  the occasion will not arise     said a voice in the shadows .   it wasn   t the right sort of voice to hear in any kind of light .  it was dust dry .  it sounded as if it came from a mouth that had never known the pleasures of spittle .  it sounded dead .   it was .       the bakery thieves considered their options .      i   ve got my hand on my crossbow     said the most enterprising of the three .   the most realistic said     have you .  well  i   ve got my heart in my mouth .         ooo     said the third .     i   ve got a weak heart  me           yeah  but what i mean is   he   s not even wearing a sword .  if i take the wolf  the two of you should be able to deal with him with no trouble  right .      the one clear thinker looked at captain carrot .  his armor shone .  so did the muscles on his bare arms .  even his knees gleamed .      it seems to me that we have a bit of an impasse  or stand off     said captain carrot .      how about if we throw down the money .     said the clear thinker .      that would certainly help matters .         and you   d let us go .         no .  but it would definitely count in your favor and i would certainly speak up on your behalf .      the bold one with the crossbow licked his lips and glanced from carrot to the wolf .     if you set it on us  i warn you  someone   s going to get killed .     he warned .      yes  it could happen     said carrot  sadly .     i   d prefer to avoid that  if at all possible .      he raised his hands .  there was something flat and round and about six inches across in each one .     this     he said     is dwarf bread .  some of mr .  ironcrust   s best .  it   s not classic battlebread  of course  but it   s probably good enough for slicing        carrot   s arm blurred .  there was a brief flurry of sawdust  and the flat loaf spun to a stop half way through the thick timbers of the cart and about half an inch away from the man with the weak heart and  as it turned out  a fragile bladder  too .   the man with the crossbow tore his attention away from the bread only when he felt a slight  damp pressure on his wrist .   there was no way that an animal could have moved that fast  but there it was  and the wolf   s expression contrived to indicate very calmly that if the animal so desired the pressure could be increased more or less indefinitely .      call it off .     he said  flinging the bow away with his free hand .     tell it to let go .         oh  i never tell her anything     said carrot .     she makes up her own mind .      there was a clatter of iron shod boots and half a dozen axe bearing dwarfs raced out of the bakery gates  kicking up sparks as they skidded to a halt beside carrot .      get them .     shouted mr .  ironcrust .  carrot dropped a hand on top of the dwarf   s helmet and turned him around .      it   s me  mr .  ironcrust     he said .     i believe these are the men .         right you are  captain carrot .     said the dwarf baker .     c   mon  lads .  let   s hang    em up by the bura   zak ka .          ooo     murmured the weak of heart  damply .      now  now  mr .  ironcrust     said carrot patiently .     we don   t practice that punishment in ankh morpork .           they bashed bjorn tightbritches senseless .  and they kicked olaf stronginthearm in the bad   dhakz .     we   ll cut their           mr .  ironcrust .      the dwarf baker hesitated and then  to the amazement and relief of the thieves  took a step backwards .     yeah   all right  captain carrot .  if you say so .         i have business elsewhere  but i would be grateful if you would take them and turn them over to the thieves    guild     said carrot .   the quick thinker went pale .     oh  no .  they get really intense about unlicensed thieving .  anything but the thieves    guild .      carrot turned .  the light caught his face in a certain way .     anything .     he said .   the unlicensed thieves looked at one another  and then all spoke at once .      the thieves    guild .  fine .  no problem .         we like the thieves    guild .         can   t wait .  thieves    guild  here i come .         fine body of men .         firm but fair .         good     said carrot .     then everyone   s happy .  oh  yes .     he dug into his money pouch .     here   s five pence for the loaf  mr .  ironcrust .  i   ve handled the other one  but you should be able to sand it off with no trouble .      the dwarf blinked at the coins .     you want to pay me for saving my money .     he said .      as a tax payer you are entitled to the protection of the watch     said carrot .   there was a delicate pause .  mr .  ironcrust stared at his feet .  one or two of the other dwarfs started to snigger .      i   ll tell you what     said carrot  in a kindly voice     i   ll come around when i get a moment and help you fill in the forms  how about that .      a thief broke the embarrassed silence .      er   could your   little dog   let go of my arm  please .      the wolf released its grip  jumped down and padded over to carrot  who raised his hand to his helmet respectfully .      good day to you all     he said  and strode away .   thieves and victims watched him go .      is he real .     said the quick thinker .   there was a growl from the baker  then    you bastards .     he shouted .     you bastards .         wha   what .  you   ve got the money back  haven   t you .      two of his employees had to hold mr .  ironcrust back .      three years .     he said .     three years and no one bothered .  three bloody years and not so much as a knock at the door .  and he   ll ask me .  oh  yes .  he   ll be nice about it .  he   ll probably even go and get the extra forms so i won   t be put to the trouble .  why couldn   t you buggers have just run away .          vimes peered around the shadowy  musty room .  the voice might as well have come from a tomb .   a panicky look crossed the face of the little herald .     perhaps sir samuel would be kind enough to step this way .     said the voice .  it was chilly  clipping every syllable with precision .  it was the kind of voice that didn   t blink .      that is  in fact  er   dragon     said red crescent .   vimes reached for his sword .      dragon king of arms     said the man .      king of arms .     said vimes .      merely a title     said the voice .     pray enter .      for some reason the words re spelled themselves in vimes   s hindbrain as    prey  enter .         king of arms     said the voice of dragon  as vimes passed into the shadows of the inner sanctum .     you will not need your sword  commander .  i have been dragon king of arms for more than five hundred years but i do not breathe fire  i assure you .  ah ha .  ah ha .         ah ha     said vimes .  he couldn   t see the figure clearly .  the light came from a few high and grubby windows  and several dozen candles that burned with black edged flames .  there was a suggestion of hunched shoulders in the shape before him .      pray be seated     said dragon king of arms .     and i would be most indebted if you would look to your left and raise your chin .         and expose my neck  you mean .     said vimes .      ah ha .  ah ha .      the figure picked up a candelabrum and moved closer .  a hand so skinny as to be skeletal gripped vimes   s chin and moved it gently this way and that .      ah  yes .  you have the vimes profile  certainly .  but not the vimes ears .  of course  your maternal grandmother was a clamp .  ah ha        the vimes hand gripped the vimes sword again .  there was only one type of person that had that much strength in a body so apparently frail .      i thought so .  you are a vampire .     he said .     you   re a bloody vampire .         ah ha .     it might have been a laugh .  it might have been a cough .     yes .  vampire  indeed .  yes  i   ve heard about your views on vampires .     not really alive but not dead enough     i believe you have said .  i think that is rather clever .  ah ha .  vampire  yes .  bloody  no .  black puddings  yes .  the acme of the butcher   s art  yes .  and if all else fails there are plenty of kosher butchers down in long hogmeat .  ah ha  yes .  we all live in the best way we can .  ah ha .  virgins are safe from me .  ah ha .  for several hundred years  more   s the pity .  ah ha .      the shape  and the pool of candlelight  moved away .      i   m afraid your time has been needlessly wasted  commander vimes .      vimes   s eyes were growing accustomed to the flickering light .  the room was full of books  in piles .  none of them were on shelves .  each one sprouted bookmarks like squashed fingers .      i don   t understand     he said .  either dragon king of arms had very hunched shoulders or there were wings under his shapeless robe .  some of them could fly like a bat  vimes recalled .  he wondered how old this one was .  they could    live    almost forever        i believe you   re here because it is considered  ah ha  appropriate that you have a coat of arms .  i am afraid that this is not possible .  ah ha .  a vimes coat of arms has existed  but it cannot be resurrected .  it would be against the rules .         what rules .      there was a thump as a book was taken down and opened .      i   m sure you know your ancestry  commander .  your father was thomas vimes  his father was gwilliam vimes           it   s old stoneface  isn   t it     said vimes flatly .     it   s something to do with old stoneface .         indeed .  ah ha .  suffer not injustice vimes .  your ancestor .  old stoneface  indeed  as he was called .  commander of the city watch in      .  and a regicide .  he murdered the last king of ankh morpork  as every schoolboy knows .         executed .      the shoulders shrugged .     nevertheless  the family crest was  as we say in heraldry  excretus est ex altitudine .  that is to say  depositatum de latrina .  destroyed .  banned .  made incapable of resurrection .  lands confiscated  house pulled down  page torn out of history .  ah ha .  you know  commander  it is interesting that so many of  ah ha     old stoneface   s    descendants      the inverted commas dropped neatly around the nickname like an old lady carefully picking up something nasty in a pair of tongs      have been officers of the watch .  i believe  commander  that you too have acquired the nickname .  ah ha .  ah ha .  i have wondered whether there is some inherited urge to expunge the infamy .  ah ha .      vimes gritted his teeth .     are you telling me i can   t have a coat of arms .         this is so .  ah ha .         because my ancestor killed a       he paused .     no  it wasn   t even execution     he said .     you execute a human being .  you slaughter an animal        he was the king     said dragon mildly .      oh  yes .  and it turned out that down in the dungeons he had machines for           commander     said the vampire  holding up his hands     i feel you do not understand me .  whatever else he was  he was the king .  you see  a crown is not like a watchman   s helmet  ah ha .  even when you take it off  it   s still on the head .         stoneface took it off all right .         but the king did not even get a trial .         no willing judge could be found     said vimes .      except you   that is  your ancestor           well .  someone had to do it .  some monsters should not walk under the living sky .      dragon found the page he had been looking for and turned the book around .     this was his escutcheon     he said .   vimes looked down at the familiar sign of the morpork owl perched on an ankh .  it was atop a shield divided into four quarters  with a symbol in each quarter .      what   s this crown with a dagger through it .         oh  a traditional symbol  ah ha .  indicates his role as defender of the crown .         really .  and the bunch of rods with an axe in it .     he pointed .      a fasces .  symbolizes that he is   was an officer of the law .  and the axe was an interesting harbinger of things to come  yes .  but axes  i   m afraid  solve nothing .      vimes stared at the third quarter .  it contained a painting of what seemed to be a marble bust .      symbolizing his nickname     old stoneface        said dragon helpfully .     he asked that some reference be made .  sometimes heraldry is nothing more than the art of punning .         and this last one .  a bunch of grapes .  bit of a boozer  was he .     said vimes sourly .      no .  ah ha .  word play .  vimes   vines .         ah .  the art of bad punning     said vimes .     i bet that had you people rolling on the floor .      dragon shut the book and sighed .     there is seldom a reward for those who do what must be done .  alas  such is precedent  and i am powerless .     the old voice brightened up .     but  still   i was extremely pleased  commander  to hear of your marriage to lady sybil .  an excellent lineage .  one of the most noble families in the city  ah ha .  the ramkins  the selachiis  the venturis  the nobbses  of course           that   s it  is it .     said vimes .     i just go now .         i seldom get visitors     said dragon .     generally people are seen by the heralds  but i thought you should get a proper explanation .  ah ha .  we   re so busy now .  once we dealt with real heraldry .  but this  they tell me  is the century of the fruitbat .  now it seems that  as soon as a man opens his second meat pie shop  he feels impelled to consider himself a gentleman .     he waved a thin white hand at three coats of arms pinned in a row on a board .     the butcher  the baker and the candlestick maker     he sneered  but genteelly .     well  the candle maker  in point of fact .  nothing will do but that we burrow through the records and prove them acceptably armigerous        vimes glanced at the three shields .     haven   t i seen that one before .     he said .      ah .  mr .  arthur carry the candle maker     said dragon .     suddenly business is booming and he feels he must be a gentleman .  a shield bisected by a bend sinister d   une m  che en metal gris   that is to say  a steel gray shield indicating his personal determination and zeal  how zealous  ah ha  these businessmen are .   bisected by a wick .  upper half  a chandelle in a fen  tre avec rideaux houlant  a candle lighting a window with a warm glow  ah ha   lower half two chandeliers illumin    indicating the wretched man sells candles to rich and poor alike  .  fortunately his father was a harbor master  which fact allowed us to stretch ourselves a little with a crest of a lampe au poisson  fish shaped lamp   indicating both this and his son   s current profession .  the motto i left in the common modern tongue and is    art brought forth the candle .     i   m sorry  ah ha  it was naughty but i couldn   t resist it .         my sides ache     said vimes .  something kicked his brain  trying to get attention .      this one is for mr .  gerhardt sock  president of the butchers    guild     said dragon .     his wife   s told him a coat of arms is the thing to have  and who are we to argue with the daughter of a tripe merchant  so we   ve made him a shield of red  for blood  and blue and white stripes  for a butcher   s apron  bisected by a string of sausages  centralis a cleaver held in a gloved hand  a boxing glove  which is  ah ha  the best we could do for    sock .     motto is futurus meus est in visceris  which translates as    my future is in  the  entrails     both relating to his profession and  ah ha  alluding to the old practice of telling              the future from entrails     said vimes .     a mazing .     whatever was trying to get into his attention was really jumping up and down now .      while this one  ah ha  is for rudolph potts of the bakers    guild     said dragon  pointing to the third shield with a twig thin finger .     can you read it  commander .      vimes gave it a gloomy stare .     well  it   s divided into three  and there   s a rose  a flame and a pot     he said .     er   bakers use fire and the pot   s for water  i suppose           and a pun on the name     said dragon .      but  unless he   s called rosie  i       then vimes blinked .     a rose is a flower .  oh  good grief .  flower  flour .  flour  fire and water .  the pot looks like a guzunder to me  though .  a chamber pot .         the old word for baker was pistor     said dragon .     why  commander  we should make a herald of you yet .  and the motto .         quod subigo farinam     said vimes  and wrinkled his forehead .        because         farinaceous    means to do with corn  or flour  doesn   t it .    oh  no      because i knead the dough    .      dragon clapped his hands .     well done  sir .         this place must simply rock on those long winter evenings     said vimes .     and that   s heraldry  is it .  crossword clues and plays on words .         of course there is a great deal more     said the dragon .     these are simple .  we more or less have to make them up .  whereas the escutcheon of an old family  such as the nobbses           nobbs .     said vimes  as the penny dropped .     that   s it .  you said    nobbs    .  before   when you were talking about old families .         ah ha .  what .  oh  indeed .  yes .  oh  yes .  a fine old family .  although now  sadly  in decay .         you don   t mean nobbs as in   corporal nobbs .     said vimes  horror edging his words .   a book thumped open .  in the orange light vimes had a vague upside down glimpse of shields  and a rambling  unpruned family tree .      my word .  would that be a c .  w .  st .  j .  nobbs .         er   yes .  yes .         son of sconner nobbs and a lady referred to here as maisie of elm street .         probably .         grandson of slope nobbs .         that sounds about right .         who was the illegitimate son of edward st .  john de nobbes  earl of ankh  and a  ah ha  a parlormaid of unknown lineage .         good gods .         the earl died without issue  except that which  ah ha  resulted in slope .  we had not been able to trace the scion   hitherto  at any rate .         good gods .         you know the gentleman .      vimes regarded with amazement a serious and positive sentence about corporal nobbs that included the word    gentleman .        er   yes     he said .      is he a man of property .         only other people   s .         well  ah ha  do tell him .  there is no land or money now  of course  but the title is still extant .         sorry   let me make sure i understand this .  corporal nobbs   my corporal nobbs   is the earl of ankh .         he would have to satisfy us as to proof of his lineage but  yes  it would appear so .      vimes stared into the gloom .  thus far in his life  corporal nobbs would have been unlikely to satisfy the examiners as to his species .      good gods .     vimes said yet again .     and i suppose he gets a coat of arms .         a particularly fine one .         oh .      vimes hadn   t even wanted a coat of arms .  an hour ago he   d have cheerfully avoided this appointment as he had done so many times before .  but        nobby .     he said .     good gods .         well  well .  this has been a very happy meeting     said dragon .     i do so like to keep the records up to date .  ah ha .  incidentally  how is young captain carrot getting along .  i   m told his young lady is a werewolf .  ah ha .         really     said vimes .      ah ha .     in the dark  dragon made a movement that might have been a conspiratorial tap on the side of the nose .     we know these things .         captain carrot is doing well     said vimes  as icily as he could manage .     captain carrot always does well .      he slammed the door when he went out .  the candle flames wavered .       constable angua walked out of an alleyway  doing up her belt .      that went very well  i thought     said carrot     and will go some way to earning us the respect of the community .         pff .  that man   s sleeve .  i doubt if he even knows the meaning of the word    laundry        said angua  wiping her mouth .   automatically  they fell into step   the energy saving policeman   s walk  where the pendulum weight of the leg is used to propel the walker along with the minimum of effort .  walking was important  vimes had always said  and because vimes had said it carrot believed it .  walking and talking .  walk far enough and talk to enough people and sooner or later you had an answer .   the respect of the community  thought angua .  that was a carrot phrase .  well  in fact it was a vimes phrase  although sir samuel usually spat after he said it .  but carrot believed it .  it was carrot who   d suggested to the patrician that hardened criminals should be given the chance to    serve the community    by redecorating the homes of the elderly  lending a new terror to old age and  given ankh morpork   s crime rate  leading to at least one old lady having her front room wallpapered so many times in six months that now she could only get into it sideways .       i   ve found something very interesting that you will be very interested to see     said carrot  after a while .      that   s interesting     said angua .      but i   m not going to tell you what it is because i want it to be a surprise     said carrot .      oh .  good .      angua walked in thought for a while and then said     i wonder if it will be as surprising as the collection of rock samples you showed me last week .         that was good  wasn   t it .     said carrot enthusiastically .     i   ve been along that street dozens of times and never suspected there was a mineral museum there .  all those silicates .         amazing .  you   d imagine people would be flocking to it  wouldn   t you .         yes  i can   t think why they don   t .      angua reminded herself that carrot appeared to have in his soul not even a trace element of irony .  she told herself that it wasn   t his fault he   d been brought up by dwarfs in some mine  and really did think that bits of rock were interesting .  the week before they   d visited an iron foundry .  that had been interesting  too .   and yet   and yet   you couldn   t help liking carrot .  even people he was arresting liked carrot .  even old ladies living in a permanent smell of fresh paint liked carrot .  she liked carrot .  a lot .  which was going to make leaving him all the harder .   she was a werewolf .  that   s all there was to it .  you either spent your time trying to make sure people didn   t find out or you let them find out and spent your time watching them keep their distance and whisper behind your back  although of course you   d have to turn round to watch that .   carrot didn   t mind .  but he minded that other people minded .  he minded that even quite friendly colleagues tended to carry a bit of silver somewhere on their person .  she could see it upsetting him .  she could see the tensions building up  and he didn   t know how to deal with them .   it was just as her father had said .  get involved with humans other than at mealtimes and you might as well jump down a silver mine .      apparently there   s going to be a huge firework display after the celebrations next year     said carrot .     i like fireworks .         it beats me why ankh morpork wants to celebrate the fact it had a civil war three hundred years ago     said angua  coming back to the here and now .      why not .  we won     said carrot .      yes  but you lost  too .         always look on the positive side  that   s what i say .  ah  here we are .      angua looked up at the sign .  she   d learned to read dwarf runes now .         dwarf bread museum        she said .     gosh .  i can   t wait .      carrot nodded happily and pushed open the door .  there was a smell of ancient crusts .      coo ee  mr .  hopkinson .     he called .  there was no reply .     he does go out sometimes     he said .      probably when the excitement gets too much for him     said angua .     hopkinson .  that   s not a dwarf name  is it .         oh  he   s a human     said carrot  stepping inside .     but an amazing authority .  bread   s his life .  he wrote the definitive work on offensive baking .  well   since he   s not here i   ll just take two tickets and leave tuppence on the desk .      it didn   t look as though mr .  hopkinson got many visitors .  there was dust on the floor  and dust on the display cases  and a lot of dust on the exhibits .  most of them were the classic cowpat like shape  an echo of their taste  but there were also buns  close combat crumpets  deadly throwing toast and a huge dusty array of other shapes devised by a race that went in for food fighting in a big and above all terminal way .      what are we looking for .     angua said .  she sniffed .  there was a nastily familiar tang in the air .      it   s   are you ready for this .    the battle bread of b   hrian bloodaxe .     said carrot  rummaging in a desk by the entrance .      a loaf of bread .  you brought me here to see a loaf of bread .      she sniffed again .  yes .  blood .  fresh blood .      that   s right     said carrot .     it   s only going to be here a couple of weeks on loan .  it   s the actual bread he personally wielded at the battle of koom valley  killing fifty seven trolls although      and here carrot   s tone changed down from enthusiasm to civic respectability      that was a long time ago and we shouldn   t let ancient history blind us to the realities of a multi ethnic society in the century of the fruitbat .      there was a creak of a door .   then     this battle bread     said angua  indistinctly .     black  isn   t it .  quite a lot bigger than normal bread .         yes  that   s right     said carrot .      and mr .  hopkinson   a short man .  little white pointy beard .         that   s him .         and his head all smashed in .         what .         i think you   d better come and look     said angua  backing away .       dragon king of arms sat alone among his candles .   so that was commander sir samuel vimes  he mused .  stupid man .  clearly can   t see beyond the chip on his shoulder .  and people like that rise to high office these days .  still  such people have their uses  which presumably is why vetinari has elevated him .  stupid men are often capable of things the clever would not dare to contemplate     he sighed  and pulled another tome towards him .  it was not much bigger than many others which lined his study  a fact which might have surprised anyone who knew its contents .   he was rather proud of it .  it was quite an unusual piece of work  but he had been surprised   or would have been surprised  had dragon been really surprised at anything at all for the last hundred years or so   at how easy some of it had been .  he didn   t even need to read it now .  he knew it by heart .  the family trees were properly planted  the words were down there on the page  and all he had to do was sing along .   the first page was headed     the descent of king carrot i  by the grace of the gods king of ankh morpork .     a long and complex family tree occupied the next dozen pages until it reached  married       the words there were merely pencilled in .      delphine angua von uberwald     said dragon aloud .     father   and  ah ha  sire   baron guye von uberwald  also known as silvertail  mother  mme .  serafine soxe bloonberg  also known as yellowfang  of genua        it had been quite an achievement  that part .  he had expected his agents to have had some difficulty with the more lupine areas of angua   s ancestry  but it turned out that mountain wolves took quite a lot of interest in that sort of thing as well .  angua   s ancestors had definitely been among the leaders of the pack .   dragon king of arms grinned .  as far as he was concerned  species was a secondary consideration .  what really mattered in an individual was a good pedigree .   ah  well .  that was the future as it might have been .   he pushed the book aside .  one of the advantages of a life much longer than average was that you saw how fragile the future was .  men said things like    peace in our time    or    an empire that will last a thousand years     and less than half a lifetime later no one even remembered who they were  let alone what they had said or where the mob had buried their ashes .  what changed history were smaller things .  often a few strokes of the pen would do the trick .   he pulled another tome towards him .  the frontispiece bore the words .     the descent of king       now  what would the man call himself .  that at least was not calculable .  oh  well     dragon picked up his pencil and wrote     nobbs .      he smiled in the candlelit room .   people kept on talking about the true king of ankh morpork  but history taught a cruel lesson .  it said   often in words of blood   that the true king was the one who got crowned .       books filled this room  too .  that was the first impression   one of dank  oppressive bookishness .   the late father tubelcek was sprawled across a drift of fallen books .  he was certainly dead .  no one could have bled that much and still been alive .  or survived for long with a head like a deflated football .  someone must have hit him with a lump hammer .      this old lady came running out screaming     said constable visit  saluting .     so i went in and it was just like this  sir .         just like this  constable visit .         yes  sir .  and the name   s visit the infidel with explanatory pamphlets  sir .         who was the old lady .         she says she   s mrs .  kanacki  sir .  she says she always brings him his meals .  she says she does for him .         does for him .         you know  sir .  cleaning and sweeping .      there was  indeed  a tray on the floor  along with a broken bowl and some spilled porridge .  the lady who did for the old man had been shocked to find that someone else had done for him first .      did she touch him .     he said .      she says not  sir .      which meant the old priest had somehow achieved the neatest death vimes had ever seen .  his hands were crossed on his chest .  his eyes had been closed .   and something had been put in his mouth .  it looked like a rolled up piece of paper .  it gave the corpse a disconcertingly jaunty look  as though he   d decided to have a last cigarette after dying .   vimes gingerly picked out the little scroll and unrolled it .  it was covered with meticulously written but unfamiliar symbols .  what made them particularly noteworthy was the fact that their author had apparently made use of the only liquid lying around in huge quantities .      yuk     said vimes .     written in blood .  does this mean anything to anyone .         yes  sir .      vimes rolled his eyes .     yes  constable visit .         visit the infidel with explanatory pamphlets  sir     said constable visit  looking hurt .         the infidel with explanatory pamphlets      i was just about to say it  constable     said vimes .     well .         it   s an ancient klatchian script     said constable visit .     one of the desert tribes called the cenotines  sir .  they had a sophisticated but fundamentally flawed           yes  yes  yes     said vimes  who could recognize the verbal foot getting ready to stick itself in the aural door .     but do you know what it means .         i could find out  sir .         good .         incidentally  were you able by any chance to find time to have a look at those leaflets i gave you the other day  sir .         been very busy .     said vimes automatically .      not to worry  sir     said visit  and smiled the wan smile of those doing good against great odds .     when you   ve got a moment will be fine .      the old books that had been knocked from the shelves had spilled their pages everywhere .  there were splashes of blood on many of them .      some of these look religious     vimes said .     you might find something .     he turned .     detritus  have a look round  will you .      detritus paused in the act of laboriously drawing a chalk outline around the body .     yessir .  what for  sir .         anything you find .         right  sir .      with a grunt  vimes hunkered down and prodded at a gray smear on the floor .     dirt     he said .      you get dat on floors  sir     said detritus  helpfully .      except this is off white .  we   re on black loam     said vimes .      ah     said sergeant detritus .     a clue .         could be just dirt  of course .      there was something else .  someone had made an attempt to tidy up the books .  they   d stacked several dozen of them in one neat towering pile  one book wide  largest books on the bottom  all the edges squared up with geometrical precision .      now that i don   t understand     said vimes .     there   s a fight .  the old man is viciously attacked .  then someone   maybe it was him  dying  maybe it was the murderer   writes something down using the poor man   s own blood .  and rolls it up neatly and pops it into his mouth like a sweetie .  then he does die and someone shuts his eyes and makes him tidy and piles these books up neatly and   does what .  walks out into the seething hurly burly that is ankh morpork .      sergeant detritus   s honest brow furrowed with the effort of thought .     could be a   could be dere   s a footprint outside der window     he said .     dat   s always a clue wort    lookin    for .      vimes sighed .  detritus  despite a room temperature iq  made a good copper and a damn good sergeant .  he had that special type of stupidity that was hard to fool .  but the only thing more difficult than getting him to grasp an idea was getting him to let go of it .       detritus     he said  as kindly as possible     there   s a thirty foot drop into the river outside the window .  there won   t be       he paused .  this was the river ankh  after all .     any footprints   d be bound to have oozed back by now     he corrected himself .     almost certainly .      he looked outside  though  just in case .  the river gurgled and sucked below him .  there were no footprints  even on its famously crusted surface .  but there was another smear of dirt on the windowsill .   vimes scratched some up  and sniffed at it .      looks like some more white clay     he said .   he couldn   t think of any white clay around the city .  once you got outside the walls it was thick black loam all the way to the ramtops .  a man walking across it would be two inches taller by the time he got to the other side of a field .      white clay     he said .     where the hell is white clay country round here .         it a mystery     said detritus .   vimes grinned mirthlessly .  it was a mystery .  and he didn   t like mysteries .  mysteries had a way of getting bigger if you didn   t solve them quickly .  mysteries pupped .   mere murders happened all the time .  and usually even detritus could solve them .  when a distraught woman was standing over a fallen husband holding a right angled poker and crying    he never should   ve said that about our neville .     there was only a limited amount you could do to spin out the case beyond the next coffee break .  and when various men or parts thereof were hanging from or nailed to various fixtures in the mended drum on a saturday night  and the other clientele were all looking innocent  you didn   t need even a detritic intelligence to work out what had been happening .   he looked down at the late father tubelcek .  it was amazing he   d bled so much  with his pipe cleaner arms and toast rack chest .  he certainly wouldn   t have been able to put up much of a fight .   vimes leaned down and gently raised one of the corpse   s eyelids .  a milky blue eye with a black center looked back at him from wherever the old priest was now .   a religious old man who lived in a couple of little poky rooms and obviously didn   t go out much  from the smell .  what kind of threat could he    .   constable visit poked his head around the door .     there   s a dwarf down here with no eyebrows and a frizzled beard says you told him to come  sir     he said .     and some citizens say father tubelcek is their priest and they want to bury him decently .         ah  that   ll be littlebottom .  send him up .     said vimes  straightening .     tell the others they   ll have to wait .      littlebottom climbed the stairs  took in the scene  and managed to reach the window in time to be sick .      better now .     said vimes eventually .      er   yes .  i hope so .         i   ll leave you to it  then .         er   what exactly did you want me to do .     said littlebottom  but vimes was already half way down the stairs .       angua growled .  it was the signal to carrot that he could open his eyes again .   women  as colon had remarked to carrot once when he thought the lad needed advice  could be funny about little things .  maybe they didn   t like to be seen without their make up on  or insisted on buying smaller suitcases than men even though they always took more clothes .  in angua   s case she didn   t like to be seen en route from human to werewolf shape  or vice versa .  it was just something she had a thing about  she said .  carrot could see her in either shape but not in the various ones she occupied on the way through  in case he never wanted to see her again .   through werewolf eyes the world was different .   for one thing  it was in black and white .  at least  that small part of it which as a human she   d thought of as    vision    was monochrome   but who cared that vision had to take a back seat when smell drove instead  laughing and sticking its arm out of the window and making rude gestures at all the other senses .  afterward  she always remembered the odors as colors and sounds .  blood was rich brown and deep brass  stale bread was a surprisingly tinkly bright blue  and every human being was a four dimensional kaleidoscopic symphony .  for nasal vision meant seeing through time as well as space  man could stand still for a minute and  an hour later  there he   d still be  to the nose  his odors barely faded .   she prowled the aisles of the dwarf bread museum  muzzle to the ground .  then she went out into the alley for a while and tried there too .   after five minutes she padded back to carrot and gave him the signal again .   when he re opened his eyes she was pulling her shirt on over her head .  that was one thing where humans had the edge .  you couldn   t beat a pair of hands .      i thought you   d be down the street and following someone     he said .      follow who .     said angua .      pardon .         i can smell him  and you  and the bread  and that   s it .         nothing else .         dirt .  dust .  the usual stuff .  oh  there are some old traces  days old .  i know you were in here last week  for example .  there are lots of smells .  grease  meat  pine resin for some reason  old food   but i   ll swear no living thing   s been in here in the last day or so but him and us .         but you told me everyone leaves a trail .         they do .      carrot looked down at the late curator .  however you phrased it  however broadly you applied your definitions  he definitely couldn   t have committed suicide .  not with a loaf of bread .      vampires .     said carrot .     they can fly        angua sighed .     carrot  i could tell if a vampire had been in here in the last month .         there   s almost half a dollar in pennies in the drawer     said carrot .     anyway  a thief would be here for the battle bread  wouldn   t they .  it is a very valuable cultural artifact .         has the poor man got any relatives .     said angua .      he   s got an elderly sister  i believe .  i come in once a month just to have a chat .  he lets me handle the exhibits  you know .         that must be fun     said angua  before she could stop herself .      it   s very   satisfying  yes     said carrot solemnly .     it reminds me of home .      angua sighed and stepped into the room behind the little museum .  it was like the back rooms of museums everywhere  full of junk and things there is no room for on the shelves and also items of doubtful provenance  such as coins dated       bc .     there were some benches with shards of dwarf bread on them  a tidy tool rack with various sizes of kneading hammer  and papers all over the place .  against one wall  and occupying a large part of the room  was an oven .      he researches old recipes     said carrot  who seemed to feel he had to promote the old man   s expertise even in death .   angua opened the oven door .  warmth spilled out into the room .     hell of a bake oven     she said .     what   re these things .         ah   see he   s been making drop scones     said carrot .     quite deadly at short range .      she shut the door .     let   s get back to the yard and they can send someone out to        angua stopped .   these were always the dangerous moments  just after a shape change this close to full moon .  it wasn   t so bad when she was a wolf .  she was still as intelligent  or at least she felt as intelligent  although life was a lot simpler and so she was probably just extremely intelligent for a wolf .  it was when she became a human again that things were difficult .  for a few minutes  until the morphic field fully reasserted itself  all her senses were still keen  smells were still incredibly strong  and her ears could hear sounds way outside the stunted human range .  and she could think more about the things she experienced .  a wolf could sniff a lamp post and know that old bonzo had been past yesterday  and was feeling a bit under the weather  and was still being fed tripe by his owner  but a human mind could actually think about the whys and where fores .      there is something else     she said  and breathed in gently .     faint .  not a living thing .  but   can   t you smell it .  something like dirt  but not quite .  it   s kind of   yellow orange           um       said carrot  tactfully .     some of us don   t have your nose .         i   ve smelled it before  somewhere in this town .  can   t remember where   it   s strong .  stronger than the other smells .  it   s a muddy smell .         hah  well  on these streets           no  it   s not   exactly mud .  sharper .  more treble .         you know  sometimes i envy you .  it must be nice to be a wolf .  just for a while .         it has its drawbacks .     like fleas  she thought  as they locked up the museum .  and the food .  and the constant nagging feeling that you should be wearing three bras at once .   she kept telling herself she had it under control and she did  in a way .  she prowled the city on moonlit nights and  ok  there was the occasional chicken  but she always remembered where she   d been and went round next day to shove some money under the door .   it was hard to be a vegetarian who had to pick bits of meat out of her teeth in the morning .  she was definitely on top of it  though .   definitely  she reassured herself .   it was angua   s mind that prowled the night  not a werewolf mind .  she was almost entirely sure of that .  a werewolf wouldn   t stop at chickens  not by a long way .   she shuddered .   who was she kidding .  it was easy to be a vegetarian by day  it was preventing yourself becoming a humanitarian at night that took the real effort .       the first clocks were striking eleven as vimes   s sedan chair wobbled to a halt outside the patrician   s palace .  commander vimes   s legs were beginning to give out  but he ran up five flights of stairs as fast as possible and collapsed on a chair in the waiting salon .   minutes went past .   you didn   t knock on the patrician   s door .  he summoned you in the certain knowledge that you would be there .   vimes sat back  enjoying a moment   s peace .   something inside his coat went     bing bing bingley bing .      he sighed  pulled out a leather bound package about the size of a small book  and opened it .   a friendly yet slightly worried face peered up at him from its cage .      yes .     said vimes .         a . m .  appointment with the patrician .         yes .  well it   s five past now .         er .  so you   ve had it  have you .     said the imp .      no .         shall i go on remembering it or what .         no .  anyway  you didn   t remind me about the college of arms at ten .      the imp looked panic stricken .      that   s tuesday  isn   t it .  could   ve sworn it was tuesday .         it was an hour ago .         oh .     the imp was downcast .     er .  all right .  sorry .  um .  hey  i could tell you what time it is in klatch  if you like .  or genua .  or hunghung .  any of those places .  you name it .         i don   t need to know the time in klatch .         you might     said the imp desperately .     think how people will be impressed if  during a dull moment of the conversation  you could say    incidentally  in klatch it   s an hour ago .     or bes pelargic .  or ephebe .  ask me .  go on .  i don   t mind .  any of those places .      vimes sighed inwardly .  he had a notebook .  he took notes in it .  it was always useful .  and then sybil  gods bless her  had brought him this fifteen function imp which did so many other things  although as far as he could see at least ten of its functions consisted of apologizing for its inefficiency in the other five .      you could take a memo     he said .      wow .  really .  gosh .  ok .  right .  no problem .      vimes cleared his throat .     see corporal nobbs re  time keeping  also re  earldom .         er   sorry  is this the memo .         yes .         sorry  you should have said    memo    first .  i   m pretty certain it   s in the manual .         all right  it was a memo .         sorry  you have to say it again .         memo  see corporal nobbs re  time keeping  also re  earldom .         got it     said the imp .     would you like to be reminded of this at any particular time .         the time here .     said vimes  nastily .     or the time in  say  klatch .         as a matter of fact  i can tell you what time it           i think i   ll write it in my notebook  if you don   t mind     said vimes .      oh  well  if you prefer  i can recognize handwriting     said the imp proudly .     i   m quite advanced .      vimes pulled out his notebook and held it up .     like this .     he said .   the imp squinted for a moment .     yep     it said .     that   s handwriting  sure enough .  curly bits  spiky bits  all joined together .  yep .  handwriting .  i   d recognize it anywhere .         aren   t you supposed to tell me what it say .      the demon looked wary .     says .     it said .     it   s supposed to make noises .      vimes put the battered book away and shut the lid of the organizer .  then he sat back and carried on waiting .   someone very clever   certainly someone much cleverer than whoever had trained that imp   must have made the clock for the partrician   s waiting room .  it went tick tock like any other clock .  but somehow  and against all usual horological practice  the tick and the tock were irregular .  tick tock tick   and then the merest fraction of a second longer before   tock tick tock   and then a tick a fraction of a second earlier than the mind   s ear was now prepared for .  the effect was enough  after ten minutes  to reduce the thinking processes of even the best prepared to a sort of porridge .  the patrician must have paid the clockmaker quite highly .   the clock said quarter past eleven .   vimes walked over to the door and  despite precedent  knocked gently .   there was no sound from within  no murmur of distant voices .   he tried the handle .  the door was unlocked .   lord vetinari had always said that punctuality was the politeness of princes .   vimes went in .       cheery dutifully scraped up the crumbly white dirt and then examined the corpse of the late father tubelcek .   anatomy was an important study at the alchemists    guild  owing to the ancient theory that the human body represented a microcosm of the universe  although when you saw one opened up it was hard to imagine which part of the universe was small and purple and went blomp blomp when you prodded it .  but in any case you tended to pick up practical anatomy as you went along  and sometimes scraped it off the wall as well .  when new students tried an experiment that was particularly successful in terms of explosive force  the result was often a cross between a major laboratory refit and a game of hunt the other kidney .   the man had been killed by being repeatedly hit around the head .  that was about all you could say .  some kind of very heavy blunt instrument .    what else did vimes expect cheery to do .   he looked carefully at the rest of the body .  there were no other obvious signs of violence  although   there were a few specks of blood on the man   s fingers .  but  then  there was blood everywhere .   a couple of fingernails were torn .  tubelcek had put up a fight  or at least had tried to shield himself with his hands .   cheery looked more closely at the fingers .  there was something piled under the nails .  it had a waxy sheen  like thick grease .  he couldn   t imagine why it should be there  but maybe his job was to find out .  he conscientiously took an envelope out of his pocket and scraped the stuff into it  sealed it up and numbered it .   then he took his iconograph out of its box and prepared to take a picture of the corpse .   as he did so  something caught his eye .   father tubelcek lay there  one eye still open as vimes had left it  winking at eternity .   cheery looked closer .  he   d thought he   d imagined it .  but     even now he wasn   t sure .  the mind could play tricks .   he opened the little door of the iconograph and spoke to the imp inside .      can you paint a picture of his eye  sydney .     he said .   the imp squinted out through the lens .     just the eye .     it squeaked .      yes .  as big as you can .         you   re sick  mister .         and shut up     said cheery .   he propped the box on the table and sat back .  from inside the box there came the swish swish of brush strokes .  at last there was the sound of a handle being turned  and a slightly damp picture rustled out of a slot .   cheery peered at it .  then he knocked on the box .  the hatch opened .      yes .         bigger .  so big it fills the whole paper .  in fact      cheery squinted at the picture in his hands      just paint the pupil .  the bit in the middle .         so it fills the whole paper .  you   re weird .      cheery propped the box nearer .  there was a clicking of gears as the imp wound the lenses out  and then a few more seconds of busy brush work .   another damp picture unwound .  it showed a big black disc .   well   mainly black .   cheery looked closer .  there was a hint  just a hint     he rapped on the box again .      yes  mr .  dwarf weird person .     said the imp .      the bit in the middle .  big as you can  thank you .      the lenses wound out yet further .   cheery waited anxiously .  in the next room  he could hear detritus patiently moving around .   the paper wound out for the third time  and the hatch opened .     that   s it     said the imp .     i   ve run out of black .      and the paper was black   except for the tiny little area that wasn   t .   the door to the stairs burst open and constable visit came in  borne along by the pressure of a small crowd .  cheery guiltily thrust the paper into his pocket .      this is intolerable .     said a small man with a long black beard .     we demand you let us in .  who   re you  young man .         i   m ch   i   m corporal littlebottom     said cheery .     look  i   ve got a badge           well  corporal     said the man     i am wengel raddley and i am a man of some standing in this community and i demand that you let us have poor father tubelcek this minute .         we   re  er  we   re trying to find out who killed him     cheery began .   there was a movement behind cheery  and the faces in front of him suddenly looked very worried indeed .  he turned to see detritus in the doorway to the next room .      everyt   ing ok .     said the troll .   the changed fortunes of the watch had allowed detritus to have a proper breastplate rather than a piece of elephant battle armor .  as was normal practice for the uniform of a sergeant  the armorer had attempted to do a stylized representation of muscles on it .  as far as detritus was concerned  he hadn   t been able to get them all in .      is dere any trouble .     he said .   the crowd backed away .      none at all  officer     said mr .  raddley .     you  er  just loomed suddenly  that   s all           dis is correct     said detritus .     i am a loomer .  it often happen suddenly .  so dere   s no trouble  den .         no trouble whatsoever  officer .         amazing t   ing  trouble     rumbled detritus thoughtfully .     always i go lookin    for trouble  an    when i find it people said it ain   t dere .      mr .  raddley drew himself up .      but we want to take father tubelcek away to bury him     he said .   detritus turned to cheery littlebottom .     you done every   ting you need .         i suppose so           he dead .         oh  yes .         he gonna get any better .         better than dead .  i doubt it .         okay  den you people can take him away .      the two watchmen stood aside as the body was carried down the stairs .      why you takin    pictures of the dead man .     said detritus .      well  er  it might be helpful to see how he was lying .      detritus nodded sagely .     ah  he was lyin     was he .  an    him a holy man  too .      littlebottom pulled out the picture and looked at it again .  it was almost black .  but     a constable arrived at the bottom of the stairs .     is there someone up there called      there was a muffled snigger      cheery littlebottom .         yes     said littlebottom gloomily .      well  commander vimes says you   ve to come to the patrician   s palace right now  all right .         dat   s corporal littlebottom you   re talkin    to     said detritus .      it   s all right     said littlebottom .     nothing could make it any worse .          rumor is information distilled so finely that it can filter through anything .  it does not need doors and windows   sometimes it doesn   t even need people .  it can exist free and wild  running from ear to ear without ever touching lips .   it had escaped already .  from the high window of the patrician   s bedroom  sam vimes could see people drifting towards the palace .  there wasn   t a mob   there wasn   t even what you might call a crowd   but the brownian motion of the streets was bouncing more and more people in his direction .   he relaxed slightly when he saw one or two guards come through the gates .   on the bed  lord vetinari opened his eyes .      ah   commander vimes     he murmured .      what   s been happening  sir .     said vimes .      i appear to be lying down  vimes .         you were in your office  sir .  unconscious .         dear me .  i must have been   overdoing it .  well  thank you .  if you would be kind enough to   help me up        lord vetinari tried to pull himself upright  swayed  and fell back again .  his face was pale .  sweat beaded his forehead .   there was a knock at the door .  vimes opened it a fraction .      it   s me  sir .  fred colon .  i got a message .  what   s up .         ah  fred .  who   ve you got down there so far .         there   s me and constable flint and constable slapper  sir .         right .  someone   s to go up to my place and get willikins to bring me my street uniform .  and my sword and crossbow .  and an overnight bag .  and some cigars .  and tell lady sybil   tell lady sybil   well  they   ll just have to tell lady sybil i   ve got to deal with things down here  that   s all .         what   s happening  sir .  someone downstairs said lord vetinari   s dead .         dead .     murmured the patrician from his bed .     nonsense .     he jerked himself upright  swung his legs off the bed  and folded up .  it was a slow  terrible collapse .  lord vetinari was a tall man  so there was a long way to fall .  and he did it by folding up a joint at a time .  his ankles gave way and he fell on his knees .  his knees hit the ground with a bang and he bent at the waist .  finally his forehead bounced on the carpet .      oh     he said .      his lordship   s just a bit       vimes began   then he grabbed colon and dragged him out of the room .     i reckon he   s been poisoned  fred  and that   s the truth of it .      colon looked horrified .     ye gods .  do you want me to get a doctor .         are you mad .  we want him to live .      vimes bit his lip .  he   d said the words that were on his mind and now  without a doubt  the faint smoke of rumor would drift out across the city .     but someone ought to look at him       he said aloud .      damn    right .     said colon .     you want i should get a wizard .         how do we know it wasn   t one of them .         ye gods .      vimes tried to think .  all the doctors in the city were employed by the guilds  and all the guilds hated vetinari  so        when you   ve got enough people to spare a runner  send him up to the stables on kings down to fetch doughnut jimmy     he said .   colon looked even more stricken .     doughnut .  he doesn   t known anything about doctoring .  he dopes racehorses .         just get him  fred .         what if he won   t come .         then say that commander vimes knows why laughing boy didn   t win the quirm     dollars last week  and say that i know chrysoprase the troll lost ten thousand on that race .      colon was impressed .     you   ve got a nasty twist of mind there  sir .         there   s going to be a lot of people turning up pretty soon .  i want a couple of watchmen outside this room   trolls or dwarfs for preference   and no one is to come in without my permission  right .      colon   s face contorted as various emotions fought for space .  finally he managed to say     but   poisoned .  he   s got food tasters and everything .         then maybe it was one of them  fred .         my gods  sir .  you don   t trust anyone  do you .         no  fred .  incidentally  was it you .  just kidding     vimes added quickly as colon   s face threatened to burst into tears .     off you go .  we don   t have much time .      vimes shut the door and leaned on it .  then he turned the key in the lock and moved a chair under the handle .   finally he hauled the patrician off the floor and rolled him on to the bed .  there was a grunt from the man  and his eyelids flickered .   poison  thought vimes .  that   s the worst of all .  it doesn   t make a noise  the poisoner can be miles away  you can   t see it  often you can   t really smell it or taste it  it could be anywhere   and there it is  doing its work     the patrician opened his eyes .      i would like a glass of water     he said .   there was a jug and a glass by the bed .  vimes picked up the jug  and hesitated .     i   ll send someone to get some     he said .   lord vetinari blinked  very slowly .      ah  sir samuel     he said     but whom can you trust .          there was a crowd in the big audience chamber when vimes finally went downstairs .  they were milling about  worried and unsure  and  like important men everywhere  when they were worried and unsure they got angry .   the first to bustle up to vimes was mr .  boggis of the guild of thieves .     what   s going on  vimes .     he demanded .   he met vimes   s stare .     sir samuel  i mean     he said  losing a certain amount of bustle .      i believe lord vetinari has been poisoned     said vimes .   the background muttering stopped .  boggis realized that  since he had been the one to ask the question  he was now the man on the spot .     er   fatally .     he said .   in the silence  a pin would have clanged .      not yet     said vimes .   around the hall there was a turning of heads .  the focus of the universal attention was lord downey  head of the guild of assassins .   downey nodded .     i   m not aware of any arrangement with regard to lord vetinari     he said .     besides  as i am sure is common knowledge  we have set the price for the patrician at one million dollars .         and who has that sort of money  indeed .     said vimes .      well   you for one  sir samuel     said downey .  there was some nervous laughter .      we wish to see lord vetinari  in any case     said boggis .      no .         no .  and why not  pray .         doctor   s orders .         really .  which doctor .      behind vimes  sergeant colon shut his eyes .      dr .  james folsom     said vimes .   it took a few seconds before someone worked this out .     what .  you can   t mean   doughnut jimmy .  he   s a horse doctor .         so i understand     said vimes .      but why .         because many of his patients survive     said vimes .  he raised his hands as the protests grew .     and now  gentlemen  i must leave you .  somewhere there   s a poisoner .  i   d like to find him before he becomes a murderer .      he went back up the stairs  trying to ignore the shouts behind him .      you sure about old doughnut  sir .     said colon  catching him up .      well  do you trust him .     said vimes .      doughnut .  of course not .         right .  he   s untrustworthy  and so we don   t trust him .  so that   s all right .  but i   ve seen him revive a horse when everyone else said it was fit only for the knackers .  horse doctors have to get results  fred .      and that was true enough  when a human doctor  after much bleeding and cupping  finds that a patient has died out of sheer desperation  he can always say     dear me  will of the gods  that will be thirty dollars please     and walk away a free man .  this is because human beings are not  technically  worth anything .  a good racehorse  on the other hand  may be worth twenty thousand dollars .  a doctor who lets one hurry off too soon to that great big paddock in the sky may well expect to hear  out of some dark alley  a voice saying something on the lines of    mr .  chrysoprase is very upset     and find the brief remainder of his life full of incident .      no one seems to know where captain carrot and angua are     said colon .     it   s their day off .  and nobby   s nowhere to be found .         well  that   s something to be thankful for           bingeley bingeley bong beep     said a voice from vimes   s pocket .   he lifted out the little organizer and raised the flap .      yes .         ey   twelve noon     said the imp .     lunch with lady sybil .      it stared at their faces .      er   that   s all right  isn   t it .     it said .       cheery littlebottom wiped his brow .      commander vimes is right .  it could be arsenic     he said .     it looks like arsenic poisoning to me .  look at his color .         nasty stuff     said doughnut jimmy .     has he been eating his bedding .         all the sheets seem to be here  so i suppose the answer is no .         how   s he pissing .         er .  the usual way  i assume .      doughnut sucked at his teeth .  he had amazing teeth .  it was the second thing everyone noticed about him .  they were the color of the inside of an unwashed teapot .      walk him round a bit on the loose rein     he said .   the patrician opened his eyes .     you are a doctor  aren   t you .     he said .   doughnut jimmy gave him an uncertain look .  he was not used to patients who could talk .     well  yeah   i have a lot of patients     he said .      indeed .  i have very little     said the patrician .  he tried to lift himself off the bed  and slumped back .      i   ll mix up a draught     said doughnut jimmy  backing away .     you   re to hold his nose and pour it down his throat twice a day  right .  and no oats .      he hurried out  leaving cheery alone with the patrician .   corporal littlebottom looked around the room .  vimes hadn   t given him much instruction .  he   d said     i   m sure it won   t be the food tasters .  for all they know they might be asked to eat the whole plateful .  still  we   ll get detritus to talk to them .  you find out the how  right .  and then leave the who to me .      if you didn   t eat or drink a poison  what else was left .  probably you could put it on a pad and make someone breathe it  or dribble some in their ear while they slept .  or they could touch it .  maybe a small dart   or an insect bite     the patrician stirred  and looked at cheery through watery red eyes .     tell me  young man  are you a policeman .         er   just started  sir .         you appear to be of the dwarf persuasion .      cheery didn   t bother to answer .  there was no use denying it .  somehow  people could tell if you were a dwarf just by looking at you .      arsenic is a very popular poison     said the patrician .     hundreds of uses around the home .  crushed diamonds used to be in vogue for hundreds of years  despite the fact they never worked .  giant spiders  too  for some reason .  mercury is for those with patience  aquafortis for those without .  cantharides has its followers .  much can be done with the secretions of various animals .  the bodily fluids of the caterpillar of the quantum weather butterfly will render a man quite  quite helpless .  but we return to arsenic like an old  old friend .      there was a drowsiness in the patrician   s voice .     is that not so  young vetinari .  yes indeed  sir .  correct .  but where then shall we put it  seeing that all will look for it .  in the last place they will look  sir .  wrong .  foolish .  we put it where no one will look at all        the voice faded to a murmur .   the bed linen  cheery thought .  even clothes .  into the skin  slowly     cheery hammered on the door .  a guard opened it .      get another bed .         what .         another bed .  from anywhere .  and fresh bed linen .      he looked down .  there wasn   t much of a carpet on the floor .  even so  in a bedroom  where people might walk with bare feet        and take away this rug and bring another one .      what else .   detritus came in  nodded at cheery  and looked carefully around the room .  finally he picked up a battered chair .      dis   ll have to do     he said .     if he want  i can break der back off   f it .         what .     said cheery .      ole doughnut said for to get a stool sample     said detritus  going out again .   cheery opened his mouth to stop the troll  and then shrugged .  anyway  the less furniture in here the better     and that seemed about it  short of stripping the wallpaper off the wall .       sam vimes stared out of the window .   vetinari hadn   t bothered much in the way of bodyguards .  he had used   that is  he still did use   food tasters  but that was common enough .  mind you  vetinari had added his own special twist .  the tasters were well paid and treated  and they were all sons of the chief cook .  but his main protection was that he was just that bit more useful alive than dead  from everyone   s point of view .  the big powerful guilds didn   t like him  but they liked him in power a lot more than they liked the idea of someone from a rival guild in the oblong office .  besides  lord vetinari represented stability .  it was a cold and clinical kind of stability  but part of his genius was the discovery that stability was what people wanted more than anything else .   he   d said to vimes once  in this very room  standing at this very window     they think they want good government and justice for all  vimes  yet what is it they really crave  deep in their hearts .  only that things go on as normal and tomorrow is pretty much like today .      now  vimes turned around .     what   s my next move  fred .         dunno  sir .      vimes sat down in the patrician   s chair .     can you remember the last patrician .         old lord snapcase .  and the one before him  lord winder .  oh  yeah .  nasty pieces of work  they were .  at least this one didn   t giggle or wear a dress .      the past tense  thought vimes .  it creeps in already .  not long past  but already very tense .      it   s gone very quiet downstairs  fred     he said .      plotting don   t make a lot of noise  sir  generally .         vetinari   s not dead  fred .         yessir .  but he   s not exactly in charge  is he .      vimes shrugged .     no one   s in charge  i suppose .         could be  sir .  there again  you never know your luck .      colon was standing stiffly to attention  with his eyes firmly fixed on the middle distance and his voice pitched carefully to avoid any hint of emotion in the words .   vimes recognized the stance .  he used it himself  when he had to .     what do you mean  fred .     he said .      not a thing  sir .  figure of speech  sir .      vimes sat back .   this morning  he thought  i knew what the day held .  i was going to see about that damn    coat of arms .  then there was my usual meeting with vetinari .  i was going to read some reports after lunch  maybe go and see how they   re getting on with the new watch house in chittling street  and have an early night .  now fred   s suggesting   what .      listen  fred  if there is to be a new ruler  it won   t be me .         who   ll it be  sir .     colon   s voice still held that slow  deliberate tone .      how should i know .  it could be        the gap opened ahead of him and he could feel his thoughts being sucked into it .     you   re talking about captain carrot  aren   t you  fred .         could be  sir .  i mean none of the guilds   d let some other guild bloke be ruler now  and everyone likes captain carrot  and  well   rumors got about that he   s the hair to the throne  sir .         there   s no proof of that  sergeant .         not for me to say  sir .  dunno about that .  dunno what is proof     said colon  with just a hint of defiance     but he   s got that sword of his  and the birthmark shaped like a crown  and   well  everyone knows he   s king .  it   s his krisma .      charisma  thought vimes .  oh yes .  carrot has charisma .  he makes something happen in people   s heads .  he can talk a charging leopard into giving up and handing over its teeth and doing good work in the community  and that would really upset the old ladies .   vimes distrusted charisma .     no more kings  fred .         right you are  sir .  by the way  nobby   s turned up .         the day gets worse and worse  fred .         you said you   d talk to him about all these funerals  sir           the job goes on  i suppose .  all right  go and tell him to come up here .      vimes was left to himself .   no more kings .  vimes had difficulty in articulating why this should be so  why the concept resonated in his very bones .  after all  a good many of the patricians had been as bad as any king .  but they were   sort of   bad on equal terms .  what set vimes   s teeth on edge was the idea that kings were a different kind of human being .  a higher lifeform .  somehow magical .  but  huh  there was some magic  at that .  ankh morpork still seemed to be littered with royal this and royal that  little old men who got paid a few pence a week to do a few meaningless chores  like the master of the king   s keys or the keeper of the crown jewels  even though there were no keys and certainly no jewels .   royalty was like dandelions .  no matter how many heads you chopped off  the roots were still there underground  waiting to spring up again .   it seemed to be a chronic disease .  it was as if even the most intelligent person had this little blank spot in their heads where someone had written     kings .  what a good idea .     whoever had created humanity had left in a major design flaw .  it was its tendency to bend at the knees .   there was a knock at the door .  it should not be possible for a knock to sound surreptitious  yet this knock achieved it .  it had harmonics .  they told the hindbrain  the person knocking will  if no one eventually answers  open the door anyway and sidle in  whereupon he will certainly nick any smokes that are lying around  read any correspondence that catches his eye  open a few drawers  take a nip out of such bottles of alcohol as are discovered  but stop short of major crime because he is not criminal in the sense of making a moral decision but in the sense that a weasel is evil   it is built into his very shape .  it was a knock with a lot to say for itself .      come in  nobby     said vimes  wearily .   corporal nobbs sidled in .  it was another special trait of his that he could sidle forwards as well as sideways .   he saluted awkwardly .   there was something absolutely changeless about corporal nobbs  vimes told himself .  even fred colon had adapted to the changing nature of the city watch  but nothing altered corporal nobbs in any way .  it wouldn   t matter what you did to him  there was always something fundamentally nobby about corporal nobbs .      nobby           yessir .         er   take a seat  nobby .      corporal nobbs looked suspicious .  this was not how a dressing down was supposed to begin .      er  fred said you wanted to see me  mr .  vimes  on account of timekeeping           did i .  did i .  oh  yes .  nobby  how many grandmothers    funerals have you really been to .         er   three       said nobby  uncomfortably .      three .         it turned out nanny nobbs wasn   t quite dead the first time .         so why have you   ve taken all this time off .         don   t like to say  sir           why not .         you   re gonna go spare  sir .         spare .         you know  sir   throw a wobbler .         i might  nobby .     vimes sighed .     but it   ll be nothing to what   ll get heaved if you don   t tell me           thing is  it   s the tricentre   tricera   this three hundred year celebration thing next year  mr .  vimes           yes .      nobby licked his lips .     i dint like to ask for time off special .  fred said you were a bit sensitive about it all .  but   you know i   m in the peeled nuts  sir        vimes nodded .     those clowns who dress up and pretend to fight old battles with blunt swords     he said .      the ankh morpork historical re creation society  sir     said nobby  a shade reproachfully .      that   s what i said .         well   we   re going to recreate the battle of ankh morpork for the celebrations  see .  that means extra practice .         it all begins to make sense     said vimes  nodding wearily .     you   ve been marching up and down with your tin pike  eh .  in my time .         er   not exactly  mister vimes   er   i   ve been riding up and down on my white horse  to tell the truth           oh .  playing at being a general eh .         er   a bit more   n a general  sir           go on .      nobby   s adam   s apple bobbed nervously .     er   i   m going to be king lorenzo  sir .  er   you know   the last king  the one your   er        the air froze .      you   are going to be       vimes began  unpeeling each word like a sullen grape of wrath .      i said you   d go spare     said nobby .     fred colon said you   d go spare  too .         why are you           we drew lots  sir .         and you lost .      nobby squirmed .     er   not exactly lost  sir .  not precisely lost .  more sort of won  sir .  everyone wanted to play him .  i mean  you get a horse and a good costume and everything  sir .  and he was a king  when all   s said and done  sir .         the man was a vicious monster .         well  it was all a long time ago  sir     said nobby anxiously .   vimes calmed down a little .     and who drew the straw to play stoneface vimes .         er   er           nobby .      nobby hung his head .     no one  sir .  no one wanted to play him  sir .     the little corporal swallowed  and then plunged onwards with the air of a man determined to get it all over with .     so we   re making a man out of straw  sir  so he   ll burn nicely when we throw him on the bonfire in the evening .  there   s going to be fireworks  sir     he added  with dreadful certainty .   vimes   s face shut down .  nobby preferred it when people shouted .  he had been shouted at for most of his life .  he could handle shouting .      no one wanted to be stoneface vimes     vimes said coldly .      on account of him being on the losing side  sir .         losing .  vimes   s ironheads won .  he ruled the city for six months .      nobby squirmed again .     yeah  but   everyone in the society says he didn   t ought to of  sir .  they said it was just a fluke  sir .  after all  he was outnumbered ten to one  and he had warts  sir .  and he was a bit of a bastard  sir  when all   s said and done .  he did chop off a king   s head  sir .  you got to be a bit of a nasty type to do that  sir .  saving your presence  mr .  vimes .      vimes shook his head .  what did it matter  anyway .   but it did matter  somewhere .   it had all been a long time ago .  it didn   t matter what a bunch of deranged romantics thought .  facts were facts .      all right  i understand     he said .     it   s almost funny  really .  because there something else i   ve got to tell you  nobby .         yessir .     said nobby  looking relieved .      do you remember your father .      nobby looked about to panic again .     what kind of question is that to suddenly ask anybody  sir .         purely a social inquiry .         old sconner  sir .  not much  sir .  never used to see him much except when the milit   ry police used to come for to drag him outa the attic .         do you know much about your  er  antecedents .         that is a lie  sir .  i haven   t got no antecedents  sir  no matter what you might have been tole .         oh .  good .  er   you don   t actually know what    antecedents    means  do you  nobby .      nobby shifted uneasily .  he didn   t like being questioned by policemen  especially since he was one .     not in so many words  sir .         you never got told anything about your forebears .     another worried expression crossed nobby   s face  so vimes quickly added     your ancestors .         only old sconner  sir .  sir   if all this is working up to asking about them sacks of vegetables which went missing from the shop in treacle mine road  i was not anywhere near the        vimes waved a hand vaguely .     he didn   t   leave you anything .  or anything .         coupla scars  sir .  and this trick elbow of mine .  it aches sometimes  when the weather changes .  i always remembers ole sconner when the wind blows from the hub .         ah  right           and this  o    course       nobby fished around behind his rusting breastplate .  and that was a marvel  too .  even sergeant colon   s armor could shine  if not actually gleam .  but any metal anywhere near nobby   s skin corroded very quickly .  the corporal pulled out a leather thong that hung around his neck .  there was a gold ring on it .  despite the fact that gold cannot corrode  it had nevertheless developed a patina .      he left it to me when he was on his deathbed     said nobby .     well  when i say    left it              did he say anything .         well  yeah  he did say    give it back  you little bugger .      sir .  see     e    ad it on a string round his neck  sir  just like me .  but it   s not like a proper ring  sir .  i   d have flogged it but it   s all i got to remember him by .  except when the wind blows from the hub .      vimes took the ring and rubbed it with a finger .  it was a seal ring  with a coat of arms on it .  age and wear and the immediate presence of the body of corporal nobbs had made it quite unreadable .      you are armigerous  nobby .      nobby nodded .     but i got a special shampoo for it  sir .      vimes sighed .  he was an honest man .  he   d always felt that was one of the bigger defects in his personality .      when you   ve got a moment  nip along to the college of heralds in mollymog street  will you .  take this ring with you and say i sent you .         er           it   s all right .  nobby     said vimes .     you won   t get into trouble .  not as such .         if you say so  sir .         and you don   t have to bother with the    sir     nobby .         yessir .      when nobby had gone vimes reached behind the desk and picked up a faded copy of twurp   s peerage or  as he personally thought of it  the guide to the criminal classes .  you wouldn   t find slum dwellers in these pages  but you would find their landlords .   and  while it was regarded as pretty good evidence of criminality to be living in a slum  for some reason owning a whole street of them merely got you invited to the very best social occasions .   these days they seemed to be bringing out a new edition every week .  dragon had been right about one thing  at least .  everyone in ankh morpork seemed to be hankering after more arms than they were born with .   he looked up de nobbes .   there even was a damn coat of arms .  one supporter of the shield was a hippo  presumably one of the royal hippos of ankh morpork and therefore the ancestor of roderick and keith .  the other was a bull of some sort  with a very nobby like expression  it was holding a golden ankh which  this being the de nobbes coat of arms  it had probably stolen from somewhere .  the shield was red and green  there was  a white chevron with five apples on it .  quite what they had to do with warfare was unclear .  perhaps they were some kind of jolly visual pun or play on words that had had them slapping their thighs down at the royal college of arms  although probably if dragon slapped his thigh too hard his leg would fall off .   it was easy enough to imagine an enobled nobbs .  because where nobby went wrong was in thinking small .  he sidled into places and pinched things that weren   t worth much .  if only he   d sidled into continents and stolen entire cities  slaughtering many of the inhabitants in the process  he   d have been a pillar of the community .   there was nothing in the book under    vimes .      suffer not injustice vimes wasn   t a pillar of the community .  he killed a king with his own hands .  it needed doing but the community  whatever that was  didn   t always like the people who did what needed to be done or said what had to be said .  he put some other people to death as well  that was true  but the city had been lousy  there   d been a lot of stupid wars .  we were practically part of the klatchian empire .  sometimes you needed a bastard .  history had wanted surgery .  sometimes dr .  chopper is the only surgeon to hand .  there   s something final about an axe .  but kill one wretched king and everyone calls you a regicide .  it wasn   t as if it was a habit or anything     vimes had found old stoneface   s journal in the unseen university library .  the man had been hard no doubt about that .  but they were hard times .  he   d written     in the fyres of struggle let us bake new men  who will notte heed the old lies .     but the old lies had won in the end .   he said to people  you   re free .  and they said hooray  and then he showed them what freedom costs and they called him a tyrant and  as soon as he   d been betrayed  they milled around a bit like barn bred chickens who   ve seen the big world outside for the first time  and then they went back into the warm and shut the door        bing bong bingely beep .      vimes sighed and pulled out his organizer .      yes .         memo  appointment with bootmaker    p . m .      said the imp .      it   s not two o   clock yet and that was tuesday in any case     said vimes .      so i   ll cross it off the list of things to do  then .      vimes put the disorganized organizer back in his pocket and went and looked out of the window again .   who had a motive for poisoning lord vetinari .   no  that wasn   t the way to crack it .  probably  if you went to some outlying area of the city and confined your investigations to little old ladies who didn   t get out much  what with all the wallpaper over the door and everything  you might be able to find someone without a motive .  but the man stayed alive by always arranging matters so that a future without him represented a riskier business than a future with him still upright .   the only people  therefore  who   d risk killing him were madmen   and the gods knew ankh morpork had enough of them   or someone who was absolutely confident that if the city collapsed he   d be standing on top of the pile .   if fred were right   and the sergeant was generally a good indicator of how the man in the street thought because he was the man in the street   then that person was captain carrot .  but carrot was one of the few people in the city who seemed to like vetinari .   of course  there was one other person who stood to gain .   damn  thought vimes .  it   s me  isn   t it    .   there was another knock at the door .  he didn   t recognize this one .   he opened the door cautiously .      it   s me  sir .  littlebottom .         come in  then .     it was nice to know there was at least one person in the world with more problems than him .     how is his lordship .         stable     said littlebottom .      dead is stable     said vimes .      i mean he   s alive  sir  and sitting up reading .  mr .  doughnut made up some sticky stuff that tasted of seaweed  sir  and i mixed up some gloobool   s salts .  sir  you know the old man in the house on the bridge .         what old   oh .  yes .     it seemed a long time ago .     what about him .         well   you asked me to look around and   i took some pictures .  this is one  sir .     he handed vimes a rectangle that was nearly all black .      odd .  where   d you get it .         er   have you ever heard the story about dead men   s eyes  sir .         assume i haven   t had a literary education  littlebottom .         well   they say           who say .         they  sir .  you know  they .         the same people who   re the    everyone    in    everyone knows    .  the people who live in    the community    .         yes  sir .  i suppose so  sir .      vimes waved a hand .     oh  them .  well  go on .         they say that the last thing a dying man sees stays imprinted in his eyes  sir .         oh  that .  that   s just an old story .         yes .  amazing  really .  i mean  if it weren   t true  you   d have thought it wouldn   t have survived  wouldn   t you .  i thought i saw this little red spark  so i got the imp to paint a really big picture before it faded completely .  and  right in the center           couldn   t the imp have made it up .     said vimes  staring at the picture again .      they haven   t got the imagination to lie  sir .  what they see is what you get .         glowing eyes .         two red dots     said littlebottom  conscientiously     which might indeed be a pair of glowing eyes  sir .         good point  littlebottom .     vimes rubbed his chin .     blast .  i just hope it   s not a god of some sort .  that   s all i need at a time like this .  can you make copies so i can send them to all the watch houses .         yes  sir .  the imp   s got a good memory .         hop to it  then .      but before littlebottom could go the door opened again .  vimes looked up .  carrot and angua were there .      carrot .  i thought you were on your day off .         we found a murder  sir .  at the dwarf bread museum .  but when we got back to the watch house they told us lord vetinari   s dead .      did they .  thought vimes .  that   s rumor for you .  if we could modulate it with the truth  how useful it could be        he   s breathing well for a corpse     he said .     i think he   ll be ok .  someone got past his guard  that   s all .  i   ve got a doctor to see him .  don   t worry .      someone got past his guard  he thought .  yes .  and i   m his guard .      i hope the man   s a leader in the field  that   s all i can say     said carrot severely .      he   s even better than that   he   s the doctor to the leaders of the field     said vimes .  i   m his guard and i didn   t see it coming .      it   d be terrible for the city if anything happened to him .     said carrot .   vimes saw nothing but innocent concern behind carrot   s forthright stare .     it would  wouldn   t it .     he said .     anyway  it   s under control .  you said there   s been another murder .         at the dwarf bread museum .  someone killed mr .  hopkinson with his own bread .         made him eat it .         hit him with it  sir     said carrot reproachfully .     battle bread  sir .         is he the old man with the white beard .         yes  sir .  you remember  i introduced you to him when i took you to see the boomerang biscuit exhibition .      angua thought she saw a faint wince of recollection speed guiltily across vimes    face .     who   s going around killing old men .     he said to the world at large .      don   t know  sir .  constable angua went plain clothes      carrot waggled his eyebrows conspiratorially      and couldn   t find a sniff of anyone .  and nothing was taken .  this is what it was done with .      the battle bread was much larger than an ordinary loaf .  vimes turned it over gingerly .     dwarfs throw it like a discus  right .         yes  sir .  at the seven mountains games last year snori shield biter took the tops off a line of six hard boiled eggs at fifty yards  sir .  and that was with just a standard hunting loaf .  but this is  well  it   s a cultural artifact .  we haven   t got the baking technology for bread like this any more .  it   s unique .         valuable .         very  sir .         worth stealing .         you   d never be able to get rid of it .  every honest dwarf would recognize it .         hmm .  did you hear about that priest being murdered on misbegot bridge .      carrot looked shocked .     not old father tubelcek .  really .      vimes stopped himself from asking     you know him  then .     because carrot knew everyone .  if carrot were to be dropped into some dense tropical jungle it   d be    hello  mr .  runs swiftly through the trees .  good morning  mr .  talks to the forest  what a splendid blowpipe .  and what a novel place for a feather .         did he have more than one enemy .     said vimes .      sorry  sir .  why more than one .         i should say the fact that he had one is obvious  wouldn   t you .         he is   he was a nice old chap     said carrot .     hardly stirred out .  spends   spent all his time with his books .  very religious .  i mean  all kinds of religion .  studied them .  bit odd  but no harm in him .  why should anyone want to kill him .  or mr .  hopkinson .  a pair of harmless old men .      vimes handed him the battle bread .     we shall find out .  constable angua  i want you to have a look at this one .  take   yes  take corporal little bottom     he said .     he   s been doing some work on it .  angua   s from uberwald too  littlebottom .  maybe you   ve got friends in common  that sort of thing .      carrot nodded cheerfully .  angua   s expression went wooden .      ah  h   druk g   har dwatch  sh   rt   azs .     said carrot .      h   h angua tconstable   angua g   har  b   hk bargr   a sh   rt   azs kad   k         angua appeared to concentrate .     grr   dukk d   buzh   drak       she managed .   carrot laughed .     you just said    small delightful mining tool of a feminine nature    .      cheery stared at angua  who returned the stare blankly while mumbling     well  dwarfish is difficult if you haven   t eaten gravel all your life        cheery was still staring .     er   thank you     he managed .     er   i   d better go and tidy up .         what about lord vetinari .     said carrot .      i   m putting my best man on that     said vimes .     trustworthy  reliable  knows the ins and outs of this place like the back of his hand .  i   m handling it  in other words .      carrot   s hopeful expression faded to hurt puzzlement .     don   t you want me to .     he said .     i could           no .  indulge an old man .  i want you to go back to the watch house and take care of things .         what things .         everything .  rise to the occasion .  move paper around .  there   s that new shift rota to draw up .  shout at people .  read reports .      carrot saluted .     yes  commander vimes .         good .  off you go  then .      and if anything happens to vetinari  vimes added to himself as the dejected carrot went out  no one will be able to say you were anywhere near him .       the little grille in the gate of the royal college of arms snapped open  to the distant accompaniment of brayings and grunts .     yes .     said a voice     what dost thee want .         i   m corporal nobbs     said nobby .   an eye applied itself to the grille .  it took in the full  dreadful extent of the godly handiwork that was corporal nobbs .      are you the baboon .  we   ve had one on order for           no .  i   ve come about some coat with arms     said nobby .      you .     said the voice .  the owner of the voice made it very clear that he was aware there were degrees of nobility from something above kingship stretching all the way down to commoner  and that as far as corporal nobbs was concerned an entirely new category   commonest  perhaps   would have to be coined .      i   ve been told     said nobby  miserably .     it   s about this ring i got .         go round the back door     said the voice .       cheery was tidying away the makeshift equipment he   d set up in the privy when a sound made him look around .  angua was leaning against the doorway .      what do you want .     he demanded .      nothing .  i just thought i   d say  don   t worry  i won   t tell anyone if you don   t want me to .         i don   t know what you   re talking about .         i think you   re lying .      cheery dropped a test tube  and sagged on to a seat .     how could you tell .     he said .     even other dwarfs can   t tell .  i   ve been so careful .         shall we just say   i have special talents .     said angua .   cheery started to clean a beaker distractedly .      i don   t know why you   re so upset     said angua .     i thought dwarfs hardly recognized the difference between male and female  anyway .  half the dwarfs we bring in here on a no .     are female  i know that  and they   re the ones that are hardest to subdue           what   s a no .     .            running screaming at people while drunk and trying to cut their knees off        said angua .     it   s easier to give them numbers than write it down every time .  look  there   s plenty of women in this town that   d love to do things the dwarf way .  i mean  what   re the choices they   ve got .  barmaid  seamstress or someone   s wife .  while you can do anything the men do           provided we do only what the men do     said cheery .   angua paused .     oh     she said .     i see .  hah .  yes .  i know that tune .         i can   t hold an axe .     said cheery .     i   m scared of fights .  i think songs about gold are stupid .  i hate beer .  i can   t even drink dwarfishly .  when i try to quaff i drown the dwarf behind me .         i can see that could be tricky     said angua .      i saw a girl walk down the street here and some men whistled after her .  and you can wear dresses .  with colors .         oh  dear .     angua tried not to smile .     how long have lady dwarfs felt like this .  i thought they were happy with the way things are           oh  it   s easy to be happy when you don   t know any different     said cheery bitterly .     chainmail trousers are fine if you   ve never heard of lingerry .         li   oh  yes     said angua .     lingerie .  yes .     she tried to feel sympathetic and found that she was  really  but she did have to stop herself from saying that at least you don   t have to find styles that can easily be undone by claws .      i thought i could come here and get a different kind of job     cheery moaned .     i   m good at needlework and i went to see the guild of seamstresses and       she stopped  and blushed behind her beard .      yes     said angua .     lots of people make that mistake .     she stood up straight and brushed herself off .     you   ve impressed commander vimes  anyway .  i think you   ll like it here .  everyone   s got troubles in the watch .  normal people don   t become policemen .  you   ll get on fine .         commander vimes is a bit       cheery began .      he   s ok when he   s in a good mood .  he needs to drink but he doesn   t dare to these days .  you know  one drink is too many  two is not enough   and that makes him edgy .  when he   s in a bad mood he   ll tread on your toes and then shout at you for not standing up straight .         you   re normal     said cheery  shyly .     i like you .      angua patted her on the head .     you say that now     she said     but when you   ve been around here for a while you   ll find out that sometimes i can be a bitch   what   s that .         what .         that   painting .  with the eyes           or two points of red light     said cheery .      oh  yeah .         it   s the last thing father tubelcek saw  i think     said the dwarf .   angua stared at the black rectangle .  she sniffed .     there it is again .      cheery took a step backwards .     what .  what .         where   s that smell coming from .     angua demanded .      not me .      angua grabbed a small dish from the bench and sniffed at it .     this is it .  i smelled this at the museum .  what is it .         it   s just clay .  it was on the floor in the room where the old priest was killed     said cheery .     probably it came off someone   s boot .      angua crumbled some of it between her fingers .      i think it   s just potters    clay     said cheery .     we used to use it at the guild .  for making pots     she added  just in case angua hadn   t grasped things .     you know .  crucibles and things .  this looks like someone tried baking it but didn   t get the heat right .  see how it crumbles .         pottery     said angua .     i know a potter        she glanced down at the dwarf   s iconograph again .   please  no  she thought .  not one of them .       the front gate of the college of arms   both front gates   were swung open .  the two heralds bobbed excitedly around corporal nobbs as he tottered out .      has your lordship got everything he requires .         nfff     said nobby .      if we can be of any help whatsoever           nnnf .         any help at all    .         nnnf .         sorry about your boots  m   lord  but the wyvern   s been ill .  it   ll brush off no trouble when it dries .      nobby tottered off along the lane .      he even walks nobly  wouldn   t you say .         more   nobbly than nobly  i think .         it   s disgusting that he   s a mere corporal  a man of his breeding .          igneous the troll backed away until he was up against his potter   s wheel .      i never done it     he said .      done what .     said angua .   igneous hesitated .   igneous was huge and   well  rocky .  he moved around the streets of ankh morpork like a small iceberg and  like an iceberg  there was more to him that immediately met the eye .  he was known as a supplier of things .  more or less any kind of things .  and he was also a wall  which was the same as a fence only a lot harder and tougher to beat .  igneous never asked unnecessary questions  because he couldn   t think of any .      nuffin     he said  finally .  igneous had always found the general denial was more reliable than the specific refutation .      glad to hear it     said angua .     now   where do you get your clay from .      igneous   s face crinkled as he tried to work out where this line of questioning could possibly go .     i got re seats     he said .     every bit prop   ly paid for .      angua nodded .  it was probably true .  igneous  despite giving the appearance of not being able to count beyond ten without ripping off someone else   s arm  and having an intimate involvement in the city   s complex hierarchy of crime  was known to pay his bills .  if you were going to be successful in the world of crime  you needed a reputation for honesty .      have you seen any like this before .     she said  holding out the sample .      it clay     said igneous  relaxing a little .     i see clay all der time .  it don   t have no serial number .  clay   s clay .  got lumps of it out der back .  you make bricks an pots and stuff outa it .  dere   s loads of potters in dis town and we all got der stuff .  why you wanna know about clay .         can   t you tell where it came from .      igneous took the tiny piece  sniffed it  and rolled it between his fingers .      dis is crank     he said  looking a lot happier now that the conversation was veering away from more personal concerns .     dat   s like   crappy clay  jus    good enough for dem lady potters wi    dangly earrings wot make coffee mugs wot you can   t lift wid both hands .     he rolled it again .     also  it got a lotta grog in it .  dat   s bitsa old pots  all smashed up real small .  makes it stronger .  any potter got loadsa stuff like dis .     he rubbed it again .     dis has been sorta heated up but it ain   t prop   ly baked .         but you can   t say where it came from .         outta der ground is der best i can do  lady     said igneous .  he relaxed a little now it appeared that inquiries were not to do with such matters as a recent batch of hollow statues and subjects of a similar nature .  as sometimes happened in these circumstances  he tried to be helpful .     come an    have a look at dis .      he loped away .  the watchmen followed him through the warehouse  observed by a couple of dozen cautious trolls .  no one liked to see policemen up close  especially if the reason you were working at igneous   s place was that it was nice and quiet and you wanted somewhere to lie low for a few weeks .  besides  while it was true that a lot of people came to ankh morpork because it was a city of opportunity  sometimes it was the opportunity not to be hung  skewered or dismantled for whatever crimes you   d left behind in the mountains .      just don   t look     said angua .      why .     said cheery .      because there   s just us and there   s at least two dozen of them     said angua .     and all our clothes were made for people with full sets of arms and legs .      igneous went through a doorway and out into the yard behind the factory .  pots were stacked high on pallets .  bricks were curing in long rows .  and under a crude roof were several large mounds of clay .      dere     said igneous generously .     clay .         is there a special name for it when it   s piled up like that .     said cheery timorously .  she prodded the stuff .      yeah     said igneous .     dat   s technic   ly wot we calls a heap .      angua shook her head sadly .  so much for clues .  clay was clay .  she   d hoped there were all different sorts  and it turned out to be as common as dirt .   and then igneous helped the police with their enquiries .     d   you mind if youse goes out the back way .     he mumbled .     youse makes the help nervous an    i get pots i can   t sell .      he indicated a pair of wide doors in the rear wall  big enough for a cart to get through .  then he fumbled in his apron and produced a large keyring .   the padlock on the gate was big and shiny and new .      you are afraid of theft .     said angua .      now  lady  dat   s unfair     said igneous .     someone broke der ole lock when dey pinched some stuff tree  four munfs ago .         disgusting  isn   t it .     said angua .     makes you wonder why you pay your taxes  i expect .      in some ways igneous was a lot brighter than  say  mr .  ironcrust .  he ignored the remark .     it was just stuff     he said  ushering them towards the open gate as speedily as he dared .      was it clay they stole .     said cheery .      it don   t cost much but it   s the principle of the t   ing     he said .     it beat me why dey bothered .  it come to somet   ng when half a ton of clay can jus    walk out the door .      angua looked at the lock again .     yes  indeed     she said distantly .   the gate rattled shut behind them .  they were outside  in an alley .      fancy anyone stealing a load of clay     said cheery .     did he tell the watch .         i shouldn   t think so     said angua .     wasps don   t complain too loudly when they   re stung .  anyway  detritus thinks igneous is mixed up with smuggling slab to the mountains  and so he   s itching for an excuse to have a poke around in there   look  this is still technically my day off .     she stepped back and peered up at the high spiked wall around the yard .  could you bake clay in a baker   s oven .     she said .      oh  no .         doesn   t get hot enough .         no  it   s the wrong shape .  some of your pots   d be baked hard while others   d still be green .  why do you ask .      why did i ask  angua thought .  oh  what the hell      fancy a drink .         not ale     said cheery quickly .     and nowhere where you have to sing while you drink .  or slap your knees .      angua nodded understandingly .     somewhere  in fact  without dwarfs .         er   yes           where we   re going     said angua     that won   t be a problem .          the fog was rising fast .  all morning it had hung around in alleys and cellars .  now it was moving back in for the night .  it came out of the ground and up from the river and down from the sky  a clinging yellowish stinging blanket  the river ankh in droplet form .  it found its way through cracks and  against all common sense  managed to survive in lighted rooms  filling the air with an eye watering haze and making the candles crackle .  outdoors  every figure loomed  every shape was a menace     in a drab alley off a drab street angua stopped  squared her shoulders  and pushed open a door .   the atmosphere in the long  low  dark room altered as she stepped inside .  a moment of time rang like a glass bowl  and then there was a sense of relaxation .  people turned back in their seats .   well  they were seated .  it was quite likely they were people .   cheery moved closer to angua .     what   s this place called .     she whispered .      it hasn   t really got a name     said angua     but sometimes we call it biers .         it didn   t look like an inn outside .  how did you find it .         you don   t .  you   gravitate to it .      cheery looked around nervously .  she wasn   t sure where they were  apart from somewhere in the cattle market district  somewhere up a maze of alleys .   angua walked to the bar .   a deeper shadow appeared out of the gloom .     hello  angua     it said  in a deep  rolling voice .     fruit juice  is it .         yes .  chilled .         and what about the dwarf .         she   ll have him raw     said a voice somewhere in the gloom .  there was a ripple of laughter in the dark .  some of it sounded altogether too strange to cheery .  she couldn   t imagine it issuing from normal lips .     i   ll have a fruit juice  too     she quavered .   angua glanced at the dwarf .  she felt oddly grateful that the remark from the darkness seemed to have gone entirely over the small bullet head .  she unhooked her badge and with care and deliberation laid it down on the counter .  it went perlink .  then angua leaned forward and showed the iconograph to the barman .   if it was a man .  cheery wasn   t sure yet .  a sign over the bar said    don   t you ever change .         you know everything that   s going on  igor     angua said .     two old men got killed yesterday .  and a load of clay got stolen from igneous the troll recently .  did you ever hear about that .         what   s that to you .         killing old men is against the law     said angua .     of course  a lot of things are against the law  so we   re very busy in the watch .  we like to be busy about important things .  otherwise we have to be busy about unimportant things .  are you hearing me .      the shadow considered this .     go and take a seat     it said .     i   ll bring your drinks .      angua led the way to a table in an alcove .  the clientele lost interest in them .  a buzz of conversation resumed .      what is this place .     cheery whispered .      it   s   a place where people can be themselves     said angua slowly .     people who   have to be a little careful at other times .  you know .         no        angua sighed .     vampires  zombies  bogeymen  ghouls  oh my .  the und       she corrected herself .     the differently alive     she said .     people who have to spend most of their time being very careful  not frightening people  fitting in .  that   s how it works here .  fit in  get a job  don   t worry people  and you probably won   t find a crowd outside with pitchforks and flaming torches .  but sometimes it   s good to go where everybody knows your shape .      now that cheery   s eyes had grown accustomed to the low light she could make out the variety of shapes on the benches .  some of them were a lot bigger than human .  some had pointy ears and long muzzles .      who   s that girl .     she said .     she looks   normal .         that   s violet .  she   s a tooth fairy .  and next to her is schleppel the bogeyman .      in the far corner something sat huddled in a huge overcoat under a high  broad brimmed pointed hat .      and him .         that   s old man trouble     said angua .     if you know what   s good for you  you don   t mind him .         er   any werewolves here .         one or two     said angua .      i hate werewolves .         oh .      the oddest customer was sitting by herself  at a small round table .  she appeared to be a very old lady  in a shawl and a straw hat with flowers in it .  she was staring in front of her with an expression of good natured aimlessness  and in context looked more frightening than any of the shadowy figures .      what is she .     cheery hissed .      her .  oh  that   s mrs .  gammage .         and what does she do .         do .  well  she comes in here most days for a drink and some company .  sometimes we   they have a singsong .  old songs  that she remembers .  she   s practically blind .  if you mean  is she an undead   no  she   s isn   t .  not a vampire  a werewolf  a zombie  or a bogeyman .  just an old lady .      a huge shambling hairy thing paused at mrs .  gammage   s table and put a glass in front of her .      port and lemon .  there you goes  mrs .  gammage     it rumbled .      cheers  charlie .     the old lady cackled .     how   s the plumbing business .         doing fine  love     said the bogeyman  and vanished into the gloom .      that was a plumber .     said cheery .      of course not .  i don   t know who charlie was .  he probably died years ago .  but she thinks the bogeyman is him  and who   s going to tell her different .         you mean she doesn   t know this place is           look  she   s been coming here ever since the old days when it was the crown and axe     said angua .     no one wants to spoil things .  everyone likes mrs .  gammage .  they   watch out for her .  help her out in little ways .         how .         well  i heard that last month someone broke into her hovel and stole some of her stuff           that doesn   t sound helpful .            and it was all returned next day and a couple of thieves were found in the shades with not a drop of blood left in their bodies .     angua smiled  and her voice took on a mocking edge .     you know  you get told a lot of bad things about the undead  but you never hear about the marvelous work they do in the community .      igor the barman appeared .  he looked more or less human  apart from the hair on the back of his hands and the single unbifurcated eyebrow across his forehead .  he tossed a couple of mats on the table and put their drinks down .      you   re probably wishing this was a dwarf bar     said angua .  she lifted her beer mat carefully and glanced at the underside .   cheery looked around again .  by now  if it had been a dwarf bar  the floor would be sticky with beer  the air would be full of flying quaff  and people would be singing .  they   d probably be singing the latest dwarf tune  gold  gold  gold  or one of the old favorites  like gold  gold  gold  or the all time biggie  gold  gold  gold .  in a few minutes  the first axe would have been thrown .      no     she said     it could never be that bad .         drink up     said angua .     we   ve got to go and see   something .      a large hairy hand grabbed angua   s wrist .  she looked up into a terrifying face  all eyes and mouth and hair .      hello  shlitzen     she said calmly .      hah  i   m hearing where there   s a baron who   s really unhappy about you     said shlitzen  alcohol crystallizing on his breath .      that   s my business  shlitzen     said angua .     why don   t you just go back behind your door like the good bogeyman that you are .         hah  he   s sayin    where you   re disgracin    the old country           let go  please     said angua .  her skin was white where shlitzen was gripping her .   cheery looked from the wrist to the bogeyman   s shoulder .  rangy though the creature was  muscles were strung along the arm like beads on a wire .      hah  you wearin    a badge     it sneered .     what   s a good we    .      angua moved so fast she was a blur .  her free hand pulled something from her belt and flipped it up and on to shlitzen   s head .  he stopped  and stood swaying back and forth gently  making faint moaning sounds .  on his head  flopping down around his ears like the knotted hanky of a style impaired seaside sunbather  was a small square of heavy material .   angua pushed back her chair and grabbed the beermat .  the shadowy figures around the walls were muttering .      let   s get out of here     she said .     igor  give us half a minute and then you can take the blanket off him .  come on .      they hurried out .  the fog had already turned the sun into a mere suggestion  but it was vivid daylight compared to the gloom in biers .      what happened to him .     said cheery  running to keep up with angua   s stride .      existential uncertainty     angua said .     he doesn   t know whether he exists or not .  it   s cruel  i know  but it   s the only thing we   ve found that works against bogeymen .  blue fluffy blanket  for preference .     she noted cheery   s blank expression .     look  bogeymen go away if you put your head under the blankets .  everyone knows that  don   t they .  so if you put their head under a blanket           oh  i see .  ooo  that   s nasty .         he   ll feel all right in ten minutes .     angua skimmed the beermat across the alley .      what was he saying about a baron .         i wasn   t really listening     said angua carefully .   cheery shivered in the fog  but not just from the cold .     he sounded like he came from uberwald  like us .  there was a baron who lived near us and he hated people to leave .         yes           the whole family were werewolves .  one of them ate my second cousin .      angua   s memory spun in a hurry .  old meals came back to haunt her from the time before she   d said  no  this is not the way to live .  a dwarf  a dwarf   no  she was pretty sure she   d never   the family had always made fun of her eating habits        that   s why i can   t stand them     said cheery .     oh  people say they can be tamed but i say  once a wolf  always a wolf .  you can   t trust them .  they   re basically evil  aren   t they .  they could go back to the wild at any moment  i say .         yes .  you may be right .         and the worst thing is  most of the time they walk around looking just like real people .      angua blinked  glad of the twin disguises of the fog and cheery   s unquestioning confidence .     come on .  we   re nearly there .         where .         we   re going to see someone who   s either our murderer or who knows who the murderer is .      cheery stopped .     but you   ve got only a sword and i haven   t even got that .         don   t worry  we won   t need weapons .         oh  good .         they wouldn   t be any use .         oh .          vimes opened his door to see what all the shouting was about down in the office .  the corporal manning   or in this case dwarfing   the desk was having trouble .      again .  how many times have you been killed this week .         i was minding my own business .     said the unseen complainer .      stacking garlic .  you   re a vampire  aren   t you .  i mean  let   s see what jobs you have been doing   post sharpener for a fencing firm  sunglasses tester for argus opticians   is it me  or is there some underlying trend here .         excuse me  commander vimes .      vimes looked round into a smiling face that sought only to do good in the world  even if the world had other things it wanted done .      ah   constable visit  yes     he said hurriedly .     at the moment i   m afraid i   m rather busy  and i   m not even sure that i have got an immortal soul  ha ha  and perhaps you could call again when           it   s about those words you asked me to check     said visit reproachfully .      what words .         the ones father tubelcek wrote in his own blood .  you said to try and find out what they meant .         oh .  yes .  come on into my office .     vimes relaxed .  this wasn   t going to be another one of those painful conversations about the state of his soul and the necessity of giving it a wash and brush up before eternal damnation set in .  this was going to be about something important .      it   s ancient cenotine  sir .  it   s out of one of their holy books  although of course when i say    holy    it is a fact that they were basically misguided in a           yes  yes  i   m sure     said vimes  sitting down .     does it by any chance say    mr .  x did it  aargh  aargh  aargh    .         no  sir .  that phrase does not appear anywhere in any known holy book  sir .         ah     said vimes .      besides  i looked at other documents in the room and the paper does not appear to be in the deceased   s handwriting  sir .      vimes brightened up .     ah ha .  someone else   s .  does it say something like    take that  you bastard  we   ve been waiting ages to get you for what you did all those years ago    .         no  sir .  that phrase also does not appear in any holy book anywhere     said constable visit  and hesitated .     except in the apocrypha to the vengeful testament of offler     he added conscientiously .     these words are from the cenotine book of truth     he sniffed     as they called it .  it   s what their false god           could i just perhaps have the words and leave out the comparative religion .     said vimes .      very well  sir .     visit looked hurt  but unfolded a piece of paper and sniffed disparagingly .     these are some of the rules that their god allegedly gave to the first people after he   d baked them out of clay  sir .  rules like    thou shalt labor fruitfully all the days of your life     sir  and    thou shalt not kill     and    thou shalt be humble .     that sort of thing .         is that all .     said vimes .      yes  sir     said visit .      they   re just religious quotations .         yes  sir .         any idea why it was in his mouth .  poor devil looked like he was having a last cigarette .             no  sir .         i could understand if it was one of the    smite your enemies    ones     said vimes .     but that   s just saying    get on with your work and don   t make trouble    .         ceno was a rather liberal god  sir .  not big on commandments .         sounds almost decent  as gods go .      visit looked disapproving .     the cenotines died through five hundred years of waging some of the bloodiest wars on the continent  sir .         spare the thunderbolts and spoil the congregation  eh .     said vimes .      pardon  sir .         oh  nothing .  well  thank you  constable .  i   ll  er  see that captain carrot is informed and  thank you once again  don   t let me keep you from        vimes   s desperately accelerating voice was too late to prevent visit pulling a roll of paper out of his breastplate .      i   ve brought you the latest unadorned facts magazine  sir  and also this month   s battle call  which contains many articles that i   m sure will be of interest to you  including pastor nasal pedlers    exhortation to the congregation to rise up and speak to people sincerely through their letterboxes  sir .         er  thank you .         i can   t help noticing that the pamphlets and magazines i gave you last week are still on your desk where i left them  sir .         oh  yes  well  sorry  you know how it is  the amount of work these days  makes it so hard to find the time to           it   s never too soon to contemplate eternal damnation  sir .         i think about it all the time  constable .  thank you .      unfair  thought vimes  when visit had gone .  a note is left at the scene of a crime in my town and does it have the decency to be a death threat .  no .  the last dying scrawl of a man determined to name his murderer .  no .  it   s a bit of religious doggerel .  what   s the good of clues that are more mysterious than the mystery .   he scribbled a note on visit   s translation and chucked it into his in tray .       too late  angua remembered why she avoided the slaughterhouse district at this time of the month .   she could change at will at any time .  that   s what people forgot about werewolves .  but they remembered the important thing .  full moonlight was the irresistible trigger  the lunar rays reached down into the center of her morphic memory and flipped all the switches  whether she wanted them switched or not .  full moon was only a couple of days away .  and the delicious smell of the penned animals and the blood from the slaughterhouses was chiming against her strict vegetarianism .  the clash was bringing on her plt .   she glared at the shadowy building in front of her .     i think we   ll go round the back     she said .     and you can knock .         me .  they won   t take any notice of me .     said cheery .      you show them your badge and tell them you   re the watch .         they   ll ignore me .  they   ll laugh at me .         you   re going to have to do it sooner or later .  go on .      the door was opened by a stout man in a bloody apron .  he was shocked to have his belt grabbed by one dwarf hand  while another dwarf hand was thrust in front of his face  holding a badge  and a dwarf voice in the region of his navel said     we   re the watch  right .  oh  yes .  and if you don   t let us in we   ll have your guts for starters .         good try     murmured angua .  she lifted cheery out of the way and smiled brightly at the butcher .      mr .  sock .  we   d like to speak to an employee of yours .  mr .  dorfl .      the man hadn   t quite got over cheery  but he managed to rally .     mr .  dorfl .  what   s he done now .         we   d just like to talk to him .  may we come in .      mr .  sock looked at cheery  who was trembling with nerves and excitement .     i have a choice .     he said .      let   s say   you have a kind of choice     said angua .   she tried to close her nostrils against the beguiling miasma of blood .  there was even a sausage factory on the premises .  it used all the bits of animals no one would ever otherwise eat  or even recognize .  the odors of the abattoir turned her human stomach but  deep inside  part of her sat up and drooled and begged at the mingling smells of pork and beef and lamb and mutton and        rat .     she said  sniffing .     i didn   t know you supplied the dwarf market  mr .  sock .      mr .  sock was suddenly a man who wished to be seen to be cooperative .      dorfl .  come here right now .      there was the sound of footsteps and a figure emerged from behind a rack of beef carcasses .   some people had a thing about the undead .  angua knew commander vimes was uneasy in their presence  although he was getting better these days .  people always needed someone to feel superior to .  the living hated the undead  and the undead loathed   she felt her fists clench   the unalive .   the golem called dorfl lurched a little because one leg was slightly shorter than the other .  it didn   t wear any clothes because there was nothing whatsoever to conceal  and so she could see the mottling on it where fresh clay had been added over the years .  there was so much patching that she wondered how old it could be .  originally  some attempt had been made to depict human musculature  but the repairs had nearly obscured these .  the thing looked like the kind of pots igneous despised  the ones made by people who thought that because it was hand made it was supposed to look as if was hand made  and that thumbprints baked in the clay were a sign of integrity .   that was it .  the thing looked hand made .  of course  over the years it had mostly made itself  one repair at a time .  its triangular eyes glowed faintly .  there were no pupils  just the dark red glow of a banked fire .   it was holding a long  heavy cleaver .  cheery   s stare gravitated to this and remained fixed on it in terrified fascination .  the other hand grasped a piece of string  on the end of which was a large  hairy and very smelly goat .      what are you doing  dorfl .      the golem nodded towards the goat .      feeding the yudasgoat .      dorfl nodded again .      have you got something to do  mr .  sock .     said angua .      no  i   ve           you have got something to do  mr .  sock     said angua emphatically .      ah .  er .  yes .  er .  yes .  ok .  i   ll just go and see to the offal boilers        as the butcher walked away he stopped to wave a finger under the place where dorfl   s nose would be if the golem had had a nose .      if you   ve been causing trouble       he began .      i expect those boilers could really do with attention     said angua sharply .   he hurried off .   there was silence in the yard  although the sounds of the city drifted in over the walls .  from the other side of the slaughterhouse there was the occasional bleat of a worried sheep .  dorfl stood stock still  holding his cleaver and looking down at the ground .      is it a troll made to look like a human .     whispered cheery .     look at those eyes .         it   s not a troll     said angua .     it   s a golem .  a man of clay .  it   s a machine .         it looks like a human .         that   s because it   s a machine made for looking like a human .      she walked around behind the thing .     i   m going to read your chem  dorfl     she said .   the golem let go of the goat and raised the cleaver and brought it down sharply on to a chopping block beside cheery  making the dwarf leap sideways .  then it pulled around a slate that was slung over its shoulder on a piece of string  unhooked the pencil  and wrote   yes .   when angua put her hand up  cheery realized that there was a thin line across the golem   s forehead .  to her horror  the entire top of the head flipped up .  angua  quite unperturbed  reached inside .  her hand came out holding a yellowing scroll .   the golem froze .  the eyes faded .   angua unrolled the paper .     some kind of holy writing     she said .     it always is .  some old dead religion .         you   ve killed it .         no .  you can   t take away what isn   t there .     she put the scroll back and closed the head with a click .   the golem came    alive    again  the glow returning to its eyes .   cheery had been holding her breath .  it came out in a rush .     what did you do .     she managed .      tell her  dorfl     said angua .   the golem   s thick fingers were a blur as the pencil scratched across the slate .   i am a golem .  i was made of clay .  my life is the words .  by means of words of purpose in my head i acquire life .  my life is to work .  i obey all commands .  i take no rest .      what words of purpose .      relevant text that are the focus of belief .  golem must work .  golem must have a master .   the goat lay down beside the golem and started to chew cud .      there have been two murders     said angua .     i   m pretty certain a golem did one and probably both .  can you tell us anything  dorfl .         sorry  look     said cheery .     are you telling me this   thing is powered by words .  i mean   is it telling me it   s powered by words .         why not .  words do have power .  everyone knows that     said angua .     there are more golems around than you might think .  they   re out of fashion now  but they last .  they can work underwater  or in total darkness  or knee deep in poison .  for years .  they don   t need rest or feeding .  they           but that   s slavery .     said cheery .      of course it isn   t .  you might as well enslave a doorknob .  have you got anything to tell me  dorfl .      cheery kept looking at the cleaver in the block .  words like length and heavy and sharp were filling her head more snugly than any words could have filled the clay skull of the golem .   dorfl said nothing .      how long have you been working here  dorfl .      now three hundred days already .      and you have time off .      to make a hollow laughing .  what would i do with time off .      i mean  you   re not always in the slaughterhouse .      sometimes i make deliveries .      and meet other golems .  now listen  dorfl  i know you things keep in touch somehow .  and  if a golem is killing real people  i wouldn   t give a busted teacup for your chances .  folk will be along here straight away with flaming torches .  and sledgehammers .  you get my drift .      the golem shrugged .   they cannot take away what does not exist  it wrote .   angua threw up her hands .     i   m trying to be civilized     she said .     i could confiscate you right now .  the charge would be being obstructive when it   s been a long day and i   ve had enough .  do you know father tubelcek .   the old priest who lives on the bridge .      how come you know him .      i have made deliveries there .      he   s been murdered .  where were you when he was killed .      in the slaughterhouse .      how do you know .      dorfl hesitated a moment .  then the next words were written very slowly  as if they had come from a long way away after a great deal of thought .   because it is something that must have happened not long ago  because you are excited .  for the last three days i have been working here .      all the time .      yes .      twenty four hours a day .      yes .  men and trolls here on every shift  they will tell you .  during the day i must slaughter  dress  quarter  joint and bone  and at night without rest i must make sausages and boil up the livers  hearts  tripes  kidneys and chitterling .      that   s awful     said cheery .   the pencil blurred briefly .   close .   dorfl turned his head slowly to look at angua and wrote   do you need me further .      if we do  we know where to find you .      i am sorry about the old man .      good .  come on  cheery .      they felt the golem   s eyes on them as they left the yard .      it was lying     said cheery .      why do you say that .         it looked as if it was lying .         you   re probably right     said angua .     but you can see the size of the place .  i bet we wouldn   t be able to prove it   d stepped out for half an hour .  i think i   ll suggest that we put it under what commander vimes calls special surveillance .         what  like   plain clothes .         something like that     said angua carefully .      funny to see a pet goat in a slaughterhouse  i thought     said cheery  as they walked on through the fog .      what .  oh  you mean the yudasgoat     said angua .     most slaughterhouses have one .  it   s not a pet .  i suppose you could call it an employee .         employee .  what kind of job could it possibly do .         hah .  walk into the slaughterhouse every day .  that   s its job .  look  you   ve got a pen full of frightened animals  right .  and they   re milling around and leaderless   and there   s this ramp into this building  looks very scary   and  hey  there   s this goat  it   s not scared  and so the flock follows it and       angua made a throat slitting noise      only the goat walks out .         that   s horrible .         i suppose it makes sense from the goat   s point of view .  at least it does walk out     said angua .      how did you know about this .         oh  you pick up all sorts of odds and ends of stuff in the watch .         i   ve got a lot to learn  i can see     said cheery .     i never thought you had to carry bits of blanket  for a start .         it   s special equipment if you   re dealing with the undead .         well  i knew about garlic and vampires .  anything holy works on vampires .  what else works on werewolves .         sorry .     said angua  who was still thinking about the golem .      i   ve got a silver mail vest which i promised my family i   d wear  but is anything else good for werewolves .         a gin and tonic   s always welcome     said angua distantly .      angua .         hmm .  yes .  what .         someone told me there was a werewolf in the watch .  i can   t believe that .      angua stopped and stared down at her .      i mean  sooner or later the wolf comes through     said cheery .     i   m surprised commander vimes allows it .         there is a werewolf in the watch  yes     said angua .      i knew there was something odd about constable visit .      angua   s jaw dropped .      he always looks hungry     said cheery .     and he   s got that odd smile all the time .  i know a werewolf when i see one .         he does look a bit hungry  that   s true     said angua .  she couldn   t think of anything else to say .      well  i   m going to be keeping my distance .         fine     said angua .      angua           yes .         why do you wear your badge on a collar round your neck .         what .  oh .  well   so it   s always handy .  you know .  in any circumstances .         do i need to do that .         i shouldn   t think so .          mr .  sock jumped .     dorfl  you damn stupid lump .  never sneak up behind a man on the bacon slicer .  i   ve told you that before .  try to make some noise when you move  damn you .      the golem held up its slate  which said   tonight i cannot work .      what   s this .  the bacon slicer never asks for time off .      it is a holy day .   sock looked at the red eyes .  old fishbine had said something about this  hadn   t he  when he   d sold dorfl .  something like     sometimes it   ll go off for a few hours because it   s a holy day .  it   s the words in its head .  if it doesn   t go and trot off to its temple or whatever it is  the words   ll stop working  don   t ask me why .  there   s no point in stopping it .      five hundred and thirty dollars the thing had cost .  he   d thought it was a bargain   and it was a bargain  no doubt about that .  the damned thing only ever stopped working when it had run out of things to do .  sometimes not even then  according to the stories .  you heard about golems flooding out houses because no one told them to stop carrying water from the well  or washing the dishes until the plates were thin as paper .  stupid things .  but useful if you kept your eye on them .   and yet   and yet   he could see why no one seemed to keep them for long .  it was the way the damned two handed engine just stood there  taking it all in and putting it   where .  and never complained .  or groused .   a man could get worried about a bargain like that  and feel mightily relieved when he was writing out a receipt for the new owner .      seems to me there   s been a lot of holy days lately     sock said .   some times are more holy than others .   but they couldn   t skive off  could they .  work was what a golem did .      i don   t know how we   re going to manage       sock began .   it is a holy day .      oh  all right .  you can have time off tomorrow .      tonight .  holy day starts at sunset .      be back quickly  then     said sock  weakly .     or i   ll   you be back quickly  d   you hear .      that was another thing .  you couldn   t threaten the creatures .  you certainly couldn   t withhold their pay  because they didn   t get any .  you couldn   t frighten them .  fishbine had said that a weaver over nap hill way had ordered his golem to smash itself to bits with a hammer   and it had .   yes .  i hear .       in a way  it didn   t matter who they were .  in fact  their anonymity was part of the whole business .  they thought themselves part of the march of history  the tide of progress and the wave of the future .  they were men who felt that the time had come .  regimes can survive barbarian hordes  crazed terrorists  and hooded secret societies  but they   re in real trouble when prosperous and anonymous men sit around a big table and think thoughts like that .   one said     at least it   s clean this way .  no blood .         and it would be for the good of the city  of course .      they nodded gravely .  no one needed to say that what was good for them was good for ankh morpork .      and he won   t die .         apparently he can be kept merely   unwell .  the dosage can be varied  i   m told .         good .  i   d rather have him unwell than dead .  i wouldn   t trust vetinari to stay in a grave .         i   ve heard that he once said he   d prefer to be cremated  as a matter of fact .         then i just hope they scatter the ashes really widely  that   s all .         what about the watch .         what about it .         ah .          lord vetinari opened his eyes .  against all rationality  his hair ached .   he concentrated  and a blur by the bed focused into the shape of samuel vimes .      ah  vimes     he said weakly .      how are you feeling  sir .         truly dreadful .  who was that little man with the incredibly bandy legs .         that was doughnut jimmy  sir .  he used to be a jockey on a very fat horse .         a racehorse .         apparently  sir .         a fat racehorse .  surely that could never win a race .         i don   t believe it ever did  sir .  but jimmy made a lot of money by not winning races .         ah .  he gave me milk and some sort of sticky potion .     vetinari concentrated .     i was heartily sick .         so i understand  sir .         funny phrase  that .  heartily sick .  i wonder why it   s a clich   .  sounds   jolly .  rather cheerful  really .         yes  sir .         feel like i   ve got a bad dose of    flu  vimes .  head not working properly .         really  sir .      the patrician thought for a while .  there was obviously something else on his mind .     why did he still smell of horses  vimes .     he said at last .      he   s a horse doctor  sir .  a damn    good one .  i heard last month he treated dire fortune and it didn   t fall over until the last furlong .         doesn   t sound helpful  vimes .         oh  i don   t know  sir .  the horse had dropped dead coming up to the starting line .         ah .  i see .  well  well  well .  what a nasty suspicious mind you have  vimes .         thank you  sir .      the patrician raised himself on his elbows .     should toenails throb  vimes .         couldn   t say  sir .         now  i think i should like to read for a while .  life goes on  eh .      vimes went to the window .  there was a nightmarish figure crouched on the edge of the balcony outside  staring into the thickening fog .      everything all right  constable downspout .         eff  fir     said the apparition .      i   ll shut the window now .  the fog is coming in .         fight oo are  fir .      vimes closed the window  trapping a few tendrils which gradually faded away .      what was that .     said lord vetinari .      constable downspout   s a gargoyle  sir .  he   s no good on parade and bloody useless on the street  but when it comes to staying in one place  sir  you can   t beat him .  he   s world champion at not moving .  if you want the winner of the     meters standing still  that   s him .  he spent three days on a roof in the rain when we caught the park lane knobbler .  nothing   ll get past him .  and there   s corporal gimletsson patrolling the corridor and constable glodsnephew on the floor below and constables flint and moraine in the rooms on either side of you  and sergeant detritus will be around constantly so that if anyone nods off he   ll kick arse  sir  and you   ll know when he does that    cos the poor bugger   ll come right through the wall .         well done  vimes .  am i right in thinking that all my guards are non human .  they all seem to be dwarfs and trolls .         safest way  sir .         you   ve thought of everything  vimes .         hope so  sir .         thank you  vimes .     vetinari sat up and took a mass of papers off the bedside table .     and now  don   t let me detain you .      vimes    mouth dropped open .   vetinari looked up .     was there anything else  commander .      well   i suppose not  sir .  i suppose i   d just better run along  eh .         if you wouldn   t mind .  and i   m sure a lot of paperwork has accumulated in my office  so if you   d send someone to fetch it  i would be obliged .      vimes shut the door behind him  a little harder than necessary .  gods  it made him livid  the way vetinari turned him on and off like a switch   and had as much natural gratitude as an alligator .  the patrician relied on vimes doing his job  knew he   d do his job  and that was the extent of his thought on the matter .  well  one day  vimes would   would        would bloody well do his job  of course  because he didn   t know how to do anything else .  but realizing that made it all the worse .   outside the palace the fog was thick and yellow .  vimes nodded to the guards on the door  and looked out at the clinging  swirling clouds .   it was almost a straight line to the watch house in pseudopolis yard .  and the fog had brought early night to the city .  not many people were on the streets  they stayed indoors  barring the windows against the damp shreds that seemed to leak in everywhere .   yes   empty streets  a chilly night  dampness in the air     only one thing was needed to make it perfect .  he sent the sedan men on home and walked back to one of the guards .     you   re constable lucker  aren   t you .         yessir  sir samuel .         what size boots do you take .      lucker looked panicky .     what  sir .         it   s a simple question  man .         seven and a halfs  sir .         from old plugger in new cobblers .  the cheap ones .         yessir .         can   t have a man guarding the palace in cardboard boots .     said vimes  with mock cheerfulness .     off with them  constable .  you can have mine .  they   ve still got wyvern   well  whatever it is wyverns do   on them  but they   ll fit you .  don   t stand there with your mouth open .  give me your boots  man .  you can keep mine .     vimes added     i   ve got lots .      the constable watched in frightened astonishment as vimes pulled on the cheap pair and stood upright  stamping a few times with his eyes shut .     ah     he said .     i   m in front of the palace  right .         er   yes  sir .  you   ve just come out of it  sir .  it   s this big building here .         ah     said vimes brightly     but i   d know i was here  even if i hadn   t .         er           it   s the flagstones     said vimes .     they   re an unusual size and slightly dished in the middle .  hadn   t you noticed .  your feet  lad .  that   s what you   ll have to learn to think with .      the bemused constable watched him disappear into the fog  stamping happily .       corporal the right honorable the earl of ankh nobby nobbs pushed open the watch house door and staggered inside .   sergeant colon looked up from the desk  and gasped .     you ok  nobby .     he said  hurrying around to support the swaying figure .      it   s terrible  fred .  terrible .         here  take a seat .  you   re all pale .         i   ve been elevated  fred .     moaned nobby .      nasty .  did you see who did it .      nobby wordlessly handed him the scroll dragon king of arms had pressed into his hand  and flopped back .  he took a tiny length of home made cigarette from behind his ear and lit it with a shaking hand .     i dunno  i   m sure     he said .     you do your best  you keep your head down  you don   t make any trouble  and then something like this happens to you .      colon read the scroll slowly  his lips moving when he came to difficult words like    and    and    the .        nobby  you   ve read this .  it says you   re a lord .         the old man said they   d have to do a lot of checking up but he thought it was pretty clear what with the ring and all .  fred  what am i gonna do .         sit back and eat off ermine plates  i should think .         that   s just it  fred .  there   s no money .  no big house .  no land .  not a brass farthing .         what  nothing .         not a dried pea  fred .         i thought all the upper crust had pots of money .         well  i   m the crust on its uppers  fred .  i don   t know anything about lording .  i don   t want to have to wear posh clothes and go to hunt balls and all that stuff .      sergeant colon sat down beside him .     you never suspected you   d got any posh connections .         well   my cousin vincent once got done for indecently assaulting the duchess of quirm   s housemaid           chambermaid or scullery maid .         scullery maid  i think .         probably doesn   t count  then .  does anyone else know about this .         well  she did  and she went and told           i mean about your lordshipping .         only mr .  vimes .         well  there you are     said sergeant colon  handing him back the scroll .     you don   t have to tell anyone .  then you don   t have to go around wearing golden trousers  and you needn   t hunt balls unless you   ve lost    em .  you just sit there  and i   ll fetch you a cup of tea  how about that .  we   ll see it through  don   t you worry .         you   re a toff  fred .         that makes two of us  m   lord .     colon waggled his eyebrows .     get it .  get it .         don   t  fred .      the watch house door opened .   fog poured in like smoke .  in the midst of it were two red eyes .  the parting shreds revealed the massive figure of a golem .      umpk     said sergeant colon .   the golem held up his slate   i have come to you .      yeah .  yeah .  yeah .  i   ve  er  yeah  i can see that     said colon .   dorfl turned the slate around .  the other side read   i give myself up for murder .  it was i who killed the old priest .  the crime is solved .   colon  once his lips had stopped moving  scurried behind the suddenly very flimsy defenses of his desk and scrabbled through the papers there .      you keep it covered  nobby     he said .     make sure it don   t run off .         why   s it going to run off .     said nobby .   sergeant colon found a relatively clean piece of paper .      well  well  well  i  well  i guess i   d better   what   s your name .      the golem wrote   dorfl .       by the time he was on the brass bridge  medium sized cobbles of the rounded sort they called    cat heads     quite a few missing  vimes was already beginning to wonder if he   d done the right thing .   autumn fogs were always thick  but he   d never known it this bad .  the pall muffled the sounds of the city and turned the brightest lights into dim glows  even though in theory the sun hadn   t set yet .   he walked along by the parapet .  a squat  glistening shape loomed in the fog .  it was one of the wooden hippos  some distant ancestor of roderick or keith .  there were four on either side  all looking out towards the sea .   vimes had walked past them thousands of times .  they were old friends .  he   d often stood in the lee of one on chilly nights  when he was looking for somewhere out of trouble .   that   s what it used to be like  wasn   t it .  it hardly seemed that long ago .  just a handful of them in the watch  staying out of trouble .  and then carrot had arrived  and suddenly the narrow circuit of their lives had opened up  and there were nearly thirty men  oh  including trolls and dwarfs and miscellaneous  in the watch now  and they didn   t skulk around keeping out of trouble  they went looking for trouble  and they found it everywhere they looked .  funny  that .  as vetinari had pointed out in that way of his  the more policemen you had  the more crimes seemed to be committed .  but the watch was back and out there on the streets  and if they weren   t actually as good as detritus at kicking arse they were definitely prodding buttock .   he lit a match on a hippo   s toenail and cupped his hand around it to shield his cigar from the damp .   these murders  now .  no one would care if the watch didn   t care .  two old men  murdered on the same day .  nothing stolen   he corrected himself  nothing apparently stolen .  of course  the thing about things that were stolen was that the bloody things weren   t there .  they almost certainly hadn   t been fooling around with other people   s wives .  they probably couldn   t remember what fooling around was .  one spent his time among old religious books  the other  for gods    sakes  was an authority on the aggressive uses of baking .   people would probably say they had lived blameless lives .   but vimes was a policeman .  no one lived a completely blameless life .  it might be just possible  by lying very still in a cellar somewhere  to get through a day without committing a crime .  but only just .  and  even then  you were probably guilty of loitering .   anyway  angua seemed to have taken this case personally .  she always had a soft spot for the underdog .   so did vimes .  you had to .  not because they were pure or noble  because they weren   t .  you had to be on the side of underdogs because they weren   t overdogs .   everyone in this city looked after themselves .  that   s what the guilds were for .  people banded together against other people .  the guild looked after you from the cradle to the grave or  in the case of the assassins  to other people   s graves .  they even maintained the law  or at least they had done  after a fashion .  thieving without a license was punishable by death for the first offense .   the thieves    guild saw to that .  the arrangement sounded unreal  but it worked .   it worked like a machine .  that was fine except for the occasional people who got caught in the wheels .   the damp cobbles felt reassuringly real under his soles .   gods  he   d missed this .  he   d patrolled alone in the old days .  when there was just him  and the stones glistened around   a . m .   it all seemed to make sense somehow     he stopped .   around him  the world became a crystal of horror  the special horror that has nothing to do with fangs or ichor or ghosts but has everything to do with the familiar becoming unfamiliar .   something fundamental was wrong .   it took a few dreadful seconds for his mind to supply the details of what his subconscious had noticed .  there had been five statues along the parapet on this side .   but there should have been four .   he turned very slowly and walked back to the last one .  it was a hippo  all right .   so was the next one .  there was graffiti on it .  nothing supernatural had    zaz ys a wonker    scrawled on it .   it seemed to him that it didn   t take quite so long to get to the next one  and when he looked at it     two red points of light flared in the fog above him .   something big and dark leapt down  knocked him to the ground and disappeared into the gloom .   vimes struggled to his feet  shook his head and set off after it .  no thought was involved .  it is the ancient instinct of terriers and policemen to chase anything that runs away .   as he ran he felt automatically for his bell  which would summon other watchmen  but the commander of the watch didn   t carry a bell .  commanders of the watch were on their own .       in vimes   s squalid office captain carrot stared at a piece of paper       repairs to guttering  watch house   pseudopolis yard .  new downpipe        micklewhite bend   four right angled trusses   labor and making good .       .    .       there were more like them  including constable downspout   s pigeon bill .  he knew sergeant colon objected to the idea of a policeman being paid in pigeons  but constable downspout was a gargoyle and gargoyles had no concept of money .  but they knew a pigeon when they ate it .   still  things were improving .  when carrot had arrived the entire watch   s petty cash had been kept on a shelf in a tin marked    stronginthearm   s armor polish for gleaming cohorts    and  if money was needed for anything  all you had had to do was go and find nobby and force him to give it back .   then there was the letter from a resident in park lane  one of the most select addresses in the city       commander vimes     the night watch patrol in this street appears to be made up entirely of dwarfs .  i have nothing against dwarfs amongst their own kind  at least they are not trolls  but one hears stories and i have daughters in the house .  i demand that this situation is remedied instantly otherwise i shall have no option but to take up the matter with lord vetinari  who is a personal friend .     i am  sir  your obt .  servant     j .  h .  catterail      this was police work  was it .  he wondered if mr .  vimes were trying to tell him something .  there were other letters .  the community coordinator of equal heights for dwarfs was demanding that dwarfs in the watch be allowed to carry an axe rather than the traditional sword  and should be sent to investigate only those crimes committed by tall people .  the thieves    guild was complaining that commander vimes had said publicly that most thefts were committed by thieves .   you   d need the wisdom of king isiahdanu to tackle them  and these were only today   s letters .   he picked up the next one and read     translation of text found in fr .  tubelcek   s mouth .  why .  sv .      carrot dutifully read the translation .      in his mouth .  someone tried to put words in his mouth .     said carrot  to the silent room .   he shivered  but not because of the cold that came from fear .  vimes   s office was always cold .  vimes was an outdoors person .  fog was dancing in the open window  little fingers of it drifting in the light .   the next paper down the heap was a copy of cheery   s iconograph .  carrot stared at the two blurred red eyes .      captain carrot .      he half turned his head  but kept looking at the picture .      yes  fred .         we   ve got the murderer .  we   ve got    im .         is he a golem .         how did you know that .          the tincture of night began to suffuse the soup of the afternoon .   lord vetinari considered the sentence  and found it good .  he liked    tincture    particularly .  tincture .  tincture .  it was a distinguished word  and pleasantly countered by the flatness of    soup .     the soup of the afternoon .  yes .  in which may well be found the croutons of teatime .   he was aware that he was a little light headed .  he   d never have thought a sentence like that in a normal frame of mind .   in the fog outside the window  just visible by the candlelight  he saw the crouching shape of constable downspout .   a gargoyle  eh .  he   d wondered why the watch was indebted for five pigeons a week on its wages bill .  a gargoyle in the watch  whose job it was to watch .  that would be captain carrot   s idea .   lord vetinari got up carefully from the bed and closed the shutters .  he walked unsteadily to his writing table  pulled his journal out of its drawer  then tugged out a wad of manuscript and unstopped the ink bottle .   now then  where had he got to .   chapter eight  he read unsteadily  the rites of man .   ah  yes        concerning truth     he wrote     that which may be spoken as events dictate  but should be heard on every ocassion        he wondered how he could work    soup of the afternoon    into the treatise  or at least    tincture of night .      the pen scratched across the paper .   unheeded on the floor lay the tray that had contained a bowl of nourishing gruel  concerning which he had resolved to have strong words with the cook when he felt better .  it had been tasted by three tasters  including sergeant detritus  who was unlikely to be poisoned by anything that worked on humans   but probably not by most things that worked on trolls .   the door was locked .  occasionally he could hear the reassuring creak of detritus on his rounds .  outside the window  the fog condensed on constable downspout .   vetinari dipped the pen in the ink and started a new page .  every so often he consulted the leather bound journal  licking his fingers delicately to turn the thin pages .   tendrils of fog slipped in around the shutters and brushed against the wall until they were frightened away by the candlelight .       vimes pounded through the fog after the fleeing figure .  it wasn   t quite so fast as him  despite the twinges in his legs and one or two warning stabs from his left knee  but whenever he came close to it some muffled pedestrian got in the way  or a cart pulled out of a cross street .    his soles told him that they   d gone right down broad way and had turned left into nonesuch street  small square paving stones  .  the fog was even thicker here  trapped between the trees of the park .   but vimes was triumphant .  you   ve missed your turning if you   re heading for the shades  my lad .  there   s only the ankh bridge now and there   ll be a guard on that     his feet told him something else .  they said     wet leaves  that   s nonesuch street in the autumn .  small square paving stones with occasional treacherous drifts of wet leaves .      they said it too late .   vimes landed on his chin in the gutter  staggered upright  fell over again as the rest of the universe spun past  got up  tottered a few steps in the wrong direction  fell over again and decided to accept the majority vote for a while .       dorfl was standing quietly in the station office  heavy arms folded across its chest .  in front of the golem was the crossbow belonging to sergeant detritus  which had been converted from an ancient siege weapon .  it fired a six foot long iron arrow .  nobby sat behind it  his finger on the trigger .      put it away  nobby .  you can   t fire that in here .     said carrot .     you know we never find where the arrows stop .         we wrestled a confession out of it     said sergeant colon  hopping up and down .     it kept on admitting it but we got it to confess in the end .  and we   ve got these other crimes we   d like taken into consideration .      dorfl held up its slate .   i am guilty .   something fell out of its hand .   it was short  and white .  a piece of matchstick  by the look of it .  carrot picked it up and stared at it .  then he looked at the list colon had drawn up .  it was quite long  and consisted of every unsolved crime in the city for the past couple of months .      it   s confessed to all these .         not yet     said nobby .      we haven   t read    em all out yet     said colon .   dorfl wrote   i did everything .      hey .     said colon .     mr .  vimes is going to be really pleased with us .      carrot walked up to the golem .  there was a faint orange glow in its eyes .      did you kill father tubelcek .     he said .   yes .      see .     said sergeant colon .     you can   t argue with that .         why did you do it .     said carrot .   no reply .      and mr .  hopkinson at the bread museum .      yes .      you beat him to death with an iron bar .     said carrot .   yes .      hang on     said colon     i thought you said he was           leave it  fred     said carrot .     why did you kill the old man  dorfl .      no reply .      does there have to be a reason .  you can   t trust golems  my dad always used to say     said colon .     turn on you soon as look at you  he said .         have they ever killed anyone .     said carrot .      not for want of thinking about it     said colon darkly .     my dad said he had to work with one once and it used to look at him all the time .  he   d turn around and there it would be   looking at him .      dorfl sat staring straight in front .      shine a candle in its eyes .     said nobby .   carrot pulled a chair across the floor and straddled it  facing dorfl .  he absentmindedly twirled the broken match between his fingers .      i know you didn   t kill mr .  hopkinson and i don   t think you killed father tubelcek     he said .     i think he was dying when you found him .  i think you tried to save him  dorfl .  in fact  i   m pretty sure i can prove it if i can see your chem        the light from the golem   s flaring eyes filled the room .  he stepped forward  fists upraised .   nobby fired the crossbow .   dorfl snatched the long bolt out of the air .  there was the sound of screaming metal and the bolt became a thin bar of red hot iron with a bulge piled up around the golem   s grip .   but carrot was behind the golem  flipping open its head .  as the golem turned  raising the iron bar like a club  the fire died in its eyes .      got it     said carrot  holding up a yellowed scroll .       at the end of nonesuch street was a gibbet  where wrongdoers   or  at least  people found guilty of wrongdoing   had been hung to twist gently in the wind as examples of just retribution and  as the elements took their toll  basic anatomy as well .   once parties of children were brought there by their parents to learn by dreadful example of the snares and perils that await the criminal  the outlaw  and those who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time  and they would see the terrible wreckage creaking on its chain and listen to the stern imprecations and then usually  this being ankh morpork  would say    wow .  brilliant .     and use the corpse as a swing .   these days the city had more private and efficient ways of dealing with those it found surplus to requirements  but for the sake of tradition the gibbet   s incumbent was a quite realistic wooden body .  the occasional stupid raven would have a peck at the eyeballs even now  and end up with a much shorter beak .   vimes tottered up to it  fighting for breath .   the quarry could have gone anywhere by now .  such daylight as had been filtering through the fog had given up .   vimes stood beside the gibbet  which creaked .   it had been built to creak .  what   s the good of a public display of retribution  it had been argued  if it didn   t creak ominously .  in richer times an elderly man had been employed to operate the creak by means of a length of string  but now there was a clockwork mechanism that needed to be wound up only once a month .   condensation dripped off the artificial corpse .      blow this for a lark     muttered vimes  and tried to head back the way he came .   after ten seconds of blundering  he tripped over something .   it was a wooden corpse  hurled into the gutter .   when he got back to the gibbet  the empty chain was swinging gently  jingling in the fog .       sergeant colon tapped the golem   s chest .  it went donk .      like a flowerpot     said nobby .     how can they move around when they   re like a pot  eh .  they ought to keep cracking all the time .         they   re daft  too     said colon .     i heard there was one over in quirm who was made to dig a trench and they forgot about it and they only remembered it when there was all this water    cos it had dug all the way to the river        carrot unrolled the chem on the table  and laid beside it the paper that had been put in father tubelcek   s mouth .      it   s dead  is it .     said sergeant colon .      it   s harmless     said carrot  looking from one piece of paper to the other .      right .  i   ve got a sledgehammer round the back somewhere  i   ll just           no     said carrot .      you saw the way it was acting .         i don   t think it could actually have hit me .  i think it just wanted to scare us .         it worked .         look at these  fred .      sergeant colon glanced at the desk .     foreign writing     he said  in a voice which suggested that it was nothing like as good as decent home writing  and probably smelled of garlic .      anything strike you about them .         well   they looks the same     sergeant colon conceded .      this yellowing one is dorfl   s chem .  the other one is from father tubelcek     said carrot .     letter for letter the same .         why   s that .         i think dorfl wrote these words and put them in old tubelcek   s mouth after the poor man died     said carrot slowly  still looking from one piece of paper to the other .      urgh  yuk     said nobby .     that   s mucky  that is           no  you don   t understand     said carrot .     i mean he wrote them because they were the only ones he knew that worked           worked how .         well   you know the kiss of life .     said carrot .     i mean first aid .  i know you know  nobby .  you came with me when they had that course at the ympa .         i only went    cos you said you got a free cup of tea and a biscuit     said nobby sulkily .     anyway  the dummy ran away when it was my turn .         it   s the same with life saving  too     said carrot .     we want people to breathe  so we try to make sure they   ve got some air in them        they all turned back to look at the words .      but golems don   t breathe     said colon .      no  a golem knows only one thing that keeps you alive     said carrot .     it   s the words in your head .      they all turned to look at the statue that was dorfl .      it   s gone all cold in here     nobby quavered .     i def   nitly felt a aura flick   rin    in the air just then .  it was like someone           what   s going on .     said vimes  shaking the damp off his cloak .         openin    the door     said nobby .       it was ten minutes later .   sergeant colon and nobby had gone off duty  to everyone   s relief .  colon in particular had great difficulty with the idea that you went on investigating after someone had confessed .  it outraged his training and experience .  you got a confession and there it ended .  you didn   t go around disbelieving people .  you disbelieved people only when they said they were innocent .  only guilty people were trustworthy .  anything else struck at the whole basis of policing .      white clay     said carrot .     it was white clay we found .  and practically unbaked .  dorfl   s made of dark terracotta  and rock hard .         the last thing the old priest saw was a golem     said vimes .      dorfl  i   m sure     said carrot .     but that   s not the same as saying dorfl was the murderer .  i think it turned up as the man was dying  that   s all .         oh .  why .         i   m   not sure yet .  but i   ve seen dorfl around .  it   s always seemed a very gentle person .         it works in a slaughterhouse .         maybe that   s not a bad place for a gentle person to work  sir     said carrot .     anyway  i   ve checked up all the records i can find and i don   t think a golem has ever attacked anyone .  or committed any kind of crime .         oh  come on     said vimes .     everyone knows       he stopped as his cynical ears heard his incredulous voice .     what  never .         oh  people are always saying that they know someone who had a friend whose grandfather heard of one killing someone  and that   s about as real as it gets  sir .  golems aren   t allowed to hurt people .  it   s in their words .         they give me the willies  i know that     said vimes .      they give everyone the willies  sir .         you hear lots of stories about them doing stupid things like making a thousand teapots or digging a hole five miles deep     said vimes .      yes  but that   s not exactly criminal activity  is it  sir .  that   s just ordinary rebellion .         what do you mean     rebellion    .         dumbly obeying orders  sir .  you know   someone shouts at it    go and make teapots     so it does .  can   t be blamed for obeying orders  sir .  no one told them how many .  no one wants them to think  so they get their own back by not thinking .         they rebel by working .         it   s just a thought  sir .  it   d make more sense to a golem  i expect .      automatically  they all turned again to look at the silent shape of the golem .      can it hear us .     said vimes .      i don   t think so  sir .         this business with the words    .         er   i think they think a dead human is just someone who   s lost his chem .  i don   t think they understand how we work  sir .         them and me both  captain .      vimes stared at the hollow eyes .  the top of dorfl   s head was still open so that light shone down through the sockets .  vimes had seen many horrible things on the street  but the silent golem was somehow worse .  you could too easily imagine the eyes flaring and the thing standing up and striding forward  fists flailing like sledgehammers .  it was more than just his imagination .  it seemed to be built into the things .  a potentiality  biding its time .   that   s why we all hate    em  he thought .  those expressionless eyes watch us  those big faces turn to follow us  and doesn   t it just look as if they   re making notes and taking names .  if you heard that one had bashed in someone   s head over in quirm or somewhere  wouldn   t you just love to believe it .   a voice inside  a voice which generally came to him only in the quiet hours of the night or  in the old days  half way down a whiskey bottle  added  given how we use them  maybe we   re scared because we know we deserve it     no   there   s nothing behind those eyes .  there   s just clay and magic words .   vimes shrugged .     i chased a golem earlier     he said .     it was standing on the brass bridge .  damn    thing .  look  we   ve got a confession and the eyeball evidence .  if you can   t come up with anything better than a   a feeling  then we   ll have to           to what  sir .     said carrot .     there isn   t anything more we could do to it .  it   s dead now .         inanimate  you mean .         yes  sir .  if you want to put it that way .         if dorfl didn   t kill the old men  who did .         don   t know  sir .  but i think dorfl does .  maybe it was following the murderer .         could it have been ordered to protect someone .         maybe  sir .  or it decided to .         you   ll be telling me it   s got emotions next .  where   s angua gone .         she thought she   d check a few things  sir     said carrot .     i was   puzzled about this  sir .  it was in his hand .     he held the object up .      a piece of matchstick .         golems don   t smoke and they don   t use fire  sir .  it   s just   odd that it should have the thing  sir .         oh     said vimes  sarcastically .     a clue .          dorfl   s trail was the word on the street .  the mixed smells of stale slaughterhouse filled angua   s nostrils .   the journey zigzagged  but with a certain directional tendency .  it was as if the golem had laid a ruler across the town and taken every road and alley that went in the right direction .   she came to a short blind alley .  there were some warehouse gates at the end .  she sniffed .  there were plenty of other smells  too .  dough .  paint .  grease .  pine resin .  sharp  loud  fresh scents .  she sniffed again .  cloth .  wool .   there was a confusion of footprints in the dirt .  large footprints .   the small part of angua that always walked on two legs saw that the footprints coming out were on top of the footprints going in .  she snuffled around .  up to twelve creatures  each with their own very distinctive smell   the smell of merchandise rather than living creatures   had all very recently gone down the stairwell .  and all twelve had come back up .   she went down the steps and was met by an impenetrable barrier .   a door .   paws were no good at doorknobs .   she peered over the top of the steps .  there was no one around .  only the fog hung between the buildings .   she concentrated and changed .  she leaned against the wall for a moment until the world stopped spinning  then tried the door .   there was a large cellar beyond .  even with a werewolf   s eyesight there wasn   t much to see .   she had to stay human .  she thought better when she was human .  unfortunately  here and now  as a human  the thought occupying her mind in no small measure was that she was naked .  anyone finding a naked woman in their cellar would be bound to ask questions .  they might not even bother with questions  even ones like    please .     angua could certainly deal with that situation  but she preferred not to have to .  it was so difficult explaining away the shape of the wounds .   no time to waste  then .   the walls were covered in writing .  big letters  small letters  but all in that neat script which the golems used .  there were phrases in chalk and paint and charcoal  and in some cases simply cut into the stone itself .  they reached from floor to ceiling  criss crossing one another over and over again so often that it was almost impossible to make out what any of them were meant to say .  here and there a word or two stood out in the jumble of letters      shalt not   what he does is not   rage at the creator   woe unto the masterless   words in the   clay of our   let my   bring us to fre     the dust in the middle of the floor was scuffed  as if a number of people had been milling around .  she crouched down and rubbed the dirt  occasionally sniffing her finger .  smells .  they were industrial smells .  she hardly needed special senses to detect them .  a golem didn   t smell of anything except clay and whatever it was it was working with at the time     and   something rolled under her fingers .  it was a length of wood  only a couple of inches long .  a matchstick  without a head .   a few minutes    investigation found another ten  lying here and there as if they   d been idly dropped .   there was also half a stick  tossed away some distance from the others .   her night vision was fading .  the sense of smell lasted much longer .  smells were strong on the sticks   the same cocktail of odors that had trailed into this damp room .  but the slaughterhouse smell she   d come to associate with dorfl was on only the broken piece .   she sat back on her haunches and looked at the little heap of wood .  twelve people  twelve people in messy jobs  had come here .  they hadn   t stayed long .  they   d had a   a discussion  the writing on the wall .  they   d done something involving eleven matches  just the wooden part   they hadn   t been dipped to get the head .  maybe the pine smelling golem worked in a match factory .   plus one broken match .   then they   d all left and gone their separate ways .   dorfl   s way had taken him straight to the main watch house to give himself up .   why .   she sniffed at the piece of broken match again .  there was no doubt about that cocktail of blood and meat smells .   dorfl had given himself up for murder     she stared at the writing on the wall  and shivered .          cheers  fred     said nobby  raising his pint .      we can put the money back in the tea club tomorrow .  no one   ll miss it     said sergeant colon .     anyway  this comes under the heading of an emergency .      corporal nobbs looked despondently into his glass .  people often did this in the mended drum  when the immediate thirst had been slaked and for the first time they could take a good look at what they were drinking .      what am i going to do .     he moaned .     if you   re a nob you got to wears coronets and long robes and that .  got to cost a mint  that kind of stuff .  and there   s stuff you   ve got to do .     he took another long swig .        s called knobless obleeje .         nobblyesse obligay     corrected colon .     yeah .  means you got to keep your end up in society .  giving money to charities .  being kind to the poor .  passing your ole clothes to your gardener when there   s still some good wear left in    em .  i know about that .  my uncle was butler to ole lady selachii .         ain   t got a gardener     said nobby gloomily .     ain   t got a garden .  ain   t got    ny ole clothes except what i   m wearin    .     he took another swig .     she gave her ole clothes to the gardener  did she .      colon nodded .     yeah .  we were always a bit puzzled about that gardener .     he caught the barman   s eye .     two more pints of winkles  ron .     he glanced at nobby .  his old friend looked more dejected than he   d ever seen him .  they   d have to see this thing through together .     better make that two for nobby  too     he added .      cheers  fred .      sergeant colon   s eyebrows raised as one pint was emptied almost in one go .  nobby put the mug down a little unsteadily .      wouldn   t be so bad if there was a pot of cash     nobby said  picking up the other mug .     i thought you couldn   t be a nob without bein    a rich bugger .  i thought they gave you a big wad with one hand and banged the crown on your head with the other .  don   t make sense  bein    nobby and poor .  s   worst of both wurble .     he drained the mug and banged it down .     common    n rich  yeah  that i could hurble .      the barman leaned over to sergeant colon .     what   s up with the corporal .  he   s a half pint man .  that   s eight pints he   s had .      fred colon leaned closer and spoke out of the corner of this mouth .     keep it to yourself  ron  but it   s because he   s a peer .         is that a fact .  i   ll go and put down some fresh sawdust .          in the watch house  sam vimes prodded the matches .  he didn   t ask angua if she were sure .  angua could smell if it was wednesday .      so who were the others .     he said .     other golems .         it   s hard to tell from the tracks     said angua .     but i think so .  i   d have followed them  but i thought i ought to come right back here .         what makes you think they were golems .         the footprints .  and golems have no smell     she said .     they pick up the smells associated with whatever they   re doing .  that   s all they smell of       she thought of the wall of words .     and they had a long debate     she said .     a golem argument .  in writing .  it got pretty heated  i think .      she thought about the wall again .     some of them got quite emphatic     she added  remembering the size of some of the lettering .     if they were human  they   d have been shouting        vimes stared gloomily at the matches laid out before him .  eleven bits of wood  and a twelth broken in two .  you didn   t need to be any kind of genius to see what had been going on .     they drew lots     he said .     and dorfl lost .      he sighed .     this is getting worse     he said .     does anyone know how many golems there are in the city .         no     said carrot .     hard to find out .  no one   s made any for centuries  but they don   t wear out .         no one makes them .         it   s banned  sir .  the priests are pretty hot on that  sir .  they say it   s making life  and that   s something only gods are supposed to do .  but they put up with the ones that are still around because  well  they   re so useful .  some are walled up or in treadmills or at the bottom of shafts .  doing messy tasks  you know  in places where it   s dangerous to go .  they do all the really mucky jobs .  i suppose there could be hundreds           hundreds .     said vimes .     and now they meet secretly and make plots .  good grief .  right .  we ought to destroy the lot of them .         why .         you like the idea of them having secrets .  i mean  good grief  trolls and dwarfs  fine  even the undead are alive in a way  even if it is a bloody awful way      vimes caught angua   s eye and went on      for the most part .  but these things .  they   re just objects that do work .  it   s like having a bunch of shovels meeting for a chat .         er   there was something else  sir     said angua slowly .      in the cellar .         yes .  er   but it   s hard to explain .  it was a   feeling .      vimes shrugged noncommitally .  he   d learned not to scoff at angua   s feelings .  she always knew where carrot was  for one thing .  if she were in the watch house you could tell if he was were coming up the street by the way she turned to look at the door .      yes .         like   deep grief  sir .  terrible  terrible sadness .  er .      vimes nodded  and pinched the bridge of his nose .  it seemed to have been a long day and it was far from over yet .   he really  really needed a drink .  the world was distorted enough as it was .  when you saw it through the bottom of a glass  it all came back into focus .      have you had anything to eat today  sir .     said angua .      i had a bit of breakfast     muttered vimes .      you know that word sergeant colon uses .         what .     manky    .         that   s how you look .  if you   re staying here at least let   s have some coffee and send out for figgins .      vimes hesitated at that .  he   d always imagined that manky was how your mouth felt after three days on a regurgitated diet .  it was horrible to think that you could look like that .   angua reached for the old coffee tin that represented the watch   s tea kitty .  it was surprisingly easy to lift .      hey .  there should be at least twenty five dollars in here     she said .     nobby collected it only yesterday        she turned the tin upside down .  a very small dogend dropped out .      not even an iou .     said carrot despondently .      an iou .  this is nobby we   re talking about .         oh .  of course .          it had gone very quiet in the mended drum .  happy hour had been passed with no more than a minor fight .  now everyone was watching unhappy hour .   there was a forest of mugs in front of nobby .     i mean  i mean  what   s it worth whenallsaidandone .     he said .      you could flog it     said ron .      good point     said sergeant colon .     there   s plenty o    rich folks who   d give a sack of cash for a title .  i mean folks that   s already got the big house and that .  they   d give anything to be as nobby as you  nobby .      the ninth pint stopped half way to nobby   s lips .      could be worth thousands of dollars     said ron encouragingly .      at the very least     said colon .     they   d fight over it .         you play your cards right and you could retire on something like that     said ron .   the mug remained stationary .  various expressions fought their away around the lumps and excrescences of nobby   s face  suggesting the terrible battle within .      oh  they would  would they .     he said at last .   sergeant colon tilted unsteadily away .  there was an edge in nobby   s voice he hadn   t heard before .      then you could be rich and common just like you said     said ron  who did not have quite the same eye for mental weather changes .     posh folks   d be falling over themselves for it .         sell m    birthright for a spot of massage  is that it .     said nobby .      it   s    a pot of message        said sergeant colon .      it   s    a mess of pottage        said a bystander  anxious not to break the flow .      hah .  well  i   ll tell you     said nobby  swaying     there   s some things that can   t be sole .  hah .  hah .  who streals my prurse streals trasph  right .         yeah  it   s the trashiest looking purse i ever saw     said a voice .       what is a mess of pottage  anyway .             cos   what good   d a lot of moneneney do me  hey .      the clientele looked puzzled .  this seemed to be a question on the lines of    alcohol  is it nice .     or    hard work  do you want to do it .         what   s messy about it then .         we   ell     said a brave soul  uncertainly     you could use it to buy a big house  lots of grub and   drink and   women and that .         that   s wha    it takes to make a man happppeyey  is it .     said nobby  glassy eyed .   his fellow drinkers just stared .  this was a metaphysical maze .      well  i   ll tell you     said nobby  the swaying now so regular that he looked like a inverted pendulum     all that stuff   s nothing  nothing .  i tell you  compared to pride inna man   s linneneage   eage .         linneneageeage .     said sergeant colon .      ancescestors and that     said nobby .        t means i   ve got ancescestors and that  which   s more   n you lot   ve got .      sergeant colon choked on his pint .      everyone   s got ancestors     said the barman calmly .     otherwise they wouldn   t be here .      nobby gave him a glassy stare and tried unsuccessfully to focus .     right .     he said  eventually .     right .  only   only i   ve got more of    em  d   y   see .  the blood of bloody kings is in these veins  am i right .         temporarily     said a voice .  there was laughter  but it had an anticipatory ring to it that colon had learned to respect and fear .  it reminded him of two things      he had got only six weeks to retirement  and     it had been quite a long time since he   d been to the lavatory .   nobby delved into his pocket and pulled out a battered scroll .     y   see this .     he said  unrolling it with difficulty on the bar .     y   see it .  i   ve got a right to arm bears  me .  see here .  it says    earl     right .  that   s me .  you could  you could  you could have my head up over the door .         could be     said the barman  eyeing the crowd .      i mean  y   could change t   name o    this place  call it the earl of ankh  and i   d come in and drink here reg   lar  whaddya say .     said nobby .     news gets around an earl drinks here  business will go right up .  and i wouldn   t   n   t   n   t chargeyouapenny  howaboutit .  people   dsay  dat   s a high class pub  is that  lord de nobbes drinks there  that   s a place with a bit of tone .      someone grabbed nobby by the throat .  colon didn   t recognize the grabber .  it was just one of the scarred  ill shaven regulars whose function it was  around about this time of an evening  to start opening bottles with his teeth or  if the evening was going really well  with somebody else   s teeth .      so we ain   t good enough for you  is that what you   re saying .     the man demanded .   nobby waved his scroll .  his mouth opened to frame words like   sergeant colon just knew      unhand me  you low born oaf .      with tremendous presence of mind and absence of any kind of common sense  sergeant colon said     his lordship wants everyone to have a drink with him .          compared to the mended drum  the bucket  on gleam street  was an oasis of frigid calm .  the watch had adopted it as their own  as a silent temple to the art of getting drunk .  it wasn   t that it sold particularly good beer  because it didn   t .  but it did serve it quickly  and quietly  and gave credit .  it was one place where watchmen didn   t have to see things or be disturbed .  no one could sink alcohol in silence like a watchman who   d just come off duty after eight hours on the street .  it was as much protection as his helmet and breastplate .  the world didn   t hurt so much .   and mr .  cheese the owner was a good listener .  he listened to things like    make that a double    and    keep them coming .     he also said the right things  like    credit .  certainly  officer .     watchmen paid their tab or got a lecture from captain carrot .   vimes sat gloomily behind a glass of lemonade .  he wanted one drink  and understood precisely why he wasn   t going to have one .  one drink ended up arriving in a dozen glasses .  but knowing this didn   t make it any better .   most of the day shift were in here now  plus one or two men who were on their day off .   scummy as the place was  he liked it here .  with the buzz of other people around him  he didn   t seem to get in the way of his own thoughts .   one reason that mr .  cheese had allowed his pub to become practically the city   s fifth watch house was the protection this offered .  watchmen were quiet drinkers  on the whole .  they just went from vertical to horizontal with the minimum amount of fuss  without starting any major fights  and without damaging the fixtures overmuch .  and no one ever tried to rob him .  watchmen got really intense about having their drinking disturbed .   and he was therefore surprised when the door was flung open and three men rushed in  flourishing crossbows .      don   t nobody move .  anyone moves and they   re dead .      the robbers stopped at the bar .  to their own surprise their arrival didn   t seem to have caused much of a stir .      oh  for heaven   s sake  will someone shut that door .     growled vimes .   a watchman near the door did so .      and bolt it     vimes added .   the three thieves looked around .  as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom  they received a general impression of armorality  with strong overtones of helmetness .  but none of it was moving .  it was all watching them .      you boys new in town .     said mr .  cheese  buffing a glass .   the boldest of the three waved his bow under the barman   s nose .     all the money right now .     he screamed .     otherwise     he said  to the room in general     you   ve got a dead barman .         plenty of other bars in town  boyo     said a voice .   mr .  cheese didn   t look up from the glass he was polishing .     i know that was you  constable thighbiter     he said calmly .     there   s two dollars and thirty pence on your slate  thank you very much .      the thieves drew closer together .  bars shouldn   t act like this .  and they fancied they could hear the faint sliding noises of assorted weapons being drawn from various sheaths .      haven   t i seen you before .     said carrot .      oh gods  it   s him     moaned one of the men .     the bread thrower .         i thought mr .  ironcrust was taking you to the thieves    guild     carrot went on .      there was a bit of an argument about taxes           don   t tell him .      carrot tapped his head .     the tax forms .     he said .     i expect mr .  ironcrust is worried i   ve forgotten about them .      the thieves were now so close together they looked like a fat six armed man with a very large bill for hats .      er   watchmen aren   t allowed to kill people  right .     said one of them .      not while we   re on duty     said vimes .   the boldest of the three moved suddenly  grabbed angua and pulled her upright .     we walk out of here unharmed or the girl gets it  all right .     he snarled .   someone sniggered .      i hope you   re not going to kill anyone     said carrot .      that   s up to us .         sorry  was i talking to you .     said carrot .      don   t worry  i   ll be fine     said angua .  she looked around to make sure cheery wasn   t there  and then sighed .     come on  gentlemen  let   s get it over with .         don   t play with your food .     said a voice from the crowd .   there were one or two giggles until carrot turned in his seat  whereupon everyone was suddenly intensely interested in their drinks .      it   s ok     said angua quietly .   aware that something was out of kilter  but not quite sure what it was  the thieves edged back to the door .  no one moved as they unbolted it and  still holding angua  stepped out into the fog  shutting the door behind them .      hadn   t we better help .     said a constable who was new to the watch .      they don   t deserve help     said vimes .   there was a clank of armor and then a long  deep growl  right outside in the street .   and a scream .  and then another scream .  and a third scream modulated with    nonononononono nonono .    aarghaarghaargh .     something heavy hit the door .   vimes turned back to carrot .     you and constable angua     he said .  you   er   get along all right .         fine  sir     said carrot .      some people might think that  er  there might be  er  problems        there was a thud  and then a faint bubbling noise .      we work around them  sir     said carrot  raising his voice slightly .      i heard that her father   s not very happy about her working here           they don   t have much law up in uberwald  sir .  they think it   s for weak societies .  the baron   s not a very civic minded man .         he   s pretty bloodthirsty  from what i   ve heard .         she wants to stay in the watch  sir .  she likes meeting people .      from outside came another gurgle .  fingernails scrabbled at a windowpane .  then their owner disappeared abruptly from view .      well  it   s not for me to judge     said vimes .      no  sir .      after a few moments of silence the door opened  slowly .  angua walked in  adjusting her clothes  and sat down .  all the watchmen in the room suddenly took a second course of advanced beer study .      er       carrot began .      flesh wounds     said angua .     but one of them did shoot one of the others in the leg by accident .         i think you   d better put it in your report as    self inflicted wounds while resisting arrest        said vimes .      yes  sir     said angua .      not all of them     said carrot .      they tried to rob our bar and take a wer   angua hostage     said vimes .      oh  i see what you mean  sir     said carrot .     self inflicted .  yes .  of course .          it had gone quiet in the mended drum .  this was because it is usually very hard to be both loud and unconscious .   sergeant colon was impressed at his own cleverness .  throwing a punch could stop a fight  of course  but in this case it had a quarter of rum  gin  and sixteen chopped lemons floating in it .   some people were still upright  however .  they were the serious drinkers  who drank as if there was no tomorrow and rather hoped this would be the case .   fred colon had reached the convivial drunk stage .  he turned to the man beside him .        s good here  isn   t it     he managed .      what   m i gonna tell me wife  that   s what i want to know       moaned the man .      dunno .  say you   ve bin bin bin working late     said colon .     an    suck a peppermint before you goes home  that usually works           working late .  hah .  i   ve bin given the sack .  me .  a craftsman .  fifteen years at spadger and williams  right  and then they go bust    cos of carry undercutting    em and i get a job at carry   s and  bang  i   m out of a job there  too .     surplus to requirements .     bloody golems .  forcing real people out of a job .  what they wanna work for .  they got no mouth to feed  hah .  but the damn    thing goes at it so fast you can   t see its bloody arms movin    .         shame .         smash    em up  that   s what i say .  i mean  we had a golem at s an    w   s but ole zhlob just used to plod along  y   know  not buzz away like a blue arsed fly .  you wanna watch it  mate  they   ll have your job next .         stoneface wouldn   t stand f   r it     said colon  undulating gently .      any chance of a job with you lot  then .         dunno     said colon .  the man seemed to have become two men .     what   s it you do .         i   m a wick dipper and end teaser  mate     they said .      i can see that   s a useful trade .         here you go  fred     said the barman  tapping him on the shoulder and putting a piece of paper in front of him .  colon watched with interest as figures danced back and forth .  he tried to focus on the one at the bottom  but it was too big to take in .      what   s this  then .         his imperial lordship   s bar bill     said the barman .      don   t be daft  no one can drink that much   i   m not payin    .         i   m including breakages  mind you .         yeah .  like what .      the barman pulled a heavy hickory stick from its hiding place under the bar .     arms .  legs .  suit yourself     he said .      oh  come on  ron  you   ve known me for years .         yes  fred  you   ve always been a good customer  so what i   ll do is  i   ll let you shut your eyes first .         but that   s all the money i   ve got .      the barman grinned .     lucky one for you  eh .          cheery littlebottom leaned against the corridor wall outside her privy and wheezed .   it was something alchemists learned to do early in their career .  as her tutors had said  there were two signs of a good alchemist  the athletic and the intellectual .  a good alchemist of the first sort was someone who could leap over the bench and be on the far side of a safely thick wall in three seconds  and a good alchemist of the second sort was someone who knew exactly when to do this .   the equipment didn   t help .  she scrounged what she could from the guild  but a real alchemical laboratory should be full of the kind of glassware that looked as if it were produced during the guild of glassblowers all comers hiccuping contest .  a proper alchemist did not have to run tests using as her beaker a mug with a picture of a teddy bear on it  which corporal nobbs was probably going to be very upset about when he found it missing .   when she judged that the fumes had cleared she ventured back into her tiny room .   that was another thing .  her books on alchemy were marvelous objects  every page a work of the engraver   s art  but they nowhere contained instructions like    be sure to open a window .     they did have instructions like    adde aqua quirmis to the zinc untile rising gas yse vigorously evolved     but never added    don   t doe thys atte home    or even    and say fare thee welle to thy eyebrows .      anyway     the glassware remained innocent of the brown black sheen that  according to the compound of alchemie  would indicate arsenic in the sample .  she   d tried every type of food and drink she could find in the palace pantries  and pressed into service every bottle and jar she could discover in the watch house .   she tried one more time with what said on the packet it was sample    .  looked like a smear of cheese .  cheese .  the various fumes thronging around her head were making her slow .  she must have taken some cheese samples .  she was pretty sure sample     had been some lancre blue vein  which had reacted vigorously with the acid  blown a small hole in the ceiling and covered half the work bench with a dark green substance that was setting like tar .   she tested this one anyway .   a few minutes later she was scrabbling furiously through her notebook .  the first sample she   d taken from the pantry  one portion of duck p  t    was down here as sample    .  what about    and    .  no     had been the white clay from misbegot bridge  so what had been    .   she found it .   but that couldn   t be right .   she looked up at the glass tube .  metallic arsenic grinned back at her .   she   d retained a bit of the sample .  she could test again  but   perhaps it would be better to tell someone     she hurried along to the main office  where a troll was on duty .     where   s commander vimes .      the troll grinned .     in der gleam   littlebottom .         thank you .      the troll turned back to address a worried looking monk in a brown cassock .     and .     he said .      best if he tells it himself     said the monk .     i only work on the next bench .     he put a small jar of dust on the desk .  it had a bow tie around it .      i want to complain most emphatically     said the dust  in a shrill little voice .     i was working there only five minutes and then splash .  it   s going to take days to get back into shape .         working where .     said the troll     nonesuch ecclesiastical supplies     said the worried monk  helpfully .      holy water section     said the vampire .          you   ve found arsenic .     said vimes .      yes  sir .  lots .  the sample   s full of it .  but           well .      cheery looked at her feet .     i tried my process again with a test sample  sir  and i   m sure i   m doing it right           good .  what was it in .         that   s just it  sir .  it wasn   t in anything from the palace .  because i   d got a bit confused and tested the stuff i found under father tubelcek   s fingernails  sir .         what .         there was grease under his nails  sir  and i thought maybe it could   ve come from whoever attacked him .  off an apron or something   i   ve still got some left if you want a second opinion  sir .  i wouldn   t blame you .         why would the old man be handling poison .     said carrot .      i thought he might have scratched the murderer     said cheery .     you know   put up a fight           with the arsenic monster .     said angua .      oh  gods     said vimes .     what time is it .         bingely bingely beep bong .         oh  damn           it   s nine of the clock     said the organizer  poking its head out of vimes   s pocket .        i was unhappy because i had no shoes until i met a man with no feet .         the watchmen exchanged glances .      what .     said vimes  very carefully .      people like it if i occasionally come up with a little aphorism or inspiring thought for the day     said the imp .      so how did you meet this man with no feet .     said vimes .      i didn   t actually meet him     said the imp .     it was a general metaphorical statement .         well  that   s it  then     said vimes .     if you   d met him you could have asked him if he had any boots he didn   t have any use for .      there was a squeak as he pushed the imp back into its box .      there   s more  sir     said cheery .      go on     said vimes wearily .      and i had a careful look at the clay we found at the murder scenes     said cheery .     igneous said it had a lot of grog in it   old powdered pottery .  well   i chipped a bit of dorfl to compare and i can   t be sure but i got the iconograph demon to paint really small details and   i think there   s some clay just like his in there .  he   s got a lot of iron oxide in his clay .      vimes sighed .  all around them people were drinking alcohol .  one drink would make it all so clear .      any of you know what any of this means .     he said .   carrot and angua shook their heads .      is it supposed to make sense if we know how all the pieces fit together .     vime demanded  raising his voice .      like pieces of a jigsaw  sir .     cheery ventured .      yes .     said vimes  so loudly that the room went quiet .     now all we need is the corner bit with the piece of sky and the leaves and it   ll all be one big picture .         it   s been a long day for all of us  sir     said carrot .   vimes sagged .     ok     he said .     tomorrow   i want you  carrot  to check on the golems in the city .  if they   re up to something i want to know what it is .  and you  littlebottom   you look everywhere in the old man   s house for more arsenic .  i wish i could believe that you   ll find any .          angua had volunteered to walk littlebottom back to her lodgings .  the dwarf was surprised that the men let her do this .  after all  it   d mean that angua would then have to walk on home by herself .      aren   t you afraid .     cheery said as they walked through the damp clouds of fog .      nope .         but i imagine muggers and cut throats would be out in a fog like this .  and you said you lived in the shades .         oh  yes .  but i haven   t been bothered lately .         ah  perhaps they   re frightened of the uniform .         possibly     said angua .      probably they   ve learned respect .         you may be right .         er   excuse me   but are you and captain carrot    .      angua waited politely .         er           oh  yes     said angua  taking pity .     we   re er .  but i stay at mrs .  cake   s boarding house because you need your own space in a city like this .     and an understanding landlady sympathetic to those with special needs  she added to herself .  like doorhandles that a paw could operate  and a window left open on moonlit nights .     you   ve got to have somewhere where you can be yourself .  anyway  the watch house smells of socks .         i   m staying with my uncle armstrangler     said cheery .     it   s not very nice there .  people talk about mining most of the time .         don   t you .         there   s not a lot you can say about mining .     i mine in my mine and what   s mine is mine        said cheery in a singsong voice .     and then they go on about gold which  frankly  is a lot duller than people think .         i thought dwarfs loved gold     said angua .      they just say that to get it into bed .         are you sure you   re a dwarf .  sorry .  that was a joke .         there must be more interesting things .  hair .  clothes .  people .         good grief .  you mean girl talk .         i don   t know  i   ve never talked girl talk before     said cheery .     dwarfs just talk .         it   s like that in the watch  too .     said angua .     you can be any sex you like provided you act male .  there   s no men and women in the watch  just a bunch of lads .  you   ll soon learn the language .  basically it   s how much beer you supped last night  how strong the curry was you had afterwards  and where you were sick .  just think egotesticle .  you   ll soon get the hang of it .  and you   ll have to be prepared for sexually explicit jokes in the watch house .      cheery blushed .      mind you  that seems to have ended now     said angua .      why .  did you complain .         no  after i joined in it all seemed to stop     said angua .     and  you know  they didn   t laugh .  not even when i did the hand gestures too .  i thought that was unfair .  mind you  some of them were quite small gestures .         there   s no help for it  i   ll have to move out     sighed cheery .     i feel all   wrong .      angua looked down at the little figure trudging along beside her .  she recognized the symptoms .  everyone needed their own space  just like angua did  and sometimes that space was inside their heads .  and she liked cheery  oddly enough .  possibly it was because of her earnestness .  or the fact that she was the only person apart from carrot who didn   t look slightly frightened when they talked to her .  and that was because she didn   t know .  angua wanted to preserve that ignorance as a small precious thing  but she could tell when someone needed a little change in their lives .      we   re going quite close to elm street     she said  carefully .     just  er  drop in for a while .  i   ve got some stuff you could borrow        i won   t be needing it  she told herself .  when i go  i won   t be able to carry much .       constable downspout watched the fog .  watching was  after staying in one place  the thing he did best .  but he was also good at keeping quite still .  not making any noise whatsoever was another of his best features .  when it came to doing absolutely nothing at all he was among the finest .  but it was keeping completely motionless in one place that was his forte .  if there were a rollcall for the world   s champion non movers  he wouldn   t even turn up .   now  chin on his hands  he watched the fog .   the clouds had settled somewhat so that up here  six stories above the streets  it was possible to believe you were on a beach at the edge of a cold  moonlit sea .  the occasional tall tower or steeple rose out of the clouds  but all sounds were muffled and pulled in on themselves .  midnight came and went .   constable downspout watched  and thought about pigeons .   constable downspout had very few desires in life  and almost all of them involved pigeons .       a group of figures lurched  staggered  or in one case rolled through the fog like the four horsemen of a small apocalypse .  one had a duck  on his head  and because he was almost entirely sane except for this one strange particular he was known as the duck man .  one coughed and expectorated repeatedly  and hence was called coffin henry .  one  a legless man on a small wheeled trolley  was for no apparent reason called arnold sideways .  and the fourth  for some very good reasons indeed  was foul ole ron .   ron had a small grayish brown  torn eared terrier on the end of a string  although in truth it would be hard for an observer to know exactly who was leading whom and who  when push came to shove  would be the one to fold at the knees if the other one shouted    sit .     because  although trained canines as aids for those bereft of sight  and even of hearing  have frequently been used throughout the universe  foul ole ron was the first person ever to own a thinking brain dog .   the beggars  led by the dog  were heading for the dark arch of misbegot bridge  which they called home .  at least  one of them called it    home     the others respectively called it    haaawrk haaawrk hrraawrk ptui .         heheheh .  whoops .      and    buggrit  millennium hand and shrimp .      as they stumbled along the riverside they passed a can from hand to hand  drinking appreciatively and occasionally belching .   the dog stopped .  the beggars shunted to a halt behind it .   a figure came towards them along the riverside .      ye gods .         ptui .         whoops .      buggrit .      the beggars flung themselves against the wall as the pale figure lurched past .  it was clutching at its head as if trying to lift itself off the ground by its ears  and then occasionally banging its head against nearby buildings .   while they watched  it pulled a metal mooring post out of the cobbles and started to hit itself over the head .  eventually the cast iron shattered .   the figure dropped the stub  flung back its head  opened a mouth from which red light spilled  and roared like a bull in distress .  then it staggered on into the darkness .      there   s that golem again     said the duck man .     the white one .         heheh  i gets heads like that myself  some mornings     said arnold sideways .      i knows about golems     said coffin henry  spitting expertly and hitting a beetle climbing the wall twenty feet away .     they ain   t s   posed to have a voice .         buggrit     said foul ole ron .     dang the twigger f   r   a bang at the fusel  and shrimp     cos the worm   s on the other boot .  see if he don   t .         he meant it   s the same one we saw the other day     said the dog .     after that ole priest got topped .         do you think we should tell someone .     said the duck man .   the dog shook its head .     nah     it said .     we got a cushy number down here  no sense in spoiling it .      the five of them staggered on into the damp shadows .      i hate bloody golems  takin    our jobs           we ain   t got jobs .         see what i mean .         what   s for supper .         mud and ole boots .  hrraawrk ptui .         millennium hand and shrimp  i sez .            m glad i   ve got a voice .  i can speak up for myself .         it   s time you fed your duck .         what duck .          the fog glowed and sizzled around five and seven yard .  flames roared up and all but set the thick clouds alight .  spitting liquid iron cooled in its moulds .  hammers rang out around the workshops .  the ironmasters didn   t work by the clock  but by the more demanding physics of molten metal .  even though it was nearly midnight  stronginthearm   s iron founders  beaters and general forging was still bustling .   there were many stronginthearms in ankh morpork .  it was a very common dwarf name .  that had been a major consideration for thomas smith when he   d adopted it by official deed poll .  the scowling dwarf holding a hammer which adorned his sign was a mere figment of the signpainter   s imagination .  people thought    dwarfmade    was better  and thomas smith had decided not to argue .   the committee for equal heights had objected but things had mired somewhat because  firstly  most of the actual committee was human  since dwarfs were generally too busy to worry about that sort of thing   and in any case their position hinged on pointing out that mr .  stronginthearm n  e smith was too tall  which was clearly a sizeist discrimination and technically illegal under the committee   s own rules .   in the meantime thomas had let his beard grow  wore an iron helmet if he thought anyone official was around  and put up his prices by twenty pence on the dollar .   the drop hammers thumped  all in a row  powered by the big ox treadmill .  there were swords to beat out and panels to be shaped .  sparks erupted .   stronginthearm took off his helmet  the committee had been around again  and wiped the inside .      dibbuk .  where the hell are you .      a sensation of filled space made him turn .  the foundry   s golem was standing a few inches behind him  the forge light glowing on his dark red clay .      i told you not to do that  didn   t i .     stronginthearm shouted above the din .   the golem held up its slate .   yes .      you   ve gone and done all your holy day stuff .  you were away too long .      sorrow .      well  now you   re back with us  go and take over on number three hammer and send mr .  vincent up to my office  right .      yes .   stronginthearm climbed the stairs to his office .  he turned at the top to look back across the redlit foundry floor .  he saw dibbuk walk over to the hammer and hold up a slate for the foreman .  he saw vincent the foreman walk away .  he saw dibbuk take the sword blank than was being shaped and hold it in place for a few blows  then hurl it aside .   stronginthearm hurried back down the steps .   when he was half way down dibbuk had laid his head on the anvil .   when stronginthearm reached the bottom the hammer struck for the first time .   when he was half way across the ash crusted floor  other workers scurrying after him  the hammer struck for the second time .   as he reached dibbuk the hammer struck for the third time .   the glow faded in the golem   s eyes .  a crack appeared across the impassive face .   the hammer went back up for the fourth time     duck .     screamed stronginthearm      and then there was nothing but pottery .   when the thunder had died away  the foundry master got to his feet and brushed himself off .  dust and wreckage were strewn across the floor .  the hammer had jumped its bearings and was lying by the anvil in a heap of golem shards .   stronginthearm gingerly picked up a piece of a foot  tossed it aside  and then reached down again and pulled a slate out of the wreckage .   he read       the old men helped us .   thou shalt not kill .   clay of my clay .   shame  sorrow .       his foreman looked over stronginthearm   s shoulder .     what did it go and do that for .         how should i know .     snapped stronginthearm .      i mean  it brought the tea round this afternoon as normal as anything .  then it went off for a coupla hours  and now this        stronginthearm shrugged .  a golem was a golem and that was all there was to it  but the recollection of that bland face positioning itself under the giant hammer had shaken him .      i heard the other day the sawmill in dimwell street wouldn   t mind selling the one it   s got     said the foreman .     it sawed up a mahogany trunk into matchsticks  or something .  you want i should go and have a word .      stronginthearm looked at the slate again .   dibbuk had never been very wordy .  he   d carry red hot iron  hammer sword blanks with his fists  clean out clinkers from a smelter still too hot for a man to touch   and never say a word .  of course  he couldn   t say any words  but dibbuk had always given the impression that there were none he   d particularly wanted to say in any case .  he just worked .  these were the most words he   d ever written at any one time .   they spoke to stronginthearm of black distress  and a mind that would have been screaming if it could only have uttered a sound .  which was daft .  the things couldn   t commit suicide .      boss .     said the foreman .     i said  you want me to get another one .      stronginthearm skimmed the slate away and  with a feeling of relief  watched it shatter against the wall .     no     he said .     just clear this thing up .  and get the bloody hammer fixed .          sergeant colon  after some considerable effort  managed to get his head higher than the gutter .      you   you all right  corporal lord de nobbes .     he mumbled .      dunno  fred .  whose face is this .            s mine  nobby .         thank gods for that  i thought it was me        colon fell back .     we   re lyin    in the gutter  nobby     he moaned .     ooo .         we   re all lyin    in the gutter  fred .  but some of us   re lookin    at the stars           well  i   m lookin    at your face  nobby .  stars   d be a lot better  believe you me .  c   mon        with several false starts they both managed to get upright  mainly by pulling themselves up one another .      where   re   re   re we  nobby .            m sure we left the drum      ve i got a sheet over m   head .         it   s the fog  nobby .         what about these legs down here .         i reckon them   s your legs  nobby .  i   ve got mine .         right .  right .  ooo   i reckon i drunk a lot  sarge .         drunk as a lord  eh .      nobby reached gingerly up to his helmet .  someone had put a paper coronet around it .  his questing hand found a dog end behind his ear .   it was that unpleasant hour of the drinking day when  after a few hours    quality gutter time  you   re beginning to feel the retribution of sobriety while still being drunk enough to make it worse .      how   d we get here  sarge .      colon started to scratch his head and stopped because of the noise .      i reckon       he said  winnowing the frazzled shreds of his short term memory     i   reckon   seems to me there was something about stormin    the palace and demandin    your birthright        nobby choked and spat out the cigarette .     we didn   t do that  did we .         you was shouting we ought to do it           oh  gods       moaned nobby .      but i reckon you threw up around that time .         that   s a relief  anyway .         well   it was all over grabber hoskins .  but he tripped over someone before he could get us .      colon suddenly patted his pockets .     and i   ve still got the tea money     he said .  another cloud of memory scudded across the sunshine of oblivion .     well   three pennies of it        the urgency of this got through to nobby .     thruppence .         yeah  well   after you started orderin    all them expensive drinks for the whole bar   well  you din   t have no money and it was either me payin    for them or       colon moved his finger across his throat and went     kssssh .         you tellin    me we paid for happy hour in the drum .         not so much happy hour     said colon miserably .     more sort of ecstatic one hundred and fifty minutes .  i didn   t even know you could buy gin in pints .      nobby tried to focus on the fog .     no one can drink gin by the pint  sarge .         that   s what i kept sayin     and would you listen .      nobby sniffed .     we   re close to the river     he said .     let   s try to get        something roared  very close by .  it was long and low  like a foghorn in serious distress .  it was the sound you might hear from a cattleyard on a nervous night  and it went on and on  and then stopped so abruptly it caught the silence unawares .         far away from that as we can     said nobby .  the sound had done the work of an ice cold shower and about two pints of black coffee .   colon spun around .  he desperately needed something that would do the work of a laundry .     where did it come from .     he said .      it was   over there  wasn   t it .         i thought it was that way .      in the fog  all directions were the same     i think       said colon  slowly     that we ort to go and make a report about this as soon as possible .         right     said nobby .     which way .         let   s just run  eh .          constable downspout   s huge pointy ears quivered as the noise boomed over the city .  he turned his head carefully  triangulating for height  direction  and distance .  and then he remembered it .       the cry was heard in the watch house  but muffled by the fog .   it entered the open head of the golem dorfl and bounced around inside  echoing down  down among the small cracks in the clay until  at the very edge of perception  little grains danced together .   the sightless sockets stared at the wall .  no one heard the cry that came back from the dead skull  because there was no mouth to utter it and not even a mind to guide it  but it screamed out into the night   clay of my clay  thou shalt not kill .  thou shalt not die .       samuel vimes dreamed about clues .   he had a jaundiced view of clues .  he instinctively distrusted them .  they got in the way .   and he distrusted the kind of person who   d take one look at another man and say in a lordly voice to his companion     ah  my dear sir  i can tell you nothing except that he is a left handed stonemason who has spent some years in the merchant navy and has recently fallen on hard times     and then unroll a lot of supercilious commentary about calluses and stance and the state of a man   s boots  when exactly the same comments could apply to a man who was wearing his old clothes because he   d been doing a spot of home bricklaying for a new barbecue pit  and had been tattooed once when he was drunk and seventeen  and in fact got seasick on a wet pavement .  what arrogance .  what an insult to the rich and chaotic variety of the human experience .   it was the same with more static evidence .  the footprints in the flowerbed were probably in the real world left by the window cleaner .  the scream in the night was quite likely a man getting out of bed and stepping sharply on an upturned hairbrush .   the real world was far too real to leave neat little hints .  it was full of too many things .  it wasn   t by eliminating the impossible that you got at the truth  however improbable  it was by the much harder process of eliminating the possibilities .  you worked away  patiently asking questions and looking hard at things .  you walked and talked  and in your heart you just hoped like hell that some bugger   s nerve   d crack and he   d give himself up .   the events of the day clanged together in vimes   s head .  golems tramped like sad shadows .  father tubelcek waved at him and then his head exploded  showering vimes in words .  mr .  hopkinson lay dead in his own oven  a slice of dwarf bread in his mouth .  and the golems marched on  silently .  there was dorfl  dragging its foot  its head open for the words to fly in and out of  like a swarm of bees .  and in the middle of it all arsenic danced  a spiky little green man  crackling and gibbering .   at one point he thought one of the golems screamed .   after that  the dream faded  a bit at a time .  golems .  oven .  words .  priest .  dorfl .  golems marching  the thudding of their feet making the whole dream pulsate     vimes opened his eyes .   beside him  lady ramkin said     wsfgl     and turned over .   someone was hammering at the front door .  still muzzy  head swimming  vimes pulled himself up on his elbows and said  to the night time world in general     what sort of a time do you call this .         bingeley bingeley beep .     said a cheerful voice from the direction of vimes   s dressing table .      oh  please           twenty nine minutes and thirty one seconds past five ay emm .  a penny saved is a penny earned .  would you like me to present your schedule for today .  while i am doing this  why not take some time to fill out your registration card .         what .  what .  what   re are you talking about .      the knocking continued .   vimes fell out of bed and groped in the dark for the matches .  he finally got a candle alight and half ran  half staggered down the long stairs and into the hall .   the knocker turned out to be constable visit .      it   s lord vetinari  sir .  it   s worse this time .         has anyone sent for doughnut jimmy .         yessir .      at this time of day the fog was fighting a rearguard action against the dawn  and made the whole world look as though it were inside a ping pong ball .      i poked my head in as soon as i came on shift and he was out like a light  sir .         how did you know he wasn   t asleep .         on the floor  sir  with all his clothes on .      a couple of watchmen had put the patrician on his bed by the time vimes arrived  slightly out of breath and with his knees aching .  gods  he thought as he struggled up the stairs  it   s not like the old truncheon and bell days .  you wouldn    think twice about running half way across the city  coppers and criminals locked in hot pursuit .   with a mixture of pride and shame he added  and none of the buggers ever caught me  either .   the patrician was still breathing  but his face was waxy and he looked as though death might be an improvement .   vimes   s gaze roamed the room .  there was a familiar haze in the air .      who opened the window .     he demanded .      i did  sir     said visit .     just before i went to get you .  he looked as though he needed some fresh air           it   d be fresher if you left the window shut     said vimes .     ok  i want everyone  i mean everyone  who was in this place overnight rounded up and down in the hall in two minutes .  and someone fetch corporal littlebottom .  and tell captain carrot .      i   m worried and confused  he thought .  so the first rule in the book is to spread it around .   he prowled about the room .  it didn   t take much intelligence to see that vetinari had got up and moved over to his writing desk  where by the look of it he had worked for some time .  the candle had burned right down .  an inkwell had been overturned  presumably when he   d slipped off the chair .   vimes dipped a finger in the ink and sniffed it .  then he reached for the quill pen beside it  hesitated  took out his dagger  and lifted the long feather gingerly .  there seemed to be no cunning little barbs on it  but he put it carefully on one side for littlebottom to examine later .   he glanced down at the paper vetinari had been working on .   to his surprise it wasn   t writing at all  but a careful drawing .  it showed a striding figure  except that the figure was not one person at all but made up of hundreds or thousands of smaller figures .  the effect was like one of the wicker men built by some of the more outlandish tribes near the hub  when they annually celebrated the great cycle of nature and their reverence for life by piling as much of it as possible in a great heap and setting fire to it .   the composite man was wearing a crown .   vimes pushed the sheet of paper aside and returned his attention to the desk .  he brushed the surface carefully for any suspicious splinters .  he crouched down and examined the underside .   the light was growing outside .  vimes went into both the rooms alongside and made sure their drapes were open  then went back into vetinari   s room  closed the curtains and the doors  and sidled along the walls looking for any tell tale speck of light that might indicate a small hole .   where could you stop .  splinters in the floor .  blowpipes through the keyhole .   he opened the curtains again .   vetinari had been on the mend yesterday .  and now he looked worse .  someone had got to him in the night .  how .  slow poison was the devil of a thing .  you had to find a way of giving it to the victim every day .   no  you didn   t   what was elegant was finding a way of getting him to administer it to himself every day .   vimes rummaged through the paperwork .  vetinari had obviously felt well enough to get up and walk over here  but here was where he had collapsed .   you couldn   t poison a splinter or a nail because he wouldn   t keep on nicking himself     there was a book half buried in the papers  but it had a lot of bookmarks in it  mostly torn bits of old letters .   what did he do every day .   vimes opened the book .  every page was covered with handwritten symbols .   you have to get a poison like arsenic into the body .  it isn   t enough to touch it .  or is it .  is there a kind of arsenic you can pick up through the skin .   no one was getting in .  vimes was almost certain of that .   the food and drink were probably all right  but he   d get detritus to go and have another one of his little talks with the cooks in any case .   something he breathed .  how could you keep that up day after day without arousing suspicion somewhere .  anyway .  you   d have to get your poison into the room .   something already in the room .  cheery had a different carpet put down and replaced the bed .  what else could you do .  strip the paint from the ceiling .   what had vetinari told cheery about poisoning .     you put it where no one will look at all        vimes realized he was still staring at the book .  there wasn   t anything there that he could recognize .  it must be a code of some sort .  knowing vetinari  it wouldn   t be crackable by anyone in a normal frame of mind .   could you poison a book .  but   so what .  there were other books .  you   d have to know he   d look at this one  continuously .  and even then you   d have to get the poison into him .  a man might prick his finger once  and after that he   d take care .   it sometimes worried vimes  the way he suspected everything .  if you started wondering whether a man could be poisoned by words  you might as well accuse the wallpaper of driving him mad .  mind you  that horrible green color would drive anyone insane        bingely beepy bleep .         oh  no           this is your six ay emm wake up call .  good morning .  .  here are your appointments for today  insert name here .  .  ten ay emm           shut up .  listen  whatever   s in my diary for today is definitely not        vimes stopped .  he lowered the box .   he went back to the desk .  if you assumed one page per day     lord vetinari had a very good memory .  but everyone wrote things down  didn   t they .  you couldn   t remember every little thing .  wednesday    p . m .   reign of terror       p . m .   clean out scorpion pit     he held the organizer up to his lips .     take a memo     he said .      hooray .  go right ahead .  don   t forget to say    memo    first .  .         speak to   blast   memo  what about vetinari   s journal .         is that it .         yes .      someone knocked politely at the door .  vimes opened it carefully .     oh  it   s you  littlebottom .      vimes blinked .  something wasn   t right about the dwarf .      i   ll mix up some of mr .  doughnut   s jollop right away  sir .     the dwarf looked past vimes to the bed .     ooo   he doesn   t look good  does he    .         get someone to move him into a different bedroom     said vimes .     get the servants to prepare a new room  right .         yes  sir .         and  after they   ve done it  pick a different room at random and move him into it .  and change everything  understand .  every stick of furniture  every vase  every rug           er   yes  sir .      vimes hesitated .  now he could put his finger on what had been bothering him for the last twenty seconds .      littlebottom           sir .         you   er   you   on your ears .         earrings  sir     said cheery nervously .     constable angua gave them to me .         really .  er   right   i didn   t think dwarfs wore jewelry  that   s all .         we   re known for rings  sir .         yes  of course .     rings  yes .  no one quite like a dwarf for forging a magical ring .  but   magical earrings .  oh  well .  there were some waters too deep to wade .       sergeant detritus   s approach to these matters was almost instinctively correct .  he had the palace staff lined up in front of him and was shouting at them at the top of his voice .   look at old detritus  vimes thought as he went down the stairs .  just your basic thick troll a few years ago  now a valuable member of the watch provided you get him to repeat his orders back to you to make sure he understands you .  his armor gleams even brighter than carrot   s because he doesn   t get bored with polishing .  and he   s mastered policing as it is practiced by the majority of forces in the universe  which is  basically  screaming angrily at people until they give in .  the only reason that he   s not a one troll reign of terror is the ease with which his thought processes can be derailed by anyone who tries something fiendishly cunning  like an outright denial .      i know you all done it .     he was shouting .     if the person wot done it does not own up der whole staff  an    i means this  der whole staff will be locked up in der tanty also we throws der key away .     he pointed a finger at a stout scullery maid .     it was you wot done it  own up .         no .      detritus paused .  then     where was you last night .  own up .         in bed  of course .         aha  dat a likely story  own up  dat where you always is at night .         of course .         aha  own up  you got witnesses .         sauce .         ah  so you got no witnesses  you done it then  own up .         no .         oh           all right  all right .  thank you  sergeant .  that will be all for now     said vimes  patting him on the shoulder .     are all the staff here .      he glared at the line up .     well .  are you all here .      there was a certain amount of reluctant shuffling among the ranks  and then someone cautiously put up a hand .     mildred easy hasn   t been seen since yesterday     said its owner .     she   s the upstairs maid .  a boy came with a message .  she had to go off to see her family .      vimes felt the faintest of prickles on the back of his neck .     anyone know why .     he said .      dunno  sir .  she left all her stuff .         all right .  sergeant  before you go off shift  get someone to find her .  then go and get some sleep .  the rest of you  go and get on with whatever it is you do .  ah   mr .  drumknott .      the patrician   s personal clerk  who   d been watching detritus   s technique with a horrified expression  looked up .     yes  commander .         what   s this book .  is it his lordship   s diary .      drumknott took the book .     it looks like it  certainly .         have you been able to crack the code .         i didn   t know it was in code  commander .         what .  you   ve never looked at it .         why should i  sir .  it   s not mine .         you do know his last secretary tried to kill him .         yes  sir  i ought to say  sir  that i have already been exhaustively interrogated by your men .     drumknott opened the book and raised his eyebrows .      what did they say .     said vimes .   drumknott looked up thoughtfully .     let me see  now      it was you wot done it  own up  everybody seen you  we got lots of people say you done it  you done it all right didn   t you  own up .     that was  i think  the general approach .  and then  like the scullery maid just now  i said it wasn   t me and that seemed to puzzle the officer concerned .      drumknott delicately licked his finger and turned a page .   vimes stared at him .       the sound of saws was brisk on the morning air .  captain carrot knocked against the timber yard door  which was eventually opened .      good morning  sir .     he said .     i understand you have a golem here .         had     said the timber merchant .      oh dear  another one     said angua .   that made four so far .  the one in the foundry had knelt under a hammer  the one in the stonemason   s yard was now ten clay toes sticking out from under a two ton block of limestone  one working in the docks had last been seen in the river  striding towards the sea  and now this one        it was weird     said the merchant  thumping the golem   s chest .     sidney said it went on sawing all the way up to the moment it sawed its head right off .  i   ve got a load of ash planking got to go out this afternoon .  who   s going to saw it up  may i ask .      angua picked up the golem   s head .  insofar as it had any expression at all  it was one of intense concentration .         ere     said the merchant     alf told me he heard in the drum last night that golems have been murderin    people           enquiries are continuing     said carrot .     now then  mr    .  it   s preble skink  isn   t it .  your brother runs the lamp oil shop in cable street .  and your daughter is a maid at the university .      the man looked astonished .  but carrot knew everyone .     yeah           did your golem leave the yard yesterday evening .         well  yeah  early on   something about a holy day .     he looked nervously from one to the other .     you got to let them go  otherwise the words in their heads           and then it came back and worked all night .         yeah .  what else would it do .  and then alf came in on early turn and he said it came up outa the saw pit  stood there for a moment  and then           was it sawing pine logs yesterday .     said angua .      that   s right .  where   m i going to get another golem at short notice  may i ask .         what   s this .     said angua .  she picked up a wood framed square from a heap of sawdust .     this was its slate  was it .     she handed it to carrot .         thou shalt not kill        carrot read slowly .        clay of my clay .  ashamed .     do you have any idea why it   d write that .         search me     said skink .     they   re always doing dumb things .     he brightened up a bit .     hey  perhaps it went potty .  get it .  clay   pot   potty .         extremely funny     said carrot gravely .     i will take this as evidence .  good morning .         why did you ask about pine logs .     he said to angua as they stepped outside .      i smelled the same pine resin in the cellar .         pine resin   s just pine resin  isn   t it .         no .  not to me .  that golem was in there .         they all were     sighed carrot .     and now they   re committing suicide .         you can   t take life you haven   t got     said angua .      what shall we call it  then .        destruction of property    .     said carrot .     anyway  we can   t ask them now       he tapped the slate .     they   ve given us the answers     he said .     perhaps we can find out what the questions should have been .             what do you mean     nothing    .     said vimes .     it   s got to be the book .  he licks his fingers to turn a page  and every day he gets a little dose of arsenic .  fiendishly clever .         sorry  sir     said cheery  backing away .     i can   t find a trace .  i   ve used all the tests i know .         you   re sure .         i could send it up to the unseen university .  they   ve built a new morphic resonator in the high energy magic building .  magic would easily           don   t do that     said vimes .     we   ll keep the wizards out of this .  damn .  for half an hour there i really thought i   d got it        he sat down at his desk .  something new was odd about the dwarf  but again he couldn   t quite work out what it was .      we   re missing something here  littlebottom     he said .      yes  sir .         let   s look at the facts .  if you want to poison someone slowly you   ve either got to give them small doses all the time   or  at least  every day .  we   re covered everything the patrician does .  it can   t be the air in the room   you and i have been in there every day .  it   s not the food  we   re pretty sure of that .  is something stinging him .  can you poison a wasp .  what we need              scuse me  sir .      vimes turned .      detritus .  i thought you were off duty .         i got dem to give me der address of dat maid called easy like you said     said detritus  stoically .     i went up dere and dere was people all lookin    in .         what d   you mean .         neighbors and dat .  cryin    women all round    der door .  an    i remember what you said about dat dipplo word           diplomacy     said vimes .      yeah .  not shoutin    at people an    dat .  i fought  dis look a delicate situation .  also  dey was throwin    stuff at me .  so i came back here .  i writ down der address .  an    now i   m goin    home .     he saluted  rocked slightly from the force of the blow to the side of his head  and departed .      thanks  detritus     said vimes .  he looked at the paper written in the troll   s big round hand .       st floor back     cockbill street     he said .     good grief .         you know it  sir .         should .  i was born in that street     said vimes .     it   s down below the shades .  easy   easy   yes   now i remember .  there was a mrs .  easy down the road .  skinny woman .  did a lot of sewing .  big family .  well  we were all big families   it was the only way to keep warm        he frowned at the paper .  it wasn   t as if it were any particular lead .  maidservants were always going off to see their mothers  every time there was the least little family upset .  what was it his granny had used to say .     yer son   s yer son till he takes a wife  but yer daughter   s yer daughter all yer life .     sending a watchman around would almost certainly be a waste of everyone   s time        well  well   cockbill street     he said .  he stared at the paper again .  you might as well rename the place memory lane .  no  you couldn   t waste watch resources on a wild goose chase like that .  but he might look in .  on his way past .  some time today .      er   littlebottom .         sir .         on your   your lips .  red .  er .  on your lips           lipstick  sir .         oh   er .  lipstick .  fine .  lipstick .         constable angua gave it to me  sir .         that was kind of her     said vimes .     i expect .          it was called the rats chamber .  in theory this was because of the decoration  some former resident of the palace had thought that a fresco of dancing rats would be a real decorative coup .  there was a pattern of rats woven in the carpet .  on the ceiling rats danced in a circle  their tails intertwining at the centre .  after half an hour in that room  most people wanted a wash .   soon  then  there would be a big rush on the hot water .  the room was filling up fast .   by common consent the chair was taken and amply filled by mrs .  rosemary palm  head of the guild of seamstresses   as one of the most senior guild leaders .      quiet  please .  gentlemen .      the noise level subsided a little .      dr .  downey .     she said .   the head of the assassins    guild nodded .     my friends  i think we are all aware of the situation      he began .      yeah  so   s your accountant .     said a voice in the crowd .  there was a ripple of nervous laughter but it didn   t last long  because you don   t laugh too loud at someone who knows exactly how much you   re worth dead .   dr .  downey smiled .     i can assure you once again  gentlemen   and ladies   that i am aware of no engagement regarding lord vetinari .  in any case  i cannot imagine that an assassin would use poison in this case .  his lordship spent some time at the assassins    school .  he knows the uses of caution .  no doubt he will recover .         and if he doesn   t .     said mrs .  palm .      no one lives forever     said dr .  downey  in the calm voice of a man who personally knew this to be true .     then  no doubt  we   ll get a new ruler .      the room went very silent .   the word    who .     hovered silently above every head .      thing is   the thing is       said gerhardt sock  head of the butchers    guild     it   s been   you   ve got to admit it   it   s been   well  think about some of the others        the words    lord snapcase  now   at least this one isn   t actually insane    flickered in the group consciousness .      i have to admit     said mrs .  palm     that under vetinari it has certainly been safer to walk the streets           you should know  madam     said mr .  sock .  mrs .  palm gave him an icy look .  there were a few sniggers .      i meant that a modest payment to the thieves    guild is all that is required for perfect safety     she finished .      and  indeed  a man may visit a house of ill           negotiable hospitality     said mrs .  palm quickly .      aye indeed  and be quite confident of not waking up stripped stark naked and beaten black and blue     said sick .      unless his tastes run that way     said mrs .  palm .     we aim to give satisfaction .  very accurately  if required .         life has certainly been more reliable under vetinari     said mr .  potts of the bakers    guild .      he does have all street theater players and mime artists thrown into the scorpion pit     said mr .  boggis of the thieves    guild .      true .  but let   s not forget that he has his bad points too .  the man is capricious .         you think so .  compared to the ones we had before he   s as reliable as a rock .         snapcase was reliable     said mr .  sock gloomily .     remember when he made his horse a city councilor .         you   ve got to admit it wasn   t a bad councilor .  compared to some of the others .         as i recall  the others at that time were a vase of flowers  a heap of sand  and three people who had been beheaded .         remember all those fights .  all the little gangs of thieves fighting all the time .  it got so that there was hardly any energy left to actually steal things     said mr .  boggis .      things are indeed more   reliable now .      silence descended again .  that was it  wasn   t it .  things were    reliable    now .  whatever else you said about old vetinari  he made sure today was always followed by tomorrow .  if you were murdered in your bed  at least it would be by arrangement .      things were more exciting under lord snapcase     someone ventured .      yes  right up until the point when your head fell off .         the trouble is     said mr .  boggis     that the job makes people mad .  you take some chap who   s no worse than any of us and after a few months he   s talking to moss and having people flayed alive .         vetinari isn   t mad .         depends how you look at it .  no one can be as sane as he is without being mad .         i am only a weak woman     said mrs .  palm  to the personal disbelief of several present     but it does seem to me that there   s an opportunity here .  either there   s a long struggle to sort out a successor  or we sort it out now .  yes .      the guild leaders tried to look at one another while simultaneously avoiding everyone else   s glances .  who   d be patrician now .  once there   d have been a huge multisided struggle  but now .      you got the power  but you got the problems  too .  things had changed .  these days  you had to negotiate and juggle with all the conflicting interests .  no one sane had tried to kill vetinari for years  because the world with him in it was just preferable to one without him .   besides   vetinari had tamed ankh morpork .  he   d tamed it like a dog .  he   d taken a minor scavenger among scavengers and lengthened its teeth and strengthened its jaws and built up its muscles and studded its collar and fed it lean steak and then he   d aimed it at the throat of the world .   he   d taken all the gangs and squabbling groups and made them see that a small slice of the cake on a regular basis was better by far than a bigger slice with a dagger in it .  he   d made them see that it was better to take a small slice but enlarge the cake .   ankh morpork  alone of all the cities of the plains  had opened its gates to dwarfs and trolls  alloys are stronger  as vetinari had said  .  it had worked .  they made things .  often they made trouble  but mostly they made wealth .  as a result  although ankh morpork still had many enemies  those enemies had to finance their armies with borrowed money .  most of it was borrowed from ankh morpork  at punitive interest .  there hadn   t been any really big wars for years .  ankh morpork had made them unprofitable .   thousands of years ago the old empire had enforced the pax morporkia  which had said to the world     do not fight  or we will kill you .     the pax had arisen again  but this time it said     if you fight  we   ll call in your mortgages .  and incidentally  that   s my pike you   re pointing at me .  i paid for that shield you   re holding .  and take my helmet off when you speak to me  you horrible little debtor .      and now the whole machine  which whirred away so quietly that people had forgotten it was a machine at all and thought that it was just the way the world worked  had given a lurch .   the guild leaders examined their thoughts and decided that what they did not want was power .  what they wanted was that tomorrow should be pretty much like today .      there   s the dwarfs     said mr .  boggis .     even if one of us   not that i   m saying it would be one of us  of course   even if someone took over  what about the dwarfs .  we get someone like snapcase again  there   s going to be chopped kneecaps in the streets .         you   re not suggesting we have some sort of   vote  are you .  some kind of popularity contest .         oh  no .  it   s just   it   s just   all more complicated now .  and power goes to people   s heads .         and then other people   s heads fall off .         i wish you wouldn   t keep on saying that  whoever you are     said mrs .  palm .     anyone would think you   d had your head cut off .         uh           oh  it   s you  mr .  slant .  i do apologize .         speaking as the president of the guild of lawyers     said mr .  slant  the most respected zombie in ankh morpork     i must recommend stability in this matter .  i wonder if i may offer some advice .         how much will it cost us .     said mr .  sock .      stability     said mr .  slant     equals monarchy .         oh  now  don   t tell us           look at klatch     said mr .  slant doggedly .     generations of seriphs .  result  political stability .  take pseudopolis .  or sto lat .  or even the agatean empire           come on     said dr .  downey .     everyone knows that kings           oh  monarchs come and go  they depose one another  and so on and so forth     said mr .  slant .     but the institution goes on .  besides  i think you   ll find that it is possible to work out   an accommodation .      he realized that he had the floor .  his fingers absentmindedly touched the seam where his head had been sewn back on .  all those years ago mr .  slant had refused to die until he had been paid for the disbursements in the matter of conducting his own defense .      how do you mean .     said mr .  potts .   i accept that the question of resurrecting the ankh morpork succession has been raised several times recently     said mr .  slant .      yes .  by madmen     said mr .  boggis .     it   s part of the symptoms .  put underpants on head  talk to trees  drool  decide that ankh morpork needs a king           exactly .  supposing sane men were to give it consideration .         go on     said dr .  downey .      there have been precedents     said mr .  slant .     monarchies who have found themselves bereft of a convenient monarch have   obtained one .  some suitably born member of some other royal line .  after all  what is required is someone who  uh  knows the ropes  as i believe the saying goes .         sorry .  are you saying we send out for a king .     said mr .  boggis .     we put up some kind of advertisement .     throne vacant  applicant must supply own crown    .         in fact     said mr .  slant  ignoring this     i recall that  during the first empire  genua wrote to ankh morpork and asked to be sent one of our generals to be their king  their own royal lines having died out through interbreeding so intensively that the last king kept trying to breed with himself .  the history books say that we sent our loyal general tacticus  whose first act after obtaining the crown was to declare war on ankh morpork .  kings are   interchangeable .         you mentioned something about reaching an accommodation     said mr .  boggis .     you mean  we tell a king what to do .         i like the sound of that     said mrs .  palm .      i like the echoes     said dr .  downey .      not tell     said mr .  slant .     we   agree .  obviously  as king  he would concentrate on those things traditionally associated with kingship           waving     said mr .  sock .      being gracious     said mrs .  palm .      welcoming ambassadors from foreign countries     said mr .  potts .      shaking hands .         cutting off heads           no .  no .  no  that will not be part of his duties .  minor affairs of state will be carried out           by his advisors .     said dr .  downey .  he leaned back .     i   m sure i can see where this is going  mr .  slant     he said .     but kings  once acquired  are so damn    hard to get rid of .  acceptably .         there have been precedents for that  too     said mr .  slant .   the assassin   s eyes narrowed .      i   m intrigued  mr .  slant  that as soon as the lord vetinari appears to be seriously ill  you pop up with suggestions like this .  it sounds like   a remarkable coincidence .         there is no mystery  i assure you .  destiny works its course .  surely many of you have heard the rumors   that there is  in this city  someone with a bloodline traceable all the way back to the last royal family .  someone working in this very city in a comparatively humble position .  a lowly watchman  in fact .      there were some nods  but not very definite ones .  they were to nods what a grunt is to    yes .     the guilds all picked up information .  no one wanted to reveal how much  or how little  they personally knew  just in case they knew too little or  even worse  turned out to know too much .   however  doc pseudopolis of the guild of gamblers put on a careful poker face and said     yes  but the tricentennial is coming up .  and in a few years it   ll be the century of the rat .  there   s something about centuries that gives people a kind of fever .         nevertheless  the person exists     said mr .  slant .     the evidence stares one in the face if one looks in the right places .         very well     said mr .  boggis     tell us the name of this captain .     he often lost large sums at poker .      captain .     said mr .  slant .     i   m sorry to say his natural talents have thus far not commended him to that extent .  he is a corporal .  corporal c .  w .  st .  j .  nobbs .      there was silence .   and then there was a strange putt putting sound  like water negotiating its way through a partially blocked pipe .   queen molly of the beggars    guild had so far been silent apart from occasional damp sucking noises as she tried to dislodge a particle of her lunch from the things which  because they were still in her mouth and apparently attached  were technically her teeth .   now she was laughing .  the hairs wobbled on every wart .     nobby nobbs .     she said .     you   re talking about nobby nobbs .         he is the last known descendant of the earl of ankh  who could trace his descent all the way to a distant cousin to the last king     said mr .  slant .     it   s the talk of the city .         a picture forms in my mind     said dr .  downey .     small monkey like chap  always smoking very short cigarettes .  spotty .  he squeezes them in public .         that   s nobby .     queen molly chuckled .     face like a blind carpenter   s thumb .         him .  but the man   s a tit .         and dim as a penny candle     said mr .  boggis .     i don   t see        suddenly he stopped  and then contracted the contemplative silence that was gradually affecting everyone else around the table .      don   t see why we shouldn   t   give this   due consideration     he said  after a while .   the assembled leaders looked at the table .  then they looked at the ceiling .  then they studiously avoided one another   s gaze .      blood will out     said mr .  carry .      when i   ve watched him go down the street i   ve always thought     there   s a man who walks in greatness        said mrs .  palm .      he squeezes them in a very regal way  mind you .  very graciously .      the silence rolled over the assembly again .  but it was busy  in the same way that the silence of an anthill is busy .      i must remind you  ladies and gentlemen  that poor lord vetinari is still alive     said mrs .  palm .      indeed  indeed     said mr .  slant .     and long may he remain so .  i   ve merely set out for you one option against that day  may it be a long time coming  when we should consider a   successor .         in any case     said dr .  downey     there is no doubt that vetinari has been overdoing it .  if he survives   which is greatly to be hoped  of course   i feel we should require him to step down for the sake of his health .  well done thou good and faithful servant  and so on .  buy him a nice house in the country somewhere .  give him a pension .  make sure there   s a seat for him at official dinners .  obviously  if he can be so easily poisoned now he should welcome the release from the chains of office           what about the wizards .     said mr .  boggis .      they   ve never got involved in civic concerns     said dr .  downey .     give    em four meat meals a day and tip your hat to them and they   re happy .  they know nothing about politics .      the silence that followed was broken by the voice of queen molly of the beggars .     what about vimes .      dr .  downey shrugged .     he is a servant of the city .         that   s what i mean .         surely we represent the city .         hah .  he won   t see it that way .  and you know what vimes thinks about kings .  it was a vimes who chopped the head off the last one .  there   s a bloodline that thinks a swing of an axe can solve anything .         now  molly  you know vimes   d probably take an axe to vetinari if he thought he could get away with it .  no love lost there  i fancy .         he won   t like it .  that   s all i tell you .  vetinari keeps vimes wound up .  no knowing what happens if he unwinds all at once           he   s a public servant .     snapped dr .  downey .   queen molly made a face  which was not difficult in one so naturally well endowed  and sat back .     so this is the new way of things  is it .     she muttered .     lot of ordinary men sit around a table and talk and suddenly the world   s a different place .  the sheep turn round and charge the shepherd .         there   s a soir  e at lady selachii   s house this evening     said dr .  downey  ignoring her .     i believe nobbs   s being invited .  perhaps we can   meet him .          vimes told himself he was really going to inspect the progress on the new watch house in chittling street .  cockbill street was just round the corner .  and then he   d call in  informally .  no sense in sparing a man when they were pushed anyway  what with these murders and vetinari and detritus   s anti slab crusade .   he turned the corner  and stopped .   nothing much had changed .  that was the shocking thing .  after   oh  too many years   things had no right not to have changed .   but washing lines still criss crossed the street between the gray  ancient buildings .  antique paint still peeled in the way cheap paint peeled when it had been painted on wood too old and rotten to take paint .  cockbill street people were usually too penniless to afford decent paint  but always far too proud to use whitewash .   and the place was slightly smaller than he remembered .  that was all .   when had he last come down here .  he couldn   t remember .  it was beyond the shades  and up until quite recently the watch had tended to leave that area to its own unspeakable devices .   unlike the shades  though  cockbill street was clean  with the haunting  empty cleanliness you get when people can   t afford to waste dirt .  for cockbill street was where people lived who were worse than poor  because they didn   t know how poor they were .  if you asked them they would probably say something like    mustn   t grumble    or    there   s far worse off than us    or    we   ve always kept uz heads above water and we don   t owe no body nowt .      he could hear his granny speaking .     no one   s too poor to buy soap .     of course  many people were .  but in cockbill street they bought soap just the same .  the table might not have any food on it but  by gods  it was well scrubbed .  that was cockbill street  where what you mainly ate was your pride .   what a mess the world was in  vimes reflected .  constable visit had told him the meek would inherit it  and what had the poor devils done to deserve that .   cockbill street people would stand aside to let the meek through .  for what kept them in cockbill street  mentally and physically  was their vague comprehension that there were rules .  and they went through life filled with a quiet  distracted dread that they weren   t quite obeying them .   people said that there was one law for the rich and one law for the poor  but it wasn   t true .  there was no law for those who made the law  and no law for the incorrigibly lawless .  all the laws and rules were for those people stupid enough to think like cockbill street people .   it was oddly quiet .  normally there   d be swarms of kids  and carts heading down towards the docks  but today the place had a shut in look .   in the middle of the road was a chalked hopscotch path .   vimes felt his knees go weak .  it was still here .  when had he last seen it .  thirty five years ago .  forty .  so it must have been drawn and redrawn thousands of times .   he   d been pretty good at it .  of course  they   d played it by ankh morpork rules .  instead of kicking a stone they   d kicked william scuggins .  it had been just one of the many inventive games they   d played which had involved kicking  chasing  or jumping on william scuggins until he threw one of his famous wobblers and started frothing and violently attacking himself .   vimes had been able to drop william in the square of his choice nine times out of ten .  the tenth time  william bit his leg .   in those days  tormenting william and finding enough to eat had made for a simple  straightforward life .  there weren   t so many questions you didn   t know the answers to  except maybe how to stop your leg festering .   sir samuel looked around  saw the silent street  and flicked a stone out of the gutter with his foot .  then he booted it surreptitiously along the squares  adjusted his cloak  and hopped and jumped his way up  turned  hopped     what was it you shouted as you hopped .     salt  mustard  vinegar  pepper    .  no .  or was it the one that went    william scuggins is a bastard    .  now he   d wonder about that all day .   a door opened across the street .  vimes froze  one leg in mid air  as two black clothed figures came out slowly and awkwardly .   this was because they were carrying a coffin .   the natural solemnity of the occasion was diminished by their having to squeeze around it and out into the street  pulling the casket after them and allowing two other pairs of bearers to edge their way into the daylight .   vimes remembered himself in time to lower his other foot  and then remembered even more of himself and snatched his helmet off in respect .   another coffin emerged .  it was a lot smaller .  it needed only two people to carry it and that was really one too many .   as mourners trooped out behind them  vimes fumbled in a pocket for the scrap of paper detritus had given him .  the scene was  in its way  funny  like the bit in a circus where the coach stops and a dozen clowns get out of it .  apartment houses round here made up for their limited number of rooms by having a large number of people occupy them .   he found the paper and unfolded it .  first floor back     cockbill street .   and this was it .  he   d arrived in time for a funeral .  two funerals .          looks like it   s a really bad day to be a golem     said angua .  there was a pottery hand lying in the gutter .     that   s the third one we   ve seen smashed in the street .      there was a crash up ahead  and a dwarf came through a window more or less horizontally .  his iron helmet struck sparks as he hit the street  but the dwarf was soon up again and plunging back through the adjacent doorway .   he emerged via the window again a moment later but was fielded by carrot  who set him on his feet .      hello  mr .  oresmiter .  are you keeping well .  and what is happening here .         it   s that devil gimlet  captain carrot .  you should be arresting him .         why  what   s he done .         he   s been poisoning people  that   s what .      carrot glanced at angua  then back at oresmiter .     poison .     he said .     that   s a very serious allegation .         you   re telling me .  i was up all night with mrs .  oresmiter .  i didn   t think much about it until i came in here this morning and there were other people complaining        he tried to struggle out of carrot   s grip .     you know what .     he said .     you know what .  we looked in his cold room and you know what .  you know what .  you know what he   s been selling as meat .         tell me     said carrot .      pork and beef .         oh  dear .         and lamb .         tch  tch .         hardly any rat at all .      carrot shook his head at the duplicity of traders .      and snori glodssonsunclesson said he had rat surprise last night and he   ll swear there were chicken bones in it .      carrot let go of the dwarf .     you stay here     he said to angua and  head bowed  stepped inside gimlet   s hole food delicatessen .   an axe spun towards him .  he caught it almost absentmindedly and tossed it casually aside .      ow .      there was a m  l  e of dwarfs around the counter .  the row had already gone well past the stage when it had anything much to do with the subject in hand and  these being dwarfs  took in other matters of vital importance such as whose grandfather had stolen whose grandfather   s mining claim three hundred years ago and whose axe was at whose throat right now .   but there was something about carrot   s presence .  the fighting gradually stopped .  the fighters tried to look as if they   d just happened to be standing there .  there was a sudden and general    axe .  what axe .  oh  this axe .  i was just showing it to my friend bjorn here  good old bjorn    feel to the atmosphere .      all right     said carrot .     what   s all this about poison .  mr .  gimlet first .         it   s a diabolical lie .     shouted gimlet  from somewhere under the heap .     i run a wholesome restaurant .  my tables are so clean you could eat your dinner off them .      carrot raised his hands to stop the outburst this caused .     someone said something about rats     he said .      i told them  i use only the very best rats .     shouted gimlet .     good plump rats from the best locations .  none of your latrine rubbish .  and they   re hard to come by  let me tell you .         and when you can   t get them  mr .  gimlet .     said carrot .   gimlet paused .  carrot was hard to lie to .     all right     he mumbled .     maybe when there   s not enough i might sort of plump out the stock with some chicken  maybe just a bit of beef           hah .  a bit .         that   s right  you should see his cold room  mr .  carrot .         yeah  he uses steak and cuts little legs in it and covers it with rat sauce .         i don   t know .  you try to do your best at very reasonable prices and this is the thanks you get .     said gimlet hotly .     it   s hard enough to make ends meet as it is .         you don   t even make    em of the right meat .      carrot sighed .  there were no public health laws in ankh morpork .  it would be like installing smoke detectors in hell .      all right     he said .     but you can   t get poisoned by steak .  no  honestly .  no .  no  shut up  all of you .  no  i don   t care what your mothers told you .  now  i want to know about this poisoning  gimlet .      gimlet struggled to his feet .      we did rat surprise last night for the sons of bloodaxe annual dinner     he said .  there was a general groan .     and it was rat .     he raised his voice against the complaining .     you can   t use anything else   listen   you   ve got to have the noses poking through the pastry  all right .  some of the best rat we   ve had in for a long time  let me tell you .         and you were all ill afterwards .     said carrot  taking out his notebook .      sweating all night .         couldn   t see straight .         i reckon i know every knothole on the back of the privy door .         i   ll write that down as a    definitely        said carrot .     was there anything else on the dinner menu .         vole au vents and cream of rat     said gimlet .     all hygienically prepared .         how do you mean     hygienically prepared    .     said carrot .      the chef is under strict orders to wash his hands afterwards .      the assembled dwarfs nodded .  this was certainly pretty hygienic .  you didn   t want people going around with ratty hands .      anyway  you   ve all been eating here for years     said gimlet  sensing this slight veer in his direction .     this is the first time there   s been any trouble  isn   t it .  my rats are famous .         your chicken   s going to be pretty famous  too     said carrot .   there was laughter this time .  even gimlet joined in .     all right  i   m sorry about the chicken .  but it was that or very poor rats  and you know i only buy from wee mad arthur .  he   s trustworthy  whatever else you may say about him .  you just can   t get better rats .  everyone knows that .         that   ll be wee mad arthur in gleam street .     said carrot .      yes .  not a mark on    em  most of the time .         have you got any left .         one or two .     gimlet   s expression changed .     here  you don   t think he poisoned them  do you .  i never did trust that little bugger .         inquiries are continuing     said carrot .  he tucked his notebook away .     i   d like some rats  please .  those rats .  to go .     he glanced at the menu  patted his pocket and looked questioningly out through the door at angua .      you don   t have to buy them     she said wearily .     they   re evidence .         we can   t defraud an innocent tradesman who may be the victim of circumstances     said carrot .      you want ketchup .     said gimlet .     only they   re extra with ketchup .          the funeral carriage went slowly through the streets .  it looked quite expensive  but that was cockbill street for you .  people put money by .  vimes remembered that .  you always put money by  in cockbill street .  you saved up for a rainy day even if it was pouring already .  and you   d die of shame if people thought you could afford only a cheap funeral .   half a dozen black clad mourners came along behind  altogether with perhaps a score of people who had tried at least to look respectable .   vimes followed the procession at a distance all the way to the cemetery behind the temple of small gods  where he lurked awkwardly among the gravestones and sombre graveyard trees while the priest mumbled on .   the gods had made the people of cockbill street poor  honest and provident  vimes reflected .  they might as well have hung signs saying    kick me    on their backs and had done with it .  but cockbill street people tended towards religion  at least of the less demonstrative kind .  they always put a little life by for a rainy eternity .   eventually the crowd around the graves broke up and drifted away with the aimless look of people whose immediate future contains ham rolls .   vimes spotted a tearful young woman in the main group and advanced carefully .     er   are you mildred easy .     he said .   she nodded .     who are you .     she took in the cut of his coat and added     sir .         was that old mrs .  easy who used to do dressmaking .     said vimes  taking her gently aside .      that   s right           and the   smaller coffin .         that was our william        the girl looked as if she were about to cry again .      can we have a talk .     said vimes .     there are some things i hope you can tell me .      he hated the way his mind worked .  a proper human being would have shown respect and quietly walked away .  but  as he   d stood among the chilly stones  a horrible apprehension had stolen over him that almost all the answers were in place now  if only he could work out the questions .   she looked around at the other mourners .  they had reached the gate and were staring back curiously at the two of them .      er   i know this isn   t the right time     said vimes .     but  when the kids play hopscotch in the street  what   s the rhyme they sing .     salt  mustard  vinegar  pepper .     isn   t it .      she stared at his worried grin .     that   s a skipping rhyme     she said coldly .     when they play hopscotch they sing    billy skunkins is a brass stud .     who are you .         i   m commander vimes of the watch     said vimes .  so   willy scuggins would live on in the street  in disguise and in a fashion   and old stoneface was just some guy on a bonfire     then her tears came .      it   s all right  it   s all right     said vimes  as soothingly as he could .     i was brought up in cockbill street  that   s why i   i mean i   m   i   m not here on   i   m not out to   look  i know you took food home from the palace .  that   s all right by me .  i   m not here to   oh  damn  would you like my handkerchief .  i think your one   s full .         everyone does it .         yes  i know .         anyway  cook never says nothing       she began to sob again .      yes  yes .         everyone takes a few things     said mildred easy .     it   s not like stealing .      it is  thought vimes treacherously .  but i don   t give a damn .   and now   he   d got a grip on the long copper rod and was climbing into a high place while the thunder muttered around him .     the  er  the last food you sto   were given     he said     what was it .         just some blancmange and some  you know  that sort of jam made out of meat           p  t   .         yes .  i thought it would be a little treat        vimes nodded .  rich  mushy food .  the sort you   d give to a baby who was peaky and to a granny who hadn   t got any teeth .   well  he was on the roof now  the clouds were black and threatening  and he might as well wave the lightning conductor .  time to ask     the wrong question  as it proved .      tell me     he said     what did mrs .  easy die of .             let me put it like this     said cheery .     if these rats had been poisoned with lead instead of arsenic  you   d have been able to sharpen their noses and use them as pencils .      she lowered the beaker .      are you sure .     said carrot .      yes .         wee mad arthur wouldn   t poison rats  would he .  especially not rats that were going to be eaten .         i   ve heard he doesn   t like dwarfs much     said angua .      yes  but business is business .  no one who does a lot of business with dwarfs likes them much  and he must supply every dwarf cafe and delicatessen in the city .         maybe they ate arsenic before he caught them .     said angua .     people use it as a rat poison  after all           yes     said carrot  in a very deliberate way .     they do .         you   re not suggesting that vetinari tucks into a nice rat every day .     said angua .      i   ve heard he uses rats as spies  so i don   t think he uses them as elevenses     said carrot .     but it   d be nice to know where wee mad arthur gets his from  don   t you think .         commander vimes said he was looking after the vetinari case     said angua .      but we   re just finding out why gimlet   s rats are full of arsenic     said carrot  innocently .     anyway  i was going to ask sergeant colon to look into it .      but   wee mad arthur .     said angua .     he   s mad .         fred can take nobby with him .  i   ll go and tell him .  um .  cheery .         yes  captain .         you   ve been  er  you   ve been trying to hide your face from me   oh .  did someone hit you .         no  sir .         only your eyes look a bit bruised and your lips           i   m fine  sir .     said cheery desperately .      oh  well  if you say so .  i   ll   er  i   ll   look for sergeant colon  then        he backed out  embarrassed .   that left the two of them .  all girls together  thought angua .  one normal girl between the two of us  at any rate .      i don   t think the mascara works     angua said .     the lipstick   s fine but the mascara   i don   t think so .         i think i need practice .         you sure you want to keep the beard .         you don   t mean   shave .     cheery backed away .      all right  all right .  what about the iron helmet .         it belonged to my grandmother .  it   s dwarfish .         fine .  fine .  ok .  you   ve made a good start  anyway .         er   what do you think of   this .     said cheery  handing her a bit of paper .   angua read it .  it was a list of names  although most of them were crossed out       cheery littlebottom  cheery  sherry  sherri  lucinda littlebottom  sharry  sharri  cheri         er   what do you think .     said cheery nervously .         lucinda    .     said angua  raising her eyebrows .      i   ve always liked the sound of the name .            cheri    is nice     said angua .     and it is rather like the one you   ve got already .  the way people spell in this town  no one will actually notice unless you point it out to them .      cheery   s shoulders sagged with released tension .  when you   ve made up your mind to shout out who you are to the world  it   s a relief to know that you can do it in a whisper .      cheri     thought angua .  now  what does that name conjure up .  does the mental picture include iron boots  iron helmet  a small worried face and a long beard .   well  it does now .       somewhere underneath ankh morpork a rat went about its business  ambling unconcernedly through the ruins of a damp cellar .  it turned a corner towards the grain store it knew was up ahead  and almost walked into another rat .   this one was standing on its hind legs  though  and wearing a tiny black robe and carrying a scythe .  such of its snout that could be seen was bone white .   squeak .  it said .   then the vision faded and revealed a slightly smaller figure .  there was nothing in the least rat like about it  apart from its size .  it was human  or least humanoid .  it was dressed in ratskin trousers but was bare above the waist  apart from two bandoliers that criss crossed its chest .  and it was smoking a tiny cigar .   it raised a very small crossbow and fired .   the soul of the rat   for anything so similar in so many ways to human beings certainly has a soul   watched gloomily as the figure took its recent habitation by the tail and towed it away .  then it looked up at the death of rats  who appeared a lot more solid now .      squeak .     it said .   the grim squeaker nodded .  squeak .   a minute later wee mad arthur emerged into the daylight  dragging the rat behind him .  there were fifty seven neatly lined up along the wall  but despite his name wee mad arthur made a point of not killing the young and the pregnant females .  it   s always a good idea to make sure you   ve got a job tomorrow .   his sign was still tacked up over the hole .  wee mad arthur  as the only insect and vermin exterminator able to meet the enemy on its own terms  found that it paid to advertise .                   wee mad    arthur  for those little things that get you down  rats  free   mise      per ten tails  moles        each  warsps        per nest .  hornets       extra .   cockroaches and similar by aranjement .   small fees     big jobs                 arthur took out the world   s smallest notebook and a piece of pencil lead .  see here  now   fifty eight skins at two a penny  city bounty for the tails at a penny per ten  and the carcasses to gimlet at tuppence per three  the hard driving dwarf bastard that he was     there was a moment   s shadow  and then someone stamped on him .      right     said the owner of the boot .     still catching rats without a guild card  are you .  easiest ten dollars we ever earned  ron .  let   s go and        the man was lifted several inches off the ground  whirled around  and hurled against the wall .  his companion stared as a streak of dust raced across his boot  but reacted too late .      he   s gone up me trouser .  he   s gone up me   arrgh .      there was a crack .      me knee .  me knee .  he   s broken me knee .      the man who had been flung aside tried to get up  but something scurried across his chest and landed astride his nose .      hey  pal .     said wee mad arthur .     can yer mother sew  pal .  yeah .  then get her to stitch this one .      he grabbed an eyelid in each hand and thrust his head forward with pin point precision .  there was another crack as the skulls met .   the man with the broken knee tried to drag himself away but wee mad arthur leapt from his stunned comrade and proceed to kick him .  the kicks of a man not much more than six inches high should not hurt  but wee mad arthur seemed to have a lot more mass than his size would allow .  being nutted by arthur was like being hit by a steel ball from a slingshot .  a kick seemed to have all the power of one from a large man  but very painfully concentrated into a smaller area .      yez can tell them buggers at the rat catchers    guild that i works for whoze i want and charges what i like     he said  between kicks .     and them shites can stop tryin    to persecute the small businessman        the other guild enforcer made it to the end of the alley .  arthur gave ron a final kick and left him in the gutter .   wee mad arthur walked back to his task  shaking his head .  he worked for nothing and sold his rats for half the official rate  a heinous crime .  yet wee mad arthur was growing rich because the guild hadn   t got its joint heads around the idea of fiscal relativity .   arthur charged a lot more for his services .  a lot more  that is  from the specialized and above all low point of view of wee mad arthur .  what ankh morpork had yet to understand was that the smaller you are  the more your money is worth .   a dollar for a human bought a loaf of bread that was eaten in a few bites .  the same dollar for wee mad arthur bought the same sized loaf  but it was food for a week and could then be further hollowed out and used as a bedroom .   the size differential problem was also responsible for his frequent drunkenness .  few publicans were prepared to sell beer by the thimbleful or had gnome sized mugs .  wee mad arthur had to go drinking in a swimming costume .   but he liked his work .  no one could clear out rats like wee mad arthur .  old and cunning rats that knew all about traps  deadfalls  and poison were helpless in the face of his attack  which was where  in fact  he often attacked .  the last thing they felt was a hand gripping each of their ears  and the last thing they saw was his forehead  approaching at speed .   muttering under his breath  wee mad arthur got back to his calculations .  but not for long .   he spun around  forehead cocked .      it   s only us  wee mad arthur     said sergeant colon  stepping back hurriedly .      that   s mr .  wee mad arthur to youse  copper     said wee mad arthur  but he relaxed a little .      we   re sergeant colon and corporal nobbs     said colon .      yeah  you remember us  don   t you .     said nobby  in a wheedling voice .     we was the ones who helped you when you was fighting them three dwarfs last week .         yez pulled me off    f them  if that   s what you mean     said wee mad arthur .     just when i   d got    em all down .         we want to talk to you about some rats     said colon .      can   t take on any more customers     said wee mad arthur firmly .      some rats you sold to gimlet   s hole food delicatessen a few days ago .         what   s that to yez .         he reckons they was poisoned     said nobby  who had taken the precaution of moving behind colon .      i never uses poison .      colon realized he was backing away from a man six inches high .     yeah  well   see   fing is   you being in fights and that   you don   t get on with dwarfs   some people might say   fing is   it could look like you might have a grudge .     he took another step back and almost tripped over nobby .      grudge .  why should i have a grudge  pal .  it ain   t me that gets the kicking .     said wee mad arthur  advancing .      good point .  good point     said colon .     only it   d help  right  if you could tell us   where you got those rats from           like the patrician   s palace  maybe     said nobby .      the palace .  no one catches rats at the palace .  that   s not allowed .  no  i remember those rats .  they wuz good fat ones  i wanted a penny each  but he held out for four for threepence  th    ole skinflint that he is .         where did you get them  then .      wee mad arthur shrugged .     down the cattle market .  i do the cattle market tuesdays .  couldn   t tell yez where they came from .  them tunnels guz everywhere  see .         could they   ve eaten poison before you caught them .     said colon .   wee mad arthur bristled .     no one puts down poison round there .  i won   t have it  see .  i got all the contracts along the shambles  and i won   t deal with any gobshite who uses poison .  i doesn   t charge for extermination  see .  guild hates that .  but i chooses me customers .     wee mad arthur grinned wickedly .     i only guz where   s there   s the finest eating for the rats and i clean up flogging    em to the lawn ornaments .  i find anyone using poison on my patch  they can pay guild rates for guild work  hah  and see how they like it .         i can see you   re going to be a big man in industrial catering     said colon .   wee mad arthur put his head on one side .     d   youse know what happened to the last man that made a crack like that .     he said .      er   no    .     said colon .      neither does anyone else     said wee mad arthur        cos he was never found .  have yez finished .  only i got a wasps    nest to clean out before i go home .         so you were catching them under the shambles .     colon persisted .      all the way along .     s a good beat .  there   s tanners  tallow men  butchers  sausage makers   that   s good grazing  if you   re a rat .         yeah  right     said colon .     fair enough .  well  i reckon we   ve taken up enough of your time           how d   you catch wasps .     said nobby  intrigued .     smoke    em out .            tis unsporting not to hit them on the wing     said wee mad arthur .     but if it   s a busy day i make up squibs out of that no .    black powder the alchemists sell .     he indicated the laden bandoliers over his shoulders .      you blow them up .     said nobby .     that don   t sound too sporting .         yeah .  just ever tried settin    and lightin    half a dozen fuses and then fightin    your way back out of the entrance before the first one goes off .             it   s a wild goose chase  sarge     said nobby  as they strolled away .     some rats et some poison somewhere and he got them .  what   re we supposed to do about it .  poisonin    rats ain   t illegal .      colon scratched his chin .     i think we could be in a bit of trouble  nobby     he said .     i mean  everyone   s been bustling around detectoring and we   d could end up looking a right couple of noddies .  i mean  do you want to go back to the yard and say we talked to wee mad arthur and he said it wasn   t him  end of story .  we   re humans  right .  well  i am and i know you probably are   and we   re definitely bringing up the rear around here .  i   m telling you  this ain   t my watch any more  nobby .  trolls  dwarfs  gargoyles   i   ve nothing against them  you know me  but i   m looking forward to my little farm with chickens round the door .  and i wouldn   t mind goin    out with something to be proud of .         well  what do you want us to do .  knock on every door round the cattle market and ask    em if they   ve got any arsenic in the place .         yep     said colon .     walk and talk .  that   s what vimes always says .         there   s hundreds of    em .  anyway  they   d say no .         right  but we got to arsk .     t   aint like it used to be  nobby .  this is modern policing .  detectoring .  these days  we got to get results .  i mean  the watch is getting bigger .  i don   t mind ole detritus bein    a sergeant   he   s not bad when you get to know him   but one of these days it could be a dwarf giving out orders  nobby .  it   s all right for me    cos i   ll be out on my farm           nailin    chickens round the door     said nobby .      but you   ve got your future to think about .  an     the way things are going  maybe the watch   ll be looking for another captain .  it   d be a right bugger if he turned out to have a name like stronginthearm  eh  or shale .  so you   d better look smart .         you never wanted to be a captain  fred .         me .  a hofficer .  i have my pride  nobby .  i   ve nothing against hofficering for them as is called to it  but it   s not for the likes of me .  my place is with the common man .         i wish mine was     said nobby gloomily .     look what was in my pigeonhole this morning .      he handed the sergeant a square of card  with gold edging .        lady selachii will be at home this p . m .  from five onwards  and requests the pleasure of the company of lord de nobbes        he read .      oh .         i   ve heard about these rich ole women     said nobby  dejectedly .     i reckon she wants me to be a giggle low  is that right .         nah  nah     said the sergeant  looking at passion   s most unlikely plaything .     i know this stuff from my uncle .     at home    is like a bit of a drinks do .  it   s where all you nobs hob nob  nobby .  you just drink and scoff and talk about literachoor and the arts .         i haven   t got any posh clothes     said nobby .      ah  that   s where you score  nobby     said colon .     uniforms is ok .  adds a bit of tone  in fact .  especially if you look dashing     he said  ignoring the evidence that nobby was  in fact  merely runny .      is that a fact .     said nobby  brightening up a bit .     i   ve got a lot more of    em invites  too     he said .     posh cards what look like they   ve been nibbled along the edges with gold teeth .  dinners  balls  all kinds of stuff .      colon looked down at his friend .  a strange and yet persuasive thought crept into his mind .     we ell     he said     it   s the end of the social season  see .  time   s running out .         what for .         we ell   could be all them posh women want to marry you off to their daughters who   re in season           what .         nothing beats an earl except a duke  and we haven   t got one of them .  and we ain   t got a king  neither .  the earl of ankh would be what they calls a social catch .     yes  it was easier if he said it to himself like that .  if you substituted    nobby nobbs    for    earl of ankh    it didn   t work .  but it did work when you just said    earl of ankh .     there   d be many women who   d be happy to be the mother in law of the earl of ankh even if it meant having nobby nobbs into the bargain .   well  a few  anyway .   nobby   s eyes gleamed .     never thought of that     he said .     and some of these girls have a bit of cash  too .         more   n you  nobby .         and of course i owes it to my posterity to see that the line of nobbses doesn   t die out     nobby added  thoughtfully .   colon beamed at him with the rather worried expression of a mad doctor who has bolted on the head  applied the crackling lightning to the electrodes  and is now watching his creation lurch down to the village .      cor     said nobby  his eyes now unfocusing slightly .      right  but before that     said colon     i   ll do all the places along the shambles and you do chittling street and then we can push off back to the yard  job done and dusted .  ok .             afternoon  commander vimes     said carrot  shutting the door behind him .     captain carrot reporting .      vimes was slumped in his chair  staring at the window .  the fog was creeping up again .  already the opera house opposite was a little hazy .      we  er  had a look at as many golems as we could  sir     said carrot  trying diplomatically to see if there was a bottle anywhere on the desk .     there   s hardly any  sir .  we found eleven had smashed themselves up or sawn their heads off and by lunchtime people were smashing    em or taking out their words themselves  sir .  it   s not nice  sir .  there   s bits of pottery all over the city .  it   s as if people were   just waiting for the opportunity .  it   s odd  sir .  all they do is work and keep themselves to themselves and don   t offer any harm to anyone .  and some of the ones that smashed themselves left   well  notes  sir .  sort of saying they were sorry and ashamed  sir .  they kept on going on about their clay        vimes did not respond .   carrot leaned sideways and down  in case there was a bottle on the floor .     and gimlet   s hole food delicatessen has been selling poisoned rat .  arsenic  sir .  i   ve asked sergeant colon and nobby to follow that one .  it might just be some kind of mix up  but you never know .      vimes turned .  carrot could hear his breathing .  short  sharp bursts  like a man trying to keep himself under control .     what have we missed  captain .     he said  in a faraway voice .      sir .         i   m in his lordship   s room .  there   s the bed .  the desk .  things on the desk .  the table by the bed .  the chair .  the rug .  everything .  we replaced everything .  he eats food .  we   ve checked the food  yes .         the whole larder  sir .         is that a fact .  we might be wrong there .  i don   t understand how  but we might be wrong .  there   s some evidence lying in the cemetery that suggests we are .     vimes was nearly growling .     what else is there .  littlebottom says there   s no marks on him .  what else is there .  let   s find out the how and with any luck that   ll give us the who .         he breathes the air more than anyone else  si           but we moved him into another bedroom .  even if someone was  i don   t know  pumping poison in   they couldn   t change rooms with us all watching .  it   s got to be the food .         i   ve watched them taste it  sir .         then it   s something we   re not seeing  damn it .  people are dead  captain .  mrs .  easy   s dead .         who  sir .         you   ve never heard of her .         can   t say that i have  sir .  what did she used to do .         do .  nothing  i suppose .  she just brought up nine kids in a couple of rooms you couldn   t stretch out in and she sewed shirts for tuppence an hour  every hour the bloody gods sent  and all she did was work and keep herself to herself and she is dead  captain .  and so   s her grandson .  aged fourteen months .  because her granddaughter took them some grub from the palace .  a bit of a treat for them .  and d   you know what .  mildred thought i was going to arrest her for theft .  at the damn    funeral  for gods    sake .     vimes    fists opened and closed  his knuckles showing white .     it   s murder now .  not assassination  not politics  it   s murder .  because we   re not asking the right damn    questions .          the door opened .      oh  good afternoon  squire     said sergeant colon brightly  touching his helmet .     sorry to bother you .  i expect it   s your busy time  but i   ve got to ask  just to eliminate you from our inquiries  so to speak .  do you use any arsenic around the place .         er   don   t leave the officer standing there  fanley     said a nervous voice  and the workman stepped aside .     good afternoon  officer .  how may we help you .         checking up on arsenic  sir .  seems some   s been getting where it shouldn   t .         er   good heavens .  really .  i   m sure we don   t use any  but do come inside while i check with the foremen .  i   m certain there   s a pot of tea hot  too .      colon looked behind him .  the mist was rising .  the sky was going gray .     wouldn   t say no  sir .     he said .   the door closed behind him .   a moment later  there was the faint scrape of the bolts .          right     said vimes .     let   s start again .      he picked up an imaginary ladle .      i   m the cook .  i   ve made this nourishing gruel that tastes like dog   s water .  i   m filling up three bowls .  everyone   s watching me .  all the bowls have been well washed  right .  ok .  the tasters take two  one to taste  and these days the other   s for littlebottom to check  and then a servant   that   s you  carrot   takes the third one and           put it in the dumbwaiter  sir .  there   s one up to every room .         i thought they carried them up .         six floors .  it   d get stone cold  sir .         all right   hold on .  we   ve gone too far .  you   ve got the bowl .  d   you put it on a tray .         yes  sir .         put it on a tray  then .      carrot obediently put the invisible bowl on an invisible tray .      anything else .     said vimes .      piece of bread  sir .  and we check the loaf .         soup spoon .         yes  sir .         well  don   t just stand there .  put them on        carrot detached one hand from the invisible tray to take an invisible piece of bread and an intangible spoon .      anything else .     said vimes .     salt and pepper .         i think i remember salt and pepper pots  sir .         on they go  then .      vimes stared hawk like at the space between carrots   s hands .      no     he said .     we wouldn   t have missed that  would we .  i mean   we wouldn   t  would we .      he reached out and picked up an invisible tube .      tell me we checked the salt     he said .      that   s the pepper  sir     said carrot helpfully .      salt .  mustard .  vinegar .  pepper .     said vimes .     we didn   t check all the food and then let his lordship tip poison on to suit his taste  did we .  arsenic   s a metal .  can   t you get   metal salts .  tell me we asked ourselves that .  we aren   t that stupid  are we .         i   ll check directly     said carrot .  he looked around desperately .     i   ll just put the tray down           not yet     said vimes .     i   ve been here before .  we don   t rush off shouting    give me a towel .     just because we   ve had one idea .  let   s keep looking  shall we .  the spoon .  what   s it made of .         good point .  i   ll check the cutlery  sir .         now we   re cooking with charcoal .  what   s he been drinking .         boiled water  sir .  we   ve tested the water .  and i checked the glasses .         good .  so   we   ve got the tray and you put the tray in the dumbwaiter and then what .         the men in the kitchen haul on the ropes and it goes up to the sixth floor .         no stops .      carrot looked blank .      it goes up six floors     said vimes .     it   s just a shaft with a big box in it that can be pulled up and down  isn   t it .  i   ll bet there   s a door into it on every floor .         some of the floors are hardly used these days  sir           even better for our poisoner  hmm .  he just stands there  bold as you like  and waits for the tray to come by  right .  we don   t know that the meal which arrives is the one that left  do we .         brilliant  sir .         it happens at night  i   ll swear     said vimes .     he   s chipper in the evenings and out like a light next morning .  what time is his supper sent up .         while he   s poorly  around six o   clock  sir     said carrot .     it   s got dark by then .  then he gets on with his writing .         right .  we   ve got a lot to do .  come on .          the patrician was sitting up in bed reading when vimes entered .     ah  vimes     he said .      your supper will be up shortly  my lord     said vimes .     and can i once again say that our job would be a lot easier if you let us move you out of the palace .         i   m sure it would be     said lord vetinari .   there was a rattle from the dumbwaiter .  vimes walked across and opened the doors .   there was a dwarf in the box .  he had a knife between his teeth and an axe in each hand  and was glowering with ferocious concentration .      good heavens     said vetinari weakly .     i hope at least they   ve included some mustard .         any problems  constable .     said vimes .      nofe  fir     said the dwarf  unfolding himself and removing the knife .     very dull all the way up  sir .  there was other doors and they all looked pretty unused  but i nailed    em up anyway like captain carrot said  sir .         well done .  down you go .      vimes shut the doors .  there was more rattling as the dwarf began his descent .      every detail covered  eh  vimes .         i hope so  sir .      the box came back up again  with a tray in it .  vimes took it out .      what   s this .         a klatchian hots without anchovies     said vimes  lifting the cover .     we got it from ron   s pizza hovel round the corner .  the way i see it  no one can poison all the food in the city .  and the cutlery   s from my place .         you have the mind of a true policeman  vimes .         thank you  sir .         really .  was it a compliment .     the patrician prodded at the plate with the air of an explorer in a strange country .      has someone already eaten this  vimes .         no  sir .  that   s just how they chop up the food .         oh  i see .  i thought perhaps the food tasters were getting over enthusiastic     said the patrician .     my word .  what a treat i have to look forward to .         i can see you   re feeling better  sir     said vimes stiffy .      thank you  vimes .      when vimes had gone lord vetinari ate the pizza  or at least those parts of it he thought he could recognize .  then he put the tray aside and blew out the candle by his bed .  he sat in the dark for a while  then felt under his pillow until his fingers located a small sharp knife and a box of matches .   thank goodness for vimes .  there was something endearing about his desperate  burning and above all mis placed competence .  if the poor man took any longer he   d have to start giving him hints .       in the main office carrot sat alone  watching dorfl .   the golem stood where it had been left .  someone had hung a dishcloth on one arm .  the top of its head was still open .   carrot sat for a while with his chin on one hand  just staring .  then he opened a desk drawer and took out dorfl   s chem .  he examined it .  he got up .  he walked over to the golem .  he placed the words in the head .   an orange glow rose in dorfl   s eyes .  what was baked pottery took on that faintest of auras that marked the change between the living and the dead .   carrot found the golem   s slate and pencil and pushed them into dorfl   s hand  then stood back .   the burning gaze followed him as he removed his sword belt  undid his breastplate  took off his jerkin and pulled his woollen vest over his head .   the glow was reflected from his muscles .  they glistened in the candlelight .      no weapons     said carrot .     no armor .  you see .  now listen to me        dorfl lurched forward and swung a fist .   carrot did not move .   the fist stopped a hair   s breadth from carrot   s unblinking eyes .      i didn   t think you could     he said  as the golem swung again and the fist jerked to a stop a fraction of an inch from carrot   s stomach .     but sooner or later you   ll have to talk to me .  write  anyway .      dorfl paused .  then it picked up the slate pencil .   take my words .      tell me about the golem who killed people .      the pencil did not move .      the others have killed themselves     said carrot .   i know .      how do you know .      the golem watched him .  then it wrote   clay of my clay .      you feel what other golems feel .     said carrot .   dorfl nodded .      and people are killing golems     said carrot .     i don   t know if i can stop that .  but i can try .  i think i know what   s happening  dorfl .  some of it .  i think i know who you were following .  clay of your clay .  shaming you all .  something went wrong .  you tried to put it right .  i think   you all had such hopes .  but the words in your head   ll defeat you every time        the golem stayed motionless .      you sold him  didn   t you     said carrot quietly .     why .      the words were scribbled quickly .   golem must have a master .      why .  because the words say so .      golem must have a master .   carrot sighed .  men had to breathe  fish had to swim  golems had to have a master .     i don   t know if i can sort this out  but no one else is going to try  believe me     he said .   dorfl did not move .   carrot went back to where he had been standing .     i   m wondering if the old priest and mr .  hopkinson did something   or helped to do something     he said  watching the golem   s face .     i   m wondering if   afterwards   something turned against them  found the world a bit too much        dorfl remained impassive .   carrot nodded .     anyway  you   re free to go .  what happens now is up to you .  i   ll help you if i can .  if a golem is a thing then it can   t commit murder  and i   ll still try to find out why all this is happening .  if a golem can commit murder  then you are people  and what is being done to you is terrible and must be stopped .  either way  you win  dorfl .     he turned his back and fiddled with some papers on his desk .     the big trouble     he added     is that everyone wants someone else to read their minds for them and then make the world work properly .  even golems  perhaps .      he turned back to face the golem .     i know you   ve all got a secret .  but  the way things are going  there won   t be any of you left to keep it .      he looked hopefully at dorfl .   no .  clay of my clay .  i will not betray .   carrot sighed .     well  i can   t force you .     he grinned .     although  you know  i could .  i could write a few extra words on your chem .  tell you to be talkative .      the fires rose in dorfl   s eyes .      but i won   t .  because that would be inhumane .  you haven   t murdered anyone .  i can   t deprive you of your freedom because you haven   t got any .  go on .  you can go .  it   s not as if i don   t know where you live .      to work is to live .      what is it golems want  dorfl .  i   ve seen you golems walking around the streets and working all the time  but what is it you actually hope to achieve .      the slate pencil scribbled .   respite .   then dorfl turned around and walked out of the building .      d mn .     said carrot  a difficult linguistic feat .  he drummed his fingers on the desk  then got up abruptly  put his clothes back on and stalked down the corridor to find angua .   she was leaning against the wall in corporal littlebottom   s office  talking to the dwarf .      i   ve sent dorfl home     said carrot .      has he got one .     said angua .      well  back to the slaughterhouse  anyway .  but it   s probably not a good time for a golem to be out alone so i   m just going to stroll along after him and keep   are you all right  corporal littlebottom .         yes  sir     said cheri .      you   re wearing a   a   a       carrot   s mind rebelled at the thought of what the dwarf was wearing and settled for     a kilt .         yes  sir .  a skirt  sir .  a leather one  sir .      carrot tried to find a suitable response and had to resort to     oh .         i   ll come with you     said angua .     cheri can keep an eye on the desk .         a   kilt     said carrot .     oh .  well  er   just keep an eye on things .  we won   t be long .  and   er   just keep behind the desk  all right .         come on     said angua .   when they were out in the fog carrot said     do you think there   s something a bit   odd about littlebottom .         seems like a perfectly ordinary female to me     said angua .      female .  he told you he was female .         she     angua corrected .     this is ankh morpork  you know .  we   ve got extra pronouns here .      she could smell his bewilderment .  of course  everyone knew that  somewhere down under all those layers of leather and chain mail  dwarfs came in enough different types to ensure the future production of more dwarfs  but it was not a subject that dwarfs discussed other than at those essential points in a courtship when embarrassment might otherwise arise .      well  i would have thought she   d have the decency to keep it to herself     carrot said finally .     i mean  i   ve nothing against females .  i   m pretty certain my stepmother is one .  but i don   t think it   s very clever  you know  to go around drawing attention to the fact .         carrot  i think you   ve got something wrong with your head     said angua .      what .         i think you may have got it stuck up your bum .  i mean  good grief .  a bit of make up and a dress and you   re acting as though she   d become miss va va voom and started dancing on tables down at the skunk club .      there were a few seconds of shocked silence while they both considered the image of a dwarfish strip tease dancer .  both minds rebelled .      anyway     said angua     if people can   t be themselves in ankh morpork  where can they .         there   ll be trouble when the other dwarfs notice     said carrot .     i could almost see his knees .  her knees .         everyone   s got knees .         perhaps  but it   s asking for trouble to flaunt them .  i mean  i   m used to knees .  i can look at knees and think     oh  yes  knees  they   re just hinges in your legs     but some of the lads        angua sniffed .     he turned left here .  some of the lads what .         well   i don   t know how they   ll react  that   s all .  you shouldn   t have encouraged her .  i mean  of course there   s female dwarfs but   i mean  they have the decency not to show it .      he heard angua gasp .  her voice sounded rather far away when she said     carrot  you know i   ve always respected your attitude to the citizens of ankh morpork .         yes .         i   ve been impressed by the way you really seem to be blind to things like shape and color .         yes .         and you always seem to care for people .         yes .         and you know that i feel considerable affection for you .         yes .         it   s just that  sometimes           yes .         i really  really  really wonder why .          carriages were thickly parked outside lady selachii   s mansion when corporal nobbs strolled up the drive .  he knocked on the door .   a footman opened it .     servants    entrance     said the footman  and made to shut the door again .   but nobby   s outstretched foot had been ready for this .     read these     he said  thrusting two bits of paper at him .   the first one read       i  after hearing evidence from a number of experts  including mrs .  slipdry the midwife  certify that the balance of probability is that the bearer of this document  c .  w .  st .  john nobbs  is a human being .     signed  lord vetinari .       the other was the letter from dragon king of arms .   the footman   s eyes widened .     oh  i am terribly sorry  your lordship     he said .  he stared again at corporal nobbs .  nobby was clean shaven   at least  the last time he   d shaved he   d been clean shaven   but his face had so many minor topological features it looked like a very bad example of slash and burn agriculture .      oh  dear     added the footman .  he pulled himself together .     the other visitors normally just have cards .      nobby produced a battered deck .     i   m probably busy hobnobbing right now     he said .     but i   m game for a few rounds of cripple mr .  onion afterwards  if you like .      the footman looked him up and down .  he didn   t get out much .  he   d heard rumors   who hadn   t .    that working in the watch was the rightful king of ankh morpork .  he   d have to admit that  if you wanted to hide a secret heir to the throne  you couldn   t possibly hide him more carefully than under the face of c .  w .  st .  j .  nobbs .   on the other hand   the footman was something of an historian  and knew than in its long history even the throne itself had been occupied by creatures who had been hunchbacked  one eyed  knuckle dragging and as ugly as sin .  on that basis nobby was as royal as they came .  if  technically  he wasn   t hunchbacked  this was only because he was hunched front and sides  too .  there might be a time  the footman thought  when it paid to hitch your wagon to a star  even if said star was a red dwarf .      you   ve never been to one of these affairs before  m   lord .     he said .      first time     said nobby .      i   m sure your lordship   s blood will rise to the occasion     said the footman weakly .       i   ll have to go  angua thought as they hurried through the fog .  i can   t go on living from month to month .   it   s not that he   s not likeable .  you couldn   t wish to meet a more caring man .   that   s just it .  he cares for everyone .  he cares about everything .  he cares indiscriminately .  he knows everything about everyone because everyone interests him  and the caring is all general and never personal .  he doesn   t think personal is the same as important .   if only he had some decent human quality  like selfishness .   i   m sure he doesn   t think about it that way  but you can tell the werewolf thing is upsetting him underneath .  he cares about the things people say behind my back  and he doesn   t know how to deal with them .   what was it those dwarfs said the other day .  one said something like     she feels the need     and the other one said     yeah  the need to feed .     i saw his expression .  i can handle that sort of thing   well  most of the time   but he can   t .  if only he   d thump someone .  it wouldn   t do any good but at least he   d feel better .   it   s going to get worse .  at best i   m going to get caught in someone   s chicken house  and then the midden is really going to hit the windmill .  or i   ll get caught in someone   s room     she tried to shut out the thought but it didn   t work .  you could only control the werewolf  you couldn   t tame it .   it   s the city .  too many people  too many smells     maybe it would work if we were just alone somewhere  but if i said     it   s me or the city     he wouldn   t even see there was a choice .   sooner or later  i   ve got to go home .  it   s the best thing for him .       vimes walked back through the damp night .  he knew he was too angry to think properly .   he   d got nowhere  and he   d traveled a long way to get there .  he   d got a cartload of facts and he   d done all the right logical things  and to someone  somewhere  he must look like a fool .   he probably looked like a fool to carrot already .  he   d kept coming up with bright ideas   proper policeman   s ideas   and each one had turned out to be a joke .  he   d bullied and shouted and done all the proper things  and none of it had worked .  they hadn   t found a thing .  they   d merely increased their amount of ignorance .   the ghost of old mrs .  easy rose up in his inner vision .  he couldn   t remember much about her .  he   d been just another snotty kid in a crowd of snotty kids  and she   d been just another worried face somewhere on top of a pinny .  one of cockbill street   s people .  she   d taken in needlework to make ends meet and kept up appearances and  like everyone else in the street  had crept through life never asking for anything and getting even less .   what else could he have done .  they   d practically scraped the damn wallpaper off the wall     he stopped .   there was the same wallpaper in both rooms .  in every room on that floor .  that horrible green wallpaper .   but   no  that couldn   t be it .  vetinari had slept in that room for years  if he slept at all .  you can   t sneak in and redecorate without someone noticing .   in front of him  the fog rolled aside .  he caught a glimpse of a candlelit room in a nearby building before the cloud flowed back .   the fog .  yes .  dampness .  creeping in  brushing against the wallpaper .  the old  dusty  musty wallpaper     would cheery have tested the wallpaper .  after all  in a way you didn   t actually see it .  it wasn   t in the room because it was defining what the room was .  could you actually be poisoned by the walls .   he hardly dared think the thought .  if he let his mind settle on the suspicion it   d twist and fly away  like all the others .   but   this was it  said his secret soul .  all the messing around with suspects and clues   that was just something to keep the body amused while the back of the brain toiled away .  every real copper knew you didn   t go around looking for clues so that you could find out who done it .  no  you started out with a pretty good idea of who done it .  that way  you knew what clues to look for .   he wasn   t going to have another day of bafflement interspersed with desperately bright ideas  was he .  it was bad enough looking at corporal littlebottom   s expression  which seemed to be getting a little more colorful every time he saw it .   he   d said     ah  arsenic   s a metal  right  so maybe the cutlery has been made of it .     he wouldn   t forget the look on the dwarf   s face as cheery tried to explain that  yes  it might be possible to do that  provided you were sure that no one would notice the way it dissolved in the soup almost instantly .   this time he was going to think first .          the earl of ankh  corporal the rt .  hon .  lord c .  w .  st .  j .  nobbs .      the buzz of conversation stopped .  heads turned .  somewhere in the crowd someone started to laugh and was hurriedly shushed into silence by their neighbors .   lady selachii came forward .  she was a tall  angular woman  with the sharp features and aquiline nose that were the hallmarks of the family .  the impression was that an axe was being thrown at you .   then she curtsied .   there were gasps of surprise around her  but she glared at the assembled guests and there was a smattering of bows and curtsies .  somewhere at the back of the room someone started to say     but the man   s an absolute oik       and was cut off .      has someone dropped something .     said nobby nervously .     i   ll help you look  if you like .      the footman appeared at his elbow  bearing a tray .     a drink  m   lord .     he said .      yeah  ok  a pint of winkles     said nobby .   jaws fell .  but lady selachii rose to the occasion .     winkles .     she said .      a type of beer  your ladyship     said the footman .   her ladyship hesitated only a moment .     i believe the butler drinks beer     she said .     see to it  man .  and i   ll have a pint of winkles  too .  what a novel idea .      this caused a certain effect among those guests who knew on which side of the biscuit their p  t   was spread .      indeed .  capital suggestion .  a pint of winkles here  too .         hawhaw .  great .  winkles for me .         winkles all round .         but the man   s an absolute ti           shut up .          vimes crossed the brass bridge with care  counting the hippos .  there was a ninth shape  but it was leaning against the parapet and muttering to itself in a familiar and  to vimes at least  an unmenacing way .  faint air movements wafted towards him a smell that out smelled even the river .  it proclaimed that ahead of vimes was a ding a ling so big he   d been upgraded to a clang a lang .         buggrit buggrit i told    em  stand it up and pull the end orf .  millennium hand and shrimp .  i told    em  sez i  and would they poke           evening  ron     said vimes  without even bothering to look at the figure .   foul ole ron fell into step behind him .     buggrit they done me out of it so they did           yes  ron     said vimes .         and shrimp   buggrit  say i  bread it on the butter side   queen molly says to watch your back  mister .         what was that .            sowter fry it .     said foul ole ron innocently .     trouser the lot of    em  they did me out of it  them and their big weasel .      the beggar lurched around and  filthy coat dragging its hems along the ground  limped away into the fog .  his little dog trotted along in front of him .       there was pandemonium in the servants    hall .      winkles    old peculiar .     said the butler .      another one hundred and four pints .     said the footman .   the butler shrugged .     harry  sid  rob  and jeffrey   two trays apiece and double down to the king   s head again right now .  what else is he doing .         well  they   re supposed to be having a poetry reading but he   s telling    em jokes           anecdotes .         not exactly .          it was amazing how it could drizzle and fog at the same time .  rain was blowing both through the open window  and vimes was forced to shut it .  he lit the candles by his desk and opened his notebook .   probably he should use the demonic organizer  but he liked to see things written down fair and square .  he could think better when he wrote things down .   he wrote    arsenic     and drew a big circle round it .  around the circle he wrote     fr .  tubelcek   s fingernails    and    rats    and    vetinari    and    mrs .  easy .     lower down the page he wrote     golems     and drew a second circle .  around that one he wrote     fr .  tubelcek .     and    mr .  hopkinson .     after some thought he wrote down     stolen clay    and    grog .      and then     why would a golem admit to something it didn   t do .      he stared at the candlelight for a while and then wrote     rats eat stuff .      more time passed .      what has the priest got that anyone wants .      from downstairs came the sound of armor as a patrol came in .  a corporal shouted .      words     wrote vimes .     what had mr .  hopkinson got .  dwarf bread .   .  not stolen .  what else had he got .      vimes looked at this  too  and then he wrote    bakery     stared at the word for a while  and rubbed it out and replaced it with    oven .     he drew a ring around    oven .     and a ring around    stolen clay     and linked the two .   there   d been arsenic under the old priest   s fingernails .  perhaps he   d put down rat poison .  there were plenty of uses for arsenic .  it wasn   t as if you couldn   t buy it by the pound from any alchemist .   he wrote down    arsenic monster    and looked at it .  you found dirt under fingernails .  if people had put up a fight you might find blood or skin .  you didn   t find grease and arsenic .   he looked at the page again and  after still more thought  wrote     golems aren   t alive .  but they think they are alive .  what do things that are alive do .   .  ans  breathe  eat  crap .     he paused  staring out at the fog  and then wrote very carefully     and make more things .      something tingled at the back of his neck .   he circled the late hopkinson   s name and drew a line down the page to another circle  in which he wrote     he   d got a big oven .      hmm .  cheery had said you couldn   t bake clay properly in a bread oven .  but maybe you could bake it improperly .   he looked up at the candlelight again .   they couldn   t do that  could they .  oh  gods   no  surely not     but  after all  all you needed was clay .  and a holy man who knew how to write the words .  and someone to actually sculpt the figure  vimes supposed  but golems had had hundreds and hundreds of years to learn to be good with their hands     those great big hands .  the ones that looked so very fist like .   and then the first thing they   d want to do would be to destroy the evidence  wouldn   t they .  they probably didn   t think of it as killing  but more like a sort of switching off     he drew another rather misshapen circle on his notes .   grog .  old baked clay  ground up small .   they   d added some of their own clay .  dorfl had a new foot  didn   t he   it .  it hadn   t made it quite right .  they   d put part of their own selves into a new golem .   that all sounded   well  nobby would call it mucky .  vimes didn   t know what to call it .  it sounded like some sort of secret society thing .     clay of my clay .     my own flesh and blood     damn hulking things .  aping their betters .   vimes yawned .  sleep .  he   d be better for some sleep .  or something .   he stared at the page .  automatically his hand trailed down to the bottom drawer of his desk  as it always did when he was worried and trying to think .  it wasn   t as though there was ever a bottle there these days   but old habits died ha     there was a soft glassy ching and a faint  seductive slosh .   vimes   s hand came up with a fat bottle .  the label said  bearhugger   s distilleries  the macabre  finest malt .   the liquid inside almost crawled up the sides of the glass in anticipation .   he stared at it .  he   d reached down into the drawer for the whiskey bottle and there it was .   but it shouldn   t have been .  he knew carrot and fred colon kept an eye on him  but he   d never bought a bottle since he   d got married  because he   d promised sybil  hadn   t he    .   but this wasn   t any old rotgut .  this was the macabre     he   d tried it once .  he couldn   t quite remember why now  since in those days the only spirits he generally drank had the subtlety of a mallet to the inner ear .  he must have found the money somehow .  just a sniff of it had been like hogswatchnight .  just a sniff            and she said     that   s funny   it didn   t do that last night    .     said corporal nobbs .   he beamed at the company .   there was silence .  then someone in the crowd started to laugh  one of those little uncertain laughs a man laughs who is unsure that he   s not going to be silenced by those around him .  another man laughed .  two more picked it up .  then laughter exploded in the group as a whole .   nobby basked .      then there   s the one about the klatchian who walked into a pub with a tiny piano       he began .      i think     said lady selachii firmly     that the buffet is ready .         got any pig knuckles .     said nobby cheerfully .     goes down a treat with winkles  a plate of pig knuckles .         i don   t normally eat extremities     said lady selachii .      a pig knuckle sandwich   never tried a pig knuckle .  you just can   t beat it     said nobby .      it is   perhaps   not the most delicate food .     said lady selachii .      oh  you can cut the crusts off     said nobby .     even the toenails .  if you   re feeling posh .          sergeant colon opened his eyes  and groaned .  his head ached .  they   d hit him with something .  it might have been a wall .   they   d tied him up  too .  he was trussed hand and foot .   he appeared to be lying in darkness on a wooden floor .  there was a greasy smell in the air  which seemed familiar yet annoyingly unrecognizable .   as his eyes grew accustomed to the dark he could make out very faint lines of light  such as might surround a door .  he could also hear voices .   he tried to get up to his knees  and groaned as more pain crackled in his head .   when people tied you up it was bad news .  of course  it was much better news than when they killed you  but it could mean they were just putting you on one side for killing later .   this never used to happen  he told himself .  in the old days  if you caught someone thieving  you practically held the door open for him to escape .  that way  you got home in one piece .   by using the angle between a wall and a heavy crate he managed to get upright .  this was not much of an improvement on his former position  but after the thunder in his head had died away he hopped awkwardly towards the door .   there were still voices on the other side of it .   someone apart from sergeant colon was in trouble .         clown .  you got me here for this .  there   s a werewolf in the watch .  ah ha .  not one of your freaks .  she   s a proper bimorphic .  if you tossed a coin  she could smell what side it came down .         how about if we kill him and drag his body away .         you think she couldn   t smell the difference between a corpse and a living body .      sergeant colon moaned softly .      er  how about we could march him out in the fog    .         and they can smell fear  idiot .  ah ha .  why couldn   t you have let him look around .  what could he have seen .  i know that copper .  a fat old coward with all the brains of  ah ha  a pig .  he stinks of fear all the time .      sergeant colon hoped he wasn   t about to stink of anything else .      send meshugah after him  ah ha .         are you sure .  it   s getting odd .  it wanders off and screams in the night  and they   re not supposed to do that .  and it   s cracking up .  trust dumb golems not to do something prop           everyone knows you can   t trust golems .  ah ha .  see to it .         i heard that vimes is           i   ve seen to vimes .      colon eased himself away from the door as quietly as possible .  he hadn   t the faintest idea what this thing called meshugah the golems had made was  except that it sounded like a fine idea to be wherever it wasn   t .   now  if he were a resourceful type  like sam vimes or captain carrot  he   d   find a nail or something to snap these ropes  wouldn   t he .  they were really tight  and cut into his wrists because the cord was so thin  little more than string wound and knotted many times .  if he could find something to rub it on     but  unfortunately  and against all common sense  sometimes people inconsiderately throw their bound enemies into rooms entirely bereft of nails  handy bits of sharp stone  sharp edged shards of glass or even  in extreme cases  enough pieces of old junk and tools to make a fully functional armored car .   he managed to get on to his knees again and shuffled across the planks .  even a splinter would do .  a lump of metal .  a wide open doorway marked freedom .  he   d settle for anything .   what he got was a tiny circle of light on the floor .  a knothole in the wood had long ago fallen out  and light   dim orange light   was shining through .   colon got down and applied his eye to the hole .  unfortunately this also brought his nose into a similar proximity .   the stench was appalling .   there was a suggestion of wateriness  or at least of liquidity .  he must be over one of the numerous streams that flowed through the city  although they had of course been built over centuries before and were now used   if their existence was even re membered   for those purposes to which humanity had always put clean fresh water  i . e .   making it as turbid and undrinkable as possible .  and this one was flowing under the cattle markets .  the smell of ammonia bored into colon   s sinuses like a drill .   and yet there was light down there .   he held his breath and took another look .   a couple of feet below him was a very small raft .  half a dozen rats were laid neatly on it  and a minute scrap of candle was burning .   a tiny rowing boat entered his vision .  a rat was in the bottom of it and  sitting amidships and rowing  was        wee mad arthur .      the gnome looked up .     who   s that there  then .         it   s me  your good old mate fred colon .  can you give me a hand .         wha   re yez doing up there .         i   m all tied up and they   re going to kill me .  why does it smell so bad .            s the old cockbill stream .  all the cattle pens drain into it .     wee mad arthur grinned .     yez can feel it doing yer tubes a power of good  eh .  just call me king of the golden river  eh .         they   re going to kill me  arthur .  don   t piss about .         aha  good one .      desperate cells flared in colon   s mind .     i   ve been on the trail of those blokes who   re poisoning your rats     he said .      the ratcatchers    guild .     snarled arthur  almost dropping an oar .     i knew it was them  right .  this is where i got them rats .  there   s more of    em down here  dead as doornails .         right .  and i   ve got to give the names to commander vimes .  in person .  with all my arms and legs on .  he   s very particular about that sort of thing .         did yez know yez on a trapdoor .     said arthur .     wait right there .      arthur rowed out of sight .  colon rolled over .  after a while there was a scratching noise in the walls and then someone kicked him in the ear .      ow .         would there be any money in this .     said wee mad arthur  holding up his stub of candle .  it was a small one  such as might be put on a child   s birthday cake .      what about your public duty .         aye  so there   s no money in this .         lots .  i promise .  now untie me .         this is string they   ve used     said arthur  somewhere around colon   s hands .     not proper rope at all .      colon felt his hands free  although there was still pressure around his wrists .      where   s the trapdoor .     he said .      yer on it .  handy for dumping stuff .  dunt look as if it been used for years  from underneath .  hey  i been finding dead rats everywhere down there now .  fat as yer head and twice as dead .  i thought the ones i caught for gimlet were a wee bit sluggish .      there was a twang and colon   s legs were free .  he sat up cautiously and tried to massage some life back into them .      is there any other way out .     he said .      plenty for me  none for a silly bigger like yez     said wee mad arthur .     yer   ll have to swim for it .         you want me to drop into that .         don   t yez worry  yez can   t drown in it .         you sure .         yeah .  but yez may suffocate .  yer know that creek they talk about .  the one yez can be up without no paddle .         that   s not this one  is it .     said colon .      it   s coz of the cattle pens     said wee mad arthur .     cattle penned up is always a bit nervous .         i know how they feel .      there was a creak outside the door .  colon managed to get to his feet .   the door opened .   a figure filled the doorway .  it was in silhouette because of the light behind it  but colon looked up into two triangular glowing eyes .   colon   s body  which in many respects was considerably more intelligent than the mind it had to carry around  took over .  it made use of the adrenalinfed start the brain had given it and leapt several feet in the air  pointing its toes as it came down so that the iron tips of colon   s boots hit the trapdoor together .   the filth of years and the rust of iron gave way .   colon went through .  fortunately his body had the foresight to hold its own nose as he hit the much maligned stream  which went   gloop .   many people  when they   re precipitated into water  struggle to breathe .  sergeant colon struggled not to .  the alternative was too horrible to think about .   he rose again  buoyed up in part by various gases released from the ooze .  a few feet away  the candle on wee mad arthur   s rocking raft started to burn with a blue flame .   someone landed on his helmet and kicked it like a man spurs on a horse .      right turn .  forward .      half walking  half swimming  colon struggled down the fetid drain .  terror lent him strength .  it would demand repayment with interest later but  for now  he left a wake .  which took several seconds to close up after him .      he didn   t stop until a sudden lack of pressure overhead told him that he was in the open air .  he grabbed in the darkness  found the greasy pilings of a jetty  and clung to them  wheezing .      what was that thing .     said wee mad arthur .      golem     colon panted .   he managed to get a hand on to the planks of the jetty  tried to pull himself up  and sagged back into the water .      hey  did i just hear something .     said wee mad arthur .   sergeant colon rose like an undersea launched missile and landed on the jetty  where he folded up .      nah  just a bird or something     said wee mad arthur .      what do your friends call you  wee mad arthur .     muttered colon .      dunno .  ain   t got none .         gosh  that   s surprising .          lord de nobbes had a lot of friends now .     up the hatch .  here   s looking at your bottom .     he said .   there were shrieks of laughter .   nobby grinned happily in the middle of the crowd .  he couldn   t remember when he had enjoyed himself so much with all his clothes on .   in the far corner of lady selachii   s drawing room a door closed discreetly and  in the comfortable smoking room beyond  anonymous people sat down in leather armchairs and looked at one another expectantly .   finally one said     it   s astonishing .  frankly astonishing .  the man has actually got charisn   tma .         your meaning .         i mean he   s so dreadful he fascinates people .  like those stories he was telling   did you notice how people kept encouraging him because they couldn   t actually believe anyone would tell jokes like that in mixed company .         actually  i rather liked the one about the very small man playing the piano           and his table manners .  did you notice them .         no .         ex actly .         and the smell  don   t forget the smell .         not so much bad as   odd .         actually  i found that after a few minutes the nose shuts down and then it   s           my point is that  in some strange way  he attracts people .         like a public hanging .      there was a period of reflective silence .      good humored little tit  though  in his way .         not too bright  though .         give him his pint of beer and a plate of whatever those things with toenails were and he seems as happy as a pig in muck .         i think that   s somewhat insulting .         i   m sorry .         i   ve known some splendid pigs .         indeed .         but i can certainly see him drinking his beer and eating feet while he signs the royal proclamations .         yes  indeed .  er .  do you think he can read .         does it matter .      there was some more silence  filled with the busy racing of minds .   then someone said     another thing   we won   t have to worry about establishing a royal succession that might be inconvenient .         why do you think that .         can you see any princess marrying him .         we ell   they have been known to kiss frogs           frogs  i grant you .            and  of course  power and royalty are powerful aphrodisiacs           how powerful  would you say .      more silence .  then     probably not that powerful .         he should do nicely .         splendid .         dragon did well .  i suppose the little tit isn   t really an earl  by any chance .         don   t be silly .          cheri littlebottom sat awkwardly on the high stool behind the desk .  all she had to do  she   d been told  was check the patrols off  and on duty when the shift changed .   a few of the men gave her an odd look but they said nothing  and she was beginning to relax when the four dwarfs on the king   s way beat came in .   they stared at her .  and her ears .   their eyes traveled downwards .  there was no such concept as a modesty panel in ankh morpork .  all that was usually visible under the desk was the bottom half of sergeant colon .  of the large number of good reasons for shielding the bottom half of sergeant colon from view  its potential for engendering lust was not among the top ten .      that   s   female clothes  isn   t it .     said one of the dwarfs .   cheri swallowed .  why now .  she   d sort of assumed angua would be around .  people always calmed down when she smiled at them   it was really amazing .      well .     she quavered .     so what .  i can if i want to .         and   on your ear           well .         that   s   my mother never even   urgh   that   s disgusting .  in public  too .  what happens if kids come in .         i can see your ankles .     said another dwarf .      i   m going to speak to captain carrot about this .     said the third .     i never thought i   d live to see the day .      two of the dwarfs stormed off towards the locker room .  another one hurried after them  but hesitated as he drew level with the desk .  he gave cheri a frantic look .      er   er   nice ankles  though     he said  and then ran .   the fourth dwarf waited until the others had gone and then sidled up .   cheri was shaking with nervousness .     don   t you say a thing about my legs .     she said  waving a finger .      er       the dwarf looked around hurriedly  and leaned forward .     er   is that   lipstick .         yes .  what about it .         er       the dwarf leaned forward even more  looked around again  this time conspiratorially  and lowered her voice .     er   could i try it .          angua and carrot walked silently through the fog  except for angua   s occasional crisp and brief directions .   then she stopped .  up until then dorfl   s scent  or at least the fresh scent of old meat and cow dung  had headed quite directly back to the slaughterhouse district .      it   s gone up this alley     she said .     that   s nearly doubling back .  and   it was moving faster   and   there   s a lot of humans and   sausages .      carrot started to run .  a lot of people and the smell of sausages meant a performance of the street theater that was life in ankh morpork .   there was a crowd further up the alley .  it had obviously been there for some time  because at the rear was a familiar figure with a tray  craning to see over the tops of the heads .      what   s going on  mr .  dibbler .     said carrot .      oh  hello  cap   n .  they   ve got a golem .         who have .         oh  some blokes .  they   ve just fetched the hammers .      there was a press of bodies in front of carrot .  he put both hands together and rammed them between a couple of people  and then moved them apart .  grunting and struggling  the crowd opened up like a watercourse in front of the better class of prophet .   dorfl was standing at bay at the end of the alley .  three men with hammers were approaching the golem cautiously  in the way of mobs  each unwilling to strike the first blow in case the second blow came right back at him .   the golem was crouching back  shielding itself with its slate on which was written   i am worth     dollars     money .     said one of the men .     that   s all you things think about .      the slate shattered under a blow .   then he tried to raise his hammer again .  when it didn   t budge he very nearly somersaulted backwards .      money is all you can think about when all you have is a price     said carrot calmly  twisting the hammer out of his grip .     what do you think you   re doing  my friend .         you can   t stop us .     mumbled the man .     everyone knows they   re not alive .         but i can arrest you for willful damage to property     said carrot .      one of these killed that old priest .         sorry .     said carrot .     if it   s just a thing  how can it commit murder .  a sword is a thing      he drew his own sword  it made an almost silken sound      and of course you couldn   t possibly blame a sword if someone thrust it at you  sir .      the man went cross eyed as he tried to focus on the sword .   and  again  angua felt that touch of bewilderment .  carrot wasn   t threatening the man .  he wasn   t threatening the man .  he was merely using the sword to demonstrate a   well  a point .  and that was all .  he   d be quite amazed to hear that not everyone would think of it like that .   part of her said  someone has to be very complex indeed to be as simple as carrot .   the man swallowed .      good point     he said .      yeah  but   you can   t trust    em     said one of the other hammer bearers .     they sneak around and they never say anything .  what are they up to  eh .      he gave dorfl a kick .  the golem rocked slightly .      well  now     said carrot .     that is what i am finding out .  in the meantime  i must ask you to go about your business        the third demolition man had only recently arrived in the city and had gone along with the idea because there are some people who do .   he raised his hammer defiantly and opened his mouth to say     oh  yeah .     but stopped  because just by his ear he heard a growl .  it was quite low and soft  but it had a complex little waveform which went straight down into a little knobbly bit in his spinal column where it pressed an ancient button marked primal terror .   he turned .  an attractive watchwoman behind him gave him a friendly smile .  that was to say  her mouth turned up at the corners and all her teeth were visible .   he dropped the hammer on his foot .      well done     said carrot .     i   ve always said you can do more with a kind word and a smile .      the crowd looked at him with the kind of expression people always wore when they looked at carrot .  it was the face cracking realization that he really did believe what he was saying .  the sheer enormity tended to leave people breathless .   they backed away and scurried out of the alley .   carrot turned back to the golem  which had dropped to its knees and was trying to piece its slate together .      come on  mr .  dorfl     he said .     we   ll walk with you the rest of the way .          are you mad .     said sock  trying to shut the door .     you think i want that back .         he   s your property     said carrot .     people were trying to smash him .         you should   ve let them     said the butcher .     haven   t you heard the stories .  i   m not having one of those under my roof .      he tried to slam the door again  but carrot   s foot was in it .      then i   m afraid you   re committing an offense     said carrot .     to wit  littering .         oh  be serious .         i always am     said carrot .      he always is     said angua .   sock waved his hands frantically .     it can just go away .  shoo .  i don   t want a killer working in my slaughterhouse .  you have it  if you   re so keen .      carrot grabbed the door and forced it wide open .  sock took a step backwards .      are you trying to bribe an officer of the law  mr .  sock .         are you insane .         i am always sane     said carrot .      he always is     sighed angua .      watchmen are not allowed to accept gifts     said carrot .  he looked around at dorfl  which was standing forlornly in the street .     but i will buy him from you .  for a fair price .      sock looked from carrot to the golem and then back again .     buy .  for money .         yes .      the butcher shrugged .  when people were offering you money it was no time to debate their sanity .     well  that   s different     he conceded .     it was worth      when i bought it  but of course it   s got additional skills now        angua growled .  it had been a trying evening and the smell of fresh meat was making her senses twang .     you were prepared to give it away a moment ago .         well  give  yes  but business is busi           i   ll pay you a dollar     said carrot .      a dollar .  that   s daylight robb        angua   s hand shot out and grabbed his neck .  she could feel the veins  smell his blood and fear   she tried to think of cabbages .      it   s night time     she growled .   like the man in the alley  sock listened to the call of the wild .     a dollar     he croaked .     right .  a fair price .  one dollar .      carrot produced one .  and waved his notebook .      a receipt is very important     he said .     a proper legal transfer of ownership .         right .  right .  right .  happy to oblige .      sock glanced desperately at angua .  somehow  her smile didn   t look right .  he scribbled a few hasty lines .   carrot looked over his shoulder .       i gerhardt sock give the barer full and totarl ownorship of the golem dorfl in xchange for one dolar and anythinge it doz now is his responsibility and nuthing to doe with me    singed  gerhardt sock         interesting wording  but it does look legal  doesn   t it .     said carrot  taking the paper .     thank you very much  mr .  sock .  a happy solution all round  i feel .         is that it .  can i go now .         certainly  and        the door slammed shut .      oh  well done     said angua .     so now you own a golem .  you do know that anything it does is your responsibility .         if that   s the truth  why are people smashing them .         what are you going to use it for .      carrot looked thoughtfully at dorfl  who was staring at the ground .      dorfl .      the golem looked up .      here   s your receipt .  you don   t have to have a master .      the golem took the little scrap of paper between two thick fingers .      that means you belong to you     said carrot encouragingly .     you own yourself .      dorfl shrugged .      what did you expect .     said angua .     did you think he was going to wave a flag .         i don   t think he understands     said carrot .     it   s quite hard to get some ideas into people   s heads       he stopped abruptly .   carrot took the paper out of dorfl   s unresisting fingers .     i suppose it might work     he said .     it seems a bit invasive .  but what they understand  after all  is the words in their heads        he reached up  opened dorfl   s lid  and dropped the paper inside .   the golem blinked .  that is to say  its eyes went dark and then brightened again .  it raised one hand very slowly and patted the top of its head .  then it held up the other hand and turned it this way and that  as if it had never seen a hand before .  it looked down at its feet and around at the fog shrouded buildings .  it looked at carrot .  it looked up at the clouds above the street .  it looked at carrot again .   then  very slowly  without bending in any way  it fell backwards and hit the cobbles with a thud .  the light faded in its eyes .      there     said angua .     now it   s broken .  can we go .         there   s still a bit of a glow     said carrot .     it must have all been too much for him .  we can   t leave him here .  maybe if i took the receipt out        he knelt down by the golem and reached for the trapdoor on its head .   dorfl   s hand moved so quickly it didn   t even appear to move .  it was just there  gripping carrot   s wrist .      ah     said carrot  gently pulling his arm back .     he   s obviously   feeling better .         thsssss     said dorfl .  the voice of the golem shivered in the fog .   golems had a mouth .  they were part of the design .  but this one was open  revealing a thin line of red light .      oh  ye gods     said angua  backing away .     they can   t speak .         thssss .     it was less a syllable than the sound of escaping steam .      i   ll find your bit of slate       carrot began  looking around hurriedly .      thssss .      dorfl clambered to its feet  gently pushed him out of the way and strode off .      are you happy now .     said angua .     i   m not following the wretched thing .  maybe it   s going to throw itself in the river .      carrot ran a few steps after the figure  and then stopped and came back .      why do you hate them so much .     he said .      you wouldn   t understand .  i really think you wouldn   t understand     said angua .     it   s an   undead thing .  they   sort of throw in your face the fact you   re not human .         but you are human .         three weeks out of four .  can   t you understand that  when you have to be careful all the time  it   s dreadful to see things like that being accepted .  they   re not even alive .  but they can walk around and they never get people passing remarks about silver or garlic   up until now  anyway .  they   re just machines for doing work .         that   s how they   re treated  certainly     said carrot .      you   re being reasonable again .     snapped angua .     you   re deliberately seeing everyone   s point of view .  can   t you try to be unfair even once .          nobby had been left alone for a moment while the party buzzed around him  so he   d elbowed some waiters away from the buffet and was currently scraping out a bowl with his knife .      ah  lord de nobbes     said a voice behind him .   he turned .     wotcha     he said  licking the knife and wiping it on the tablecloth .      are you busy  my lord .         just making meself this meat paste sandwich     said nobby .      that   s p  t   de foie gras  my lord .            s that what it   s called .  it doesn   t have the kick of clammer   s beefymite spread  i know that .  want a quail   s egg .  they   re a bit small .         no  thank you           there   s loads of them     said nobby generously .     they   re free .  you don   t have to pay .         even so           i can get six in my mouth at once .  watch           amazing  my lord .  i was wondering  however  whether you would care to join a few of us in the smoking room .         fghmf .  mfgmf fgmf mgghjf .         indeed .     a friendly arm was put around nobby   s shoulders and he was adroitly piloted away from the buffet  but not before he had grabbed a plate of chicken legs .     so many people want to talk to you           mgffmph .          sergeant colon tried to clean himself up  but trying to clean yourself up with water from the ankh was a difficult maneuver .  the best you could hope for was an allover gray .   fred colon hadn   t reached vimes   s level of sophisticated despair .  vimes took the view that life was so full of things happening erratically in all directions that the chances of any of them making some kind of relevant sense were remote in the extreme .  colon  being by nature more optimistic and by intellect a good deal slower  was still at the clues are important stage .   why had he been tied up with string .  there were still loops of it around his arms and legs .      you sure you don   t know where i was .     he said .      yez walked into the place     said wee mad arthur  trotting along beside him .     how come yez don   t know .            cos it was dark and foggy and i wasn   t paying attention  that   s why .  i was just going through the motions .         aha  good one .         don   t mess about .  where was i .         don   t ask me     said wee mad arthur .     i just hunts under the whole cattle market area .  i don   t bother about what   s up top .  like i said  them runs go everywhere .         anyone along there make string .         it   s all animal stuff  i tell yez .  sausages and soap and stuff like that .  is this the bit where yez gives me the money .      colon patted his pockets .  they squelched .      you   ll have to come to the watch house  wee mad arthur .         i got a business to run here .         i   m swearin    you in as a special watchman for the night     said colon .      what   s the pay .         dollar a night .      wee mad arthur   s tiny eyes gleamed .  they gleamed red .      ye gods  you look awful     said colon .     what   re you looking at my ear for .      wee mad arthur said nothing .   colon turned .   a golem was standing behind him .  it was taller than any he   d seen before  and much better proportioned   a human statue rather than the gross shape of the usual golems  and handsome  too  in the cold way of a statue .  and its eyes shone like red searchlights .   it raised a fist above its head and opened its mouth .  more red light streamed out .   it screamed like a bull .   wee mad arthur kicked colon on the ankle .      are we running or what .     he said .   colon backed away  still staring at the thing .      it   s   it   s all right  they can   t move fast       he muttered .  and then his sensible body gave up on his stupid brain and fired up his legs  spinning him around and shoving him in the opposite direction .   he risked looking over his shoulder .  the golem was running after him in long  easy strides .   wee mad arthur caught him up .   colon was used to proceeding gently .  he wasn   t built for high speeds  and said so .     and you certainly can   t run faster than that thing .     he wheezed .      just so long as i can run faster   n yez     said wee mad arthur .     this way .      there was a flight of old wooden stairs against the side of a warehouse .  the gnome went up them like the rats he hunted .  colon  panting like a steam engine  followed him .   he stopped half way up and looked around .   the golem had reached the bottom step .  it tested it carefully .  the wood creaked and the whole stairway  gray with age  trembled .      it won   t take the weight .     said wee mad arthur .     the bugger   s gonna smash it up .  yeah .      the golem took another step .  the wood groaned .   colon got a grip on himself and hurried on up the stairs .   behind him  the golem seemed to have satisfied itself that the wood could indeed take its weight  and started to leap from step to step .  the rails shook under colon   s hands and the whole structure swayed .      come on  will yez .     said wee mad arthur  who had already reached the top .     it   s gaining on yez .      the golem lunged .  the stairs gave way .  colon flung out his hands and grabbed the edge of the roof .  then his body thudded into the side of the building .   there was the distant sound of woodwork hitting cobbles .      come on then     said wee mad arthur .     pull yourself up  yer silly bugger .         can   t     said colon .      why not .         it   s holding on to my foot               a cigar  your lordship .         brandy  my lord .      lord de nobbes sat back in the comfort of his chair .  his feet only just reached the ground .  brandy and cigars  eh .  this was the life all right .  he took a deep puff at the cigar .      we were just talking  my lord  about the future governance of the city now that poor lord vetinari   s health is so bad        nobby nodded .  this was the kind of thing you talked about when you were a nob .  this was what he   d been born for .   the brandy was giving him a pleasant warm feeling .      it would obviously upset the current equilibrium if we looked for a new patrician at this point     said another armchair .     what is your view  lord de nobbes .         oh  yeah .  right .  the guilds   d fight like cats in a sack     said nobby .     everyone knows that .         a masterly summary  if i may say so .      there was a general murmur of agreement from the other chairs .   nobby grinned .  oh  yes .  this was the bee   s pyjamas and no mistake .  hobnobbing with his fellow nobs  talking big talk about important matters instead of having to think up reasons why the tea money tin was empty   oh  yes .   a chair said     besides  are any of the guild leaders up to the task .  oh  they can organize a bunch of tradesmen  but ruling an entire city   i think not .  gentlemen  perhaps it is time for a new direction .  perhaps it is time for blood to reveal itself .      odd way of putting it  nobby thought  but clearly this was how you were supposed to speak .      at a time like this     said a chair     the city will surely look at those representatives of its most venerable families .  it would be in all our interests if such a one would take up the burden .         he   d need his head examined  if you want my opinion     said nobby .  he took another swig of the brandy and waved the cigar expansively .      still  not to worry     he said .     everyone knows we   ve got a king hanging around .  no problem there .  send for captain carrot  that   s my advice .          another evening folded over the city in layers of fog .   when carrot arrived back at the watch house corporal littlebottom made a face at him and indicated  with a flicker of her eyes  the three people sitting grimly on the bench against one wall .      they want to see an officer .     she hissed .     but s   arnt colon isn   t back and i knocked on mister vimes   s door and i don   t think he   s in .      carrot composed his features into a welcoming smile .      mrs .  palm     he said .     and mr .  boggis   and dr .  downey .  i am so sorry .  we   re rather stretched at present  what with the poisoning and this business with the golems        the head of the assassin   s guild smiled  but only with his mouth .     it   s about the poisoning we wish to speak     he said .     is there somewhere a little less public .         well  there   s the canteen     said carrot .     it   ll be empty at this time of night .  if you   d just step this way           you do well for yourselves here  i must say     said mrs .  palm .     a canteen        she stopped as she stepped through the door .      people eat in here .     she said .      well  grumble about the coffee  mostly     said carrot .     and write their reports .  commander vimes is keen on reports .         captain carrot     said dr .  downey  firmly     we have to talk to you on a grave matter concerning   what have i sat in .      carrot brushed a chair hurriedly .     sorry  sir  we don   t seem to have much time to clean up           leave it for now  leave it for now .      the head of the assassins    guild leaned forward with his hands pressed together .      captain carrot  we are here to discuss this terrible matter of the poisoning of lord vetinari .         you really ought to talk to commander vimes           i believe that on a number of occasions commander vimes has made derogatory comments to you about lord vetinari     said dr .  downey .      you mean like    he ought to be hung except they can   t find a twisty enough rope    .     said carrot .     oh  yes .  but everyone does that .         do you .         well  no     carrot admitted .      and i believe he personally took over the investigation of the poisoning .         well  yes .  but           didn   t you think that was odd .         no  sir .  not when i thought about it .  i think he   s got a sort of soft spot for the patrician  in his way .  he once said that if anyone was going to kill vetinari he   d like it to be him .         indeed .         but he was smiling when he said it .  sort of smiling  anyway .         he  er  visits his lordship most days  i believe .         yes  sir .         and i understand that his efforts to discover the poisoner have not reached any conclusions .         not as such  sir     said carrot .     we   ve found a lot of ways he   s not being poisoned .      downey nodded at the others .     we would like to inspect the commander   s office     he said .      i don   t know if that   s       carrot began .      please think very carefully     said dr .  downey .     we three represent most of the guilds of this city .  we feel we have a good reason for inspecting the commander   s office .  you will of course accompany us to see that we do nothing illegal .      carrot looked awkward .     i suppose   if i   m with you       he said .      that   s right     said downey .     that makes it official .      carrot led the way .     i don   t even know  if he   s back     he said  opening the door .     as i said  we   ve been   oh .      downey peered around him and at the figure slumped over the desk .      it would appear that sir samuel is in     he said .     but quite out of it .         i can smell the drink from here     said mrs .  palm .     it   s terrible what drink will do to a man .         a whole bottle of bearhugger   s finest     said mr .  boggis .     all right for some  eh .         but he hasn   t touched a drop all year .     said carrot  giving the recumbent vimes a shake .     he goes to meetings about it and everything .         now let us see       said downey .   he pulled open one of the desk drawers  and held it open .      captain carrot .     he said .     can you witness that there appears to be a bag of grayish powder in here .  i will now        vimes   s hand shot out and slammed the drawer on the man   s fingers .  his elbow rammed back into the assassin   s stomach and  as downey   s chin jerked down  vimes    arm swung upwards and caught him full on the nose .   then vimes opened his eyes .      wassat .  wassat .     he said  raising his head .     dr .  downey .  mr .  boggis .  carrot .  hmm .         hwat .  hwat .     screamed downey .     you hns fruck me .         oh  i   m so sorry     said vimes  concern radiating from every feature as he pushed the chair back into downey   s groin and stood up .     i   m afraid i must have dropped off and  of course  when i woke up and found someone stealing from           you   re raving drunk  man .     said mr .  boggis .   vimes   s features froze .      indeed .  peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers     he snarled  prodding the man in the chest .     a peck of bloody pickled peppers peter piper damn    well picked .  do you want me to continue .     he said  poking the man until his back was against the wall .     it doesn   t get much better .         hwhat about thif packet .     shouted downey  clutching his streaming nose with one hand and waving at the desk with the other .   vimes still wore a wild eyed mirthless grin .     ah  well  yes     he said .     you   ve got me there .  a highly dangerous substance .         ah  you admit it .         yes  indeed .  i suppose i have no alternative but to dispose of the evidence       vimes grabbed the packet  ripped it open and tipped most of the contents into his mouth .      mmm mmm     he said  powder spraying everywhere as he masticated .     feel that tingle on the tongue .         but that   s arsenic     said boggis .      good gods  is it .     said vimes  swallowing .     amazing .  i   ve got this dwarf downstairs  you know  clever little bugger  spends all his time with pipes and chemicals and things to find out what is arsenic and what isn   t  and all the time here   s you able to spot it just by looking .  i   ve got to hand it to you .      he dropped the torn packet into boggis   s hand  but the thief jerked back and the packet tumbled to the floor  spraying its contents .      excuse me     said carrot .  he knelt down and peered at the powder .   it is traditionally the belief of policemen that they can tell what a substance is by sniffing it and then gingerly tasting it  but this practice had ceased in the watch ever since constable flint had dipped his finger into a blackmarket consignment of ammonium chloride cut with radium  said    yes  this is definitely slab wurble wurble sclup     and had to spend three days tied to his bed until the spiders went away .   nevertheless  carrot said     i   m sure this isn   t poisonous     licked his finger and tried a bit .      it   s sugar     he said .   downey  his composure severely compromised  waved a finger at vimes .     you admitted it was dangerous .     he screamed .      right .  take too much of it and see what it does to your teeth .     bellowed vimes .     what did you think it was .         we had information       boggis began .      oh  you had information  did you .     said vimes .     you hear that  captain .  they had information .  so that   s all right .         we acted in good faith     said boggis .      let me see     said vimes .     your information was something on the lines of  vimes is dead drunk in the watch house and he   s got a bag of arsenic in his desk .  and i   ll just bet you wanted to act in good faith  eh .      mrs .  palm cleared her throat .     this has gone far enough .  you are correct  sir samuel     she said .     we were all sent a note .     she handed a slip of paper to vimes .  it had been written in capitals .     and i can see we have been misinformed     she added  glaring at boggis and downey .     do allow me to apologize .  come  gentlemen .      she swept out of the door .  boggis followed her quickly .   downey dabbed at his nose .     what   s the guild price on your head  sir samuel .     he said .      twenty thousand dollars .         really .  i think we shall definitely have to upgrade you .         delighted .  i shall have to buy a new beartrap .         i   ll  er  show you out     said carrot .   when he hurried back he found vimes leaning out of the window and feeling the wall below it .      not a brick dislodged     vimes muttered .     not a tile loose   and the front office has been manned all day .  odd  that .      he shrugged and walked back to his desk  where he picked up the note .      and i shouldn   t think we   ll be able to find any clues on this     he said .     there   s too many greasy fingermarks all over it .     he put down the paper and glared at carrot .     when we find the man responsible     he said     somewhere at the top of the charge sheet is going to be forcing commander vimes to tip a whole bottle of single malt on to the carpet .  that   s a hanging offense .     he shuddered .  there were some things a man should not have to do .      it   s disgusting .     said carrot .     fancy them even thinking that you   d poison the patrician .         i   m offended that they think i   d be daft enough to keep the poison in my desk drawer     said vimes  lighting a cigar .      right     said carrot .     did they think you were some kind of fool who   d keep evidence like that where anyone could find it .         exactly     said vimes  leaning back .     that   s why i   ve got it in my pocket .      he put his feet on the desk and blew out a cloud of smoke .  he   d have to get rid of the carpet .  he wasn   t going to spend the rest of his life working in a room haunted by the smell of departed spirits .   carrot   s mouth was still open .      oh  good grief     said vimes .     look  it   s quite simple  man .  i was expected to go    at last  alcohol .      and chugalug the lot without thinking .  then some respectable pillars of the community      he removed the cigar from his mouth and spat      were going to find me  in your presence  too   which was a nice touch   with the evidence of my crime neatly hidden but not so well hidden that they couldn   t find it .     he shook his head sadly .     the trouble is  you know  that once the taste   s got you it never lets go .         but you   ve been very good  sir     said carrot .     i   ve not seen you touch a drop for           oh  that     said vimes .     i was talking about policing  not alcohol .  there   s lots of people will help you with the alcohol business  but there   s no one out there arranging little meetings where you can stand up and say     my name is sam and i   m a really suspicious bastard .         he pulled a paper bag out of his pocket .     we   ll get littlebottom to have a look at this     he said .     i damn    sure wasn   t going to try tasting it .  so i nipped down to the canteen and filled a bag with sugar out of the bowl .  it was but the work of a moment to fish nobby   s butts out of it  i might add .     he opened the door  poked his head out into the corridor and yelled     littlebottom .     to carrot he added     you know  i feel quite perked up .  the old brain has begun to work at last .  you know the golem that did the killing .         yes  sir .         ah  but do you know what was special about it .         can   t think  sir     said carrot     except that it was a new one .  the golems made it themselves  i think .  but of course they needed a priest for the words and they had to borrow mr .  hopkinson   s oven .  i expect the old men thought it would be interesting .  they were historians  after all .      it was vimes   s turn to stand there with his mouth open .   finally he got control of himself .     yes  yes  of course     he said  his voice barely shaking .     yes  i mean  that   s obvious .  plain as the nose on your face .  but   er  have you worked out what else is special about it .     he added  trying to keep any traces of hope out of his voice .      you mean the fact it   s gone mad  sir .         well  i didn   t think it was winner of the ankh morpork mr .  sanity award .     said vimes .      i mean they drove it mad  sir .  the other golems .  they didn   t mean to  but it was built in  sir .  they wanted it to do so many things .  it was like their   child  i think .  all their hopes and dreams .  and when they found out it   d been killing people   well  that   s terrible to a golem .  they mustn   t kill  and it was their own clay doing it           it   s not a great idea for people  either .         but they   d put all their future in it           you wanted me  commander .     said cheri .      oh  yes .  is this arsenic .     said vimes  handing her the packet .   cheri sniffed at it .     it could be arsenous acid  sir .  i   ll have to test it  of course .         i thought acids sloshed about in jars     said vimes .     er   what   s that on your hands .         nail varnish  sir .         nail varnish .         yes  sir .         er   fine  fine .  funny  i thought it would be green .         wouldn   t look good on the fingers  sir .         i meant the arsenic  littlebottom .         oh  you can get all sorts of colors of arsenic  sir .  the sulphides   that   s the ores  sir   can be red or brown or yellow or gray  sir .  and then you cook them up with nitre and you get arsenous acid  sir .  and a load of nasty smoke  really bad .         dangerous stuff     said vimes .      not good at all  sir .  but useful  sir     said cheri .     tanners  dyers  painters   it   s not just prisoners that   ve got a use for arsenic .         i   m surprise people aren   t dropping dead of it all the time     said vimes .      oh  most of them use golems  sir        the words stayed in the air even after cheri stopped speaking .   vimes caught carrot   s eye and started to whistle hoarsely under his breath .  this is it  he thought .  this is where we   ve filled ourselves up with so many questions that they   re starting to overflow and become answers .   he felt more alive than he had for days .  the recent excitement still tingled in his veins  kicking his brain into life .  it was the sparkle you got with exhaustion  he knew .  you were so bone weary that a shot of adrenaline hit you like a falling troll .  they must have it all now .  all the bits .  the edges  the corners  the whole picture .  all there  just waiting to be pieced together        these golems     said carrot .     they   d be covered in arsenic  would they .         could be  sir .  i saw one at the alchemists    guild building in quirm and  hah  it   d even got arsenic plated on its hands  sir  on account of stirring crucibles with its fingers           they don   t feel heat     said vimes .      or pain     said carrot .      that   s right     said cheri .  she looked uncertainly from one to the other .      you can   t poison them     said vimes .      and they   ll obey orders     said carrot .     without speaking .         golems do all the really mucky jobs     said vimes .      you could have mentioned this before  cheri     said carrot .      well  you know  sir   golems are just there  sir .  no one notices golems .         grease under his fingernails     said vimes  to the room in general .     the old man scratched at his murderer .  grease under his fingernails .  with arsenic in it .      he looked down at the notebook  still on his desk .  it   s there  he thought .  something we haven   t seen .  but we   ve looked everywhere .  so we   ve seen the answer and haven   t seen that it is the answer .  and if we don   t see it now  at this moment  we   ll never see it at all        no offense  sir  but that   s probably not a help     said cheri   s voice somewhere in the distance .     so many of the trades that use arsenic involve some kind of grease .      something we don   t see  thought vimes .  something invisible .  no  it wouldn   t have to be invisible .  something we don   t see because it   s always there .  something that strikes in the night     and there it was .   he blinked .  the glittering stars of exhaustion were causing his mind to think oddly .  well  thinking rationally hadn   t worked .      no one move     he said .  he held up a hand for silence .     there it is     he said softly .     there .  on my desk .  you see it .         what  sir .     said carrot .      you mean you haven   t worked it out .     said vimes .      what  sir .         the thing that   s poisoning his lordship .  there it is   on the desk .  see .         your notebook .         no .         he drinks bearhugger   s whiskey .     said cheri .      i doubt it     said vimes .      the blotter .     said carrot .     poisoned pens .  a packet of pantweeds .         where   re they .     said vimes  patting his pockets .      just sticking out from under the letters in the in tray  sir     said carrot .  he added reproachfully     you know  sir  the ones you don   t answer .      vimes picked up the packet and extracted another cigar .     thanks     he said .     hah .  i didn   t ask mildred easy what else she took .  but of course they   re a servant   s little bonus  too .  and old mrs .  easy was a seamstress  a proper seamstress .  and this is autumn .  killed by the nights drawing in .  see .      carrot crouched down and looked at the surface of the desk .     can   t see it myself  sir     he said .      of course you can   t     said vimes .     because there   s nothing to see .  you can   t see it .  that   s how you can tell it   s there .  if it wasn   t there you   d soon see it .     he gave a huge manic grin .     only you wouldn   t .  see .         you all right  sir .     said carrot .     i know you   ve been overdoing it a bit these last few day           i   ve been underdoing it .     said vimes .     i   ve been running around looking for damn clues instead of just thinking for five minutes .  what is it i   m always telling you .         er   er   never trust anybody  sir .         no  not that .         er   er   everyone   s guilty of something  sir .         not that  either .         er   er   just because someone   s a member of an ethnic minority doesn   t mean they   re not a nasty small minded little jerk  sir .         n   when did i say that .         last week  sir .  after we   d had that visit from the campaign for equal heights  sir .         well  not that .  i mean   i   m pretty sure i   m always saying something else that   s very relevant here .  something pithy about police work .         can   t remember anything right now  sir .         well  i   ll damn    well make up something and start saying it a lot from now on .         jolly good  sir .     carrot beamed .     it   s good to see you   re your old self again  sir .  looking forward to kicking ar   to prodding buttock  sir .  er   what have we found  sir .         you   ll see .  we   re going to the palace .  fetch angua .  we might need her .  and bring the search warrant .         you mean the sledgehammer  sir .         yes .  and sergeant colon  too .         he hasn   t signed in again yet  sir     said cheri .     he should have gone off duty an hour ago .         probably hanging around somewhere  staying out of trouble     said vimes .       wee mad arthur peered over the edge of the wall .  somewhere below colon  two red eyes stared up at him .      heavy  is it .            s .         kick it with your other foot .      there was a sucking sound .  colon winced .  then there was a plop  a moment of silence  and a loud crash of pottery down in the street .      the boot it was holding came off     moaned colon .      how did that happen .         it got lubricated        wee mad arthur tugged at a finger .     up yez come  then .         can   t .         why not .  it ain   t holding on to yez no more .         arms tired .  another ten seconds and i   m gonna be a chalk outline           nah  no one   s got that much chalk .     wee mad arthur knelt down so that his head was level with colon   s eyes .     if you gonna die  d   yez mind signing a chitty to say yez promised me a dollar .      down below  there was a chink of pottery shards .      what was that .     said colon .     i thought the damn    thing smashed up        wee mad arthur looked down .     d   yez believe in that reincarnation stuff  mr .  colon .     he said .      you wouldn   t get me touching that foreign muck     said colon .      well  it   s putting itself together .  like one of them jiggling saw puzzles .         well done  wee mad arthur     said colon .     but i know you   re just saying that so   s i   ll make the effort to haul meself up  right .  statues don   t go putting themselves back together when they   re smashed up .         please yezself .  it   s done nearly a whole leg already .      colon managed to peer down through the small and smelly space between the wall and his armpit .  all he could see were shreds of fog and a faint glow .      you sure .     he said .      yez run around rat holes  yez learns to see good in the dark     said wee mad arthur .     otherwise yez dead .      something hissed  somewhere below colon   s feet .   with his one booted foot and his toes he scrabbled at the brickwork .      it   s having a wee bit o    trouble     said wee mad arthur conversationally .     looks like it   s put its knees on wrong way round .          dorfl sat hunched in the abandoned cellar where the golems had met .  occasionally the golem raised its head and hissed .  red light spilled from its eyes .  if something had streamed back down through the glow  soared through the eye sockets into the red sky beyond  there would be     dorfl huddled under the glow of the universe .  its murmur was a long way off  muted  nothing to do with dorfl .   the words stood around the horizon  reaching all the way to the sky .   and a voice said quietly     you own yourself .     dorfl saw the scene again and again  saw the concerned face  hand reaching up  filling its vision  felt the sudden icy knowledge           own yourself .      it echoed off the words  and then rebounded  and then rolled back and forth  increasing in volume until the little world between the words was gripped in the sound .   golem must have a master .  the letters towered against the world  but the echoes poured around them  blasting like a sandstorm .  cracks started and then ran  ziggaging across the stone  and then     the words exploded .  great slabs of them  mountain sized  crashed in showers of red sand .   the universe poured in .  dorfl felt the universe pick it up and bowl it over and then lift it off its feet and up        and now the golem was among the universe .  it could feel it all around  the purr of it  the busyness  the spinning complexity of it  the roar     there were no words between you and it .   you belonged to it  it belonged to you .   you couldn   t turn your back on it because there it was  in front of you .   dorfl was responsible for every tick and swerve of it .   you couldn   t say     i had orders .     you couldn   t say     it   s not fair .     no one was listening .  there were no words .  you owned yourself .   dorfl orbited a pair of glowing suns and hurtled off again .   not thou shalt not .  say i will not .   dorfl tumbled through the red sky  then saw a dark hole ahead .  the golem felt it dragging at him  and streamed down through the glow and the hole grew larger and sped across the edges of dorfl   s vision     the golem opened his eyes .   no master .   dorfl unfolded in one movement and stood upright .  he reached out one arm and extended a finger .   the golem pushed the finger easily into the wall where the argument had taken place  and then dragged it carefully through the splintering brickwork .  it took him a couple of minutes but it was something dorfl felt needed to be said .   dorfl completed the last letter and poked a row of three dots after it .  then the golem walked away  leaving behind   no master         a blue overcast from the cigars hid the ceiling of the smoking room .      ah  yes .  captain carrot     said a chair .     yes   indeed   but   is he the right man .            s got a birthmark shaped like a crown .  i seen it     said nobby helpfully .      but his background           he was raised by dwarfs     said nobby .  he waved his brandy glass at a waiter .     same again  mister .         i shouldn   t think dwarfs could raise anyone very high     said another chair .  there was a hint of laughter .      rumors and folklore     someone murmured .      this is a large and busy and above all complex city .  i   m afraid that having a sword and a birthmark are not much in the way of qualifications .  we would need a king from a lineage that is used to command .         like yours  my lord .      there was a sucking  draining noise as nobby attacked the fresh glass of brandy .     oh  i   m used to command  all right        he said  lowering the glass .     people are always orderin    me around .         we would need a king who had the support of the great families and major guilds of the city .         people like carrot     said nobby .      oh  the people           anyway  whoever got the job   d have his work cut out     said nobby .     ole vetinari   s always pushin    paper .  what kinda fun is that .     s no life  sittin    up all hours  worryin     never a moment to yerself .     he held out the empty glass .     same again  my old mate .  fill it right up this time  eh .  no sense in havin    a great big glass and only sloshing a bit in the bottom  is there .         many people prefer to savor the bouquet     said a quietly horrified chair .     they enjoy sniffing it .      nobby looked at his glass with the red veined eyes of one who   d heard rumors about what the upper crust got up to    nah     he said .     i   ll go on stickin    it in my mouth  if it   s all the same to you .         if we may get to the point     said another chair     a king would not have to spend every moment running the city .  he would of course have people to do that .  advisors .  counselors .  people of experience .         so what   d he have to do .     said nobby .      he   d have to reign     said a chair .      wave .         preside at banquets .         sign things .         guzzle good brandy disgustingly .         reign .         sounds like a good job to me     said nobby .     all right for some  eh .         of course  a king would have to be someone who could recognize a hint if it was dropped on his head from a great height     said a speaker sharply  but the other chairs shushed him into silence .   nobby managed to find his mouth after several goes and took another long pull at his cigar .     seems to me     he said     seems to me  what you want to do is find some nob with time on his hands and say     yo  it   s your lucky day .  let   s see you wave that hand .            ah .  that   s a good idea .  does any name cross your mind  my lord .  have a drop more brandy .         why  thanks  you   re a toff .  o    course  so    m i  eh .  that   s right  flunky  all the way to the top .  no  can   t think of anyone that fits the bill .         in fact  my lord  we were indeed thinking of offering the crown to you        nobby   s eyes bulged .  and then his cheek bulged .   it is not a good idea to spray finest brandy across the room  especially when your lighted cigar is in the way .  the flame hit the far wall  where it left a perfect chrysanthemum of scorched woodwork  while in accordance with a fundamental rule of physics nobby   s chair screamed back on its castors and thudded into the door .      king .     nobby coughed  and then they had to slap him on the back until he got his breath again .     king .     he wheezed .     and have mr .  vimes cut me head off .         all the brandy you can drink  my lord     said a wheedling voice .         s no good if you ain   t got a throat for it to go down .         what   re you talking about .         mr .  vimes   d go spare .  he   d go spare .         good heavens  man           my lord     someone corrected .      my lord  i mean   when you   re king you can tell that wretched sir samuel what to do .  you   ll be  as you would call it     the boss .     you could           tell ole stoneface what to do .     said nobby .      that   s right .         i   d be a king and tell ole stoneface what to do .     said nobby .      yes .      nobby stared into the smoky gloom .      he   d go spare .         listen  you silly little man           my lord           you silly little lord  you   d be able to have him executed if you wished .         i couldn   t do that .         why not .         he   d go spare .         the man calls himself an officer of the law  and whose law does he listen to  eh .  where does his law come from .         i don   t know .     groaned nobby .     he says it comes up through his boots .     he looked around .  the shadows in the smoke seemed to be closing in .      i can   t be king .  ole vimes   d go spare .         will you stop saying that .      nobby pulled at his collar .         s a bit hot and smoky in here     he mumbled .     which way   s the window .         over there        the chair rocked .  nobby hit the glass helmet first  landed on top of a waiting carriage  bounced off and ran into the night  trying to escape destiny in general and axes in particular .       cheri littlebottom strode into the palace kitchens and fired her crossbow into the ceiling .      don   t nobody move .     she yelled .   the patrician   s domestic staff looked up from their dinner .      when you say don   t nobody move     said drumknott carefully  fastidiously taking a piece of plaster off his plate     do you in fact mean    .         all right  corporal  i   ll take over now     said vimes  patting cheri on the shoulder .     is mildred easy here .      all heads turned .   mildred   s spoon dropped into her soup .      it   s all right     said vimes .     i just need to ask you a few more questions           i   m   s s sorry  sir           you haven   t done anything wrong     said vimes  walking around the table .     but you didn   t just take food home for your family  did you .         s sir .         what else did you take .      mildred looked at the suddenly blank expressions on the faces of the other servants .     there was the old sheets but mrs .  dipplock did s say i could have           no  not that     said vimes .   mildred licked her dry lips .     er  there was   there was some boot polish           look     said vimes  as kindly as possible     everyone takes small things from the place where they work .  small stuff that no one notices .  no one thinks of it as stealing .  it   s like   it   s like rights .  odds and ends .  ends  miss easy .  i   m thinking about the word    ends    .         er   you mean   the candle ends  sir .      vimes took a deep breath .  it was such a relief to be right  even though you knew you   d only got there by trying every possible way to be wrong .     ah .     he said .      b but that   s not stealing  sir .  i   ve never stolen nothing  s sir .         but you take home the candle stubs .  still half an hour of light in    em  i expect  if you burn them in a saucer .     said vimes gently .      but that   s not stealing  sir .  that   s perks  sir .      sam vimes smacked his forehead .     perks .  of course .  that was the word i was looking for .  perks .  everyone   s got to have perks  aren   t i right .  well  that   s fine  then     he said .     i expect you get the ones from the bedrooms  yes .      even through her nervousness  mildred easy was able to grin the grin of someone with an entitlement that lesser beings hadn   t got .     yessir .  i   m allowed  sir .  they   re much better than the ole coarse ones we use in the main halls  sir .         and you put in fresh candles when necessary  do you .         yessir .      probably slightly more often than necessary  vimes thought .  no point in letting them burn down too much        perhaps you can show me where they   re kept  miss .      the maid looked along the table to the housekeeper  who glanced at commander vimes and then nodded .  she was bright enough to know when something that sounded like a question really wasn   t one .      we keep them in the candle pantry next door  sir     said mildred .      lead the way  please .      it wasn   t a big room  but its shelves were stacked floor to ceiling with candles .  there were the yard high ones used in the public halls and the small everyday ones used everywhere else  sorted according to quality .      these are what we uses in his lordship   s rooms  sir .     she handed him twelve inches of white candle .      oh  yes   very good quality .  number fives .  nice white tallow     said vimes  tossing it up and down .     we burn these at home .  the stuff we use at the yard is damn    near pork dripping .  we get ours from carry   s in the shambles now .  very reasonable prices .  we used to deal with spadger and williams but mr .  carry   s really cornered the market these days  hasn   t he .         yessir .  and he delivers    em special  sir .         and you put these candles in his lordship   s room every day .         yessir .         anywhere else .         oh  no sir .  his lordship   s particular about that .  we just use number threes .         and you take your  er  perks home .         yessir .  gran said they gave a lovely light  sir           i expect she sat up with your little brother  did she .  because i expect he got took sick first  so she sat up with him all night long  night after night and  hah  if i know old mrs .  easy  she did her sewing           yessir .      there was a pause .      use my handkerchief     said vimes  after a while .      am i going to lose my position  sir .         no .  that   s definite .  no one involved deserves to lose their jobs     said vimes .  he looked at the candle .     except possibly me     he added .   he stopped at the doorway  and turned .     and if you ever want candle ends  we   ve always got lots at the watch house .  nobby   ll have to starting buying cooking fat like everyone else .             what   s it doing now .     said sergeant colon .   wee mad arthur peered over the edge of the roof again .     it   s havin    problems with its elbows     he said conversationally .     it keeps lookin    at one of    em and tryin    it all ways up and it   s not workin    .         i had that trouble when i put up them kitchen units for mrs .  colon     said the sergeant .     the instructions on how to open the box were inside the box           oh oh  it   s worked it out     said the rat catcher .     looks like it had it mixed up with its knees after all .      colon heard a clank below him .      and now its gone round the corner      there was a crash of splintering wood       and now it   s got into the building .  i expect it   ll come up the stairs  but it looks like yer   ll be ok .         why .            cos all you gotta do is let go of the roof  see .         i   ll drop to my death .         right .  nice clean way to go .  none of that    arms and legs bein    ripped off    stuff first .         i wanted to buy a farm .     moaned colon .      could be     said arthur .  he looked over the roof again .     or     he said  as if this were hardly a better option     yez could try to grab the drainpipe .      colon looked sideways .  there was a pipe a few feet away .  if he swung his body and really made an effort  he might just miss it by inches and plunge to his death .      does it look safe .     he said .      compared with what  mister .      colon tried to swing his legs like a pendulum .  every muscle in his arm screamed at him .  he knew he was overweight .  he   d always meant to take exercise one day .  he just hadn   t been aware that it was going to be today .      i reckon i can hear it walking up the stairs     said wee mad arthur .   colon tried to swing faster .      what   re you going to do .     he said .      oh  don   t yez worry about me     said wee mad arthur .     i   ll be fine .  i   ll jump .         jump .         sure .  i   ll be safe    cos of being normal sized  see .         you think you   re normal sized .      wee mad arthur looked at colon   s hands .     are these yer fingers right here by my boots .     he said .      right  right  you   re normal sized .     s not your fault you   ve moved into a city full of giants     said colon .      right .  the smaller yez are the lighter yez fall .  well known fact .  a spider   ll not even notice a drop like this  a mouse   d walk away  a horse   d break every bone in its body and a helephant would spla           oh  gods     muttered colon .  he could feel the drainpipe with his boot now .  but getting a grip would mean there would have to be one long  bottomless moment when he was not exactly holding on to the roof and not exactly holding on to the drainpipe and in very serious peril of holding on to the ground .   there was another crash from somewhere on the roof .      right     said wee mad arthur .     see you at the bottom .         oh  gods        the gnome stepped off the roof .      all ok so far     he shouted  as he went past colon .      oh  gods        sergeant colon looked up into two red glows .      doing fine up to now     said a dopplering voice from below .      oh  gods        colon heaved his legs around  stood on fresh air for a moment  grabbed the top of the pipe  ducked his head as a pottery fist swung at him  heard the nasty little noise as the pipe   s rusty bolts said goodbye to the wall and  still clinging to a tilting length of cast iron pipe as if it were going to help  disappeared backwards into the fog .       mr .  sock looked up at the sound of the door opening  and then cowered back against the sausage machine .      you .     he whispered .     here  you can   t come back .  i sold you .      dorfl regarded him steadily for a few seconds  and then walked past him and took the largest cleaver from the blood stained rack on the wall .   sock began to shake .      i i i was always g g good to you     he said .     a a always let you h have your h holy d d days off        dorfl stared at him again .  it   s only red light  sock gibbered to himself     but it seemed more focused .  he felt it entering his head though his own eyes and examining his soul .   the golem pushed him aside and stepped out of the slaughter house and towards the cattle pens .   sock unfroze .  they never fought back  did they .  they couldn   t .  it was how the damn    things were made .   he stared around at the other workers  humans and trolls alike .     don   t just stand there .  get it .      one or two hesitated .  it was a big cleaver in the golem   s hand .  and when dorfl stopped to look around at them there was something different about the golem   s stance  too .  it didn   t look like something that wouldn   t fight back .   but sock didn   t employ people for the muscles in their heads .  besides  no one had really liked a golem around the place .   a troll aimed a pole axe at him .  dorfl caught it one handed without turning his head and snapped the hickory handle with his fingers .  a man with a hammer had it plucked from his hand and thrown so hard at the wall that it left a hole .   after that they followed at a cautious distance .  dorfl took no notice of them .   the steam over the cattle pens mingled further with the fog .  hundreds of dark eyes watched dorfl curiously as it walked between the fences .  they were always quiet when the golem was around .   he stopped by one of the largest pens .  there were voices from behind .      don   t tell me it   s going to slaughter the lot of    em .  we   ll never get that lot jointed this shift .         i heard where there was one at a carpenter   s that went odd and made five thousand tables in one night .  lost count or something .         it   s just staring at them           i mean  five thousand tables .  one of them had twenty seven legs .  it got stuck on legs        dorfl brought the cleaver down hard and sliced the lock off the gate .  the cattle watched the golem  with that guarded expression which cattle have that means they   re waiting for the next thought to turn up .   he walked on to the sheep pens and opened them  too .  the pigs were next  and then the poultry .      all of them .     said mr .  sock .   the golem walked calmly back down the line of pens  ignoring the watchers  and re entered the slaughterhouse .  he came out very shortly afterwards leading the ancient and hairy billygoat on a piece of string .  he went past the waiting animals until he reached the wide gates that opened into the main road  which it opened .  then he let the goat loose .   the animal sniffed the air and rolled its slotted eyes .  then  apparently deciding that the distant odor of the cabbage fields beyond the city wall was much preferable to the smells immediately around it  it trotted away up the road .   the animals followed it in a rush  but with hardly any other noise than the rustle of movement and the sounds of their hooves .  they streamed around the stationary figure of dorfl  who stood and watched them go .   a chicken  bewildered by the stampede  landed on the golem   s head and started to cluck .   anger finally overcame sock   s terror .     what the hell are you doing .     he shouted  trying to field a few stray sheep as they bolted out of the pens .     that   s money walking out of the gate  you        dorfl   s hand was suddenly around his throat .  the golem picked him up and held the struggling man at arm   s length  turning its head this way and that as if considering its next course of action .   finally he tossed away the cleaver  reached up under the chicken that had taken up residence  and produced a small brown egg .  with apparent ceremony the golem smashed it carefully on sock   s scalp and dropped him .   the golem   s former co workers jumped back out of the way as dorfl walked back through the slaughterhouse .   there was a tally board by the entrance .  dorfl looked at it for a while  then picked up the chalk and wrote   no master     the chalk crumbled in its fingers .  dorfl walked out into the fog .       cheri looked up from her workbench .      the wick   s full of arsenous acid     she said .     well done  sir .  this candle even weighs slightly more than other candles .         what an evil way to kill anyone     said angua .      certainly very clever     said vimes .     vetinari sits up half the night writing  and in the morning the candle   s burned down .  poisoned by the light .  the light   s something you don   t see .  who looks at the light .  not some plodding old copper .         oh  you   re not that old  sir     said carrot  cheerfully .      what about plodding .         or that plodding  either     carrot added quickly .     i   ve always pointed out to people that you walk in a very purposeful and meaningful manner .      vimes gave him a sharp look and saw nothing more than a keen and innocently helpful expression .      we don   t look at the light because the light is what we look with     said vimes .     ok .  and now i think we should go and have a look at the candle factory  shouldn   t we .  you come  littlebottom  and bring your   have you got taller  littlebottom .         high heeled boots  sir     said cheri .      i thought dwarfs always wore iron boots           yes  sir .  but i   ve got high heels on mine  sir .  i welded them on .         oh .  fine .  right .     vimes pulled himself together .     well  if you can still totter  bring your alchemy stuff with you .  detritus should   ve come off duty from the palace .  when it comes to locked doors you can   t beat detritus   he   s a walking crowbar .  we   ll pick him up on the way .      he loaded his crossbow and lit a match .      right     he said .     we   ve done it the modern way  now let   s try policing like grandfather used to do it .  it   s time to           prod buttock  sir .     said carrot  hurriedly .      close     said vimes  taking a deep drag and blowing out a smoke ring     but no cigar .          sergeant colon   s view of the world was certainly changing .  just when something was about to fix itself firmly in his mind as the worst moment of his entire life  it was hurriedly replaced by something even nastier .   firstly  the drainpipe he was riding hit the wall of the building opposite .  in a well organized world he might have landed on a fire escape  but fire escapes were unknown in ankh morpork and the flames generally had to leave via the roof .   with the pipe thus leaning against the wall  he found himself sliding down the diagonal .  even this might have been a happy outcome were it not for the fact that colon was a heavy man and  as his weight slid nearer to the middle of the unsupported pipe  the pipe sagged  and cast iron has only a very limited amount of sag before it snaps  which it now did .  colon dropped  and landed on something soft   at least  softer than the street   and the something went    mur r r r r m .     he bounced off it and landed on something lower and softer which went    baaaaarp .     and rolled from this on to something even lower and apparently made of feathers  which went insane .  and pecked him .   the street was full of animals  milling around uncertainly .  when animals are in a state of uncertainty they get nervous  and the street was already  as it were  paved with anxiety .  the only benefit to sergeant colon was that this made it slightly softer than would otherwise have been the case .   hooves trod on his hands .  very large dribbly noses sneezed at him .   sergeant colon had not hitherto had a great deal of experience of animals  except in portion sizes .  when he   d been little he   d had a pink stuffed pig call mr .  dreadful  and he   d got up to chapter six in animal husbandry .  it had woodcuts in it .  there was no mention of hot smelly breath and great clomping feet like soup plates on a stick .  cows  in sergeant colon   s book  should go    moo .     every child knew that .  they shouldn   t go    mur r r r r m .     like some kind of undersea monster and spray you with spit .   he tried to get up  skidded on some cow   s moment of crisis  and sat down on a sheep .  it went    blaaaart .     what kind of noise was that for a sheep to make .   he got up again and tried to make his way to the curb .     shoo .  get out of the damn    way  you sheep .  garn .      a goose hissed at him and stuck out altogether too much neck .   colon backed off  and stopped when something nudged him in the back .  it was a pig .   it was no mr .  dreadful .  this wasn   t the little piggy that went to market  or the little piggy that stayed at home .  it would be quite hard to imagine what kind of foot would have a piggy like this  but it would probably be the kind that had hair and scales and toenails like cashew nuts .   this piggy was the size of a pony .  this piggy had tusks .  and it wasn   t pink .  it was a blue black color and covered with sharp hair but it did have   let   s be fair  thought colon   little red piggy eyes .   this little piggy looked like the little piggy that killed the boarhounds  disemboweled the horse  and ate the huntsman .   colon turned around  and came face to face with a bull like a beef cube on legs .  it turned its huge head from side to side so that each rolling eye could get a sight of the sergeant  but it was clear that neither of them liked him very much .   it lowered its head .  there wasn   t room for it to charge  but it could certainly push .   as the animals crowded around him  colon took the only way of escape possible .       there were men slumped all over the alley .      hello  hello  hello  what   s all this  then .     said carrot .   a man who was holding his arm and groaning looked up at him .     we were viciously attacked .         we don   t have time for this     said vimes .      we may have     said angua .  she tapped him on the shoulder and pointed to the wall opposite  on which was written in a familiar script   no master     carrot hunched down and spoke to the casualty .     you were attacked by a golem  were you .     he said .      right .  vicious bugger .  just walked out of the fog and went for us  you know what they   re like .      carrot gave the man a cheerful smile .  then his gaze traveled along the man   s body to the big hammer lying in the gutter  and moved from that to the other tools strewn around the scene of the fight .  several had their handles broken .  there was a long crowbar  bent nearly into a circle .      it   s lucky you were all so well armed     he said .      it turned on us     said the man .  he tried to snap his fingers .     just like that   aargh .         you seem to have hurt your fingers           you   re right .         it   s just that i don   t understand how it could have turned on you and just walked out of the fog     said carrot .      everyone knows they   re not allowed to fight back .            fight back        carrot repeated .      it   s not right  them walking around the streets like that     the man muttered  looking away .   there was the sound of running feet behind them and a couple of men in blood stained aprons caught up with them .     it went that way .     one yelled .     you   ll be able to catch up with it if you hurry .         come on  don   t hang around .  what do we pay our taxes for .     said the other .      it went all round the cattle yards and let everything out .  everything .  you can   t move on pigsty hill .         a golem let all the cattle out .     said vimes .     what for .         how should i know .  it took the yudasgoat out of sock   s slaughterhouse so half the damn    things are following it around .  and then it went and put old fosdyke in his sausage machine           what .         oh  it didn   t turn the handle .  it just shoved a handful of parsley in his mouth  dropped an onion down his trousers  covered him in oatmeal and dropped him in the hopper .      angua   s shoulders started to shake .  even vimes grinned .      and then it went into the poultry merchant   s  grabbed mr .  terwillie  and      the man stopped  aware there was a lady present  even if she was making snorting noises while trying not to laugh  and continued in a mumble      made use of some sage and onion .  if you know what i mean           you mean he    .     vimes began .      yes .      his companion nodded .     poor old terwillie won   t be able to look sage and onion in the face again  i reckon .         by the sound of it  that   s the last thing he   ll do     said vimes .   angua had to turn her back .      tell him about what happened in your pork butcher   s     said the man   s companion .      i don   t think you   ll need to     said vimes .     i   m seeing a pattern here .         right .  and poor young sid   s only an apprentice and didn   t deserve what it done to him .         oh  dear     said carrot .     er   i think i   ve got an ointment that might be           will it help with the apple .     the man demanded .      it shoved an apple in his mouth .         wrong .      vimes winced .     ouch           what   s going to be done  eh .     said the butcher  his face a few inches from vimes   s .      well  if you can get a grip on the stem           i   m serious .  what are you going to do .  i   m a taxpayer and i know my rights .      he prodded vimes in the breastplate .  vimes   s expression went wooden .  he looked down at the finger  and then back up at the man   s large red nose .      in that case     said vimes     i suggest you take another apple and           er  excuse me     said carrot loudly .     you   re mr .  maxilotte  aren   t you .  got a shop in the shambles .         yes  that   s right .  what of it .         it   s just that i don   t recall seeing your name on the register of taxpayers  which is very odd because you said you were a taxpayer  but of course you wouldn   t lie about a thing like that and anyway when you paid your taxes they would have given you a receipt because that   s the law and i   m sure you   d be able to find it if you looked        the butcher lowered his finger .     er  yes           i could come and help you if you   d like     said carrot .   the butcher gave vimes a despairing look .      he really does read that stuff     said vimes .     for pleasure .  carrot  why don   t you    .  my gods  what the hell is that .      there was a bellow further up the street .   something big and muddy was approaching at a sort of menacing amble .  in the gloom it looked vaguely like a very fat centaur  half man  half   in fact it was  he realized as it bounced nearer  half colon  half bull .   sergeant colon had lost his helmet and had a certain look about him that suggested he had been close to the soil .   as the massive bull cantered past  the sergeant rolled his eyes wildly and said     i daren   t get off .  i daren   t get off .         how did you get on .     shouted vimes .      it wasn   t easy  sir .  i just grabbed the    orns  sir  next minute i was on its back .         well  hang on .         yes  sir .  hanging on sir .          rogers the bulls were angry and bewildered  which counts as the basic state of mind for a full grown bulls .    but they had a particular reason .  beef cattle have a religion .  they are deeply spiritual animals .  they believe that good and obedient cattle go to a better place when they die  through a magic door .  they don   t know what happens next  but they   ve heard that it involves really good eating and  for some reason  horseradish .   rogers had been quite looking forward to it .  they were getting a bit creaky these days  and cows seemed to run faster than they had done when they were lads .  they could just taste that heavenly horseradish     and instead they   d been herded into a crowded pen for a day and then the gate had been opened and there   d been animals everywhere and this did not look like the promised lard .   and someone was on their back .  they   d tried to buck him off a few times .  in rogers    heyday the impudent man would by now be a few stringy red stains on the ground  but finally the arthritic bulls had given up until such time as they could find a handy tree on which to scrape him off .   they just wished the wretched man would stop yelling .       vimes took a few steps after the bull  and then turned .      carrot .  angua .  you two get down to carry   s tallow works .  just keep an eye on it until we get there  understand .  spy out the place but don   t go in  understand .  right .  do not in any circumstances move in .  do i make myself clear .  just remain in the area .  right .         yes  sir     said carrot .      detritus  let   s get fred off that thing .      the crowds were melting away ahead of the bull .  a ton of pedigree bull does not experience traffic congestion  at least not for any length of time .      can   t you jump off  fred .     vimes yelled  as he ran along behind .      i do not wish to give that a try  sir .         well  can you steer it .         how  sir .         take the bull by the horns  man .      colon tentatively reached out and took a horn in each hand .  rogers the bull turned his head and nearly pulled him off .      he   s a bit stronger than me  sir .  quite a lot stronger actually  sir .         i could shoot it through der head wid my bow  mr .  vimes     said detritus  flourishing his converted siege weapon .      this is a crowded street  sergeant .  it might hit an innocent person  even in ankh morpork .         sorry  sir .     detritus brightened .     but if it did we could always say they   d bin guilty of somethin     sir .         no  that   what   s that chicken doing .      a small black bantam cock raced up the street  ran between the bull   s legs and skidded to a halt just in front of rogers .  a smaller figure jumped off its back  leapt up  caught hold of the ring through the bull   s nose  swung up further until it was in the mass of curls on the bull   s forehead  and then took firm hold of a lock of hair in each tiny hand .      it looks like wee mad arthur der ger nome  sir     said detritus .     he   tryin    to nut der bull        there was a noise like a slow woodpecker working on a particularly difficult tree  and it punctuated a litany of complaints from somewhere between the animal   s eyes .      take that  yer big lump that yez are        the bull stopped .  he tried to turn his head so that one or other of the rogerses could see what the hell it was that was hammering at its forehead  and might as well have tried looking down its own ears .   it staggered backwards .      fred     vimes whispered     you slip off its back while it   s busy .      with a panicky look  sergeant colon swung a leg over the bull   s huge back and slid down to the ground .  vimes grabbed him and hustled him into a doorway .  then he hustled him out again .  a doorway was far too confined a space in which to be anywhere near fred colon .      why are you all covered in crap  fred .         well  sir  you know that creek that you   re up without a paddle .  it started there and it   s got worse  sir .         good grief .  worse than that .         permission to go and have a bath  sir .         no  but you could stand back a few more feet .  what happened to your helmet .         last time i saw it  it was on a sheep  sir .  sir  i was tied up and shoved in a cellar and heroically broke free  sir .  and i was chased by one of them golems  sir .         where was this .      colon had hoped he wouldn   t be asked that .     it was a place in the shambles     he said .     it was foggy  so i        vimes grabbed colon   s wrists .     what   s this .         they tied me up with string  sir .  but at great pers   nal risk of life and limb i           this doesn   t look like string to me     said vimes .      no  sir .         no  this looks like   candlewick .      colon looked blank .      that a clue  sir .     he said  hopefully .   there was a splatting noise as vimes slapped him on the back .     well done  fred     he said  wiping his hand on his trousers .     it   s certainly a corroboration .         that   s what i thought .     said colon quickly .     this is a corrobolaration and i   ve got to get it to commander vimes as soon as possible regardless of           why   s that gnome nutting that bull  fred .         that   s wee mad arthur  sir .  we owe him a dollar .  he was   of some help  sir .      rogers the bull was on his knees  dazed and bewildered .  it wasn   t that wee mad arthur was capable of delivering a killing blow  but he just didn   t stop .  after a while the noise and the thumping got on people   s nerves .      should we help him .     said vimes .      looks like he   s doing all right by himself  sir     said colon .   wee mad arthur looked up and grinned .     one dollar  right .     he shouted .     no welching or i   ll come after yez .  one of these buggers trod on me grandpa once .         was he hurt .         he got one of his horns twisted right orf .      vimes took sergeant colon firmly by the arm .     come on  fred  it   s all hitting the street now .         right  sir .  and most of it   s splashing .         i say .  you there .  you   re a watchman  aren   t you .  come over here .      vimes turned .  a man had pushed his way through the crowds .   on the whole  colon reflected  it was just possible that the worst moment of his life hadn   t happened yet .  vimes tended to react in a ballistic way to words like    i say .  you there .     when uttered in a certain kind of neighing voice .   the speaker had an aristocratic look about him  and the angry air of a man not accustomed to the rigors of life who has just found one happening to him .   vimes saluted smartly .     yessir .  i   m a watchman  sir .         well  just you come along with me and arrest this thing .  it   s disturbing the workers .         what thing  sir .         a golem  man .  walked into the factory as bold as you like and started painting on the damn    walls .         what factory  sir .         you come with me  my man .  i happen to be a very good friend of your commander and i can   t say i like your attitude .         sorry about that  sir     said vimes  with a cheerfulness that sergeant colon had come to dread .   there was a nondescript factory on the other side of the street .  the man strode in .      er   he said    golem     sir     murmured colon .   vimes had known fred colon a long time .     yes  fred  so it   s vitally important for you to stay on guard out here     he said .   the relief rose off colon like steam .     that   s right  sir .     he said .   the factory was full of sewing machines .  people were sitting meekly in front of them .  it was the sort of thing the guilds hated  but since the guild of seamstresses didn   t take all that much interest in sewing there was no one to object .  endless belts led up from each machine to pulleys on a long spindle near the roof  which in turn were driven by   vimes   s eyes followed it down the length of the workshop   a treadmill  now stationary and somewhat broken .  a couple of golems were standing forlornly alongside it  looking lost .   there was a hole in the wall quite close to it and  above it  someone had written in red paint   workers .  no master but yourselves .   vimes grinned .      it smashed its way in  broke the treadmill  pulled my golems out  painted that stupid message on the wall  and stamped out again .     said the man behind him .      hmm  yes  i see .  a lot of people use oxen in their treadmills     said vimes mildly .      what   s that got to do with it .  anyway  cattle can   t keep going twenty four hours a day .      vimes   s gaze worked its way along the rows of workers .  their faces had that worried  cockbill street look that you got when you were cursed with pride as well as poverty .      no  indeed     he said .     most of the clothing workshops are up at nap hill  but the wages are cheaper down here  aren   t they .         people are jolly glad to get the work .         yes     said vimes  looking at the faces again .     glad .     at the far end of the factory  he noted  the golems were trying to rebuild their treadmill .      now you listen to me  what i want you to do is       the factory owner began .   vimes   s hand gripped his collar and dragged him forward until his face was a few inches from vimes   s own .      no  you listen to me     hissed vimes .     i mix with crooks and thieves and thugs all day and that doesn   t worry me at all but after two minutes with you i need a bath .  and if i find that damn    golem i   ll shake its damn    hand  you hear me .      to the surprise of that part of vimes that wasn   t raging  the man found enough courage to say    how dare you .  you   re supposed to be the law .      vimes   s furious finger almost went up the man   s nose .      where shall i start .     he yelled .  he glared at the two golems .     and why are you clowns repairing the treadmill .     he shouted .     good grief  haven   t got the sense you were bor   haven   t you got any sense .      he stormed out of the building .  sergeant colon stopped trying to scrape himself clean and ran to catch up with him .      i heard some people say they saw a golem come out of the other door  sir     he said .     it was a red one .  you know  red clay .  but the one that was after me was white  sir .  are you angry  sam .         who   s that man who owns that place .         that   s mr .  catterail  sir .  you know  he   s always writing you letters about there being too many what he calls    lesser races    in the watch .  you know   trolls and dwarfs       the sergeant had to trot to keep up with vimes .      get some zombies     he said .      you   ve always been dead against zombies  excuse my pun     said sergeant colon .      any want to join  are there .         oh  yessir .  couple of good lads  sir  and but for the gray skin hangin    off    em you   d swear they hadn   t been buried five minutes .         swear them in tomorrow .         right  sir .  good idea .  and of course it   s a great saving not having to include them in the pension plan .         they can patrol up on kings down .  after all  they   re only human .         right  sir .     when sam is in these moods  colon thought  you agree with everything .     you   re really getting the hang of this affirmative action stuff  eh sir .         right now i   d swear in a gorgon .         there   s always mr .  bleakley  sir  he   s getting fed up with working in the kosher butcher   s and           but no vampires .  never any vampires .  now let   s get a move on  fred .          nobby nobbs ought to have known .  that   s what he told himself as he scuttled through the streets .  all that stuff about kings and stuff   they   d wanted him to     it was a terrible thought        volunteer .   nobby had spent a lifetime in one uniform or another .  and one of the most basic lessons he   d learned was that men with red faces and plummy voices never ever gave cushy numbers to the likes of nobby .  they   d ask for volunteers to do something    big and clean    and you   d end up scrubbing some damn great drawbridge  they   d say     anyone here like good food .     and you   d be peeling potatoes for a week .  you never ever volunteered .  not even if a sergeant stood there and said     we need someone to drink alcohol  bottles of  and make love  passionate  to women  for the use of       there was always a snag .  if a choir of angels asked for volunteers for paradise to step forward .  nobby knew enough to take one smart pace to the rear .   when the call came for corporal nobbs  it would not find him wanting .  it would not find him at all .   nobby avoided a herd of pigs in the middle of the street .   even mr .  vimes never expected him to volunteer .  he respected nobby   s pride .   nobby   s head ached .  it must   ve been the quail   s eggs  he was sure .  they couldn   t be healthy birds to lay titchy eggs like that .   he sidled past a cow that had got its head stuck in someone   s window .   nobby as king .  oh  yes .  no one ever gave a nobbs anything except maybe a skin disease or sixty lashes .  it was a dog eat nobbs world  right enough .  if there were to be a world competition for losers  a nobbs would come firs   last .   he stopped running and went to earth in a doorway .  in its welcome shadows he extracted a very short cigarette end from behind his ear and lit it .   now that he felt safe enough to think about more than flight he wondered about all the animals that seemed to be on the streets .  unlike the family tree that had borne fred colon as its fruit  the creeping vine of the nobbses had flourished only within city walls .  nobby was vaguely aware of animals as being food in a primary stage and left it at that .  but he was pretty sure they weren   t supposed to be wandering around untidily like this .   gangs of men were trying to round them up .  since they were tired and working at cross purposes  and the animals were hungry and bewildered  all that was happening was that the streets were getting a lot muddier .   nobby became aware that he was not alone in the doorway .   he looked down .   also lurking in the shadows was a goat .  it was unkempt and smelly  but it turned its head and gave nobby the most knowing look he   d ever seen on the face of an animal .  unexpectedly  and most uncharacteristically  nobby was struck by a surge of fellow feeling .   he pinched out the end of his cigarette and passed it down to the goat  which ate it .      you and me both     said nobby .       miscellaneous livestock scattered madly as carrot  angua  and cheri made their way down the shambles .  they especially tried to keep away from angua .  it seemed to cheri that an invisible barrier was advancing in front of them .  some animals tried to climb walls or scattered madly into side alleys .      why are they so scared .     said cheri .      can   t imagine     said angua .   a few maddened sheep ran away from them as they walked around the candle factory .  light from its high windows indicated that candlemaking continued all night .      they make nearly half a million candles every twenty four hours     said carrot .     i heard they   ve got very advanced machinery .  it sounds very interesting .  i   d love to see it .      at the rear of the premises light blazed out into the fog .  crates of candles were being manhandled on to a succession of carts .      looks normal enough     said carrot  as they eased themselves into a conveniently shadowy doorway .     busy  though .         i don   t see what good this is going to do     said angua .     as soon as they see us they can destroy any evidence .  and  even if we find arsenic  so what .  there   s no crime in owning arsenic  is there .         er   is there a crime in owning that .     whispered cheri .   a golem was walking slowly up the alley .  it was quite unlike any other golem they had seen .  the others were ancient and had repaired themselves so many times they were as shapeless as a gingerbread man  but this one looked like a human  or at least like humans wished they could look .  it resembled a statue made of white clay .  around its head  part of the very design  was a crown .      i was right     murmured carrot .     they did make themselves a golem .  the poor devils .  they thought a king would make them free .         look at its legs     said angua .   as the golem walked  lines of red light appeared and disappeared all over its legs  and across its body and arms .      it   s cracking     she said .      i knew you couldn   t bake pottery in an old bread oven .     said cheri .     it   s not the right shape .      the golem pushed open a door and disappeared into the factory .      let   s go     said carrot .      commander vimes told us to wait for him     said angua .      yes  but we don   t know what might be going on in there     said carrot .     besides  he likes us to use our initiative .  we can   t just hang around now .      he darted across the alley and opened the door .   there were crates piled inside  with a narrow passageway between them .  from all around them  but slightly muffled by the crates  came the clicking and rattling of the factory .  the air smelled of hot wax .   cheri was aware of a whispered conversation going on several feet above her little round helmet .      i wish mr .  vimes hadn   t wanted us to bring her .  supposing something happens to her .         what are you talking about .         well   you know   she   s a girl .         so what .  there   s at least three female dwarfs in the watch already and you don   t worry about them .         oh  come on   name one .         lars skulldrinker  for a start .         no .  really .         are you calling this nose a liar .         but he broke up a fight in the miner   s arms single handedly last week .         well .  why do you assume females are weaker .  you wouldn   t worry about me taking on a vicious bar crowd by myself .         i   d give aid where necessary .         to me or to them .         that   s unfair .         is it .         i wouldn   t help them unless you got really rough .         ah  so .  and they say chivalry is dead           anyway  cheri is   a bit different .  i   m sure he   she   s good at alchemy  but we   d better watch her back in a fight .  hold on        they   d stepped out into the factory .   candles whirled overhead   hundreds of them  thousands of them   dangling by their wicks from an endless belt of complex wooden links that switchbacked its way up and down the long hall .      i heard about this     said carrot .     it   s called a producing line .  it   s a way of making thousands of things that are all the same .  but look at the speed .  i   m amazed the treadmill can        angua pointed .  there was a treadmill creaking around beside them  but there was nothing inside it .      something   s got to be powering all this     said angua .   carrot pointed .  further up the hall the switchbacks of the line converged in a complicated knot .  there was a figure somewhere in the middle  arms moving in a blur .   just beside carrot the line ended at a big wooden hopper .  candles cascaded into it .  no one had been emptying it  and they were tumbling over the pile and rolling on to the floor .      cheri     said carrot     do you know how to use any kind of weapon .         er   no  captain carrot .         right .  you just wait in the alley  then .  i don   t want any harm coming to you .      she scuttled off  looking relieved .   angua sniffed the air .     there   s been a vampire here     she said .      i think we   d       carrot began .      i knew you   d find out .  i wish i   d never bought the damned thing .  i   ve got a bow .  i warn you  i   ve got a crossbow .      they turned .     ah  mr .  carry     said carrot cheerfully .  he produced his badge .     captain carrot  ankh morpork city watch           i know who you are .  i know who you are .  and what you are  too .  i knew you   d come .  i   ve got a bow and i   m not afraid to use it .     the crossbow   s point moved uncertainly  proving him a liar .      really .     said angua .     what we are .         i didn   t even want to get involved .     said carry .     it killed those old men  didn   t it .         yes     said carrot .      why .  i didn   t tell it to .         because they helped make it  i think     said carrot .     it knew who to blame .         the golems sold it to me .     said carry .     i thought it   d help build up the business but the damned thing won   t stop        he glanced up at the line of candles whirring overhead  but jerked his head back before angua could move .      works hard  does it .         hah .     but carry didn   t look like a man enjoying a joke .  he looked like a man in private torment .     i   ve laid off everyone except the girls in the packing department  and they   re on three shifts and overtime .  i   ve got four men out looking for tallow  two negotiating for wicks and three trying to buy more storage space .         then get it to stop making candles     said carrot .      it goes off into the streets when we run out of tallow .  you want it walking around looking for something to do .  hey  you two stay together .     carry added urgently  waving the crossbow .      look  all you have to do is change the words in its head     said carrot .      it won   t let me .  don   t you think i   ve tried .         it can   t not let you     said carrot .     golems have to let           i said it won   t let me .         what about the poisoned candles .     said carrot .      that wasn   t my idea .         whose idea was it .      carry   s crossbow swung back and forth .  he licked his lips .     this has all gone far too far     he said .     i   m getting out .         whose idea  mr .  carry .         i   m not going to end up in some alley somewhere with as much blood as a banana .         now then  we wouldn   t do anything like that     said carrot .   mr .  carry was exporting terror .  angua could smell it streaming off him .  he might pull the trigger out of sheer panic .   there was another smell  too .     who   s the vampire .     she said .   for a moment she thought the man would fire the crossbow .     i never said anything about him .         you   ve got garlic in your pocket     said angua .     and the place reeks of vampire .         he said we could get the golem to do anything     carry mumbled .      like making poisoned candles .     said carrot .      yes  but he said it   d just keep vetinari out of the way     said carry .  he seemed to be getting a tenuous grip on himself .     and he   s not dead     cos i   d have heard     he said .     i shouldn   t think making him ill is a crime  so you can   t           the candles killed two other people     said carrot .   carry started to panic again .     who .         an old lady and a baby in cockbill street .         were they important .     said carry .   carrot nodded to himself .     i was almost feeling sorry for you     he said .     right up to that point .  you   re a lucky man  mr .  carry .         you think so .         oh  yes .  we got to you before commander vimes did .  now  just put down the crossbow and we can talk about        there was a noise .  or  rather  the sudden cessation of a noise that had been so pervasive that it had no longer been consciously heard .   the clacking line had stopped .  there was a chorus of little waxy thuds as the hanging candles swung and hit one another  and then silence unrolled .  the last candle dropped off the line  tumbled down the heap in the hopper  and bounced on the floor .   and in the silence  the sound of footsteps .   carry started to back away .     too late .     he moaned .   both carrot and angua saw his finger move .   angua pushed carrot out of the way as the claw released the string  but he had anticipated this and his hand was already flinging itself up and across .  she heard the sickening  tearing noise as his palm whirled in front of her face  and his grunt as the force of the bolt spun him round .   he landed heavily on the floor  clutching his left hand .  the crossbow bolt was sticking out of the palm .   angua crouched down .     it doesn   t look barbed  let me pull        carrot grabbed her wrist .     the point   s silver .  don   t touch it .      they both looked up as a shadow crossed the light .   the king golem looked down at her .   she felt her teeth and fingernails begin to lengthen .   then she saw the small round face of cheri peering nervously around a pile of crates .  angua fought down her werewolf instincts  screamed    stay right there .     at the dwarf and at every swelling hair follicle  and hesitated between pursuing the fleeing carry and dragging carrot to safety .   she told her body again that a wolf shape was not an option .  there were too many strange smells  too many fires     the golem glistened with tallow and wax .   she backed away .   behind the golem she saw cheri look down at the groaning carrot and then up at a fire axe hooked on the wall .  the dwarf took it down and weighed it vaguely in her hands .      don   t try       angua began .      t   dr   duzk b   hazg t   t .         oh  no .     moaned carrot .     not that one .      cheri came up behind the golem at a run and hacked at its waist .  the axe rebounded but she pirouetted with it and caught the statue on the thigh  chipping off a piece of clay .   angua hesitated .  cheri   s axe was making blurred orbits around the golem while its wielder yelled more terrible battle cries .  angua couldn   t make out any words but many dwarf cries didn   t bother with words .  they went straight for emotions in sonic form .  chips of pottery ricocheted off the crates as each blow landed .      what did she yell .     angua said  as she pulled carrot out of the way .      it   s the most menacing dwarf battle cry there is .  once it   s been shouted someone has to be killed .         what   s it mean .         today is a good day for someone else to die .      the golem watched the dwarf incuriously  like an elephant watching an attack by a rogue chicken .   then it picked the axe out of the air  cheri trailing behind it like a comet  and hurled it aside .   angua hauled carrot to his feet .  blood dripped from his hand .  she tried to shut her nostrils .  full moon tomorrow .  no more choices .      maybe we can reason with it       carrot started .      attention .  this is the real world calling .     shouted angua .   carrot drew his sword .     i am arresting you       he began .   the golem   s arm whirred across .  the sword buried itself to the hilt in a crate of candles .      got any more clever ideas .     said angua  as they backed away .     or can we go now .         no .  we   ve got to stop it somewhere .      their heels met a wall of crates .      i think we   ve found the place     said angua as the golem raised its fists again .      you duck right  i   ll duck left .  maybe        a blow rocked the big double doors in the far wall .   the king golem   s head turned .   the doors shook again  and burst inwards .  for a moment dorfl was framed in the doorway .  then the red golem lowered his head  spread his arms  and charged .   it wasn   t a very fast run but it did have a terrible momentum  like the slow slide of a glacier .  the floorboards shook and drummed under dorfl .   the golems collided with a clang in the middle of the floor .  jagged lines of fire spread across the king   s body as cracks opened  but it roared and caught up dorfl around the middle and tossed him against the wall .      come on     said angua .     now can we find cheri and get out of here .         we ought to help him     said carrot  as the golems smashed into each other again .      how .  if it   if he can   t stop it  what makes you think we can .  come on .      carrot shook her off .   dorfl picked himself up from among the bricks and charged again .  the golems met  scrabbling at one another for purchase .  they stood locked for a moment  creaking  and then dorfl   s hand came up holding something .  dorfl pushed himself back and smashed the other golem over the head with its own leg .   as it spun dorfl   s other hand lashed out  but was grabbed .  the king swiveled with a strange grace  bore dorfl to the floor  rolled and kicked out .  dorfl rolled too  flung out his arms to stop himself  and looked back to see both his feet pinwheeling into the wall .   the king picked up its own leg  balanced for a moment  and joined itself together .   then its red gaze swept the factory and flared when it caught sight of carrot .      there must be a back way out of here     muttered angua .     carry got out .      the king started to run after them  but hit an immediate problem .  it had put its leg on back to front .  it began to limp in a circle but  somehow  the circle got nearer to carrot .      we can   t just leave dorfl lying there     said carrot .   he pulled a long metal rod out of a stirring tank and eased himself back down to the grease crusted floor .   the king rocked towards him .  carrot hopped backwards  steadied himself on a rail  and swung .   the golem lifted its hand  caught the rod out of the air and tossed it aside .  it raised both fists and tried to step forward .   it couldn   t move .  it looked down .      thsss     said what remained of dorfl  gripping its ankle .   the king bent  swung one hand with the palm edgewise  and calmly sheared the top off dorfl   s head .  it removed the chem and crumpled it up .   the glow died in dorfl   s eyes .   angua cannoned into carrot so hard he almost fell over .  she wrapped both arms around him and pulled him after her .      it just killed dorfl  just like that .     said carrot .      it   s a shame  yes     said angua .     or it would be if dorfl had been alive .  carrot  they   re like   machinery .  look  we can make it to the door        carrot shook himself free .     it   s murder     he said .     we   re watchmen .  we can   t just   watch .  it killed him .         it   s an it and so   s he           commander vimes said someone has to speak for the people with no voices .      he really believes it  angua thought .  vimes put words in his head .      keep it occupied .     he shouted  and darted away .      how .  organize a sing song .         i   ve got a plan .         oh  good .          vimes looked up at the entrance of the candle factory .  he could dimly see two cressets burning on either side of a shield .     look at that  will you .     he said .     paint not dry and he flaunts the thing for all the world to see .         what   s dat  sir .     said detritus .      his damn    coat of arms .      detritus looked up .     why   s it got a lighted fish on it .     he said .      in heraldry that   s a poisson     said vimes bitterly .     and it   s suppose to be a lamp .         a lamp made out of a poisson     said detritus .     well  dere   s a fing .         at least it   s got the motto in proper language     said sergeant colon .     instead of all the old fashioned stuff no one understands .     art brought forth the candle .     that  sergeant detritus  is a pun  or play on words .     cos his name is arthur  see .      vimes stood between the two sergeants and felt a hole open up in his head .      damn .     he said .     damn  damn  damn .  he showed it to me .     dumb plodder vimes .  he won   t notice .     oh  yes .  and he was right .            s not that good     said colon .     i mean  you   ve got to know that mr .  carry   s first name is arthur           shut up  fred .     snapped vimes .      shutting up right now  sir .         the arrogance of the   who   s that .      a figure darted out of the building  glanced around hurriedly  and scurried along the street .      that   s carry .     said vimes .  he didn   t even shout    after him .     but went from a standing start to a full run .  the fleeing figure dodged between the occasional straying sheep or pig and didn   t have a bad turn of speed  but vimes was powered by sheer anger and was only yards away when carry ducked into an alleyway .   vimes skidded to a halt and grabbed at the wall .  he   d seen the shape of a crossbow and one of the things you learned in the watch   that is  one of the things which hopefully you   d have a chance to learn   was that it was a very stupid thing indeed to follow someone with a crossbow into a dark alley where you   d be outlined against any light there was .      i know it   s you  carry     he shouted .      i   ve got a crossbow .         you can only fire it once .         i want to turn patrician   s evidence .         guess again .      carry lowered his voice .     they just said i could get the damn    golem to do it .  i didn   t think anyone was going to get hurt .         right  right     said vimes .     you made poisoned candles because they gave a better light  i expect .         you know what i mean .  they told me it would all be all right and           which they would    they    be .         they said no one would ever find out .         really .         look  look  they said they could       the voice paused  and took on that wheedling tone the bluntwitted use when they   re trying to sound sharp .      if i tell you everything  you   ll let me go  right .      the two sergeants had caught up .  vimes pulled detritus towards him  although in fact he ended up pulling himself towards detritus .      go round the corner and see he doesn   t come out of the alley the other way     he whispered .  the troll nodded .      what   s it you want to tell me  mr .  carry .     said vimes to the darkness in the alley .      have we got a bargain .         what .         a bargain .         no  we damn    well haven   t got a bargain  mr .  carry .  i   m not a tradesman .  but i   ll tell you something  mr .  carry .  they betrayed you .      there was silence from the darkness  and then a sound like a sigh .   behind vimes  sergeant colon stamped his feet on the cobbles to keep warm .      you can   t stay in there all night  mr .  carry     said vimes .   there was another sound  a leathery sound .  vimes glanced up into the coils of fog .     something   s not right     he said .     come on .      he ran into the alley .  sergeant colon followed  on the basis that it was fine to run into an alley containing an armed man provided you were behind someone else .   a shape loomed at them .      detritus .         yes  sir .         where did he go .  there are no doors in the alley .      then his eyes grew more accustomed to the gloom .  he saw a huddled outline at the foot of a wall  and his foot nudged a crossbow .     mr .  carry .      he knelt down and lit a match .      oh  nasty     said sergeant colon .     something   s broken his neck           dead  is he .     said detritus .     you want i should draw a chalk outline round him .         i don   t think we need bother  sergeant .         it no bother  i   ve got der chalk right here .      vimes looked up .  fog filled the alley  but there were no ladders  no handy low roofs .      let   s get out of here     he said .       angua faced the king .   she resisted a terrible urge to change .  even a werewolf   s jaws probably wouldn   t have any effect on the thing .  it didn   t have a jugular .   she daren   t look away .  the king moved uncertainly  with little jerks and twitches that in a human would suggest madness .  its arms moved fast but erratically  as if signals that were being sent were not arriving properly .  and dorfl   s attack had left it damaged .  every time it moved  red light shone from dozens of new cracks .      you   re cracking up .     she shouted .     the oven wasn   t right for pottery .      the king lunged at her .  she dodged and heard its hand slice through a rack of candles .      you   re cranky .  you   re baked like a loaf .  you   re half baked .      she drew her sword .  she didn   t usually have much use for it .  she found a smile would invariably do the trick .   a hand sliced the top off the blade .   she stared at the sheared metal in horror and then somersaulted back as another blow hummed past her face .   her foot slipped on a candle and she fell heavily  but with enough presence of mind to roll before a foot stamped down .      where   ve you gone .     she yelled .      can you get it to move a little closer to the doors  please .     said a voice from the darkness on high .   carrot was crawled out along the rickety structure that supported the production line .      carrot .         almost there        the king grabbed at her leg .  she lashed out with her foot and caught it on the knee .   to her amazement she made it crack .  but the fire below was still there .  the pieces of pottery seemed to float on it .  no matter what anyone did the golem could keep going  even if it were just a cloud of dust held together .      ah .  right     said carrot  and dropped off the gantry .   he landed on the king   s back  flung one arm around its neck  and began to pound on its head with the hilt of his sword .  it staggered and tried to reach up to pull him off .      got to get the words out .     carrot shouted  as the arms flailed at him .     it   s the only   way .      the king staggered forward and hit a stack of boxes  which burst and rained candles over the floor .  carrot grabbed its ears and tried to twist .   angua heard him saying     you   have   the right   to   a lawyer           carrot .  don   t bother with its damn    rights .         you   have   the right to           just give it the last ones .      there was a commotion in the gaping doorway and vimes ran in  sword drawn .     oh  gods   sergeant detritus .      detritus appeared behind him .     sah .         crossbow bolt through the head  if you please .         if you say so  sir           its head  sergeant .  mine is fine .  carrot  get down off the thing .         can   t get its head off  sir .         we   ll try six feet of cold steel in the ear just as soon as you let the damn    thing go .      carrot steadied himself on the king   s shoulders  tried to judge his moment as the thing staggered around  and leapt .   he landed awkwardly on a sliding heap of candles .  his leg buckled under him and he tumbled over until he was stopped by the inert shell that had been dorfl .      hey  look dis way  mister     said detritus .   the king turned .   vimes didn   t catch everything that happened next  because it all happened so quickly .  he was merely aware of the rush of air and the gloink of the rebounding bolt mingling with the wooden juddering noise as it buried itself in the doorframe behind him .   and the golem was crouching down by carrot  who was trying to squirm out of the way .   it raised a fist  and brought it down     vimes didn   t even see dorfl   s arm move but there it was  there  suddenly gripping the king   s wrist .   tiny stars of light went nova in dorfl   s eyes .      tssssss .      as the king jerked back in surprise  dorfl held on and levered himself up on what remained of his legs .  as he came up so did his fist .   time slowed .  nothing moved in the whole universe but dorfl   s fist .   it swung like a planet  without any apparent speed but with a drifting unstoppability .   and then the king   s expression changed .  just before the fist landed  it smiled .   the golem   s head exploded .  vimes recalled it in slow motion  one long second of floating pottery .  and words .  scraps of paper flew out  dozens  scores of them  tumbling gently to the floor .   slowly  peacefully  the king hit the floor .  the red light died  the cracks opened  and then there were just   pieces .   dorfl collapsed on top of them .   angua and vimes reached carrot together .      he came alive .     said carrot  struggling up .     that thing was going to kill me and dorfl came alive .  but that thing had smashed the words out of his head .  a golem has to have the words .         they gave their own golem too many  i can see that     said vimes .   he picked up some of the coils of paper .      create peace and justice for all        rule us wisely        teach us freedom        lead us to     poor devil  he thought .      let   s get you home .  that hand needs treating       said angua .      listen  will you .     said carrot .     he   s alive .      vimes knelt down by dorfl .  the broken clay skull looked as empty as yesterday   s breakfast egg .  but there was still a pinpoint of light in each eye socket .      usssss     hissed dorfl  so faintly that vimes wasn   t sure he   d heard it .   a finger scratched on the floor .      is it trying to write something .     said angua .   vimes pulled out his notebook  eased it under dorfl   s hand  and gently pushed a pencil into the golem   s fingers .  they watched the hand as it wrote   a little jerkily but still with the mechanical precision of a golem   eight words .   then it stopped .  the pencil rolled away .  the lights in dorfl   s eyes dwindled and went out .      good grief     breathed angua .     they don   t need words in their heads           we can rebuild him     said carrot hoarsely .     we have the pottery .      vimes stared at the words  and then at what remained of dorfl .      mister vimes .     said carrot .      do it     said vimes .   carrot blinked .      right now     vimes said .  he looked back at the scrawl in his book .   words in the heart can not be taken .      and when you rebuild him     he said     when you rebuild him   give him a voice .  understand .  and get someone to look at your hand .         a voice  sir .         do it .         yes  sir .         right .     vimes pulled himself together .     constable angua and i will have a look around here .  off you go .      he watched the two of them carry the remains out .     ok     he said .     we   re looking for arsenic .  maybe there   ll be some workshop somewhere .  i shouldn   t think they   d want to mix the poisoned candles up with the others .  cheri   ll know what   where is corporal littlebottom .            er   i don   t think i can hold on much longer        they looked up .   cheri was hanging on the line of candles .      how did you get up there .     said vimes .      i sort of found myself going past  sir .         can   t you just let go .  you   re not that high   oh        a big trough of molten tallow was a few feet under her .  occasionally the surface went gloop .      er   how hot would that be .     vimes hissed to angua .      ever bitten hot jam .     she said .   vimes raised his voice .     can   t you swing yourself along  corporal .         all the wood   s greasy  sir .         corporal littlebottom  i order you not to fall off .         very good sir .      vimes pulled off his jacket .     hang on to this .  i   ll see if i can climb up       he muttered .      it won   t work .     said angua .     the thing   s shaky enough as it is .         i can feel my hands slipping  sir .         good grief  why didn   t you call out earlier .         everyone seemed to be busy  sir .         turn around  sir     said angua  undoing the buckles of her breastplate .     right now  please .  and shut your eyes .         why  what    .         rrright nowwww  sirrrrr .         oh   yes        vimes heard angua back away from the candle machine  her footsteps punctuated by the clang of falling armor .  then she started running and the footsteps changed while she was running and then     he opened his eyes .   the wolf sailed upwards in slow motion  caught the dwarf   s shoulder in its jaws as cheri   s grip gave way  and then arced its body so that wolf and dwarf hit the floor on the far side of the vat .   angua rolled  whimpering .   cheri scrambled to her feet .     it   s a werewolf .      angua rolled back and forth  pawing at her mouth .      what   s happened to it .     said cheri  her panic receding a little .     it looks   hurt .  where   s angua .  oh        vimes glanced at the dwarf   s torn leather shirt .     you wear chain mail under your clothes .     he said .      oh   it   s my silver vest   but she knew about it .  i told her        vimes grabbed angua   s collar .  she moved to bite him  and then caught his eye and turned her head away .      she only bit the silver     said cheri  distractedly .   angua pulled herself on to her feet  glared at them  and slunk off behind some crates .  they heard her whimpering which  by degrees  became a voice .         blasted blasted dwarfs and their blasted vests           you all right  constable .     said vimes .         damn    silver underwear   can you throw me my clothes  please .      vimes bundled up angua   s uniform and  eyes closed for decency   s sake  handed it around the crates .      no one told me she was a were       cheri moaned .      look at it like this  corporal     said vimes  as patiently as he could .     if she hadn   t been a werewolf you would by now be the world   s largest novelty candle  all right .      angua walked from behind the crates  rubbing her mouth .  the skin around it looked too pink        it burned you .     said cheri .      it   ll heal     said angua .      you never said you were a werewolf .         how would you   ve liked me to have put it .         right     said vimes     if that   s all sorted out  ladies  i want this place searched .  understand .         i   ve got some ointment     said cheri meekly .      thank you .      they found a bag in a cellar .  there were several boxes of candles .  and a lot of dead rats .       igneous the troll opened the door of his pottery a fraction .  he   d intended the fraction to be no more than about one sixteenth  but someone immediately pushed hard and turned it into rather more than one and three quarters .      here  what   s dis .     he said  as detritus and carrot came in with the shell of dorfl between them .     you can   t jus    break in here           we ain   t just breakin    in     said detritus .      dis is an outrage     said igneous     you got no right comin    in here .  you got no reason        detritus let go of the golem and spun around .  his hand shot out and caught igneous around the throat .     you see dose statchoos of monolith over dere .  you see dem .     he growled  twisting the other troll   s head to face a row of troll religious statues on the other side of the warehouse     you want i should smash one open  see what dey   re fill wit     maybe find a reason .      igneous   s slitted eyes darted this way and that .  he might have been hard of thinking  but he could feel a killing mood when it was in the air .     no call for dat  i always help der watch     he muttered .     what dis all about .      carrot laid out the golem on a table .     start  then     he said .     rebuild him .  use as much of the old clay as you can  understand .         how can it work when its lights   re out .     said detritus  still puzzled by this mission of mercy .      the clay remembers .      the sergeant shrugged .      and give him a tongue     said carrot .   igneous looked shocked .     i won   t do dat     he said .     everbody know it blasphemy if golems speak .         oh  yeah .     said detritus .  he strode across the warehouse to the group of statues and glared at them .  then he said     whoops  here   s me accident   ly trippin    up  ooo  dis is me grabbin    a statchoo for support  oh  der arm have come right off  where can i put my face   and what is dis white powder what i sees here with my eyes accident   ly spillin    on der floor .      he licked a finger and gingerly tasted the stuff .      slab     he growled  walking back to the trembling igneous .     you tellin    me about blasphemy  you sedimentr   y coprolith .  you doin    what captain carrot say right now or you goin    out of here in a sack .         dis is police brutality       igneous muttered .      no  dis is just police shoutin    .     yelled detritus .     you want to try for brutality it ok wit    me .      igneous tried to appeal to carrot .     it not right  he got a badge  he puttin    me in fear  he can   t do dis     he said .   carrot nodded .  there was a glint in his eye that igneous should have noticed .     that   s correct     he said .     sergeant detritus .         sir .         it   s been a long day for all of us .  you can go off duty .         yessir .     said detritus  with considerable enthusiasm .  he removed his badge and laid it down carefully .  then he started to struggle out of his armor .      look at it like this     said carrot .     it   s not that we   re making life  we   re simply giving life a place to live .      igneous finally gave up .     ok  ok     he muttered .     i doin    it .  i doin    it .      he looked at the various lumps and shards that were all that remained of dorfl  and rubbed the lichen on his chin .      you got most of the bits     he said  professionalism edging resentment aside for a moment .     i could glue him together wit    kiln cement .  dat   d do the trick if we bakes him overnight .  lessee   i reckon i got some over dere        detritus blinked at his finger  which was still white with the dust  and sidled over to carrot .     did i just lick dis .     he said .      er  yes     said carrot .      t   ank goodness for dat     said detritus  blinking furiously .        d hate to believe dis room was really full of giant hairy spide   weeble weeble sclup        he hit the floor  but happily .      even if i do it you can   t make it come alive again     muttered igneous  returning to his bench .     you won   t find a priest who   s goin    to write der words for in der head  not again .         he   ll make up his own words     said carrot .      and who   s going to watch the oven .     said igneous .     it   s gonna take    til breakfast at least           i wasn   t planning on doing anything for the rest of tonight     said carrot  taking off his helmet .       vimes awoke around four o   clock .  he   d gone to sleep at his desk .  he hadn   t meant to  but his body had just shut down .   it wasn   t the first time he   d opened bleary eyes there .  but at least he wasn   t lying in anything sticky .   he focused on the report he   d half written .  his notebook was beside it  page after page of laborious scrawl to remind him that he was trying to understand a complex world by means of his simple mind .   he yawned  and looked out at the shank of the night .   he didn   t have any evidence .  no real evidence at all .  he   d had an interview with an almost incoherent corporal nobbs  who hadn   t really seen anything .  he had nothing that wouldn   t burn away like the fog in the morning .  all he   d got were a few suspicions and a lot of coincidences  leaning against one another like a house of cards with no card on the bottom .   he peered at his notebook .   someone seemed to have been working hard .  oh  yes .  it had been him .   the events of last night jangled in his head .  why   d he written all this stuff about a coat of arms .   oh  yes     yes .   ten minutes later he was pushing open the door of the pottery .  warmth spilled out into the clammy air .   he found carrot and detritus asleep on the floor on either side of the kiln .  damn .  he needed someone he could trust  but he hadn   t the heart to wake them .  he   d pushed everyone very hard the last few days     something tapped on the door of the kiln .   then the handle started to turn by itself .   the door opened as far as it could go and something half slid and half fell on to the floor .   vimes still wasn   t properly awake .  exhaustion and the importunate ghosts of adrenaline sizzled around the edges of his consciousness  but he saw the burning man unfold himself and stand upright .   his red hot body gave little pings as it began to cool .  where it stood  the floor charred and smoked .   the golem raised his head and looked around .      you .     said vimes  pointing an unsteady finger .     come with me .         yes     said dorfl .       dragon king of arms stepped into his library .  the dirt of the small high windows and the remnants of the fog made sure there was never more than grayness here  but a hundred candles yielded their soft light .   he sat down at his desk  pulled a volume towards him  and began to write .   after a while he stopped and stared ahead of him .  there was no sound but the occasional spluttering of a candle .      ah ha .  i can smell you  commander vimes     he said .     did the heralds let you in .         i found my own way  thank you     said vimes  stepping out of the shadows .   the vampire sniffed again .     you came alone .         who should i have brought with me .         and to what do i owe the pleasure  sir samuel .         the pleasure is all mine .  i   m going to arrest you     said vimes .      oh  dear .  ah ha .  for what  may i ask .         can i invite you to notice the arrow in this crossbow .     said vimes .     no metal on the point  you   ll see .  it   s wood all the way .         how very considerate .  ah ha .     dragon king of arms twinkled at him .     you still haven   t told me what i   m accused of  however .         to start with  complicity in the murders of mrs .  flora easy and the child william easy .         i am afraid those names mean nothing to me .      vimes   s finger twitched on the bow   s trigger .     no     he said  breathing deeply .     they probably don   t .  we are making other inquiries and there may be a number of additional matters .  the fact that you were poisoning the patrician i consider a mitigating circumstance .         you really intend to proffer charges .         i   d prefer violence     said vimes loudly .     charges is what i   m going to have to settle for .      the vampire leaned back .     i hear you   ve been working very hard  commander     he said .     so i will not           we   ve got the testimony of mr .  carry     lied vimes .     the late mr .  carry .      dragon   s expression changed by not one tiny tremor of muscle .     i really do not know  ah ha  what you are talking about  sir samuel .         only someone who could fly could have got into my office .         i   m afraid you   ve lost me  sir .         mr .  carry was killed tonight     vimes went on .     by someone who could get out of an alley guarded at both ends .  and i know a vampire was in his factory .         i   m still gamely trying to understand you  commander     said dragon king of arms .     i know nothing about the death of mr .  carry and in any case there are a great many vampires in the city .  i   m afraid your   aversion is well known .         i don   t like to see people treated like cattle     said vimes .  he stared briefly at the volumes piled in the room .     and of course that   s what you   ve always done  isn   t it .  these are the stock books of ankh morpork .     the crossbow swung back towards the vampire  who hadn   t moved .     power over little people .  that   s what vampires want .  the blood is just a way of keeping score .  i wonder how much influence you   ve had over the years .         a little .  you are correct there  at least .            a person of breeding        said vimes .     good grief .  well  i think people wanted vetinari out of the way .  but not dead  yet .  too many things   d happen too fast if he were dead .  is nobby really an earl .         the evidence suggests so .         but it   s your evidence  right .  you see  i don   t think he   s got noble blood in him .  nobby   s as common as muck .  it   s one of his better points .  i don   t set any score by the ring .  the amount of stuff his family   s nicked  you could probably prove he   s the duke of pseudopolis  the caliph of klatch  and the dowager duchess of quirm .  he pinched my cigar case last year and i   m damn    certain he   s not me .  no  i don   t think nobby is a nob .  but i think he was convenient .      it seemed to vimes that dragon was getting bigger  but perhaps it was only a trick of the candlelight .  the light flickered as the candles hissed and popped .      you made good use of me  eh .     vimes carried on .     i   d been ducking out of appointments with you for weeks .  i expect you were getting quite impatient .  you were so surprised when i told you about nobby  eh .  otherwise you   d   ve had to send for him or something  very suspicious .  but commander vimes discovered him .  that looks good .  practically makes it official .      and then i started thinking  who wants a king .  well  nearly everyone .  it   s built in .  kings make it better .  funny thing  isn   t it .  even those people who owe everything to him don   t like vetinari .  ten years ago most of the guild leaders were just a bunch of thugs and now   well  they   re still a bunch of thugs  to tell the truth  but vetinari   s given    em the time and energy to decide they never needed him .      and then young carrot turns up with charisma writ all over him  and he   s got a sword and a birthmark and everyone gets a funny feeling and dozens of buggers start going through the records and say     hey  looks like the king   s come back .     and then they watch him for a while and say     shit  he really is decent and honest and fair and just  just like in all the stories .  whoops .  if this lad gets on the throne we could be in serious trouble .  he might turn out to be one of them inconvenient kings from long ago who wanders around talking to the common people              you are in favor of the common people .     said dragon mildly .      the common people .     said vimes .     they   re nothing special .  they   re no different from the rich and powerful except they   ve got no money or power .  but the law should be there to balance things up a bit .  so i suppose i   ve got to be on their side .         a man married to the richest woman in the city .      vimes shrugged .     the watchman   s helmet isn   t like a crown .  even when you take it off you   re still wearing it .         that   s an interesting statement of position  sir samuel  and i would be the first to admire the way you   ve come to terms with your family history  but           don   t move .     vimes shifted his grip on the crossbow .     anyway   carrot wouldn   t do  but the news was getting around  and someone said     right  let   s have a king we can control .  all the rumors say the king is a humble watchman so let   s find one .     and they had a look and found that when it comes to    humble    you can   t beat nobby nobbs .  but   i think people weren   t too sure .  killing vetinari wasn   t an option .  as i said  too many things would happen too fast .  but to just gently remove him  so that he   s there and not there at the same time  while everyone tried out the idea   that was a good wheeze .  that   s when someone got mr .  carry to make poisoned candles .  he   d got a golem .  golems can   t talk .  no one would know .  but it turned out to be a bit   erratic .         you seem to wish to involve me     said dragon king of arms .     i know nothing about this man other than that he   s a customer        vimes strode across the room and pulled a piece of parchment from a board .     you did him a coat of arms .     he shouted .     you even showed me when i was here .     the butcher  the baker  and the candlestick maker .     remember .      there was no sound now from the hunched figure .      when i first met you the other day     said vimes     you made a point of showing me arthur carry   s coat of arms .  i thought it was a bit fishy at the time  but all that business with nobby put it out of my mind .  but i do remember it reminded me of the one for the assassins    guild .      vimes flourished the parchment .      i looked and looked at it last night  and then i wound my sense of humor down ten notches and let it go out of focus and looked at the crest  the fish shaped lamp .  lampe au poisson  it   s called .  a sort of bilingual play on words  perhaps .     a lamp of poison .     you   ve got to have a mind like old detritus to spot that one .  and fred colon wondered why you   d left the motto in modern ankhian instead of putting it into the old language  and that made me wonder so i sat up with the dictionary and worked it out and  you know  it would have read    ars enixa est candelam .  ars enixa .     that must have really cheered you up .  you   d said who did it and how it was done and gave it to the poor bugger to be proud of .  it didn   t matter that no one else would spot it .  it made you feel good .  because we ordinary mortals just aren   t as clever as you  are we .     he shook his head .     good grief  a coat of arms .  was that the bribe .  was that all it took .      dragon slumped in his chair .      and then i wondered what was in it for you     continued vimes .     oh  there   s a lot of people involved  i expect  for the same old reasons .  but you .  now  my wife breeds dragons .  out of interest  really .  is that what you do .  a little hobby to allow the centuries to fly by .  or does blue blood taste sweeter .  y   know  i hope it was some reason like that .  some decent mad selfish one .         possibly   if someone were so inclined  and i certainly make no such admission  ah ha   they might simply be thinking of improving the race     said the shape in the shadows .      breeding for receding chins or bunny teeth  that sort of thing .     said vimes .     yes  i can see where it   d be more straightforward if you had the whole king business .  all those courtly balls .  all those little arrangements which see to it that the right kind of gal meets only the right kind of boy .  you   ve had hundreds of years  right .  and everyone consults you .  you know where all the family trees are planted .  but it   s all got a bit messy under vetinari  hasn   t it .  all the wrong people are getting to the top .  i know how sybil curses when people leave the pen gates open  it really messes up her breeding program .         you are wrong about captain carrot  ah ha .  the city knows how to work around   difficult kings .  but would it want a future king who might really be called rex .      vimes looked blank .  there was a sigh from the shadows .     i am  ah ha  referring to his apparently stable relationship with the werewolf .      vimes stared .  understanding eventually dawned .     you think they   d have puppies .         the genetics of werewolves are not straightforward  ah ha  but the chance of such an outcome would be considered unacceptable .  if someone were thinking on those lines .         by gods  and that   s it .      the shadows were changing .  dragon was still slumped in his chair  but his outline seemed to be blurring .      whatever the  ah ha  motives  mr .  vimes  there is no evidence other than supposition and coincidence and your will to believe that links me with any attempt on vetinari   s  ah ha  life        the old vampire   s head was sunk even further in his chest .  the shadows of his shoulders seemed to be getting longer .      it was sick  involving the golems     said vimes  watching the shadows .     they could feel what their    king    was doing .  perhaps it wasn   t very sane even to begin with  but it was all they had .  clay of their clay .  the poor devils didn   t have anything except their clay  and you bastards took away even that        dragon leapt suddenly  bat wings unfolding .  vimes   s wooden bolt clattered somewhere near the ceiling as he was borne down .      you really thought you could arrest me with a piece of wood .     said dragon  his hand around vimes   s neck .      no     vimes croaked .     i was more   poetic   than that .  all i had   to do   was keep you talking .  feeling   weak  are you .  the biter bit   you might say    .     he grinned .   the vampire looked puzzled  and then turned his head and stared at the candles .     you   put something in the candles .  really .         we   knew garlic   would smell but   our alchemist reckoned that   if you get   holy water   soak the wicks   water evaporates   just leaves holiness .      the pressure was released .  dragon king of arms sat back on his haunches .  his face had changed  shaping itself forward  giving him an expression like a fox .   then he shook his head .     no     he said  and this time it was his turn to grin .     no  that   s just words .  that wouldn   t work           bet   your   unlife .     rasped vimes  rubbing his neck .     a better way   than old carry went  eh .         trying to trick me into an admission  mr .  vimes .         oh  i had that     said vimes .     when you looked straight at the candles .         really .  ah ah .  but who else saw me .     said dragon .   from the shadows there was a rumble like a distant thunderstorm .      i did     said dorfl .   the vampire looked from the golem to vimes .      you gave one of them a voice .     he said .      yes     said dorfl .  he reached down and picked up the vampire in one hand .     i could kill you     he said .     this is an option available to me as a free thinking individual but i will not do so because i own myself and i have made a moral choice .         oh  gods     murmured vimes under his breath .      that   s blasphemy     said the vampire .   he gasped as vimes shot him a glance like sunlight .     that   s what people say when the voiceless speak .  take him away  dorfl .  put him in the palace dungeons .         i could take no notice of that command but am choosing to do so out of earned respect and social responsibility           yes  yes  fine     said vimes quickly .   dragon clawed at the golem .  he might as well have kicked at a mountain .      undead or alive  you are coming with me     said dorfl .      is there no end to your crimes .  you   ve made this thing a policeman .     said the vampire  struggling as dorfl dragged him away .      no  but it   s an intriguing suggestion  don   t you think .     said vimes .   he was left alone in the thick velvety gloom of the royal college .   and vetinari will let him go  he reflected .  because this is politics .  because he   s part of the way the city works .  besides  there   s the matter of evidence .  i   ve got enough to prove it to myself  but     but i   ll know  he told himself .   oh  he   ll be watched  and maybe one day when vetinari is ready a really good assassin will be sent with a wooden dagger soaked in garlic  and it   ll all be done in the dark .  that   s how politics works in this city .  it   s a game of chess .  who cares if a few pawns die .   i   ll know .  and i   ll be the only one who knows  deep down .   his hands automatically patted his pockets for a cigar .   it was hard enough to kill a vampire .  you could stake them down and turn them into dust and ten years later someone drops a drop of blood in the wrong place and guess who   s back .  they returned more times than raw broccoli .   these were dangerous thoughts  he knew .  they were the kind that crept up on a watchman when the chase was over and it was just you and him  facing one another in that breathless little pinch between the crime and the punishment .   and maybe a watchman had seen civilization with the skin ripped off one time too many and stopped acting like a watchman and started acting like a normal human being and realized that the click of the crossbow or the sweep of the sword would make all the world so clean .   and you couldn   t think like that  even about vampires .  even though they   d take the lives of other people because little lives don   t matter and what the hell can we take away from them .   and  too  you couldn   t think like that because they gave you a sword and a badge and that turned you into something else and that had to mean there were some thoughts you couldn   t think .   only crimes could take place in darkness .  punishment had to be done in the light .  that was the job of a good watchman  carrot always said .  to light a candle in the dark .   he found a cigar .  now his hands did the automatic search for matches .   the volumes were piled up against the walls .  the candlelight picked up gold lettering and the dull gleam of leather .  there they were  the lineages  the books of heraldic minutiae  the who   s whom of the centuries  the stockbooks of the city .  people stood on them to look down .   no matches     quietly  in the dusty silence of the college  vimes picked up a candelabrum and lit his cigar .   he took a few deep luxuriant puffs  and looked thoughtfully at the books .  in his hand  the candles spluttered and flickered .       the clock ticked its arrhythmic tock .  it finally stuttered its way to one o   clock  and vimes got up and went into the oblong office .      ah  vimes     said lord vetinari  looking up .      yes  sir .      vimes had managed a few hours    sleep and had even attempted to shave .   the patrician shuffled some papers on his desk .     it seems to have been a very busy night last night           yes  sir .     vimes stood to attention .  all uniformed men knew in their very soul how to act in circumstances like this .  you stared straight ahead  for one thing .      it appears that i have dragon king of arms in the cells     said the patrician .      yes  sir .         i   ve read your report .  somewhat tenuous evidence  i feel .         sir .         one of your witnesses isn   t even alive  vimes .         no  sir .  neither is the suspect  sir .  technically .         he is  however  an important civic figure .  an authority .         yes  sir .      lord vetinari shuffled some of the papers on his desk .  one of them was covered in sooty fingermarks .     it also appears i have to commend you  commander .         sir .         the heralds at the royal college of arms  or at least at what remains of the royal college of arms  have send me a note saying how bravely you worked last night .         sir .         letting all those heraldic animals out of the pens and raising the alarm and so on .  a tower of strength  they   ve called you .  i gather most of the creatures are lodging with you at the present time .         yes  sir .  couldn   t stand by and let them suffer  sir .  we   d got some empty pens  sir  and keith and roderick are doing well in the lake .  they   ve taken a liking to sybil  sir .      lord vetinari coughed .  then he stared up at the ceiling for a while .     so you  er  assisted in the fire .         yes  sir .  civic duty  sir .         the fire was caused by a candlestick falling over  i understand  possibly after your fight with dragon king of arms .         so i believe  sir .         and so  it seems  do the heralds .         anyone told dragon king of arms .     said vimes innocently .      yes .         took it well  did he .         he screamed a lot  vimes .  in a heart rending fashion  i am told .  and i gather he uttered a number of threats against you  for some reason .         i shall try to fit him into my busy schedule  sir .         bingely bongely beep .  .     said a small bright voice .  vimes slapped a hand against his pocket .   lord vetinari fell silent for a moment .  his fingers drummed softly on his desk .     many fine old manuscripts in that place  i believe .  without price  i   m told .         yes  sir .  certainly worthless  sir .         is it possible you misunderstood what i just said  commander .         could be  sir .         the provenances of many splendid old families went up in smoke  commander .  of course  the heralds will do what they can  and the families themselves keep records but frankly  i understand  it   s all going to be patchwork and guesswork .  extremely embarrassing .  are you smiling  commander .         it was probably a trick of the light  sir .         commander  i always used to consider that you had a definite anti authoritarian streak in you .         sir .         it seems that you have managed to retain this even though you are authority .         sir .         that   s practically zen .         sir .         it seems i   ve only got to be unwell for a few days and you manage to upset everyone of any importance in this city .         sir .         was that a    yes  sir    or a    no  sir     sir samuel .         it was just a    sir     sir .      vimes glanced at a piece of paper .     did you really punch the president of the assassins    guild .         yes  sir .         why .         didn   t have a dagger  sir .      vetinari turned away abruptly .     the council of churches  temples  sacred groves  and big ominous rocks is demanding   well  a number of things  several of them involving wild horses .  initially  however  they want me to sack you .         yes  sir .         in all i   ve had seventeen demands for your badge .  some want parts of your body attached .  why did you have to upset everybody .         i suppose it   s a knack  sir .         but what could you hope to achieve .         well  sir  since you ask  we found out who murdered father tubelcek and mr .  hopkinson and who was poisoning you  sir .     vimes paused .     two out of three   s not bad  sir .      vetinari riffled through the papers again .     workshop owners  assassins  priests  butchers   you seem to have infuriated most of the leading figures in the city .     he sighed .     really  it seems i have no choice .  as of this week  i   m giving you a pay raise .      vimes blinked .     sir .         nothing unseemly .  ten dollars a month .  and i expect they need a new dart board in the watch house .  they usually do  i recall .         it   s detritus     said vimes  his mind unable to think of anything other than an honest reply .     he tends to split them .         ah  yes .  and talking of splits  vimes  i wonder if your forensic genius could help me with a little conundrum we found this morning .     the patrician stood up and headed for the stairs .      yes  sir .  what is it .     said vimes  following him down .      it   s in the rats chamber  vimes .         really  sir .      vetinari pushed open the double doors .     voila     he said .      that   s some kind of musical instrument  isn   t it  sir .         no  commander  the word means    what is that in the table .        said the patrician sharply .   vimes looked into the room .  there was no one there .  the long mahogany table was bare .   except for the axe .  it had embedded itself in the wood very deeply  almost splitting the table along its entire length .  someone had walked up to the table and brought an axe down right in the center as hard as they could and then left it there  its handle pointing towards the ceiling .      that   s an axe     said vimes .      astonishing     said lord vetinari .     and you   ve barely had time to study it .  why is it there .         i really couldn   t say  sir .         according to the servants  sir samuel  you came into the palace at six o   clock this morning           oh  yes  sir .  to check that the bastard was safely in a cell  sir .  and to see that everything was all right  of course .         you didn   t come into this room .      vimes kept his gaze fixed somewhere on the horizon .     why should i have done that  sir .      the patrician tapped the axe handle .  it vibrated with a faint thumping noise .     i believe some of the city council met in here this morning .  or came in here  at least .  i   m told they hurried out very quickly .  looking rather disturbed  i   m told .         maybe it was one of them that did it  sir .      that is  of course  a possibility     said lord vetinari .     i suppose you won   t be able to find one of your famous clues on the thing .         shouldn   t think so  sir .  not with all these fingerprints on it .         it would be a terrible thing  would it not  if people thought they could take the law into their own hands           oh  no fear of that  sir .  i   m holding on tightly to it .      lord vetinari plunked the axe again .     tell me  sir samuel  do you know the phrase    quis custodiet ipsos custodes .     .      it was an expression carrot had occasionally used  but vimes was not in the mood to admit anything .     can   t say that i do  sir     he said .     something about trifle  is it .         it means    who guards the guards themselves .     sir samuel .         ah .         well .         sir .         who watches the watch .  i wonder .         oh  that   s easy  sir .  we watch one another .         really .  an intriguing point        lord vetinari walked out of the room and back into the main hall  with vimes trailing behind .     however     he said     in order to keep the peace  the golem will have to be destroyed .         no  sir .         allow me to repeat my instruction .         no  sir .         i   m sure i just gave you an order  commander .  i distinctly felt my lips move .         no  sir .  he   s alive  sir .         he   s just made of clay  vimes .         aren   t we all  sir .  according to them pamphlets constable visit keeps handing out .  anyway  he thinks he   s alive  and that   s good enough for me .      the patrician waved a hand towards the stairs and his office full of paper .     nevertheless  commander  i   ve had no less than nine missives from leading religious figures declaring that he is an abomination .         yes  sir .  i   ve given that viewpoint a lot of thought  sir  and reached the following conclusion  arseholes to the lot of    em  sir .      the patrician   s hand covered his mouth for a moment .     sir samuel  you are a harsh negotiator .  surely you can give and take .         couldn   t say  sir .     vimes walked to the main doors and pushed them open .      fog   s lifted  sir     he said .     there   s a bit of cloud but you can see all the way across the brass bridge           what will you use the golem for .         not use  sir .  employ .  i thought he might be useful for to keep the peace  sir .         a watchman .         yes  sir     said vimes .     haven   t you heard  sir .  golems do all the mucky jobs .      vetinari watched him go  and sighed .     he does so like a dramatic exit     he said .      yes  my lord     said drumknott  who had appeared noiselessly at his shoulder .      ah  drumknott .     the patrician took a length of candle out of his pocket and handed it to his secretary .     dispose of this somewhere safely  will you .         yes  my lord .         it   s the candle from the other night .         it   s not burned down  my lord .  but i saw the candle end in the holder           oh  of course i cut off enough to make a stub and let the wick burn for a moment .  i couldn   t let our gallant policeman know i   d worked it out for myself  could i .  not when he was making such an effort and having so much fun being   well  being vimes .  i   m not completely heartless  you know .         but  my lord  you could have sorted it out diplomatically .  instead he went around upsetting things and making a lot of people very angry and afraid           yes .  dear me .  tsk  tsk .         ah     said drumknott .      quite so     said the patrician .      do you wish me to have the table in the rats chamber repaired .         no  drumknott  leave the axe where it is .  it will make a good   conversation piece  i think .         may i make an observation  my lord .         of course you may     said vetinari  watching vimes walk through the palace gates .      the thought occurs  sir  that if commander vimes did not exist you would have had to invent him .         you know  drumknott  i rather think i did .             atheism is also a religious position     dorfl rumbled .      no it   s not .     said constable visit .     atheism is a denial of a god .         therefore it is a religious position     said dorfl .     indeed  a true atheist thinks of the gods constantly  albeit in terms of denial .  therefore  atheism is a form of belief .  if the atheist truly did not believe  he or she would not bother to deny .         did you read those pamphlets i gave you .     said visit suspiciously .      yes .  many of them did not make sense .  but i should like to read some more .         really .     said visit .  his eyes gleamed .     you really want more pamphlets .         yes .  there is much in them that i would like to discuss .  if you know some priests  i would enjoy disputation .         all right  all right     said sergeant colon .     so are you going to take the sodding oath or not  dorfl .      dorfl held up a hand the size of a shovel .     i  dorfl  pending the discovery of a deity whose existence withstands rational debate  swear by the temporary precepts of a self derived moral system           you really want more pamphlets .     said constable visit .   sergeant colon rolled his eyes .      yes     said dorfl .      oh  my god .     said constable visit  and burst into tears .     no one   s ever asked for more pamphlets before .      colon turned when he realized vimes was watching .     it   s no good  sir     he said .     i   ve been trying to swear him in for half an hour  sir  and we keep ending up arguing about oaths and things .         you willing to be a watchman  dorfl .     said vimes .      yes .         right .  that   s as good as a swear to me .  give him his badge  fred .  and this is for you  dorfl .  it   s a chit to say you   re officially alive  just in case you run into any trouble .  you know   with people .         thank you     said dorfl solemnly .     if ever i feel i am not alive  i will take this out and read it .         what are your duties .     said vimes .      to serve the public trust  protect the innocent  and seriously prod buttock  sir     said dorfl .      he learns fast  doesn   t he .     said colon .     i didn   t even tell him the last one .         people won   t like it     said nobby .        s not going to be popular  a golem as a watchman .         what better work for one who loves freedom than the job of watchman .  law is the servant of freedom .  freedom without limits is just a word     said dorfl ponderously .      y   know     said colon     if it doesn   t work out  you could always get a job making fortune cookies .         funny thing  that     said nobby .     you never get bad fortunes in cookies  ever noticed that .  they never say stuff like     oh dear  things are going to be really bad .     i mean  they   re never misfortune cookies .      vimes lit a cigar and shook the match to put it out .     that  corporal  is because of one of the fundamental driving forces of the universe .         what .  like  people who read fortune cookies are the lucky ones .     said nobby .      no .  because people who sell fortune cookies want to go on selling them .  come on  constable dorfl .  we   re going for a walk .         there   s a lot of paperwork  sir     said sergeant colon .      tell captain carrot i said he should look at it     said vimes  from the doorway .      he hasn   t been in yet  sir .         it   ll keep .         right  sir .      colon went and sat behind his desk .  it was a good place to be  he   d decided .  there was absolutely no chance of finding any nature there .  he   d had a rare conversation with mrs .  colon this morning and made it clear that he was no longer interested in getting close to the soil because he   d been as close to the soil as it was possible to get and the soil  it turned out  was just dirt .  a good thick layer of cobblestones was  he decided  about as close as he wanted to get to nature .  also  nature tended to be squishy .      i   ve got to go on duty     said nobby .     captain carrot wants me to do crime prevention in peach pie street .         how d   you do that  then .     said colon .      keep away  he said .         ere  nobby  woss this about you not being a lord after all .     said colon cautiously .      i think i got the sack     said nobby .     bit of a relief  really .  that nobby grub isn   t much  and the drink is frankly piss .         lucky escape for you  then     said colon .     i mean  you won   t have to go giving your clothes away to gardeners and so on .         yeah .  wish i   d never told them about the damn    ring  really .         would   ve saved you a lot of trouble  certainly     said colon .   nobby spat on his badge and buffed it industriously with his sleeve .     s a good job i never told them about the tiara  the coronet  and the three gold lockets  he said to himself .          where are we going .     said dorfl  as vimes strolled across the brass bridge .      i thought i might break you in gently with some guard duty at the palace     said vimes .      ah .  this is where my new friend constable visit is also on guard     said dorfl .      splendid .         i wish to ask you a question     said the golem .      yes .         i smashed the treadmill but the golems repaired it .  why .  and i let the animals go but they just milled around stupidly .  some of them even went back to the slaughter pens .  why .         welcome to the world  constable dorfl .         is it frightening to be free .         you said it .         you say to people    throw off your chains    and they make new chains for themselves .         seems to be a major human activity  yes .      dorfl rumbled as he thought about this .     yes     he said eventually .     i can see why .  freedom is like having the top of your head opened up .         i   ll have to take your word for that  constable .         and you will pay me twice as much as other watchmen     said dorfl .      will i .         yes .  i do not sleep .  i can work constantly .  i am a bargain .  i do not need days off to bury my granny .      how soon they learn  thought vimes .  he said     but you have holy days off  don   t you .         either all days are holy or none are .  i have not decided yet .         er   what do you need money for  dorfl .         i shall save up and purchase the golem klutz who labors in the pickle factory  and give him to himself  then together we will earn and save for the golem bobkes of the coal merchant  the three of us will labor and buy the golem shmata who toils at the seven dollar tailor   s in peach pie street  then the four of us will           some people might decide to free their comrades by force and bloody revolution     said vimes .     not that i   m suggesting that in any way  of course .         no .  that would be theft .  we are bought and sold .  so we will buy ourselves free .  by our labor .  no one else to do it for us .  we will do it by ourselves .      vimes smiled to himself .  probably no other species in the world would demand a receipt with their freedom .  some things you just couldn   t change .     ah     he said .     it seems some people want to talk to us        a crowd was approaching over the bridge  in a mass of gray  black  and saffron robes .  it was made up of priests .  they looked angry .  as they pushed and shoved their way through the other citizens  several haloes became interlocked .   at their head was hughnon ridcully  chief priest of blind io and the closest thing ankh morpork had to a spokesman on religious issues .  he spotted vimes and hurried towards him  admonitory finger upraised .      now  see here  vimes       he began  and stopped .  he glared at dorfl .      is this it .     he said .      if you mean the golem  this is him     said vimes .     constable dorfl  your reverence .      dorfl touched his helmet respectfully .     how may we be of service .     he said .      you   ve done it this time  vimes .     said ridcully  ignoring him .     you   ve gone altogether too far by half .  you made this thing speak and it isn   t even alive .         we want it smashed .         blasphemy .         people won   t stand for it .      ridcully looked around at the other priests .     i   m talking     he said .  he turned back to vimes .     this comes under the heading of gross profanity and the worship of idols           i don   t worship him .  i   m just employing him     said vimes  beginning to enjoy himself .     and he   s far from idle .     he took a deep breath .     and if it   s gross profanity you   re looking for           excuse me     said dorfl .      we   re not listening to you .  you   re not even really alive .     said a priest .   dorfl nodded .     this is fundamentally true     he said .      see .  he admits it .         i suggest you take me and smash me and grind the bits into fragments and pound the fragments into powder and mill them again to the finest dust there can be  and i believe you will not find a single atom of life           true .  let   s do it .         however  in order to test this fully  one of you must volunteer to undergo the same process .      there was silence .      that   s not fair     said a priest  after a while .     all anyone has to do is bake up your dust again and you   ll be alive        there was more silence .   ridcully said     is it only me  or are we on tricky theological ground here .      there was more silence .   another priest said     is it true you   ve said you   ll believe in any god whose existence can be proved by logical debate .         yes .      vimes had a feeling about the immediate future and took a few steps away from dorfl .      but the gods plainly do exist     said a priest .      it is not evident .      a bolt of lightning lanced through the clouds and hit dorfl   s helmet .  there was a sheet of flame and then a trickling noise .  dorfl   s molten armor formed puddles around his white hot feet .      i don   t call that much of an argument     said dorfl calmly  from somewhere in the clouds of smoke .      it   s tended to carry the audience     said vimes .     up until now .      the chief priest of blind io turned to the other priests .     all right  you fellows  there   s no need for any of that           but offler is a vengeful god     said a priest at the back of the crowd .      trigger happy is what he is     said ridcully .  another lightning bolt zigzagged down but bent at right angles a few feet above the chief priest   s hat and earthed itself on a wooden hippo  which split .  the chief priest smiled smugly and turned back to dorfl  who was making little clinking noises as he cooled .      what you   re saying is  you   ll accept the existence of any god only if it can be proved by discussion .         yes     said dorfl .   ridcully rubbed his hands together .     not a problem  me old china     he said .     firstly  let us take the           excuse me     said dorfl .  he bent down and picked up his badge .  the lightning had given it an interesting melted shape .      what are you doing .     said ridcully .      somewhere  a crime is happening     said dorfl .     but when i am off duty i will gladly dispute with the priest of the most worthy god .      he turned and strode on across the bridge .  vimes nodded hurriedly at the shocked priests and hurried after him .  we took him and baked him in the fire and he   s turned out to be free  he thought .  no words in the head except the ones he   s chosen to put there himself .  and he   s not just an atheist  he   s a ceramic atheist .  fireproof .   it looked like being a good day .   behind them  on the bridge  a fight was breaking out .       angua was packing .  or  rather  she was failing to pack .  the bundle couldn   t be too heavy to carry by mouth .  but a little money  she wouldn   t have to buy much food  and a change of clothes  for those occasions when she might have to wear clothes  didn   t have to take up much room .      the boots are a problem     she said aloud .      maybe if you knot the laces together you could carry them round your neck .     said cheri  who was sitting on the narrow bed .      good idea .  do you want these dresses .  i   ve never got round to wearing them .  i expect you could cut them down .      cheri took them in both arms .     this one   s silk .         there   s probably enough material for you to make two for one .         d   you mind if i share them out .  only some of the lads   the ladies at the watch house      cheri savored the word    ladies         are beginning to get a bit thoughtful           going to melt down their helmets  are they .     said angua .      oh  no .  but perhaps they could be made into a more attractive design .  er           yes .         um        cheri shifted uneasily .      you   ve never actually eaten anyone  have you .  you know   crunching bones and so on .         no .         i mean  i only heard my second cousin was eaten by werewolves .  he was called sfen .         can   t say i recall the name     said angua .   cheri tried to grin .     that   s all right  then     she said .      so you won   t need that silver spoon in your pocket     said angua .   cheri   s mouth dropped open  and then the words tumbled over themselves .     er   i don   t know how it got there it must have dropped in when i was washing up .  oh i didn   t mean           it doesn   t worry me  honestly .  i   m used to it .         but i didn   t think you   d           look  don   t get the wrong idea .  it   s not a case of not wanting to     said angua .     it   s a case of wanting to and not doing it .         you don   t really have to go  do you .         oh  i don   t know if i can take the watch seriously and   and sometimes i think carrot   s working up to ask me   and  well  it   d never work out .  it   s the way he just assumes everything  you know .  so best to go now     angua lied .      won   t carrot try to stop you .         yes  but there   s nothing he can say .         he   ll be upset .         yes     said angua briskly  throwing another dress on the bed .     and then he   ll get over it .         hrolf thighbiter   s asked me out     said cheri shyly  looking at the floor .     and i   m almost certain he   s male .         glad to hear it .      cheri stood up .     i   ll walk with you as far as the watch house .  i   ve got to go on duty .      they were halfway along elm street before they saw carrot  head and shoulders above the crowd .      looks like he was coming to see you     said cheri .     er  shall i go away .         too late           ah  good morning  corporal miss littlebottom .     said carrot cheerfully .     hello  angua .  i was just coming to see you but i had to write my letter home first  of course .      he took off his helmet  and smoothed back his hair .     er       he began .      i know what you   re going to ask     said angua .      you do .         i know you   ve been thinking about it .  you knew i was wondering about going .         it was obvious  was it .         and the answer   s no .  i wish it could be yes .      carrot looked astonished .     it never occurred to me that you   d say no     he said .     i mean  why should you .         good grief  you amaze me     she said .     you really do .         i thought it   d be something you   d want to do .     said carrot .  he sighed .     oh  well   it doesn   t matter  really .      angua felt that a leg had been kicked away .     it doesn   t matter .     she said .      i mean  yes  it   d have been nice  but i won   t lose any sleep over it .         you won   t .         well  no .  obviously not .  you   ve got other things you want to do .  that   s fine .  i just thought you might enjoy it .  i   ll do it by myself .         what .  how can    .     angua stopped .     what are you talking about  carrot .         the dwarf bread museum .  i promised mr .  hopkinson   s sister that i   d tidy it up .  you know  get it sorted out .  she   s not very well off and i thought it could raise some money .  just between you and me  there   s several exhibits in there that could be better presented  but i   m afraid mr .  hopkinson was rather set in his ways .  i   m sure there   s a lot of dwarfs in the city that   d flock there if they knew about it  and of course there   s a lot of youngsters that ought to learn more about their proud heritage .  a good dusting and a lick of paint would make all the difference  i   m sure  especially on the older loaves .  i don   t mind giving up a few days off .  i just thought it might cheer you up  but i appreciate that bread isn   t everyone   s cup of tea .      angua stared at him .  it was the stare that carrot so often attracted .  it roamed every feature of his face  looking for the tiniest clue that he was making some kind of joke .  some long  deep joke at the expense of everyone else .  every sinew in her body knew that he must be  but there was not a clue  not a twitch to prove it .      yes     she said weakly  still searching his face     i expect it could be a little goldmine .         museums have got to be a whole lot more interesting these days .  and  you know  there   s a whole guerrilla crumpet assortment he hasn   t even catalogued     said carrot .     and some early examples of defensive bagels .         gosh     said angua .     hey  why don   t we paint a big sign saying something like    the dwarf bread experience    .         that probably wouldn   t work for dwarfs     said carrot  oblivious to sarcasm .     a dwarf bread

strange and foreign parts  where he met lots of young ladies who didn   t wear many clothes .  he eventually died from stepping on a tiger .  a good deed goes around the world .          that is to say  the sort you can use to give something three extra legs and then blow it up .        town hall        because ankh morpork doesn   t have a town hall .          yeast bowl       commander vimes  on the other hand  was all for giving criminals a short  sharp shock .  it really depended on how tightly they could be tied to the lightning rod .        constable visit was an omnian  whose country   s traditional approach to evangelism was to put unbelievers to torture and the sword .  things had become a lot more civilized these days but omnians still had a strenuous and indefatigable approach to spreading the word  and had merely changed the nature of the weapons .  constable visit spent his days off in company with his co religionist smite the unbeliever with cunning arguments  ringing doorbells and causing people to hide behind the furniture everywhere in the city .        detritus was particularly good when it came to asking questions .  he had three basic ones .  they were the direct     did you do it .       the persistent     are you sure it wasn   t you that done it .      and the subtle     it was you what done it  wasn   t it .   .  although they were not the most cunning questions ever devised  detritus   s talent was to go on patiently asking them for hours on end  until he got the right answer  which was generally something like     yes .  yes .  i did it .  i did it .  now please tell me what it was i did .           it is a pervasive and beguiling myth that the people who design instruments of death end up being killed by them .  there is almost no foundation in fact .  colonel shrapnel wasn   t blown up  m .  guillotin died with his head on  colonel gatling wasn   t shot .  if it hadn   t been for the murder of cosh and blackjack maker sir william blunt instrument in an alleyway  the rumor would never have got started .        welcome  corporal smallbottom .  this is constable angua   angua  show smallbottom how well you   re learning dwarfish             the ankh morpork view of crime and punishment was that the penalty for the first offense should prevent the possibility of a second offense .        this always happens in any police chase anywhere .  a heavily laden lorry will always pull out of a side alley in front of the pursuit .  if vehicles aren   t involved  then it   ll be a man with a rack of garments .  or two men with a large sheet of glass .  there   s probably some kind of secret society behind all this .        and for the most part were unconcerned about matters of height .  there   s a dwarfish saying     all trees are felled at ground level      although this is said to be an excessively bowdlerized translation for a saw which more literally means     when his hands are higher than your head  his groin is level with your teeth .           these terms are often synonymous .        as they were euphemistically named .  people said     they call themselves seamstresses   hem  hem .           because of the huge obtrusive mass of his forehead  rogers the bulls    view of the universe was from two eyes each with their own non overlapping hemispherical view of the world .  since there were two separate visions  rogers had reasoned  that meant there must be two bulls  bulls not having been bred for much deductive reasoning  .  most bulls believe this  which is why they always keep turning their head this way and that when they look at you .  they do this because both of them want to see .
