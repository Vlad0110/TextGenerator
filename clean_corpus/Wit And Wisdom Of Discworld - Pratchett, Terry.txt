press      through the wardrobe into discworld   it was the wit of terry pratchett that first attracted me to the books  and which then led to my pushing past the fur coats and finding myself in his magical world   thankfully devoid of turkish delight and talking beavers .   one of the big questions about discworld for a newcomer is    where do i start .     this is a tricky one .  for every diehard fan of rincewind there   s an advocate for small gods .  for everyone who loves the    witch    or    city watch    books  there is another who prefers the    one theme    books  such as soul music and moving pictures .  i  as it happens  kicked off with mort .   terry writes fantasy   but his books are grounded firmly in reality .  they contain heroes  not many   cowards  villains  bigots  crooks  the strong willed and the weak willed .  sometimes they are human .  a lot of the time they are not .  the series extends across many genres and deals with real issues .  but terry uses his wit to sharpen his pen  the humour in the books can be dark  and it can be so corny you may groan out loud as you read him on the train .   in producing this book  i have not tried to extract every single gag and witty exchange from the series .  there are too many  and to do that  i might just as well have tied a set of the novels up with string and added a tag     the complete wit of pratchett    .   what i have done is re read every book in the canon  and pull out the extracts that appealed to me .  sometimes they   ll be a page long  sometimes they   ll be a single line of text .  sometimes a really good gag has been omitted because it needs the buildup that the novel can give but which would take too long to set up in a book of quotations .  here and there  i   ve had to change the odd word  or omit the occasional phrase  to help the quotation work outside its context in the novel .   the extracts are presented book by book  in the order in which they were published .  each book   s section starts with the cover blurb  which in most cases was written by terry   to give you the same sort of idea of the novel   s plot as you   d get if you were browsing the shelves of your local bookstore .       it   s a big book   do i have to read it all at once .    don   t panic  you don   t need to sit and read this book section by section  from cover to cover .  this is more of a    dip into    book .  if you   re new to terry   s novels  this cornucopia of snippets may inspire you to go out and buy and read one   or more   of them .  oh  and the maps  diaries  audio books  scarf    as for you keen discworld readers  what i hope is that  as you browse through this book   by torchlight under the covers last thing at night  smeared with sun lotion on a beach in greece  on a long coach trip  sat on the privy   you   ll find some of your favourite pieces from the discworld canon .  i haven   t had the luxury of doing my research in any of these exotic locations   but i enjoyed the opportunity to wander once more through the roughly four million words which currently make up the series     around twice the complete wordage of the bible and all shakespeare   s plays .   stephen briggs  www . stephenbriggs . com   www . studiotheatreclub . com      on a world supported on the back of a giant turtle  sex  sex unknown   a gleeful  explosive  wickedly eccentric expedition sets out .  there   s an avaricious but inept wizard  rincewind   a naive tourist  twoflower  whose luggage moves on hundreds of dear little legs  dragons who only exist if you believe in them  and of course the edge of the planet     how it all began   in a distant and second hand set of dimensions  in an astral plane that was never meant to fly  the curling star mists waver and part        there was the theory that a    tuin had come from nowhere and would continue at a uniform crawl  or steady gait  into nowhere  for all time .  this theory was popular among academics .   an alternative  favoured by those of a religious persuasion  was that a       tuin was crawling from the birthplace to the time of mating  as were all the stars in the sky which were  obviously  also carried by giant turtles .  when they arrived they would briefly and passionately mate  for the first and only time  and from that fiery union new turtles would be born to carry a new pattern of worlds .  this was known as the big bang hypothesis .      the twin city of ankh morpork  foremost of all the cities bounding the circle sea  was as a matter of course the home of a large number of gangs  thieves    guilds  syndicates and similar organizations .  this was one of the reasons for its wealth .      the stranger smiled widely and fumbled yet again in the pouch .  this time his hand came out holding a large gold coin .  it was in fact slightly larger than an       dollar ankhian crown and the design on it was unfamiliar  but it spoke inside hugh   s mind in a language he understood perfectly .  my current owner  it said  is in need of succour and assistance  why not give it to him  so you and me can go off somewhere and enjoy ourselves .      if complete and utter chaos was lightning  then he   d be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armour and shouting    all gods are bastards    .     tourist  rincewind had decided  meant    idiot    .     at about this time a hitherto unsuccessful fortune teller living on the other side of the block chanced to glance into her scrying bowl  gave a small scream and  within the hour  had sold her jewellery  various magical accoutrements  most of her clothes and almost all her other possessions that could not be conveniently carried on the fastest horse she could buy .  the fact that later on  when herhouse collapsed in flames  she herself died in a freak landslide in the morpork mountains  proves that death  too  has a sense of humour .      the patrician of ankh morpork smiled  but with his mouth only .         i   m sure you won   t dream of trying to escape from your obligations by fleeing the city            i assure you the thought never even crossed my mind  lord .         indeed .  then if i were you i   d sue my face for slander .            ah  gorphal     said the patrician pleasantly .     come in .  sit down .  can i press you to a candied starfish .         i am yours to command  master     said the old man calmly .     save  perhaps  in the matter of preserved echinoderms .         there are said to be some mystic rivers   one drop of which can steal a man   s life away .  after its turbid passage through the twin cities the ankh could have been one of them .      that   s what   s so stupid about the whole magic thing     you spend twenty years learning the spell that makes nude virgins appear in your bedroom  and then you   re so poisoned by quicksilver fumes and half blind from reading old grimoires that you can   t remember what happens next .      death  on discworld  is a character in his own right  and throughout the series is recognizable by always speaking in block capitals .   death  insofar as it was possible in a face with no movable features  looked surprised .  rlncewlnd .      why are you here .      urn  why not .     said rincewind .   i was surprised that you jostled me  rincewind .  for i have an appointment with thee this very night .      oh no  not        of course  what   s so bloody vexing about the whole business is that i was expecting to meet thee in pseudopolis .      but that   s five hundred miles away .      you don   t have to tell me  the whole system   s got screwed up again .  i can see that .      i   ll get you yet  cully  said death  in a voice like the slamming of leaden coffin lids .      death sat in his garden  running a whetstone along the edge of his scythe .  it was already so sharp that any passing breeze that blew across it was sliced smoothly into two puzzled zephyrs .         run away and leave hrun with that thing .     twoflower said .   rincewind looked blank .     why not .     he said .     it   s his job .         but it   ll kill him .         it could be worse     said rincewind .      what .         it could be us     rincewind pointed out logically .         we   ve strayed into a zone with a high magical index     rincewind said .     don   t ask me how .  once upon a time a really powerful magic field must have been generated here  and we   re feeling the after effects .         precisely    said a passing bush .         you don   t understand .     screamed the tourist  above the terrible noise of the wingbeats .     all my life i   ve wanted to see dragons .         from the inside .     shouted rincewind .         you   re your own worst enemy  rincewind     said the sword .   rincewind looked up at grinning men .      bet .     he said wearily .         well     said the voice .     you see  one of the disadvantages of being dead is that one is released as it were from the bonds of time and therefore i can see everything that has happened or will happen  all at the same time except that of course i now know that time does not  for all practical purposes  exist .         that doesn   t sound like a disadvantage     said twoflower .   you don   t think so .  imagine every moment being at one and the same time a distant memory and a nasty surprise and you   ll see what i mean .        i   d rather be a slave than a corpse .     plants on the disc  while including the categories known commonly as annuals      and perennials      also included a few rare reannuals which  because of an unusual four dimensional twist in their genes  could be planted this year to come up last year .  the vul nut vine was particularly exceptional in that it could flourish as many as eight years prior to its seed actually being sown .  vul nut wine was reputed to give certain drinkers an insight into the future which was  from the nut   s point of view  the past .  strange but true .         we know all about you  rincewind the magician .  you are a man of great cunning and artifice .  you laugh in house collapsed in flames  she herself died in a freak landslide in the morpork mountains  proves that death  too  has a sense of humour .      the patrician of ankh morpork smiled  but with his mouth only .         i   m sure you won   t dream

and then you   re so poisoned by quicksilver fumes and half blind from reading old grimoires that you can   t remember what happens next .      death  on discworld  is a character in his own right  and throughout the series is recognizable by always speaking in block capitals .   death  insofar as it was possible in a face with no movable features  looked surprised .  rlncewlnd .      why are you here .      um  why not .     said rincewind .   i was surprised that you jostled me  rincewind .  for i have an appointment with thee this very night .      oh no  not        of course  what   s

of his scythe .  it was already so sharp that any passing breeze that blew across it was sliced smoothly into two puzzled zephyrs .       as it moves towards a seemingly inevitable collision with a malevolent red star  the discworld has only one possible saviour .  unfortunately  this happens to be the singularly inept and cowardly wizard called rincewind  who was last seen falling off the edge of the world      it is said that someone at a party once asked the famous philosopher ly tin wheedle    why are you here .     and the reply took three years .      cori celesti  upon whose utter peak the world   s quarrelsome and somewhat bourgeois gods lived in a palace of marble  alabaster and uncut moquette three piece suites they had chosen to call dunmanifestin .  it was always a considerable annoyance to any disc citizen with pretensions to culture that they were ruled by gods whose idea of an uplifting artistic experience was a musical doorbell .      trymon didn   t smile often enough  and he liked figures and the sort of organization charts that show lots of squares with arrows pointing to other squares .  in short  he was the sort of man who could use the word    personnel    and mean it .         do you think there   s anything to eat in this forest .         yes     said the wizard bitterly     us .             there are  some big mushrooms     can you eat them .      rincewind looked at them cautiously .     no  no good to eat at all .         why .     called twoflower .     are the gills the wrong shade of yellow .         no  not really            i expect the stems haven   t got the right kind of fluting  then .         they look okay  actually .         the cap  then  i expect the cap is the wrong colour     said twoflower .      not sure about that .         well then  why can   t you eat them .      rincewind coughed .     it   s the little doors and windows     he said wretchedly     it   s a dead giveaway        he moved in a way that suggested he was attempting the world speed record for the nonchalant walk .         i said i hope it is a good party     said galder  loudly .   at the moment it is  said death levelly .  i think it might go downhill very quickly at midnight .      why .      that   s when they think i   ll be taking my mask off .   he vanished  leaving only a cocktail stick and a short paper streamer behind .      when the first explorers from the warm lands around the circle sea travelled into the chilly hinterland they filled in the blank spaces on their maps by grabbing the nearest native  pointing at some distant landmark  speaking very clearly in a loud voice  and writing down whatever the bemused man told them .  thus were immortalized in generations of atlases such geographical oddities as just a mountain  i don   t know  what .  and  of course  your finger you fool .      cohen the barbarian enters the discworld canon   the barbarian chieftain said     what then are the greatest things that a man may find in life .      the man on his right spoke thus     the crisp horizon of the steppe  the wind in your hair  a fresh horse under you .      the man on his left said     the cry of the white eagle in the heights  the fall of snow in the forest  a true arrow in your bow .      the chieftain nodded  and said     surely it is the sight of your enemy slain  the humiliation of his tribe and the lamentation of his women .      then the chieftain turned respectfully to his guest  and said     but our guest  whose name is legend  must tell us truly  what is it that a man may call the greatest things in life .      the warriors leaned closer .  this should be worth hearing .   the guest thought long and hard and then said  with deliberation     hot water  good dentishtry and shoft lavatory paper .          he was  a very old man  the skinny variety that generally gets called    spry     with a totally bald head  a beard almost down to his knees  and a pair of matchstick legs on which varicose veins had traced the street map of quite a large city            when i was a young man  carving my name in the world  well  then i liked my women red haired and fiery        ah .         and then i grew a little older and for preference i looked for a woman with blonde hair and the glint of the world in her eye .         oh .  yes .         but then i grew a little older again and i came to see the point of dark women of a sultry nature .      he paused .  rincewind waited .      and .     he said .     then what .  what is it that you look for in a woman now .      cohen turned one rheumy blue eye on him .      patience     he said .      cohen  had   .  .   .  spent his life living rough under the sky  and  knew the value of a good thick book  which ought to outlast at least a season of cooking fires if you were careful how you tore the pages out .  many a life had been saved on a snowy night by a handful of sodden kindling and a really dry book .  if you felt like a smoke and couldn   t find a pipe  a book was your man every time .   cohen realized people wrote things in books .  it had always seemed to him to be a frivolous waste of paper .         if you kill me a thousand will take my place     said the man  who was now backed against the wall .      yes     said cohen  in a reasonable tone of voice     but that isn   t the point  is it .  the point is  you   ll be dead .         greyhald spold  currently the oldest wizard on the disc and determined to keep it that way  has been very busy .  the servants have been dismissed .  the doorways have been sealed with a paste made from powdered mayflies  and protective octograms have been drawn on the windows .  rare and rather smelly oils have been poured in complex patterns on the floor  in the very centre of the room is the eightfold octogram of withholding  surrounded by red and green candles .  and in the centre of that is a box  lined with red silk and yet more protective amulets .  because greyhald spold knows that death is looking for him  and has spent many years designing an impregnable hiding place .   he has just set the complicated clockwork of the lock and shut the lid  lying back in the knowledge that here at last is the perfect defence against the most ultimate of all his enemies  although as yet he has not considered the important part that airholes must play in an enterprise of this kind .   and right beside him  very close to his ear  a voice has just said  dark in here  isn   t it .      seven league boots are a tricksy form of magic at best  and the utmost caution must be taken in using a means of transport which  when all is said and done  relies for its effectiveness on trying to put one foot twenty one miles in front of the other .     cohen had heard of fighting fair  and had long ago decided he wanted no part of it .     twoflower didn   t just look at the world through rose tinted spectacles  rincewind knew     he looked at it through a rose tinted brain  too  and heard it through rose tinted ears .      there was no real point in trying to understand anything twoflower said  and all anyone could do was run alongside the conversation and hope to jump on as it turned a corner .        his name   s twoflower .  he isn   t from these parts .         doeshn   t look like it .  friend of yoursh .         we   ve got this sort of hate hate relationship  yes .        that   s old twoflower  rincewind thought .  it   s not that he doesn   t appreciate beauty  he just appreciates it in his own way .  i mean  if a poet sees a daffodil he stares at it and writes a long poem about it  but twoflower wanders off to find a book on botany .  and treads on it .      then they all heard it  a tiny distant crunching  like something moving very quickly over the snow crust .       it was louder now  a crisp rhythm like someone eating celery very fast .      rincewind was to magic what a bicycle is to a bumblebee .      trolls were not unknown in ankh morpork  of course  where they often got employment as bodyguards .  they tended to be a bit expensive to keep until they learned about doors and didn   t simply leave the house by walking aimlessly through the nearest wall .      there were many drawbacks to being a swordswoman  not least of which was that men didn   t take you seriously until you   d actually killed them  by which time it didn   t really matter anyway .         it   s the star  friend     the man said .     haven   t you seen it in the sky .         we couldn   t help noticing it  yes .         they say that it   ll hit us on hogswatchnight and the seas will boil and the countries of the disc will be broken and kings will be brought down and the cities will be as lakes of glass     said the man .     i   m off to the mountains .         that   ll help  will it .     said rincewind .      no  but the view will be better .         ankh morpork .   pearl of cities .   this is not a completely accurate description  of course   it was not round and shiny   but even its worst enemies would agree that if you had to liken ankh morpork to anything  then it might as well be a piece of rubbish covered with the diseased secretions of a dying mollusc .      there have been bigger cities .  there have been richer cities .  there have certainly been prettier cities .  but no city in the multiverse could rival ankh morpork for its smell .      ankh morpork  largest city in the lands around the circle sea  slept .   that statement is not really true .   on the one hand  those parts of the city which normally concerned themselves with  for example  selling vegetables  shoeing horses  carving exquisite small jade ornaments  changing money and making tables  on the whole  slept .  unless they had insomnia .  or had got up in the night as it might be  to go to the lavatory .  on the other hand  many of the less law abiding citizens were wide awake and  for instance  climbing through windows that didn   t belong to them  slitting throats  mugging one another  listening to loud music in smoky cellars and generally having a lot more fun .  but most of the animals were asleep  except for the rats .  and the bats  too  of course .  as far as the insects were concerned      the point is that descriptive writing is very rarely entirely accurate and during the reign of olaf quimby ii as patrician of ankh some legislation was passed in a determined attempt to put a stop to this sort of thing and introduce some honesty into reporting .  thus  if a legend said of a notable hero that    all men spoke of his prowess    any bard who valued his life would add hastily    except for a couple of people in his home village who thought he was a liar  and quite a lot of other people who had never really heard of him    .  poetic simile was strictly limited to statements like    his mighty steed was as fleet as the wind on a fairly calm day  say about force three     and any loose talk about a beloved having a face that launched a thousand ships would have to be backed by evidence that the object of desire did indeed look like a bottle of champagne .   quimby was eventually killed by a disgruntled poet during an experiment conducted in the palace grounds to prove the disputed accuracy of the proverb    the pen is mightier than the sword     and in his memory it was amended to include the phrase    only if the sword is very small and the pen is very sharp    .     unseen university had never admitted women   muttering something about problems with the plumbing  but the real reason was an unspoken dread that if women were allowed to mess around with magic they would probably be embarrassingly good at it       the octavo filled the room with a dull  sullen light  which wasn   t strictly light at all but the opposite of light  darkness isn   t the opposite of light  it is simply its absence  and what was radiating from the book was the light that lies on the far side of darkness  the light fantastic .   it was a rather disappointing purple colour .      it looked the sort of book described in library catalogues as    slightly foxed     although it would be more honest to admit that it looked as though it had been badgered  wolved and possibly beared as well .         all the shops have been smashed open  there was a whole bunch of people across the street helping themselves to musical instruments  can you believe that .         yeah     said rincewind .     luters  i expect .           you know  i think i might re enroll     said rincewind cheerfully .      i think i could really make a go of things this time .  i can really see myself getting to grips with magic and graduating really well .  they do say if it   s summa cum laude  then the living is easy          a thaum is the basic unit of magical strength .  it has been universally established as the amount of magic needed to create one small white pigeon or three normal sized billiard balls .       the last thing the wizard drum billet did  before death laid a bony band on his shoulder  was to pass on his staff of power to the eighth son of an eighth son .  unfortunately for his colleagues in the chauvinistic  not to say misogynistic  world of magic  he failed to check on the new born baby   s sex     the discworld is          as round and flat as a geological pizza  although without the anchovies .      he came walking through the thunderstorm and you could tell he was a wizard  partly because of the long cloak and carven staff but mainly because the raindrops were stopping several feet from his head  and steaming .      there was a village tucked in a narrow valley between steep woods .  it wasn   t a large village  and wouldn   t have shown up on a map of the mountains .  it barely showed up on a map of the village .      often there is no more than a little plaque to reveal that  against all gynaecological probability  someone very famous was born halfway up a wall .      granny weatherwax was a witch .  that was quite acceptable in the ramtops  and no one had a bad word to say about witches .  at least  not if he wanted to wake up in the morning the same shape as he went to bed .      granny had heard that broomsticks were once again very much the fashion among younger witches  but she didn   t hold with it .  there was no way a body could look respectable while hurtling through the air aboard a household implement .  besides  it looked decidedly draughty .      although she was aware that somewhere under her complicated strata of vests and petticoats there was some skin  that didn   t mean to say she approved of it .      the old woman had a flat  measured way of speaking sometimes .  it was the kind of voice the creator had probably used .  whether there was magic in it  or just headology it ruled out any possibility of argument .  it made it clear that whatever it was talking about was exactly how things should be .      the witch   s cottage consisted of so many extensions and lean tos that it was difficult to see what the original building had looked like  or even if there had ever been one .      front doors in bad ass were used only by brides and corpses  and granny had always avoided becoming either .      granny had a philosophical objection to reading  but she   d be the last to say that books  especially books with nice thin pages  didn   t have their uses .         do you know how wizards like to be buried .         yes .         well  how .      granny weatherwax paused at the bottom of the stairs .      reluctantly        esk felt that bravery was called for  but on a night like this bravery lasted only as long as a candle stayed alight .      everyone knew there were wolves in the mountains  but they seldom came near the village   the modern wolves were the offspring of ancestors that had survived because they had learned that human meat had sharp edges .         but     smith said     if it   s wizard magic she   s got  learning witchery won   t be any good  will it .  you said they   re different .         they   re both magic .  if you can   t learn to ride an elephant  you can at least learn to ride a horse .         what   s an elephant .         a kind of badger     said granny .  she hadn   t maintained forest credibility for forty years by ever admitting ignorance .      granny grinned .     that   s one form of magic  of course .         what  just knowing things .         knowing things that other people don   t know .            hoki   s a nature god     granny said .     sometimes he manifests himself as an oak tree  or half a man and half a goat  but mainly i see him in his aspect as a bloody nuisance .         a boxful of marzipan ducks on a nearby stall came to life and whirred past the stallholder to land  quacking happily  in the river  where  by dawn  they had all melted  that   s natural selection for you  .     no one can out stare a witch     cept a goat  of course .     granny meanwhile  was two streets away .  she was also  by the standards of other people  lost .  she would not see it like that .  she knew where she was  it was just that everywhere else didn   t .      he had the kind of real deep tan that rich people spend ages trying to achieve with expensive holidays andbits of tinfoil  when really all you need to do to obtain one is work your arse off in the open air every day .      a person ignorant of the possibility of failure can be a halfbrick in the path of the bicycle of history .     if women were as good as men they   d be a lot better .     the air around them reeked of incense and grain and spices and beer  but mainly of the sort of smell that was caused by a high water table  thousands of people  and a robust approach to drainage .      the shades  an ancient part of the city whose inhabitants were largely nocturnal and never enquired about one another   s business because curiosity not only killed the cat but threw it in the river with weights tied to its feet .      the lodgings were on the top floor next to the well guarded premises of a respectable dealer in stolen property because  as granny had heard  good fences make good neighbours .      at some time in the recent past someone had decided to brighten the ancient corridors of the university by painting them  having some vague notion that learning should be fun .  it hadn   t worked .  it   s a fact known throughout the universes that no matter how carefully the colours are chosen  institutional decor ends up as either vomit green  unmentionable brown  nicotine yellow or surgical appliance pink .  by some little understood process of sympathetic resonance  corridors painted in those colours always smell slightly of boiled cabbage   even if no cabbage is ever cooked in the vicinity .      it wasn   t that granny could make herself invisible  it was just that she had this talent for being able to fade into the foreground so that she wasn   t noticed .      books tend to react with one another  creating randomized magic with a mind of its own      one such accident had turned the librarian into an ape  since when he had resisted all attempts to turn him back  explaining in sign language that life as an orang utan was considerably better than life as a human being  because all the big philosophical questions resolved themselves into wondering where the next banana was coming from .  anyway  long arms and prehensile feet were ideal for dealing with high shelves .         you   re wizards .     esk screamed .     bloody well wizz .         cutangle stood with legs planted wide apart  arms akimbo and stomach giving an impression of a beginners    ski slope  the whole of him therefore adopting a pose usually associated with henry viii but with an option on henry ix and x as well .         million to one chances     granny said     crop up nine times out often .         she hit one  which had a face like a small family of squid  and it deflated into a pile of twitching bones and bits of fur and odd ends of tentacle  very much like a greek meal .      but this was a storm of the circle sea plains  and its main ambition was to hit the ground with as much rain as possible .  it was the kind of storm that suggests that the whole sky has swallowed a diuretic .  the thunder and lightning hung around in the background  supplying a sort of chorus  but the rain was the star of the show .  it tap danced across the land .         i was born up in the mountains .  i get seasick on damp grass  if you must know .            you can   t cross the same river twice  i always say      said granny .    cutangle gave this some thought .      i think you   re wrong there     he said .     i must have crossed the same river  oh  thousands of times .         ah  but it wasn   t the same river .         it wasn   t .         no .      cutangle shrugged .     it looked like the same bloody river .             the endless rooftops of the university  which by comparison made gormenghast look like a tool shed on a railway allotment        one thing the water couldn   t do was gurgle out of the ornamental gargoyles ranged around the roofs .  this was because the gargoyles wandered off and sheltered in the attics at the first sign of rain .  they held that just because you were ugly it didn   t mean you were stupid .         i don   t think there   s ever been a lady wizard before     said cutangle .     i rather think it might be against the lore .          death comes to us all .  when he came to mort  he offered him a job .  after being assured that being dead was not compulsory  mort accepted .  however  he soon found out that romantic longings did not mix easily with the responsibilities of being death   s apprentice     reannuals are plants that grow backwards in time .  you sow the seeds this year and they grow last year .   a farmer who neglects to sow ordinary seeds only loses the crop  whereas anyone who forgets to sow seeds of a crop that has already been harvested twelve months before risks disturbing the entire fabric of causality  not to mention acute embarrassment .      then there was the puzzle of why the sun came out during the day  instead of at night when the light would come in useful .      thank you  boy  said the skull .  what is your name .      uh     said mort     mortimer     sir .  they call me mort .      what a coincidence .         i suppose we were all young once .      death considered this .   no  he said  i don   t think so .      death leaned over the saddle and looked down at the kingdoms of the world .   i don   t know about you  he said  but i could murder a curry .         sir .      yes .      what   s a curry .      the blue fires flared deep in the eyes of death .   have you ever bitten a red hot ice cube .      no  sir     said mort .   curry   s like that .      ankh morpork is as full of life as an old cheese on a hot day  as loud as a curse in a cathedral  as bright as an oil slick  as colourful as a bruise and as full of activity  industry  bustle and sheer exuberant busyness as a dead dog on a termite mound .         what are we going to do now .      buy you some new clothes .      these were new today     really .  it certainly adds a new terror to poverty .      they turned into a wider street leading into a more affluent part of the city  the torches were closer together and the middens further apart  .      although the death of the discworld is  in his own words  an anthropomorphic personification  he long ago gave up using the traditional skeletal horses  because of the bother of having to stop all the time to wire bits back on .      death was standing behind a lectern  poring over a map .   you haven   t heard of the bay of mante  have you .  he said .      no  sir     said mort .   famous shipwreck there .      was there .      there will be  said death  if i can find the damn place .      albert grunted .     do you know what happens to lads who ask too many questions .      mort thought for a moment .      no     he said eventually     what .      there was silence .   then albert straightened up and said     damned if i know .  probably they get answers  and serve    em right .         mort remembered the woodcut in his grandmother   s almanack  between the page on planting times and the phases of the moon section  showing dethe thee great levyller comes to alle menne .  he   d stared at it hundreds of times when learning his letters .  it wouldn   t have been half so impressive if it had been generally known that the flame breathing horse the spectre rode was called binky     why is there a cherry on a stick in this drink .      it   s not as if it does anything for the flavour .  why does anyone take a perfectly good drink and then put in a cherry on a pole .      take these things  now  said death  fingering a passing canape .  i mean  mushrooms yes  chicken yes  cream yes  i   ve nothing against any of them  but why in the name of sanity mince them all up and put them in little pastry cases .       that   s mortals for you  death continued .  they   ve only got a few years in this world and they spend them all in making things complicated for themselves .  fascinating .         he doesn   t look a bad king     said mort .     why would anyone want to kill him .      see the man next to him .  with the little moustache and the grin like a lizard .      his cousin  the duke of sto helit .  not the nicest of people  said death .  a handy man with a bottle of poison .  fifth in line to the throne last year  now second in line .  blt of a social climber  you might say .        my granny says that dying is like going to sleep     mort added  a shade hopefully .   i wouldn   t know .  i have done neither .     this part of ankh morpork was known as the shades  an inner city area sorely in need either of governmental help or  for preference  a flamethrower .  it couldn   t be called squalid because that would be stretching the word to breaking point .  it was beyond squalor and out the other side  where by a sort of einsteinian reversal it achieved a magnificent horribleness that it wore like an architectural award .  it was noisy and sultry and smelled like a cowshed floor .      even before it entered the city  the river ankh  was slow and heavy with the silt of the plains  and by the time it got to the shades even an agnostic could have walked across it .  it was hard to drown in the ankh  but easy to suffocate .         why do you trouble igneous cutwell  holder of the eight keys  traveller in the dungeon dimensions  supreme mage of           excuse me     said mort     are you really .         really what .         master of the thingy  lord high wossname of the sacred dungeons .         in a figurative sense .         what does that mean .         well  it means no     said cutwell .         is it possible to walk through walls .     said mort desperately .      using magic .         um     said mort     i don   t think so .         then pick very thin walls     said cutwell .        what time   s sunset around here .         we normally manage to fit it in between night and day .        he felt as if he   d been shipwrecked on the titanic but in the nick of time had been rescued .  by the lusitania .             and the princesses were beautiful as the day is long and so noble they  they could pee through a dozen mattresses           what .      albert hesitated .     something like that  anyway        she looked around slowly and met the impertinent gaze of the doorknocker .  it waggled its metal eyebrows at her and spoke indistinctly through its wrought iron ring .      i am princess keli  heir to the throne of sto lat     she said haughtily        and i don   t talk to door furniture .         fwell  i   m just a doorknocker and i can talk to fwhoever i please     said the gargoyle pleasantly .     and i can ftell you the fmaster iff having a trying day and duff fnot fwant to be disturbed .  but you could ftry to use the magic word     it added .     coming from an attractiff fwoman it works nine times out of eight .         magic word .  what   s the magic word .      the knocker perceptibly sneered .     haff you been taught nothing  miss .      she drew herself up to her full height  which wasn   t really worth the effort .      i have been educated     she informed it with icy precision     by some of the finest scholars in the land .      the doorknocker did not appear to be impressed .      iff they didn   t teach you the magic word     it said calmly     they couldn   t haff fbeen all that fine .      keli reached out  grabbed the heavy ring  and pounded it on the door .  the knocker leered at her .      ftreat me rough     it lisped .     that   f the way i like it .         you   re disgusting .         yeff .  ooo  that waff nife  do it again         the door opened a crack .  there was a shadowy glimpse of curly hair .      madam  i said we   re cl        keli sagged .      please help me     she said .     please .         see .     said the doorknocker triumphantly .     sooner or later everyone remembers the magic word .            the first thing you learn when you enroll at unseen university  i   m afraid  is that people don   t pay much attention to that sort of thing .  it   s what their minds tell them that   s important .             actually it   s not the first thing you learn when you enroll     he added .     i mean  you learn where the lavatories are and all that sort of thing before that .  but after all that  it   s the first thing .         keli drummed her fingers on the table  or tried to .  it turned out to be difficult .  she stared down in vague horror .   cutwell hurried forward and wiped the table with his sleeve .      sorry    he muttered  t had treacle sandwiches for supper last night .         you can tell from the following exchange that these two are made for each other .      i don   t want to get married to anyone yet     mort added .     and certainly not to you  no offence meant .         i wouldn   t marry you if you were the last man on the disc     ysabell said sweetly .   at least i don   t look like i   ve been eating doughnuts in a wardrobe for years     he said  as they stepped out on to death   s black lawn .   at least i walk as if my legs only had one knee each     she said .      my eyes aren   t two juugly poached eggs .      ysabell nodded .     on the other hand  my ears don   t look like something growing on a dead tree .  what does juugly mean .         you know  eggs like albert does them .         with the white all sticky and runny and full of slimy bits .         yes .         a good word     she conceded thoughtfully .     but my hair  i put it to you  doesn   t look like something you clean a privy with .         certainly but neither does mine look like a wet hedgehog .         pray note that my chest does not appear to be a toast rack in a wet paper bag .      mort glanced sideways at the top of ysabell   s dress  which contained enough puppy fat for two litters of rottweilers  and forbore to comment .      my eyebrows don   t look like a pair of mating caterpillars     he hazarded .      true .  but my legs  i suggest  could at least stop a pig in a passageway        sorry    .         they   re not bandy    she explained .      ah .         enough .     she said .      just about .         good .  obviously we shouldn   t get married  if only for the sake of the children .         history unravels gently  like an old sweater .  it has been patched and darned many times  reknitted to suit different people  shoved in a box under the sink of censorship to be cut up for the dusters of propaganda  yet it always   eventually   manages to spring back into its old familiar shape .  history has a habit of changing the people who think they are changing it .  history always has a few tricks up its frayed sleeve .  it   s been around a long time .        would you like a strawberry .      mort glanced at the small wooden punnet in the wizard   s hands .      in mid winter .         actually they   re sprouts with a dash of enchantment .         they taste like strawberries .      cutwell sighed .     no  like sprouts .           i shall die nobly  like queen ezeriel      said keli .    mort   s forehead wrinkled .  history was a closed book to him .      who   s she .         she lived in klatch and she had a lot of lovers and she sat on a snake     said cutwell .      she meant to .  she was crossed in love .         all i can remember was that she used to take baths in asses    milk .  funny thing  history     said cutwell reflectively .     you become a queen  reign for thirty years  make laws  declare war on people and then the only thing you get remembered for is that you smelled like yoghurt and were bitten in the           the most famous inn on discworld used to be called the broken drum  broken drum  you can   t beat it .   .  renamed after a particularly bad fire .   the mended drum in filigree street  foremost of the city   s taverns .  it was famed not for its beer  which looked like maiden   s water and tasted like battery acid  but for its clientele .  it was said that if you sat long enough in the drum  then sooner or later every major hero on the disc would steal your horse .      ysabell was heavily into frills .  even the dressing table seemed to be wearing a petticoat .  the whole room wasn   t so much furnished as lingeried .      mort is reading from a very old book in the library of death          turnered hys hand  butt was sorelie vexed that alle menne at laste comme to nort  viz .  deathe  and vowed hymme to seke imortalitie yn his pride     it   s written in old     he said .     before they invented spelling .         death visits a job centre      it would seem that you have no useful skill or talent whatsoever     keeble said .     have you thought of going into teaching .      death   s face was a mask of terror .  well  it was always a mask of terror  but this time he meant it to be .     they opened the ledger .   they looked at it for a long time .   then mort said     what do all those symbols mean .         sodomy non sapiens     said albert under his breath .      what does that mean .         means i   m buggered if i know .        harga   s house of ribs down by the docks is probably not numbered among the city   s leading eateries  catering as it does for the type of beefy clientele that prefers quantity and breaks up the tables if it doesn   t get it .  they don   t go in for the fancy or exotic  but stick to conventional food like flightless bird embryos  minced organs in intestine skins  slices of hog flesh and burnt ground grass seeds dipped in animal fats  or  as it is known in their patois  egg  soss and bacon and a fried slice .         rincewind .     bawled albert .     take this thing away and dispose of it .      the toad crawled into rincewind   s hand and gave him an apologetic look .      that   s the last time that bloody landlord gives any lip to a wizard     said albert with smug satisfaction .     it seems i turn my back for a few hundred years and suddenly people in this town are encouraged to think they can talk back to wizards  eh .      as the bursar of this university i must say that we   ve always encouraged a good neighbour policy with respect to the community    mumbled a wizard  trying to avoid albert   s gimlet stare .      you spineless maggots .  i didn   t found this university so you could lend people the bloody lawnmower .         the rite of ashkente  quite simply  summons and binds death .  students of the occult will be aware that it can be performed with a simple incantation  three small bits of wood and  cc of mouse blood  but no wizard worth his pointy hat would dream of doing anything so unimpressive  they knew in their hearts that if a spell didn   t involve big yellow candles  lots of rare incense  circles drawn on the floor with eight different colours of chalk and a few cauldrons around the place then it simply wasn   t worth contemplating .      the wizards have escaped unscathed from an encounter with their long dead founder  whose statue had hitherto graced the campus .      i propose here and now we replace the statue  said the bursar  .  and to make sure no students deface it in any way i suggest we then erect it in the deepest cellar .      and then lock the door     he added .  several wizards began to cheer up .      and throw away the key .     said rincewind .      and weld the door     the bursar said .     and then brick up the doorway    there was a round of applause .      and throw away the bricklayer .     chortled rincewind  who felt he was getting the hang of this .   the bursar scowled at him .     no need to get carried away    he said .      the princess sprang to her feet and launched herself at her uncle  but cutwell grabbed her .      no     he said  quietly .     this isn   t the kind of man who ties you up in a cellar with just enough time for the mice to eat your ropes before the flood waters rise .  this is the kind of man who just kills you here and now .            it   s not that i mind being a duke     said mort .     it   s being married to a duchess that comes as a shock .        i wasn   t cut out to be a father  and certainly not a grandad .  i haven   t got the right kind of knees .   the disc   s greatest lovers were undoubtedly mellius and gretelina  whose pure  passionate and soul searing affair would have scorched the pages of history if they had not  because of some unexplained quirk of fate  been born two hundred years apart on different continents .      ankh morpork had dallied with many forms of government and had ended up with that form of democracy known as one man  one vote .  the patrician was the man  he had the vote .       there was an eighth son of an eighth son .  he was  naturally  a wizard .  and there it should have ended .  however  for reasons we   d better not go into   he had seven sons .  and then he had an eighth son     a wizard squared     a source of magic    a souircerer .   far below  the sea sucked on the shingle as noisily as an old man with one tooth who had been given a gob stopper .         children are our hope for the future .      there is no hope for the future  said death .      what does it contain  then .      me .      besides you i mean .      death gave him a puzzled look .  i   m sorry .         what is there in this world that makes living worth while .      death thought about it .   cats  he said eventually  cats are nice .      there was no analogy for the way in which great a    tuin the world turtle moved against the galactic night .  when you are ten thousand miles long  your shell pocked with meteor craters and frosted with comet ice  there is absolutely nothing you can realistically be like except yourself .   so great a   tuin swam slowly through the interstellar deeps like the largest turtle there has ever been  carrying on its carapace the four huge elephants that bore on their backs the vast  glittering waterfall fringed circle of the discworld  which exists either because of some impossible blip on the curve of probability or because the gods enjoy a joke as much as anyone .      spring had come to ankh morpork .  it wasn   t immediately apparent  but there were signs that were obvious to the cognoscenti .  for example  the scum on the river ankh  that great wide slow waterway that served the double city as reservoir  sewer and frequent morgue  had turned a particularly iridescent green .  the city   s drunken rooftops sprouted mattresses and bolsters as the winter bedding was put out to air in the weak sunshine  and in the depths of musty cellars the beams twisted and groaned when their dry sap responded to the ancient call of root and forest .  birds nested among the gutters and eaves of unseen university  although it was noticeable that however great the pressure on the nesting sites they never  ever  made nests in the invitingly open mouths of the gargoyles that lined the rooftops  much to the gargoyles    disappointment .      books of magic have a sort of life of their own .  some have altogether too much  for example  the first edition of the necrotelicomnicon has to be kept between iron plates  the true arte of levitatione has spent the last one hundred and fifty years up in the rafters  and ge fordge   s compenydyum of sex majick is kept in a vat of ice in a room all by itself and there   s a strict rule that it can only be read by wizards who are over eighty and  if possible  dead .      in most old libraries the books are chained to the shelves to prevent them being damaged by people .  in the library of unseen university  of course  it   s more or less the other way about .     the librarian ambled back down the aisles .  he had a face that only a lorry tyre could love .     there are eight levels of wizardry on the disc  after sixteen years rincewind has failed to achieve even level one .  in fact it is the considered opinion of some of his tutors that he is incapable even of achieving level zero  which most normal people are born at  to put it another way  it has been suggested that when rincewind dies the average occult ability of the human race will actually go up by a fraction .      on top of the wardrobe  wrapped in scraps of yellowing paper and old dust sheets  was a large brass bound chest .  it went by the name of the luggage .  why it consented to be owned by rincewind was something only the luggage knew  and it wasn   t telling  but probably no other item in the entire chronicle of travel accessories had quite such a history of mystery and grievous bodily harm .  it had been described as half suitcase  half homicidal maniac .  it had many unusual qualities     but currently there was only one that set it apart from any other brass bound chest .  it was snoring  with a sound like someone very slowly sawing a log .      the luggage might be magical .  it might be terrible .  but in its enigmatic soul it was kin to every other piece of luggage throughout the multiverse  and preferred to spend its winters hibernating on top of a wardrobe .      but it wasn   t the sight of the cockroaches that was so upsetting .  it was the fact that they were marching in step  a hundred abreast     there was something particularly unpleasant about the sound of billions of very small feet hitting the stones in perfect time .   rincewind stepped gingerly over the marching column     the luggage  of course  followed them with a noise like someone tap dancing over a bag of crisps .      there was a lot of beer about .  here and there red faced wizards were happily singing ancient drinking songs which involved a lot of knee slapping and cries of    ho .     the only possible excuse for this sort of thing is that wizards are celibate  and have to find their amusement where they can .      the higher levels of wizardry are a perilous place .  every wizard is trying to dislodge the wizards above him while stamping on the fingers of those below  to say that wizards are healthily competitive by nature is like saying that piranhas are naturally a little peckish .      one of rincewind   s tutors had said of him that    to call his understanding of magical theory abysmal is to leave no suitable word to describe his grasp of its practice    .      the reason that wizards didn   t rule the disc was quite simple .  hand any two wizards a piece of rope and they would instinctively pull in opposite directions .  something about their genetics or their training left them with an attitude towards mutual cooperation that made an old bull elephant with terminal toothache look like a worker ant .      the last thing rincewind saw before he was dragged away was the librarian .  despite looking like a hairy rubber sack full of water  the orang utan had the weight and reach of any man in the room and was currently sitting on a guard   s shoulders and trying  with reasonable success  to unscrew his head .         i said come on     she repeated .     what are you afraid of .      rincewind took a deep breath .     murderers  muggers  thieves  assassins  pickpockets  cutpurses  reevers  snigsmen  rapists and robbers     he said .     down these mean streets a man must walk  he thought .  and along some of them he will break into a run .     it might be thought that the mended drum was a seedy disreputable tavern .  in fact it was a reputable disreputable tavern .  its customers had a certain rough hewn respectability  they might murder each other in an easygoing way  as between equals  but they didn   t do it vindictively .  a child could go in for a glass of lemonade and be certain of getting nothing worse than a clip round the ear when his mother heard his expanded vocabulary .  on quiet nights  and when he was certain the librarian wasn   t going to come in  the landlord was even known to put bowls of peanuts on the bar .         is he a fair and just ruler .         i would say that he is unfair and unjust  but scrupulously even handed .  he is unfair and unjust to everyone  without fear or favour .         the current patrician  head of the extremely rich and powerful vetinari family  was thin  tall and apparently as cold blooded as a dead penguin .  just by looking at him you could tell he was the sort of man you   d expect to keep awhite cat  and caress it idly while sentencing people to death in a piranha tank  and you   d hazard for good measure that he probably collected rare thin porcelain  turning it over and over in his blue white fingers while distant screams echoed from the depths of the dungeons .  you wouldn   t put it past him to use the word    exquisite    and have thin lips .  he looked the kind of person who  when they blink  you mark it off on the calendar .   practically none of this was in fact the case  although he did have a small and exceedingly elderly wire haired terrier called wuffles that smelled badly and wheezed at people .  it was said to be the only thing in the entire world he truly cared about .  he did of course sometimes have people horribly tortured to death  but this was considered to be perfectly acceptable behaviour for a civic ruler and generally approved of by the overwhelming majority of citizens .  the people of ankh are of a practical persuasion  and felt that the patrician   s edict forbidding all street theatre and mime artists made up for a lot of things .  he didn   t administer a reign of terror  just the occasional light shower .         i can   t swim      said rincewind .       what  not a stroke .         about how deep is the sea here  would you say .  approximately .     he said .   about a dozen fathoms  i believe .         then i could probably swim about a dozen fathoms  whatever they are .         abrim laughed .  it wasn   t a nice sound .  it sounded as though he had had laughter explained to him  probably slowly and repeatedly  but had never heard anyone actually do it .         they   ll throw you into a seraglio .      conina shrugged .     could be worse .        but it   s got all these spikes and when they shut the door       hazarded rincewind .     that   s not a seraglio .   that   s an iron maiden .  don   t you know what a seraglio is .         um         she told him .  he went crimson .      it was said that everything in ankh morpork was for sale except for the beer and the women  both of which one merely hired .      of course  ankh morpork   s citizens had always claimed that the river water was incredibly pure in any case .  any water that had passed through so many kidneys  they reasoned  had to be very pure indeed .      the shape of dna  it is popularly said  owes its discovery to the chance sight of a spiral staircase when the scientist   s mind was just at the right receptive temperature .  had he used the lift  the whole science of genetics might have been a good deal different .         in the bathtub of history the truth is harder to hold than the soap  and much more difficult to find            death walks abroad     added nijel helpfully .      abroad i don   t mind     said rincewind .     they   re all foreigners .  it   s death walking around here i   m not looking forward to .            if we get a chance     whispered rincewind to nijel     we run  right .         where to .         from     said rincewind     the important word is from .         nijel was one of those people who  if you say    don   t look now     would immediately swivel his head like an owl on a turntable .  these are the same people who  when you point out  say  an unusual crocus just beside them  turn round aimlessly and put their foot down with a sad little squashy noise .  if they were lost in a trackless desert you could find them by putting down  somewhere on the sand  something small and fragile like a valuable old mug that had been in your family for generations  and then hurrying back as soon as you heard the crash .      rincewind tries to explain a wizard   s inbuilt desire to construct a tower      wizards always used to build a tower around themselves  like those     what do you call those things you find at the bottom of rivers .         frogs .         stones .         unsuccessful gangsters .         caddis flies is what i meant     said rincewind .      rincewind wasn   t very good at precognition  in fact he could barely see into the present .      there came a thunderous knock at the door .   there is a mantra to be said on these occasions .  it doesn   t matter if the door is a tent flap  a scrap of hide on a wind blown yurt  three inches of solid oak with great iron nails in or a rectangle of chipboard with mahogany veneer  a small light over it made of horrible bits of coloured glass and a bellpush that plays a choice of twenty popular melodies that no music lover would want to listen to even after five years    sensory deprivation .   one wizard turned to another and duly said     i wonder who that can be at this time of night .         the astro philosophers of krull once succeeded in proving conclusively that all places are one place and that the distance between them is an illusion  and this news was an embarrassment to all thinking philosophers because it did not explain  among other things  signposts .  after years of wrangling the whole thing was then turned over to ly tin wheedle  arguably the disc   s greatest philosopher  who after some thought proclaimed that although it was indeed true that all places were one place  that place was very large .      the four horsemen of the disc   s apocralypse have had three of their horses stolen while they were in an inn .   weight doesn   t come into it .  my steed has carried armies .  my steed has carried cities .  yea  he hath carried all things in their due time  said death .  but he   s not going to carry you three .      why not .      it   s a matter of the look of the thing .      it   s going to look pretty good  then  isn   t it     said war testily     the one horseman and three pedestrians of the apocralypse .            if we   re going to die anyway  i   d rather die like this .  heroically      said nijel .       is it heroic to die like this .     said conina .      i think it is     he said     and when it comes to dying  there   s only one opinion that matters .         although  possibly  quicker .  and only licensed to carry fourteen people .       witches are not by nature gregarious  and they certainly don   t have leaders .  granny weatherwax was the most highly regarded of the leaders they didn   t have .  but even she found that meddling in royal politics was a lot more difficult than certain playwrights would have you believe     granny weatherwax paused with a second scone halfway to her mouth .      something comes     she said .      can you tell by the pricking of your thumbs .     said magrat earnestly .  magrat had learned a lot about witchcraft from books .      the pricking of my ears     said granny .         i didn   t become a soldier for this .  not to go round killing people .            if i was you  i   d become a sailor     said granny thoughtfully .     yes  a nautical career .  i should start as soon as possible .  now  in fact .  run off  man .  run off to sea where there are no tracks .  you will have a long and successful life  i promise .     she looked thoughtful for a moment  and added     at least  longer than it   s likely to be if you hang around here .         lancre castle was built on an outcrop of rock by an architect who had heard about gormenghast but hadn   t got the budget .  he   d done his best  though  with a tiny confection of cut price turrets  bargain basements  buttresses  crenellations  gargoyles  towers  courtyards  keeps and dungeons  in fact  just about everything a castle needs except maybe reasonable foundations and the kind of mortar that doesn   t wash away in a light shower .         there is a knocking without     the porter said .      without what .     said the fool .      without the door  idiot .      the fool gave him a worried look .     a knocking without a door .     he said suspiciously .     this isn   t some kind of zen  is it .            how many times have you thrown a magic ring into the deepest depths of the ocean and then  when you get home and have a nice bit of turbot for your tea  there it is .      they considered this in silence .      never     said granny irritably .     and nor have you .         it was one of the few sorrows of granny weatherwax   s life that  despite all her efforts  she   d arrived at the peak of her career with a complexion like a rosy apple and all her teeth .  no amount of charms could persuade a wart to take root on her handsome if slightly equine features  and vast intakes of sugar only served to give her boundless energy .      granny explains her view on the proposition that replicas can be more convincing than the real thing      things that try to look like things often do look more like things than things .      the best you could say for magrat was that she was decently plain and well scrubbed and as flat chested as an ironing board with a couple of peas on it .      the duke has sent some guards to arrest a witch .  they come back empty handed .      admit it   she offered you hedonistic and licentious pleasures known only to those who dabble in the carnal arts  didn   t she .         no  sir .  she offered me a bun .         a bun .         yes  sir .  it had currants in it .      felmet sat absolutely still while he fought for internal peace .  finally  all he could manage was     and what did your men do about this .         they had a bun too  sir .  all except young roger  who isn   t allowed fruit  sir  on account of his trouble .  he had a biscuit  sir .            fool .         marry  sir       said the fool nervously .      i am already extremely married .  advise me  my fool .         i    faith  nuncle       said the fool .      nor am i thy nuncle .  i feel sure i would have remembered     said lord felmet  leaning down until the prow of his nose was a few inches from the fool   s stricken face .     if you preface your next remark with nuncle  i    faith or marry  it will go hard with you .         how do you feel about prithee .      the duke knew when to allow some slack .     prithee i can live with     he said .     so can you .         magrat tried .  every morning her hair was long  thick and blond  but by the evening it had always returned to its normal worried frizz .  to ameliorate the effect she had tried to plait violets and cowslips in it .  the result was not all she had hoped .  it gave the impression that a window box had fallen on her head .      the fool fumbled in his sleeve and produced a rather soiled red and yellow handkerchief embroidered with bells .  the duke took it with an expression of pathetic gratitude and blew his nose .  then he held it away from him and gazed at it with demented suspicion .      is this a dagger i see before me .     he mumbled .      um .  no  my lord .  it   s my handkerchief  you see .  you can sort of tell the difference if you look closely .  it doesn   t have as many sharp edges .         on the crest of the moor     was a standing stone      the stone was about the same height as a tall man  and made of a bluish tinted rock .  it was considered intensely magical because  although there was only one of it  no one had ever been able to count it .      granny  nanny and magrat have summoned a demon .      who   re you .     said granny  bluntly .      my name is unpronounceable in your tongue  woman     it said .      i   ll be the judge of that     warned granny .      very well .  my name is wxrthltl jwlpklz     said the demon smugly .        we haven   t got time to bandy legs with you all night     said granny .     magrat blurted out     you know the fool  who lives up at the castle .             it   s a steady job     said nanny .     i   ll grant you that .         huh     said granny .     a man who tinkles all day .  no kind of husband for anyone  i   d say        nanny ogg was also out early .  she hadn   t been able to get any sleep anyway  and besides  she was worried about greebo .  greebo was one of her few blind spots .  while intellectually she would concede that he was indeed a fat  cunning  evil smelling multiple rapist  she nevertheless instinctively pictured him as the small fluffy kitten he had been decades before .  the fact that he had once chased a female wolf up a tree and seriously surprised a she bear who had been innocently digging for roots didn   t stop her worrying that something bad might happen to him .  it was generally considered by everyone else in the kingdom that the only thing that might slow greebo down was a direct meteorite strike .      the books said that the old time witches had sometimes danced in their shifts .  magrat had wondered about how you danced in shifts .  perhaps there wasn   t room for them all to dance at once  she   d thought .      nanny ogg is being held captive in a torture chamber .   the duchess leaned forward until her big red face was inches away from nanny   s nose .      this insouciance gives you pleasure     she hissed     but soon you will laugh on the other side of your face .         it   s only got this side     said nanny .   the duchess fingered a tray of implements lovingly .     we shall see     she said  picking up a pair of pliers .         it   s gone too far this time     said a peasant .     all this burning and taxing and now this .  i blame you witches .  it   s got to stop .  i know my rights .         what rights are they .     said granny .      dunnage  cowhage in ordinary  badinage  leftovers  scrommidge  clary and spunt     said the peasant promptly .     and acornage  every other year  and the right to keep two thirds of a goat on the common .  until he set fire to it .  it was a bloody good goat  too .         hour gongs were being struck all across the city and nightwatchmen were proclaiming that it was indeed midnight and also that  in the face of all the evidence  all was well .  many of them got as far as the end of the sentence before being mugged .      the river ankh  the cloaca of half a continent  was already pretty wide and silt laden when it reached the city   s outskirts .  by the time it left it didn   t so much flow as exude .  owing to the accretion of the mud of centuries the bed of the river was in fact higher than some of the low lying areas and now  with the snow melt swelling the flow  many of the low rent districts on the morpork side were flooded  if you can use that word for a liquid you could pick up in a net .         you know  hwel  i reckon responsible behaviour is something to get when you grow older .  like varicose veins .         vitoller shifted uneasily .     i already owe chrystophrase the troll more than i should .         he   s the one that has people   s limbs torn off .     said tomjon .      how much do you owe him .     said hwel .      an arm and a leg .         the dwarf playwright hwel is leaving actor manager vitoller   s company .      i   ll miss you  laddie .  i don   t mind telling you .  you   ve been like a son to me .  how old are you  exactly .  i never did know .         a hundred and two .      you   ve been like a father to me  then     vitoller said .         when   s this play going to be  then .     magrat said  moving closer .      marry  i   m sure i   m not allowed to tell you     said the fool .     the duke said to me  he said  don   t tell the witches that it   s tomorrow night .         i shouldn   t  then     agreed magrat .      at eight o   clock .         i see .         but meet for sherry beforehand at seven thirty  i   faith .         nanny     leaned towards the empty seat .     walnut .         no  thank you     said king verence  a ghost   waving a spectral hand .     they go right through me  you know .          being trained by the assassins    guild in ankfe morpork did not fit teppic for the task assigned to him by fate .  he inherited the throne of the desert kingdom of djelibeybi rather earlier than he expected  his father wasn   t too happy about it either   but that was only the beginning of his problems     all assassins had a full length mirror in their rooms  because it would be a terrible insult to anyone to kill them when you were badly dressed .      he     had also heard that only one student in fifteen actually became an assassin .  he wasn   t entirely certain what happened to the other fourteen  but he was pretty sure that if you were a poor student in a school for assassins they did a bit more than throw the chalk at you  and that the school dinners had an extra dimension of uncertainty .      djelibeybi really was a small  self centred kingdom .  even its plagues were half hearted .  all self respecting river kingdoms have vast supernatural plagues  but the best the old kingdom had been able to achieve in the last hundred years was the plague of frog .         it was said that life was cheap in ankh morpork .  this was  of course  completely wrong .  life was often very expensive  you could get death for free .         what   s your name  kiddo .      teppic drew himself up .     kiddo .  i   ll have you know the blood of pharaohs runs in my veins .      the other boy looked at him unabashed  with his head on one side and a faint smile on his face .      would you like it to stay there .     he said .      my mother  died when i was young     she went for a moonlight swim in what turned out to be a crocodile .         ptraci  his favourite handmaiden .  she was special .  her singing always cheered him up .  life seemed so much brighter when she stopped .      the ankh     drained the huge silty plains all the way to the ramtop mountains  and by the time it had passed through ankh morpork  pop .  one million  it could only be called a liquid because it moved faster than the land around it  being sick in it would probably make it  on average  marginally cleaner .      one of the two legends about the founding of ankh morpork relates that the two orphaned brothers who built the city were in fact found and suckled by a hippopotamus .   the other legend  not normally recounted by the citizens  is that at an even earlier time a group of wise men survived a flood sent by the gods by building a huge boat  and on this boat they took two of every type of animal then existing on the disc .  after some weeks the combined manure was beginning to weigh the boat low in the water so     the story runs     they tipped it over the side  and called it ankh morpork .         cats are sacred     said dios .      long legged cats with silver fur and disdainful expressions are  maybe     said teppic .     i   m sure sacred cats don   t leave dead ibises under the bed .  and i   m certain that sacred cats that live surrounded by endless sand don   t come indoors and do it in the king   s sandals  dios .         descendants .  the gods had seen fit to give him one son who charged you for the amount of breath expended in saying    good morning     and another one who worshipped geometry and stayed up all night designing aqueducts .  you scrimped and saved to send them to the best schools  and then they went and paid you back by getting educated .         why are you here .      the man hung his head .  t spoke blasphemy against the king .         how did you do that .         i dropped a rock on my foot .  now my tongue is to be torn out .      the dark figure nodded sympathetically .   a priest heard you  did he .     he said .      no .  i told a priest .  such words should not go unpunished     said the man virtuously .     the old king told me once that the gods gave people a sense of humour to make up for giving them sex .     it   s a fact as immutable as the third law of sod that there is no such thing as a good grand vizier .  a predilection to cackle and plot is apparently part of the job spec .         would your sire still be honouring us with the capping out ceremony .  there   s drinks     ptaclusp stuttered .     and a silver trowel that you can take away with you .  everyone shouts hurrah and throws their hats in the air .         certainly    said dios .     it will be an honour .         and for us too  your sire     said ptaclusp loyally .      i meant for you     said the high priest .      pyramids are dams in the stream of time .  correctly shaped and orientated  with the proper paracosmic measurements correctly plumbed in  the temporal potential of the great mass of stone can be diverted to accelerate or reverse time over a very small area  in the same way that a hydraulic ram can be induced to pump water against the flow .   the original builders  who were of course ancients and therefore wise  knew this very well and the whole point of a correctly built pyramid was to achieve absolute null time in the central chamber so that a dying king  tucked up there  would indeed live forever   or at least  never actually die .  the time that should have passed in the chamber was stored in the bulk of the pyramid and allowed to flare off once every twenty four hours .   after a few aeons people forgot this and thought you could achieve the same effect by a  ritual b  pickling people and c  storing their soft inner bits in jars .   this seldom works .     he     liked my singing .  everyone else said it sounded like a flock of vultures who   ve just found a dead donkey .     he knew about tortoises .  they could be called a lot of things   vegetarians  patient  thoughtful  even extremely diligent and persistent sex maniacs  but never  up until now  fast .  fast was a word particularly associated with tortoises because they were not it .      the fastest insect is the  .     bookworm .  it evolved in magical libraries  where it is necessary to eat extremely quickly to avoid being affected by the thaumic radiations .  an adult  .     bookworm can eat through a shelf of books so fast that it ricochets off the wall .      kings who hadn   t got a kingdom any more were not likely to be very popular in neighbouring countries .  there had been one or two like that in ankh morpork   deposed royalty  who had fled their suddenly dangerous kingdoms     carrying nothing but the clothes they stood up in and a few wagonloads of jewels .  the city  of course  welcomed anyone  regardless of race  colour  class or creed   who had spending money in incredible amounts  but nevertheless the inhumation of surplus monarchs was a regular source of work for the assassins    guild .  there was always someone back home who wanted to be certain that deposed monarchs stayed that way .  it was usually a case of heir today  gone tomorrow .     the ephebians made wine out of anything they could put in a bucket  and ate anything that couldn   t climb out of one .   he pushed the food around on his plate .  some of it pushed back .        the diameter divides into the circumference  you know .  it ought to be three times .  but does it .  no .  three point one four one and lots of other figures .  there   s no end to the buggers     it tells me that the creator used the wrong kind of circles .         someone was just putting a torch to the lighthouse  which was one of the more than seven wonders of the world and had been built to a design by pthagonal using the golden rule and the five aesthetic principles .  unfortunately it had then been built in the wrong place because putting it in the right place would have spoiled the look of the harbour  but it was generally agreed by mariners to be a very beautiful lighthouse and something to look at while they were waiting to be towed off the rocks .      ptraci didn   t just derail the train of thought  she ripped up the rails  burned the stations and melted the bridges for scrap .      it was another nice day in the high desert .  it was always a nice day  if by nice you meant an air temperature like an oven and sand you could roast chestnuts on .      it is now known to science that there are many more dimensions than the classical four .  scientists say that these don   t normally impinge on the world because the extra dimensions are very small and curve in on themselves  and that since reality is fractal most of it is tucked inside itself .  this means either that the universe is more full of wonders than we can hope to understand or  more probably  that scientists make things up as they go along .      teppic takes a novel approach to the age old riddle of the sphinx      what goes on four legs in the morning  two legs at noon  and three legs in the evening .     said the sphinx smugly .   teppic considered this .      that   s a tough one     he said  eventually .      you   ll never get it .         you   re right .     teppic stared at the claws .      the answer is     a man        said the sphinx .      what do you mean  a man .         it   s easy    said the sphinx .     a baby crawls in the morning  stands on both legs at noon  and at evening an old man walks with a stick .  good  isn   t it .      teppic bit his lip .     we   re talking about one day here .     he said doubt fully .   there was a long  embarrassing silence .      it   s a wossname  a figure of speech     said the sphinx irritably .     nothing wrong with the riddle .  damn good riddle .  had that riddle for fifty years  sphinx and cub .     it thought about this .     chick     it corrected .      it   s a good riddle     teppic said soothingly .     but is there internal consistency within the metaphor .  let   s say for example that the average life expectancy is seventy years  okay .         okay    said the sphinx  in the uncertain tones of someone who has let the salesman in and is now regretfully contemplating a future in which they are undoubtedly going to buy life insurance .      right .  good .  so noon would be age     am i right .  now considering that most children can toddle at a year or so  the four legs reference is really unsuitable  wouldn   t you agree .  i mean  most of the morning is spent on two legs .  according to your analogy     only about twenty minutes immediately after    .    hours  half an hour tops  is spent on four legs .  am i right .  be fair .         well       said the sphinx .      by the same token you wouldn   t be using a stick by six p . m .  because you   d be only  er         said teppic  scribbling furiously .     in fact you wouldn   t really be looking at any kind of walking aid until at least half past nine  i think     i   m sorry  it   s basically okay  but it doesn   t work     you just need to alter it a bit  that   s all .         okay    it said doubtfully .     i suppose i could ask  what is it that walks on four legs           metaphorically speaking     said teppic .      four legs  metaphorically speaking     the sphinx agreed     for about           twenty minutes  i think we agreed .            okay  fine  twenty minutes in the morning  on two legs           but i think calling it    in the morning    is stretching it a bit     said teppic .     it   s just after midnight .  i mean  technically it   s the morning  but in a very real sense it   s still last night  .   .  .  let   s just see where we   ve got to  shall we .  what  metaphorically speaking  walks on four legs just after midnight  on two legs for most of the day              barring accidents     said the sphinx  pathetically eager to show that it was making a contribution .      fine  on two legs barring accidents  until at least suppertime  when it walks with three legs           i   ve known people use two walking sticks     said the sphinx helpfully .      okay how about  when it continues to walk on two legs or with any prosthetic aids of its choice .      the sphinx gave this some consideration .      ye ess     it said gravely .     that seems to fit all eventualities .         the city of the dead lay before teppic .  after ankh morpork  which was almost its direct opposite  in ankh  even the bedding was alive  it was probably the biggest city on the disc .       it was quite a big frog  however  and got into the air ducts and kept everyone awake for weeks .       this is where the dragons went .  they lie     not dead  not asleep  but    dormant .  and although the space they occupy isn   t like normal space  nevertheless they are packed in tightly .  they could put you in mind of a can of sardines  if you thought sardines were huge and scaly .  and presumably  somewhere  there   s a key     the library was the greatest assemblage of magical texts anywhere in the multiverse .  thousands of volumes of occult lore weighted its shelves .   it was said that  since vast amounts of magic can seriously distort the mundane world  the library did not obey the normal rules of space and time .  it was said that it went on forever .  it was said that you could wander for days among the distant shelves  and that there were lost tribes of research students somewhere in there .   wise students in search of more distant volumes took care to leave chalk marks on the shelves as they roamed deeper into the fusty darkness  and told friends to come looking for them if they weren   t back by supper .      not many people these days remarked upon the fact that the librarian was an ape .  the change had been brought about by a magical accident  always a possibility where so many powerful books are kept together  and he was considered to have got off lightly .  after all  he was still basically the same shape .  and he had been allowed to keep his job  which he was rather good at  although    allowed    is not really the right word .  it was the way he could roll his upper lip back to reveal more incredibly yellow teeth than any other mouth the university council had ever seen before that somehow made sure the matter was never really raised .      the figure rapped a complex code on the dark woodwork .  a tiny barred hatch opened and one suspicious eye peered out .          the significant owl hoots in the night        said the visitor  trying to wring the rainwater out of its robe .          yet many grey lords go sadly to the masterless men        intoned a voice on the other side of the grille .          hooray  hooray for the spinster   s sister   s daughter        countered the dripping figure .          to the axeman  all supplicants are the same height .                 yet verily  the rose is within the thorn .                the good mother makes bean soup for the errant boy        said the voice behind the door .   there was a pause  broken only by the sound of the rain .  then the visitor said     what .             the good mother makes bean soup for the errant boy .          there was another  longer pause .  then the damp figure said     are you sure the ill built tower doesn   t tremble mightily at a butterfly   s passage .         nope .  bean soup it is .  i   m sorry .         what about the cag  d whale .     said the soaking visitor  trying to squeeze into what little shelter the dread portal offered .      what about it .         it should know nothing of the mighty deeps  if you must know .         oh  the caged whale .  you want the elucidated brethren of the ebon night .  three doors down .         the supreme grand master rapped his gavel for attention .     i call the unique and supreme lodge of the elucidated brethren to order     he intoned .     is the door of knowledge sealed fast against heretics and knowlessmen .         stuck solid     said brother doorkeeper .     it   s the damp .  i   ll bring my plane in next week  soon have it           all right  all right     said the supreme grand master testily .     just a yes would have done .         minor thief zebbo mooty has just been incinerated by a dragon .      do you know  a fortune teller once told me i   d die in my bed  surrounded by grieving great grandchildren     said mooty .     what do you think of that  eh .      i think she was wrong .      the patrician nodded .      i shall deal with the matter momentarily     he said .  it was a good word .  it always made people hesitate .  they were never quite sure whether he meant he   d deal with it now  or just deal with it briefly .  and no one ever dared ask .      you came to  the patrician  with a perfectly reasonable complaint .  next thing you knew  you were shuffling out backwards  bowing and scraping  relieved simply to be getting away .  you had to hand it to the patrician  he admitted grudgingly .  if you didn   t  he sent men to come and take it away .     the patrician gave him a sweet smile .     thank you for coming to see me . don   t hesitate th  leave .        the watch hadn   t liked it  but the plain fact was that the thieves were far better at controlling crime than the watch had ever been .  after all  the watch had to work twice as hard to cut crime just a little  whereas all the thieves    guild had to do was to work less .      the only reason you couldn   t say that nobby was close to the animal kingdom was that the animal kingdom would get up and walk away .      nobby was a small  bandy legged man  with a certain resemblance to a chimpanzee who never got invited to tea parties .      sergeant colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that mrs colon worked all day and sergeant colon worked all night .  they communicated by means of notes .  he got her tea ready before he left at night  she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings .  they had three grown up children  all born  vimes had assumed  as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting .      you could describe sergeant colon like this  he was the sort of man who  if he took up a military career  would automatically gravitate to the post of sergeant .  you couldn   t imagine him ever being a corporal .  or  for that matter  a captain .  if he didn   t take up a military career  then he looked cut out for something like  perhaps  a sausage butcher  some job where a big red face and a tendency to sweat even in frosty weather were practically part of the specification .      every town in the multiverse has a part that is something like ankh morpork   s shades .  it   s a sort of black hole of bred in the brickwork lawlessness .  put it like this  even the criminals were afraid to walk the streets .      you need a special kind of mind to rule a city like ankh morpork  and lord vetinari had it .  but then  he was a special kind of person .   you had to get up very early in the morning to get the better of the patrician  in fact  it was wiser not to go to bed at all .   but he was popular  in a way .  under his hand  for the first time in a thousand years  ankh morpork operated .  it might not be fair or just or particularly democratic  but it worked .  it was said that he would tolerate absolutely anything apart from anything that threatened the city           ankh morpork .   brawling city of a hundred thousand souls .  and  as the patrician privately observed  ten times that number of actual people .     from a high point of vantage  ankh morpork looked as though someone had tried to achieve in stone and wood an effect normally associated with the pavements outside all night takeaways .      the librarian rolled his eyes .  it was strange  he felt  that so called intelligent dogs  horses and dolphins never had any difficulty indicating to humans the vital news of the moment  e . g .   that the three children were lost in the cave  or the train was about to take the line leading to the bridge that had been washed away or similar  while he  only a handful of chromosomes away from wearing a vest  found it difficult to persuade the average human to come in out of the rain .         a book has been taken .  a book has been taken .  you summoned the watch     carrot drew himself up proudly     because someone   s taken a book .  you think that   s worse than murder .      the librarian gave him the kind of look other people would reserve for people who said things like    what   s so bad about genocide .         jimkin bearhugger   s old selected dragon   s blood whiskey .  cheap and powerful  you could light fires with it  you could clean spoons .  you didn   t have to drink much of it to be drunk  which was just as well .      it was the usual ankh morpork mob in times of crisis  half of them were here to complain  a quarter of them were here to watch the other half  and the remainder were here to rob  importune or sell hot dogs to the rest .      vimes looked into the grinning  cadaverous face of cut me own throat dibbler  purveyor of absolutely anything that could be sold hurriedly from an open suitcase in a busy street and was guaranteed to have fallen off the back of an oxcart .      anti dragon cream .  personal guarantee  if you   re incinerated you get your money back  no quibble .         what you   re saying     said vimes slowly     if i understand the wording correctly  is that if i am baked alive by the dragon you   ll return the money .         upon personal application     said cut me own throat .      vimes   d had a look at cut me own throat dibbler   s dragon detectors  which consisted solely of a piece of wood on a metal stick .  when the stick was burned through  you   d found your dragon .  like a lot of cut me own throat   s devices  it was completely efficient in its own special way while at the same time being totally useless .      ankh morpork did not have many hospitals .  all the guilds maintained their own sanitariums  but by and large medical assistance was nonexistent and people had to die inefficiently  without the aid of doctors .  it was generally thought that the existence of cures encouraged slackness and was in any case probably against nature   s way .     it was a plate stacked high with bacon  fried potatoes and eggs .  vimes could hear his arteries panic just bh  looking at it .     captain vimes limped forward from the shadows .   a small and extremely frightened golden dragon was clamped firmly under one arm .  his other hand held it by the tail .   the rioters watched it  hypnotized .      now i know what you   re thinking     vimes went on  softly .     you   re wondering  after all this excitement  has it got enough flame left .  and  y   know  i ain   t so sure myself        he leaned forward  sighting between the dragon   s ears  and his voice buzzed like a knife blade      what you   ve got to ask yourself is  am i feeling lucky .         vimes gave his men his usual look of resigned dismay .      my squad     he mumbled .      fine body of men     said lady ramkin .     the good old rank and file  eh .         the rank  anyway    said vimes .      it is difficult for an orang utan to stand to attention .  its body can master the general idea  but its skin can   t .  the librarian was doing his best  however  standing in a sort of respectful heap at the end of the line and maintaining the kind of complex salute you can only achieve with a four foot arm .         do you think picking someone up by their ankles and bouncing their head on the floor comes under the heading of striking a superior officer .     said carrot .         ah  pageantry    said the monarchist  pointing with his pipe .     very important .  lots of spectacles .         what  free .     said throat .      we ell  i think maybe you have to pay for the frames     said the monarchist .      books bend space and time .  one reason the owners of those aforesaid little rambling  poky second hand bookshops always seem slightly unearthly is that many of them really are  having strayed into this world after taking a wrong turning in their own bookshops in worlds where it is considered commendable business practice to wear carpet slippers all the time and open your shop only when you feel like it .  you stray into l space at your peril .      the truth is that even big collections of ordinary books distort space  as can readily be proved by anyone who has been around a really old fashioned second hand bookshop  one of those that look as though they were designed by m .  escher on a bad day and have more staircases than storeys and those rows of shelves which end in little doors that are surely too small for a full sized human to enter .  the relevant equation is  knowledge   power   energy   matter   mass  a good bookshop is just a genteel black hole that knows how to read .      people were stupid  sometimes .  they thought the library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books  which was true enough  but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library .   energy equals matter      matter equals mass .   and mass distorts space .  it distorts it into polyfractal l space .   so  while the dewey system has its fine points  when you   re setting out to look something up in the multidimensional folds of l space what you really need is a ball of string .      the three rules of the librarians of time and space are     silence     books must be returned no later than the last date shown  and    do not interfere with the nature of causality .      the summoning of dragons .  single copy  first edition  slightly foxed and extremely dragoned .      vimes strolled along for breakfast at harga   s house of ribs .  normally the only decoration in there was on sham harga   s vest and the food was good solid stuff for a cold morning  all calories and fat and protein and maybe a vitamin crying softly because it was all alone .      time could bifurcate  like a pair of trousers .  you could end up in the wrong leg  living a life that was actually happening in the other leg  talking to people who weren   t in your leg  walking into walls that weren   t there any more .  life could be horrible in the wrong trouser of time .         never build a dungeon you wouldn   t be happy to spend the night in yourself     said the patrician .      vimes landed in damp straw and also in pitch darkness .     never trust any ruler who puts his faith in tunnels and bunkers and escape routes .  the chances are that his hearh  isn   t in the job .     eventually great a    tuin would reach the end of the universe .  eventually the stars would go out .  eventually nobby might have a bath  although that would probably involve a radical rethinking of the nature of time .         oh  you think you   re so clever  so in control  so swave  just because i   ve got a sword and you haven   t .         the patrician steepled his hands and looked at vimes over the top of them .      let me give you some advice  captain     he said .     it may help you make some sense of the world .  i believe you find life such a problem because you think there are the good people and the bad people .  you   re wrong  of course .  there are  always and only  the bad people  but some of them are on opposite sides     he waved his thin hand towards the city and walked over to the window .      a great rolling sea of evil .  shallower in some places  of course  but deeper  oh  so much deeper in others .  but people like you put together little rafts of rules and vaguely good intentions and say  this is the opposite  this will triumph in the end .  amazing .  down there     he said     are people who will follow any dragon  worship any god  ignore any iniquity .  all out of a kind of humdrum  everyday badness .  not the really high  creative loathsomeness of the great sinners  but a sort of mass produced darkness of the soul .  sin  you might say  without a trace of originality .  they accept evil not because they say yes  but because they don   t say no .  i   m sorry if this offends you     he added  patting the captain   s shoulder     but you fellows really need us .  we   re the only ones who know how to make things work .  you see  the only thing the good people are good at is overthrowing the bad people .  and you   re good at that  i   ll grant you .  but the trouble is that it   s the only thing you   re good at .  one day it   s the ringing of the bells and the casting down of the evil tyrant  and the next it   s everyone sitting around complaining that ever since the tyrant was overthrown no one   s been taking out the trash .  because the bad people know how to plan .  it   s part of the specification  you might say .  every evil tyrant has a plan to rule the world .  the good people don   t seem to have the knack .          and mime artists .  it was a strange aversion  but there you are .  anyone in baggy trousers and a white face who tried to ply their art anywhere within ankh   s crumbling walls would very quickly find themselves in a scorpion pit  on one wall of which was painted the advice  learn the words .       eric discworld   s only demonology backer .  pity he   s not very good at it .  all he wants is his three wishes granted .  nothing fancy     to be immortal  rule the world  have the most beautiful woman in the world fall madly in love with him  the usual stuff .   but instead of a tractable demon  he calls tip rincewind  probably the most incompetent wizard in the universe  and the extremely in tractable and hostile form of travel accessory known as the luggage .   with them on his side  eric   s in for a ride through space and time that is bound to make him wish  quite fervently  again     this time that he   d never been born .     like all beekeepers  death wore a veil .     it wasn   t that he had anything to sting  but sometimes a bee would get inside his skull and buzz around and give him a headache .   no enemies had ever taken ankh morpork .  well  technically they had  quite often  the city welcomed free spending barbarian invaders  but somehow the puzzled raiders always found  after a few days  that they didn   t own their own horses any more  and within a couple of months they were just another minority group with its own graffiti and food shops .         all right .  i give in .  we will try the rite of ashkente .      the rite of ashkente is the most serious ritual eight wizards can undertake .  it summons death      it took place in the mid night in the university   s great hall  in a welter of incense  candlesticks  runic inscriptions and magic circles  none of which was strictly necessary but which made the wizards feel better .  magic flared  the chants were chanted  the invocations were truly invoked .   the wizards stared into the magic octogram  which remained empty .  after a while the circle of robed figures began to mutter amongst themselves .      we must have done something wrong .         oook .         maybe he is out .         or busy            do you think we could give up and go back to bed .      who are we waiting for  exactly .      rincewind wanted to say  look  what you should do is stop all this messing around with chemicals in dark rooms and have a shave  a haircut  a bath  make that two baths  buy yourself a new wardrobe and get out of an evening and then   but he   d have to be honest  because even washed  shaved and soaked in body splash thursley wasn   t going to win any prizes   and then you could have your face slapped by any woman of your choice .   i mean  it wouldn   t be much  but it would be body contact .      if there is one thing a wizard would trade his grandmother for  it is power .  but  .  .   .  any wizard bright enough to survive for five minutes was also bright enough to realize that if there was any power in demonology then it lay with the demons .  using it for your own purposes would be like trying to beat mice to death with a rattlesnake .      lord astfgl   s patience  which in any case had the tensile strength of putty  snapped at this point .      rincewind tried some .  it was a bowl of cereal  nuts  and dried fruit .  he didn   t have any quarrel with any of that .  it was just that somewhere in the preparation something had apparently done to these innocent ingredients what it takes a million gravities to do to a neutron star .  if you died of eating this sort of thing they wouldn   t have to bury you  they would just need to drop you somewhere where the ground was soft .      pre eminent amongst rincewind   s talents was his skill in running away  which over the years he had elevated to the status of a genuinely pure science  it didn   t matter if you were fleeing from or to  so long as you were fleeing .  it was flight alone that counted .  i run  therefore i am  more correctly  i run  therefore with any luck i   ll still be .   but he was also skilled in languages and in practical geography .  he could shout    help .     in fourteen languages and scream for mercy in a further twelve .      the tezuman empire in the jungle valleys of central klatch is known for its organic market gardens  its exquisite craftsmanship in obsidian  feathers and jade  and its mass human sacrifices in honour of quezovercoatl  the feathered boa  god of mass human sacrifices .  as they said  you always knew where you stood with quezovercoatl .  it was generally with a lot of people on top of a great stepped pyramid with someone in an elegant feathered headdress chipping an exquisite obsidian knife for your very own personal use .        why do you keep saying wossname .     said rincewind .      limited wossname .  doodah .  thingy .  you know .  it   s got words in it     said the parrot .      dictionary .     said rincewind .        it   s their god quezovercoatl .  half man  half chicken  half jaguar  half serpent  half scorpion and half mad .         rincewind and companions have been tied up and left .      in fact     said da quirm     i think       he rolled from side to side experimentally  tugging at the vines which were holding him down .     yes  i think when they did these ropes up     yes  definitely  they           what .  what .     said rincewind .      yes  definitely    said da quirm .     i   m absolutely sure about it .  they did them up very tightly and professionally .  not an inch of give in them anywhere .         they were discussing strategy when rincewind arrived .  the consensus seemed to be that if really large numbers of men were sent to storm the mountain  then enough might survive the rocks to take the citadel .  this is essentially the basis of all military thinking .         it   s probably some kind of magic  or something     rincewind said .     there   s no air .  that   s why there   s no sound .  all the little bits of air sort of knock together  like marbles .  that   s how you get sound  you know .         is it .  gosh .         so we   re surrounded by absolutely nothing     said rincewind .     total nothing .     he hesitated .     there   s a word for it     he said .     it   s what you get when there   s nothing left and everything   s been used up .         yes .  i think it   s called the bill     said eric .      hell  it has been suggested  is other people .   this has always come as a bit of a surprise to many working demons  who had always thought hell was sticking sharp things into people and pushing them into lakes of blood and so on .   this is because demons  like most people  have failed to distinguish between the body and the soul .   the fact was that  as droves of demon kings had noticed  there was a limit to what you could do to a soul with  e . g .   red hot tweezers  because even fairly evil and corrupt souls were bright enough to realize that since they didn   t have the concomitant body and nerve endings attached to them there was no real reason  other than force of habit  why they should suffer excruciating agony .  so they didn   t .  demons went on doing it anyway  because numb and mindless stupidity is part of what being a demon is all about  but since no one was suffering they didn   t enjoy it much either and the whole thing was pointless .  centuries and centuries of pointlessness .      astfgl had achieved in hell a particularly high brand of boredom which is like the boredom you get which a  is costing you money  and b  is taking place while you should be having a nice time .      the speaker was duke vassenego  one of the oldest demons .  how old  no one knew .  but if he didn   t actually invent original sin  at least he made one of the first copies .      rincewind looked down at the broad steps they were climbing .  they were something of a novelty  each one was built out of large stone letters .  the one he was just stepping on to  for example  read  i meant it for the best .   the next one was  i thought you   d like it .   eric was standing on  for the sake of the children .      weird  isn   t it .     he said .     why do it like this .         i think they   re meant to be good intentions     said rincewind .  this was a road to hell  and demons were  after all  traditionalists .     old tom was the single cracked bronze bell in the university bell tower .   the clapper dropped out shortly after it was cast  but the bell still tolled out some tremendously sonorous silences every hour .       the alchemists of the discworld have discovered the magic of the silver screen .  but wheat is the dark secret of holy wood kill .   it   s tip to victor tugelbend     can   t sing .  can   t dance .  can handle a sword a little     and theda withel     i come from a little town you   ve probably never heard of  to find out     this is space .  it   s sometimes called the final frontier .    except that of course you can   t have   final frontier  because there   d be nothing for it to be a frontier to  but as frontiers go  it   s pretty penultimate          the discworld is as unreal as it is possible to be while still being just real enough to exist .      there   s a saying that there   s a saying that all roads lead to ankh morpork .   and it   s wrong .  all roads lead away from ankh morpork  but sometimes people just walk along them the wrong way .     meat pies .  hot sausages .  inna bun .  so freshthe pig hasn   t noticed they   re gone .     unseen university had had many different kinds of archchancellor over the years .  big ones  small ones  cunning ones  slightly insane ones  extremely insane ones   they   d come  they   d served  in some cases not long enough for anyone to be able to complete the official painting to be hung in the great hall  and they   d died .  the senior wizard in a world of magic had the same prospects of long term employment as a pogo stick tester in a minefield .      the name might change occasionally  but what did matter was that there always was an archchancellor      at the time  it had seemed a really good idea to elect an archchancellor who hadn   t set foot in the university in forty years .  a search of the records turned up ridcully the brown .  he looked ideal      a messenger had been sent .  ridcully the brown had sighed  cursed a bit  found his staff in the kitchen garden where it had been supporting a scarecrow  and had set out .   within twelve hours of arriving  ridcully had installed a pack of hunting dragons in the butlers    pantry  fired his dreadful crossbow at the ravens on the ancient tower of art  drunk a dozen bottles of red wine  and rolled off to bed at two in the morning singing a song with words in it that some of the older and more forgetful wizards had to look up .   and then he got up at five o   clock to go duck hunting down in the marshes on the estuary .   and came back complaining that there wasn   t a good trout fishin    river for miles .   you couldn   t fish in the river ankh  you had to jump up and down on the hooks even to make them sink .    and he ordered beer with his breakfast .   and told jokes .   on the other hand  at least he didn   t interfere with the actual running of the university .  ridcully the brown wasn   t the least interested in running anything except maybe a string of hounds .  if you couldn   t shoot arrows at it  hunt it or hook it  he couldn   t see much point in it .      a full moon glided above the smoke and fumes of ankh morpork  thankful that several thousand miles of sky lay between it and them .     the alchemists    guildhall was new .  it was always new .   it had been explosively demolished and rebuilt four times in the last two years  on the last occasion without a lecture and demonstration room in the hope that this might be a helpful move .     by and large  the only skill the alchemists of ankh morpork had discovered so far was the ability to turn gold into less gold .      the patrician   s stare had him pinned .  it was a good stare  and one of the things it was good at was making people go on talking when they thought they had finished .         well  what you do is  you take some corn  and you put it in  say  a number   crucible  with some cooking oil  you see  and then you put a plate or something on top of it  and when you heat it up it goes bang  i mean  not seriously bang  and when it   s stopped banging you take the plate off and it   s metamorphosed into these  er  things     if you put butter and salt on it  it tastes like salty butter     i just call it banged grains .         when you became a wizard you were expected to stop shaving and grow a beard like a gorse bush .  very senior wizards looked capable of straining nourishment out of the air via their moustaches  like whales .      victor eyed the glistening tubes in the tray around dibbler   s neck .  they smelled appetizing .  they always did .  and then you bit into them  and learned once again that cut me own throat dibbler could find a use for bits of an animal that the animal didn   t know it had got .  dibbler had worked out that with enough fried onions and mustard people would eat anything .      most people think in curves and zigzags .  for example  they start from a thought like  i wonder how i can become very rich  and then proceed along an uncertain course which includes thoughts like  i wonder what   s for supper  and  i wonder who i know who can lend me five dollars .   whereas throat was one of those people who could identify the thought at the other end of the process  in this case i am now very rich  draw a line between the two  and then think his way along it  slowly and patiently  until he got to the other end .   not that it worked .  there was always  he found  some small but vital flaw in the process .  it generally involved a strange reluctance on the part of people to buy what he had to sell .         mr dibbler can even sell sausages to people that have bought them off him before     and a man who could sell mr dibbler   s sausages twice could sell anything .         there was a dog sitting by his feet .   it was small  bow legged and wiry  and basically grey but with patches of brown  white and black in outlying areas      it looked up slowly  and said    woof .      victor poked an exploratory finger in his ear .  it must have been a trick of an echo  or something .  it wasn   t that the dog had gone    woof .      although that was practically unique in itself  most dogs in the universe never went    woof .      they had complicated barks like    whuuugh .     and    hwhoouf .     .  no  it was that it hadn   t in fact barked at all .  it had said    woof .      could have bin worse  mister .  i could have said    miaow    .        he was aware of a strange smell .  it was hard to place  but could perhaps have been a very old and slightly damp nursery rug .      woof bloody woof     said gaspode the wonder dog .     dibbler gave gaspode a long  slow stare  which was like challenging a centipede to an arse kicking contest .  gaspode could outstare a mirror .         i never had a chance  you know .  i mean  look at the start i had in life .  frone inna river inna sack .  an actual sack .  dear little puppy dog opens his eyes  looks out in wonder at the world  style offing  he   s in this sack .     the tears dripped off his nose .     for two weeks i thought the brick was my mother .             just my luck they threw me in the ankh     gaspode went on .     any other river  i   d have drowned and gone to doggy heaven .         victor was aware of a cold sensation against his leg .  it was as though a half melted ice cube was soaking through his trousers .  he tried to ignore it  but it had a definite unig norable quality .   he looked down .          scuse me     said gaspode .      mrs marietta cosmopilite of   quirm street  ankh morpork  believed the world was round  that a sprig of garlic in her underwear drawer kept away vampires  that it did you good to get out and have a laugh occasionally  that there was niceness in everyone if you only knew where to look  and that three horrible little dwarfs peered in at her undressing every night .            well  of course     said silverfish     a lot of very talented people want to be in moving pictures .  can you sing .         a bit .  in the bath .  but not very well     victor conceded .      can you dance .         no .         swords .  do you know how to handle a sword .      a little     said victor .      i see     said silverfish gloomily .     can   t sing .  can   t dance .  can handle a sword a little .        you would have to go a long way to find air that was realer than ankh morpork air .   you could tell just by breathing it that other people had been doing the same thing for thousands of years .        i don   t understand her     he said .     yesterday she was quite normal  today it   s all gone to her head .         bitches .     said gaspode  sympathetically .      oh  i wouldn   t go that far     said victor .     she   s just aloof     loofs .     said gaspode .      the necrotelicomnicon was written by a klatchian necromancer known to the world as achmed the mad  although he preferred to be called achmed the i just get these headaches .   it contained forbidden knowledge .   well  not actually forbidden .  no one had ever gone so far as forbidding it .  apart from anything else  in order to forbid it you   d have to know what it was  which was forbidden .  but it definitely contained the sort of information which  once you knew it  you wished you didn   t .        come on     said gaspode .     it   s not right  you being alone in a lady   s boodwah .         i   m not alone     victor said .     she   s with me .         that   s the point     said gaspode .        did i hear things  or can that little dog speak .     said dibbler .      he says he can   t     said victor .   dibbler hesitated .     well     he said     i suppose he should know .         the universe contains any amount of horrible ways to be woken up  such as the noise of the mob breaking down the front door  the scream of fire engines  or the realization that today is the monday which on friday night was a comfortably long way off .  a dog   s wet nose is not strictly speaking the worst of the bunch  but it has its own peculiar dreadfulness which connoisseurs of the ghastly and dog owners everywhere have come to know and dread .  it   s like having a small piece of defrosting liver pressed lovingly against you .      as the magic of the movies infects everyone  there are spillages from our own roundworld .      i don   t know what it   s called  but we   re doing one about going to see a wizard .  something about following a yellow sick toad     a man in one half of a lion suit explained to a companion in the queue .      a man and a woman aflame with passione in a citie riven by sivil war .   brother against brother .  women in crinoline dresses slapping people   s faces .  a mighty dynasty brought low .   a great city aflame .   all it needed was a title .  something with a ring to it .  something that people would remember .  something     dibbler scratched his chin with the pen     that said that the affairs of ordinary people were so much chaff in the great storms of history .  storms  that was it .  good imagery  a storm .  you got thunder .  lightning .  rain .  wind .   wind .  that was it .   he crawled up to the top of the sheet and  with great care  wrote   blown away .      soll was standing over the artist who lettered the cards      the lettering artist tugged at his sleeve .      i was just wondering  mr soll  what you wanted me to put in the big scene now           don   t worry me now  man .         but if you could just give me an idea        soll firmly unhooked the man   s hand from his sleeve .     frankly    he said     i don   t give a damn     and he strode off towards the set .   the artist was left alone .  he picked up his paintbrush .  his lips moved silently  shaping themselves around the words .   then he said     hmm .  nice one .         according to the history books  the decisive battle that ended the ankh morpork civil war was fought between two handfuls of bone weary men in a swamp early one misty morning and  although one side claimed victory  ended with a practical score of humans    ravens        which is the case with most battles .      the real city had been burned down many times in its long history   out of revenge  or carelessness  or spite  or even just for the insurance .  most of the big stone buildings that actually made it a city  as opposed simply to a load of hovels all in one place  survived them intact and many people considered that a good fire every hundred years or so was essential to the health of the city since it helped to keep down the rats  roaches  fleas and  of course  people not rich enough to live in stone houses .     inside every old person is a young person wondering what happened .     there   s a bar like it in every town .  it   s dimly lit and the drinkers  although they talk  don   t address their words to one another and they don   t listen  either .  they just talk the hurt inside .  it   s a bar for the derelict and the unlucky and all of those people who have been temporarily flagged off the racetrack of life and into the pits .      yetis are a high altitude species of troll  and quite unaware that eating people is out of fashion .  their view is  if it moves  eat it .  if it doesn   t  then wait for it to move .  and then eat it .      an inviolable rule about buildings for the showing of moving pictures  applicable throughout the multi verse  is that the ghastliness of the architecture around the back is inversely proportional to the glori ousness of the architecture in the front .  at the front  pillars  arches  gold leaf  lights .  at the back  weird ducts  mysterious prolapses of pipework  blank walls  fetid alleys .   and the window to the lavatories .         fascinating     said the patrician .  he had not got where he was today by bothering how things worked .  it was how people worked that intrigued him .         twas beauty killed the beast     said the dean  who liked to say things like that .      no it wasn   t     said the chair .     it was it splatting into the ground like that .        all dwarfs have beards and wear many layers of clothing .   their courtships are largely concerned with finding out  in delicate and circumspect ways  what sex the other dwarf is .     the flooded stairs lay in front of them .      can you swim .     said victor .      not very well     said ginger .      me neither     he said         still     he said  taking her hand .     we could look on this as a great opportunity to improve really quickly .         she was right about that  but only by coincidence .       death is missing     presumed     er    gone .  which leads to the kind of chaos you always get when an important public service is withdrawn .   meanwhile  on a little farm  far  far away  a tall dark stranger is turning out to be really good with a scythe .  there   s a harvest to be gathered in        not a muscle moved on death   s face  because he hadn   t got any .     the shortest lived creatures on the disc were mayflies  which barely make it through twenty four hours .  two of the oldest zigzagged aimlessly over the waters of a trout stream  discussing history with some younger members of the evening hatching .      you don   t get the kind of sun now that you used to get     said one of them .      you   re right there .  we had proper sun in the good old hours .  it were all yellow .  none of this red stuff .         it were higher  too .         it was .  you   re right .         and nymphs and larvae showed you a bit of respect .         they did .  they did     said the other mayfly vehemently .      i reckon  if mayflies these hours behaved a bit better  we   d still be having proper sun .      the younger mayflies listened politely .      i remember     said one of the oldest mayflies     when all this was fields  as far as you could see .      the younger mayflies looked around .      it   s still fields     one of them ventured  after a polite interval .      i remember when it was better fields     said the old mayfly sharply .      yeah     said his colleague .     and there was a cow .         that   s right .  you   re right .  i remember that cow .  stood right over there for  oh  forty  fifty minutes .  it was brown  as i recall .      you don   t get cows like that these hours .             what were we doing before we were talking about the sun .         zigzagging aimlessly over the water     said one of the young flies .  this was a fair bet in any case .      no  before that .         er     you were telling us about the great trout .         ah .  yes .  right .  the trout .  well  you see  if you   ve been a good mayfly  zigzagging up and down properly              taking heed of your elders and betters              then eventually the great trout        clop  clop     yes .     said one of the younger mayflies .   there was no reply .      the great trout what .     said another mayfly  nervously .   they looked down at a series of expanding concentric rings on the water .      the holy sign .     said a mayfly .     i remember being told about that .  a great circle in the water .  thus shall be the sign of the great trout .         whereas the oldest things on the discworld were the famous counting pines .   the six counting pines in this clump were listening to the oldest  whose gnarled trunk declared it to be thirty one thousand  seven hundred and thirty four years old .  the conversation took seventeen years  but has been speeded up .      i remember when all this wasn   t fields .         what was it  then .     said the nearest pine .      ice .  if you can call it ice .  we had proper glaciers in those days .  not like the ice you get now  here one season and gone the next .  it hung around for ages .         wow .  that was a sharp one .         what was .         that winter just then .         call that a winter .  when i was a sapling we had winters        then the tree vanished .   after a shocked pause for a couple of years  one of the clump said     he just went .  just like that .  one day he was here  next he was gone .      since the trees were unable even to sense any event that took place in less than a day  they never heard the sound of axes .      death   s pale horse   s name was binky he was a real horse .  death had tried fiery steeds and skeletal horses in the past  and found them impractical  especially the fiery ones  which tended to set light to their own bedding and stand in the middle of it looking embarrassed .     killing off a wizard of a higher grade was a recognized way of getting advancement in the orders .     wizards don   t believe in gods in the same way that most people don   t find it necessary to believe in  say  tables .  they know they   re there  they know they   re there for a purpose  they   d probably agree that they have a place in a well organized universe  but they wouldn   t see the point of believing  of going around saying     o great table  without whom we are as naught    .  anyway  either the gods are there whether you believe or not  or they exist only as a function of the belief  so either way you might as well ignore the whole business and  as it were  eat off your knees .      the bursar     didn   t eat much  but lived on his nerves .  he was certain he was anorectic  because every time he looked in a mirror he saw a fat man .  it was the archchancellor  standing behind him and shouting at him .      mustrum ridcully was  depending on your point of view  either the worst or the best archchancellor that unseen university had had for a hundred years .   there was too much of him  for one thing .  it wasn   t that he was particularly big  it was just that he had the kind of huge personality that fits any available space .  he   d get roaring drunk at supper and that was fine and acceptable wizardly behaviour .  but then he   d go back to his room and play darts all night and leave at five in the morning to go duck hunting .  he shouted at people .  he tried to jolly them along .  and he hardly ever wore proper robes .  he   d persuaded mrs whitlow  the university   s dreaded housekeeper  to make him a sort of baggy trouser suit in garish blue and red  twice a day the wizards stood in bemusement and watched him jog purposefully around the university buildings  his pointy wizarding hat tied firmly on his head with string .  he   d shout cheerfully up at them  because fundamental to the make up of people like mustrum ridcully is an iron belief that everyone else would like it  too  if only they tried it .      intellectually  ridcully maintained his position for two reasons .  one was that he never  ever  changed his mind about anything .  the other was that it took him several minutes to understand any new idea put to him  and this is a very valuable trait in a leader  because anything anyone is still trying to explain to you after two minutes is probably important and anything they give up after a mere minute or so is almost certainly something they shouldn   t have been bothering you with in the first place .      although not common on the discworld there are  indeed  such things as anti crimes  in accordance with the fundamental law that everything in the multiverse has an opposite .  they are  obviously  rare .  merely giving someone something is not the opposite of robbery  to be an anti crime  it has to be done in such a way as to cause outrage and or humiliation to the victim .  so there is breaking and decorating  proffering with embarrassment  as in most retirement presentations  and whitemailing  as in threatening to reveal to his enemies a mobster   s secret donations  for example  to charity  .  anti crimes have never really caught on .      for more than a century windle poons had lived inside the walls of unseen university .  in terms of accumulated years  he may have lived a long time .  in terms of experience  he was about thirteen .      the shades was the oldest part of the city .  if you could do a sort of relief map of sinfulness  wickedness and all round immorality  rather like those representations of the gravitational field around a black hole  then even in ankh morpork the shades would be represented by a shaft .         if anyone   s going to bury a wizard at a crossroads with a stake hammered through him  then wizards ought to do it .  after all  we   re his friends .         mustrum ridcully  archchancellor of unseen university  was a shameless autocondimentor .            all right  you fellows     ridcully said .      no magic at table  you know the rules .  who   s playing silly buggers .      the other senior wizards stared at him .      i  i  i don   t think we can play it any more     said the bursar     i  i  i think we lost some of the pieces            the relationship between the university and the patrician  absolute ruler and nearly benevolent dictator of ankh morpork  was a complex and subtle one .   the wizards held that  as servants of a higher truth  they were not subject to the mundane laws of the city .   the patrician said that  indeed  this was the case  but they would bloody well pay their taxes like everyone else .   the wizards said that  as followers of the light of wisdom  they owed allegiance to no mortal man .   the patrician said that this may well be true but they also owed a city tax of two hundred dollars per head per annum  payable quarterly .   the wizards said that the university stood on magical ground and was therefore exempt from taxation and anyway you couldn   t put a tax on knowledge .   the patrician said you could .  it was two hundred dollars per capita  if per capita was a problem  decapita could be arranged .   the wizards said that the university had never paid taxes to the civil authority .   the patrician said he was not proposing to remain civil for long .   the wizards said  what about easy terms .   the patrician said he was talking about easy terms .  they wouldn   t want to know about the hard terms .   the wizards said that there was a ruler back in  oh  it would be the century of the dragonfly  who had tried to tell the university what to do .  the patrician could come and have a look at him if he liked .   the patrician said that he would .  he truly would .   in the end it was agreed that while the wizards of course paid no taxes  they would nevertheless make an entirely voluntary donation of  oh  let   s say two hundred dollars per head  without prejudice  mutatis mutandis  no strings attached  to be used strictly for non militaristic and environmentally acceptable purposes .     thin  pale  and clad all in dusty black   the patrician always put ridcully in mind of a predatory flamingo  if you could find a flamingo that was black and had the patience of a rock .     people get exactly the wrong idea about belief .  they think it works back to front .  they think the sequence is  first object  then belief .  in fact  it works the other way .   belief sloshes around in the firmament like lumps of clay spiralling into a potter   s wheel .  that   s how gods get created  for example .  they clearly must be created by their own believers  because a brief resume of the lives of most gods suggests that their origins certainly couldn   t be divine .  they tend to do exactly the things people would do if only they could  especially when it comes to nymphs  golden showers  and the smiting of your enemies .         and you   re a vampire too  countess notfaroutoe .     windle poons enquired politely .   the countess smiled .     my vord  yes     she said .      by marriage     said arthur .      can you do that .  i thought you had to be bitten     said windle .      i don   t see why i should have to go around biting my wife after thirty years of marriage  and that   s flat     said the count .         this vampiring   s not all it   s cracked up to be  you know .  can   t go out in daylight  can   t eat garlic  can   t have a decent shave           why can   t you have a       windle began .      can   t use a mirror     said arthur .         by the way  sister drull is a ghoul .  if she offers you any of her meat patties  don   t accept .         oh  dear     windle said .     you mean she makes them out of human flesh .         what .  oh .  no .  she just can   t cook very well .         sometimes people challenge me to a game .  for their lives  you know   said death .       do they ever win .      no .  last year someone got three streets and all the utilities .      what .  what sort of game is that .      i don   t recall .     exclusive possession     i think .  i was the boot .      a compost heap comes to life and threatens a group of wizards   the heap swivelled and lunged towards the bursar .   the wizards backed away .      it can   t be intelligent  can it .     said the bursar .      all it   s doing is moving around slowly and eating things     said the dean .      put a pointy hat on it and it   d be a faculty member     said the archchancellor .      miss flitworth had said that before they could start a graveyard in these parts they   d had to hit someone over the head with the shovel .      people have believed for hundreds of years that newts in a well mean that the water   s fresh and drinkable  and in all that time never asked themselves whether the newts got out to go to the lavatory .      the ability of skinny old ladies to carry huge loads is phenomenal .  studies have shown that an ant can carry one hundred times its own weight  but there is no known limit to the lifting power of the average tiny eighty year old spanish peasant grandmother .        why are you called one man bucket .      in my tribe we   re traditionally named after the first thing the mother sees when she looks out of the teepee after the birth .  it   s short for one man pouring a bucket of water over two dogs .      that   s pretty unfortunate     said windle .   it   s not too bad  said one man bucket .  it was my twin brother you had to feel sorry for .  she looked out ten seconds before me to give him his name .      don   t tell me  let me guess     windle said .     two dogs fighting .      two dogs fighting .  two dogs fighting .  said one man bucket .  wow  he   d have given his right arm to be called two dogs fighting .     in the ramtop village where they dance the real morris dance  for example  they believe that no one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away   until the clock he wound up winds down  until the wine she made has finished its ferment  until the crop they planted is harvested .  the span of someone   s life  they say  is only the core of their actual existence .        who   s playing the maracas .      death grinned .   maracas .  i don   t need     maracas .     in the village in the ramtops where they understand what the morris dance is all about  they dance it just once  at dawn  on the first day of spring .  they don   t dance it after that  all through the summer .  after all  what would be the point .  what use would it be .   but on a certain day when the nights are drawing in  the dancers leave work early and take  from attics and cupboards  the other costume  the black one  and the other bells .  and they go by separate ways to a valley among the leafless trees .  they don   t speak .  there is no music .  it   s very hard to imagine what kind there could be .   the bells don   t ring .  they   re made of octiron  a magic metal .  but they   re not  precisely  silent bells .  silence is merely the absence of noise .  they make the opposite of noise  a sort of heavily textured silence .   and in the cold afternoon  as the light drains from the sky  among the frosty leaves and in the damp air  they dance the other morris .  because of the balance of things .   you   ve got to dance both  they say .  otherwise you can   t dance either .      someone who will put certainly salt and probably pepper on any meal you put in front of them whatever it is and regardless of how much it   s got on it already and regardless of how it tastes .  behavioural psychiatrists working for fast food outlets around the universe have saved billions of whatever the local currency is by noting the autocondimenting phenomenon and advising their employers to leave seasoning out in the first place .  this is really true .       it seemed an easy job     after all  how difficult could it be make sure that a servant girl doesn   t marry a prince .  but for the witches granny weatherwax  nanny ogg and magrat sarlick  travelling to the distant city of genua  things are never that simple     servant girls have to marry the prince .  that   s what life is all about .  you can   t fight a happy ending .   at least  tip until now     just superstition .  but a superstition doesn   t have to be wrong .      bad spelling can be lethal .  for example  the greedy seriph of al ybi was once cursed by a badly educated deity and for some days everything he touched turned to glod  which happened to be the name of a small dwarf from a mountain community hundreds of miles away who found himself magically dragged to the kingdom and relentlessly duplicated .  some two thousand glods later the spell wore off .  these days  the people of al ybi are renowned for being unusually short and bad tempered .      she had buried three husbands  and at least two of them had been already dead .     never trust a dog with orange eyebrows .     artists and writers have always had a rather exaggerated idea about what goes on at a witches    sabbat .  this comes from spending too much time in small rooms with the curtains drawn  instead of getting out in the healthy fresh air .   for example  there   s the dancing around naked .  in the average temperate climate there are very few nights when anyone would dance around at midnight with no clothes on  quite apart from the question of stones  thistles  and sudden hedge hogs .   then there   s all that business with goat headed gods .  most witches don   t believe in gods .  they know that the gods exist  of course .  they even deal with them occasionally .  but they don   t believe in them .  they know them too well .  it would be like believing in the postman .   and there   s the food and drink  the bits of reptile and so on .  in fact  witches don   t go for that sort of thing .  the worst you can say about the eating habits of the older type of witch is that they tend to like ginger biscuits dipped in tea with so much sugar in it that the spoon won   t move and will drink it out of the saucer if they think it   s too hot .  and do so with appreciative noises more generally associated with the cheaper type of plumbing system .  legs of toad and so on might be better than this .   then there   s the mystic ointments .  by sheer luck  the artists and writers are on firmer ground here .  most witches are elderly  which is when ointments start to have an attraction  and at least two of those present tonight were wearing granny weatherwax   s famous goose grease and sage chest liniment .  this didn   t make you fly and see visions  but it did prevent colds  if only because the distressing smell that developed around about the second week kept everyone else so far away you couldn   t catch anything from them .   and finally there   s sabbats themselves .  your average witch is not  by nature  a social animal as far as other witches are concerned .  there   s a conflict of dominant personalities .  there   s a group of ringleaders without a ring .  the natural size of a coven is one .        i can   t be having with foreign parts     said granny weather wax .      you   ve been to ankh morpork     said nanny mildly .     that   s foreign .         no it   s not .  it   s just a long way off    magrat would be the first to admit that she had an open mind .  it was as open as a field  as open as the sky .  no mind could be more open without special surgical implements .  and she was always waiting for something to fill it up .         i used to come over here quite often to look at desiderata   s books     magrat confessed .     and     and she liked to cook foreign food and no one else round here would eat it  so i   d come up to keep her company        ah ha .  curryin    favour .     snapped granny .      magrat has adopted trousers as practical wear for travelling by broomstick .      i don   t    old with it     said granny .     everyone can see her legs .         no they can   t     said nanny .     the reason being  the material is in the way     yes  but they can see where her legs are     said granny weatherwax .      that   s silly .  that   s like saying everyone   s naked under their clothes     said magrat .      magrat garlick  may you be forgiven     said granny weatherwax .      well  it   s true .         i   m not     said granny flatly     i got three vests on .         to the rest of the world he was an enormous tomcat  a parcel of incredibly indestructible life forces in a skin that looked less like a fur than a piece of bread that had been left in a damp place for a fortnight .  ferocious dogs would whine and hide under the stairs when greebo sauntered down the street .  foxes kept away from the village .  wolves made a detour .      he   s an old softie really     said nanny .      above the noise of the river they could all hear  now  the steady slosh slosh of another craft heading towards them .      someone   s following us .     hissed magrat .   two pale glows appeared at the edge of the lamplight .  eventually they turned out to be the eyes of a small grey creature  vaguely froglike  paddling towards them on a log .   it reached the boat .  long clammy fingers grabbed the side  and a lugubrious face rose level with nanny ogg   s .          ullo     it said .     it   sss my birthday .      all three of them stared at it for a while .  then granny weatherwax picked up an oar and hit it firmly over the head .  there was a splash  and a distant cursing .      horrible little bugger     said granny  as they rowed on .     looked like a troublemaker to me .            blessings be on this house     granny said  perfunctorily .  it was always a good opening remark for a witch .  it concentrated people   s minds on what other things might be on this house .      sometimes magrat really wondered about the others    commitment to witchcraft .  half the time they didn   t seem to bother .   take medicine  for example     granny just gave people a bottle of coloured water and told them they felt a lot better .   and what was so annoying was that they often did .   where was the witchcraft in that .      granny weatherwax waking up was quite an impressive sight  and one not seen by many people .   most people  on waking up  accelerate through a quick panicky pre consciousness check up  who am i  where am i  who is he she  good god  why am i cuddling a policeman   s helmet  what happened last nightl  and this is because people are riddled by doubt .   granny weatherwax went straight from fast asleep to instant operation on all six cylinders .  she never needed to find herself because she always knew who was doing the looking .     vampires have risen from the dead   the grave and the crypt  but have never managed it from the cat .     nanny ogg sent a number of cards home to her family  not a single one of which got back before she did .  this is traditional  and happens everywhere in the universe .      in a quiet little inn in a tiny country granny weatherwax sat and regarded the food with deep suspicion .      good simple home cooking     said granny .     that   s all i require .  i just want simple food .  not all grease and stuff .  it comes to something when you complain about something in your lettuce and it turns out to be what you ordered .        knowing how stories work is almost all the battle .   for example  when an obvious innocent sits down with three experienced card sharpers and says    how do you play this game  then .      someone is about to be shaken down until their teeth fall out .     the dwarf bread was brought out for inspection .  but it was miraculous  the dwarf bread .  no one ever went hungry when they had some dwarf bread to avoid .  you only had to look at it for a moment  and instantly you could think of dozens of things you   d rather eat .  your boots  for example .  mountains .  raw sheep .  your own foot .      there were only six suits of chain mail in the whole of lancre  made on the basis of one size doesn   t quite fit all .         when did you last have a bath  esme .         what do you mean  last .  baths is unhygienic     granny declared .     you know i   ve never agreed with baths .  sittin    around in your own dirt like that .         what do you do  then .     said magrat .      i just washes     said granny .     all the bits .  you know .  as and when they becomes available .         granny weatherwax had never turned anyone into a frog .  the way she saw it  there was a technically less cruel but cheaper and much more satisfying thing you could do .  you could leave them human and make them think they were a frog  which also provided much innocent entertainment for passers by .         i don   t mind criticism     said granny .     you know me .  i   ve never been one to take offence at criticism .  no one could say i   m the sort to take offence at criticism           not twice  anyway    said nanny .      people like nanny ogg turn up everywhere .  it   s as if there   s some special morphic generator dedicated to the production of old women who like a laugh and aren   t averse to the odd pint  especially of some drink normally sold in very small glasses .  you find them all over the place  often in pairs .         nanny ogg quite liked cooking  provided there were other people around to do things like chop up the vegetables and wash the dishes afterwards .         that   s the trouble with second sight     desiderata said .     you can see what   s happenin     but you don   t know what it means .  i   ve seen the future .  there   s a coach made out of a pumpkin .  and that   s impossible .  and there   s coachmen made out of mice  which is unlikely .  and there   s a clock striking midnight  and something about a glass slipper .  and it   s all going to happen .  because that   s how stories have to work .         but then granny and nanny have to try to stop the story from happening .      it   s no good  you know  said lily weatherwax  .  you can   t stop this sort of thing .  it has the momentum of inevitability .  you can   t spoil a good story .  i should know .      she handed the slipper to the prince  but without taking her eyes off granny .      it   ll fit her     she said .   two of the courtiers held magrat   s leg as the prince wrestled the slipper past her protesting toes .      there     said lily  still without looking down .     and do stop trying that hedge witch hypnotism on me  esme .         it fits     said the prince  but in a doubtful tone of voice .      yes  anything would fit     said a cheerful voice from somewhere towards the back of the crowd     if you were allowed to put two pairs of hairy socks on first .      lily looked down .  then she looked at magrat   s mask .  she reached out and pulled it off .      wrong girl     said lily .     but it still doesn   t matter  esme  because it is the right slipper .  so all we have to do is find the girl whose foot it fits        there was a commotion at the back of the crowd .  courtiers parted  revealing nanny ogg .      if it   s a five and a half narrow fit  i   m your man     she said .     just let me get these boots off           i wasn   t referring to you  old woman     said lily coldly .      oh  yes you was     said nanny .     we know how this bit goes  see .  the prince goes all round the city with the slipper  trying to find the girl whose foot fits .  that   s what you was plannin    .  so i can save you a bit of trouble  how about it .      there was a flicker of uncertainty in lily   s expression .      a girl     she said     of marriageable age .         no problem there     said nanny cheerfully      nanny grabbed the slipper out of the prince   s hands and  before anyone else could move  slid it on to her foot .   then she waggled the foot in the air .   it was a perfect fit .      there .     she said .     see .  you could have wasted the whole day        especially because there must be hundreds of five and a half               narrow fit               narrow fit wearers in a city this size     granny went on .     unless  of course  you happened to sort of go to the right house right at the start .  if you had  you know  a lucky guess .         but that   d be cheatin        said nanny .   she nudged the prince .      i   d just like to add     she said     that i don   t mind doin    all the waving and opening things and other royal stuff  but i draw the line at sleepin    in the same bed as sunny jim here .         because he doesn   t sleep in a bed     said granny .      no  he sleeps in a pond     said nanny .      because he   s a frog     said granny .        this is greebo .  between you and me  he   s a fiend from hell .         well  he   s a cat     said mrs gogol .     it   s only to be expected .        no one knew better than granny weatherwax that hats were important .  they weren   t just clothing .  hats defined the head .  they defined who you were .  no one had ever heard of a wizard without a pointy hat   at least  no wizard worth speaking of .  and you certainly never heard of a witch without one     it wasn   t the wearing of the hats that counted so much as having one to wear .  every trade  every craft had its hat .  that   s why kings had hats .  take the crown off a king and all you had was someone good at having a weak chin and waving to people .  hats had power .  hats were important .         you always used to say i was wanton  when we was younger     said nanny .      you was  of course     said granny .     but you never used magic for it  did you .         din   t have to     said nanny happily .     an off the shoulder dress did the trick most of the time .         right off the shoulder and on to the grass  as i recall     said granny .      every established kitchen has one ancient knife  its handle worn thin  its blade curved like a banana  and so inexplicably sharp that reaching into the drawer at night is like bobbing for apples in a piranha tank .         look at the three of you     lily said .     the maiden  the mother and the crone .         who are you calling a maiden .     said nanny ogg .      who are you calling a mother .     said magrat .   granny weatherwax glowered briefly like the person who has discovered that there is only one straw left and everyone else has drawn a long one .         don   t you talk to me about progress .  progress just means bad things happen faster .            how come you   re in the palace guard  casanunda .  all the rest of    em are six foot tall and you   re     of the shorter persuasion .         i lied about my height  mrs ogg .            i don   t want to hurt you  mistress weatherwax     said mrs gogol .      that   s good     said granny .     i don   t want you to hurt me either .          always in front of you in any queue  for a start .       in the beginning was the word .  and the word was     hey  you .      for brutha the novice is the chosen one .  he wants peace and justice and brotherly love .   he also wants the inquisition to stop torturing bin .  now  please     brother preptil  the master of the music  had described brutha   s voice as putting im in mind of a disappointed vulture arriving too late at the dead donkey .      there was something creepy about that boy  brutha   nhumrod thought .  it was the way he looked at you when you were talking  as if he was listening .         it   s a big bull     said the tortoise .      the very likeness of the great god om in one of his worldly incarnations .     said brutha proudly .     and you say you   re him .      i haven   t been well lately     said the tortoise .         how should i know .  i don   t know .     lied the tortoise .      but you     you   re omnicognizant     said brutha .      that doesn   t mean i know everything .      brutha bit his lip .     um .  yes .  it does .         everyone in the city knew cut me own hand off dhblah  purveyor of suspiciously new holy relics  suspiciously old rancid sweetmeats on a stick  gritty figs  and long past their  sell by dates .         i     i do not know how to ride  my lord     said brutha .      any man can get on a mule     said vorbis .     often many times in a short distance .         it was a small mule and brutha had long legs  if he   d made the effort he could have remained standing and let the mule trot out from underneath .        my grandmother used to give me a thrashing every morning because i would certainly do something to deserve it during the day    said brutha .     if you spend your whole time thinking about the universe  you tend to forget the less important bits of it .  like your pants .      people think that professional soldiers think a lot about fighting  but serious professional soldiers think a lot more about food and a warm place to sleep  because these are two things that are generally hard to get  whereas fighting tends to turn up all the time .      humans .  they lived in a world where the grass continued to be green and the sun rose every day and flowers regularly turned into fruit  and what impressed them .  weeping statues .  and wine made out of water .  a mere quantum mechanistic tunnel effect  that   d happen anyway if you were prepared to wait zillions of years .  as if the turning of sunlight into wine  by means of vines and grapes and time and enzymes  wasn   t a thousand times more impressive and happened all the time         no other library anywhere  for example  has a whole gallery of unwritten books   books that would have been written if the author hadn   t been eaten by an alligator around chapter    and so on .  atlases of imaginary places .  dictionaries of illusory words .  spotters    guides to invisible things .  wild thesauri in the lost reading room .  a library so big that it distorts reality and has opened gateways to all other libraries  everywhere and everywhen            prince lasgere of tsort asked me how he could become learned  especially since he hadn   t got any time for this reading business .  i said to him     there is no royal road to learning  sire     and he said to me     bloody well build one or i shall have your legs chopped off .  use as many slaves as you like .     a refreshingly direct approach  i always thought .  not a man to mince words .  people  yes .  but not words .         gods are not very introspective .  it has never been a survival trait .  the ability to cajole  threaten and terrify has always worked well enough .  when you can flatten entire cities at a whim  a tendency towards quiet reflection and seeing things from the other fellow   s point of view is seldom necessary .   which had led  across the multi verse  to men and women of tremendous brilliance and empathy devoting their entire lives to the service of deities who couldn   t beat them at a quiet game of dominoes .  for example  sister sestina of quirm defied the wrath of a local king and walked unharmed across a bed of coals and propounded a philosophy of sensible ethics on behalf of a goddess whose only real interest was in hairstyles  and brother zephilite of klatch left his vast estates and his family and spent his life ministering to the sick and poor on behalf of the invisible god f   rum  generally considered unable  should he have a backside  to find it with both hands  should he have hands .  gods never need to be very bright when there are humans around to be it for them .      mountains rise and fall  and under them the turtle swims onward .  men live and die  and the turtle moves .  empires grow and crumble  and the turtle moves .  gods come and go  and still the turtle moves .  the turtle moves .      words are the litmus paper of the mind .  if you find yourself in the power of someone who will use the word    commence    in cold blood  go somewhere else very quickly .  but if they say    enter     don   t stop to pack .       the fairies are back   but this time they don   t just want youir teeth     granny weatherwax and her tiny coven are tip against real elves .  it   s midsummer night .   no time for dreaming     with full supporting cast of dwarfs  wizards  trolls  morris dancers and one orang utan .  and lots of hey nonny nonny and blood all over the place .   nanny ogg never did any housework herself  but she was the cause of housework in other people .      lancre was so small that you couldn   t lie down without a passport .      william scrope .      yes .      if you would please step this way .      are you a hunter .      i like to think i am a picker up of unconsidered trifles .   death grinned hopefully .  scrope   s post physical brow furrowed .      what .  like     sherry  custard     that sort of thing .            someone got killed up here .         oh  no     moaned nanny ogg .      a tall man .  he had one leg longer   n the other .  and a beard .  he was probably a hunter .         how   d you know all that .         i just trod on    im .            hope magrat does all right as queen     said nanny .      we taught her everything she knows     said granny weatherwax .      yeah     said nanny ogg .     d   you think     maybe      .         what .         d   you think maybe we ought to have taught her everything we know .         the thing about the librarian was that no one noticed he was an orangutan any more  unless a visitor to the university happened to point it out .  in which case someone would say     oh  yes .  some kind of magical accident  wasn   t it .  pretty sure it was something like that .  one minute human  next minute an ape .  funny thing  really     can   t remember what he looked like before .  i mean  he must have been human  i suppose .  always thought of him as an ape  really .  it   s more him .         magrat normally wore a simple dress with not much underneath it except magrat .      nanny subtly breaks the news of a death      well  now     said nanny     you know the widow scrope  lives over in slice .      quarney   s mouth opened .      she   s not a widow     he said .     she           bet you half a dollar .     said nanny .      esme   s skill at borrowing unnerved nanny ogg .  it was all very well entering the minds of animals and such  but too many witches had never come back .  for several years nanny had put out lumps of fat and bacon rind for a bluetit that she was sure was old granny postalute  who   d gone out borrowing one day and never came back .      granny weatherwax had a feeling she was going to die .  this was beginning to get on her nerves .         i do apologize for this     said the very small highwayman .     i find myself a little short .         the dwarf bowed and produced a slip of pasteboard from one grubby but lace clad sleeve .      my card     he said .   it read        are you really an outrageous liar .         no .         why are you trying to rob coaches  then .         i am afraid i was waylaid by bandits .         but it says here     said ridcully    that you are a finest swordsman .         i was outnumbered .         how many of them were there .         three million .            you know     said ponder     this reminds me of that famous logical puzzle     there was this man  right  who had to choose between going through two doors  apparently  and the guard on one door always told the truth and the guard on the other door always told a lie  and the thing was  behind one door was certain death  and behind the other door was freedom  and he didn   t know which guard was which  and he could only ask them one question and so  what did he ask .         hang on     said casanunda     i think i   ve worked it out .  one question  right .         yes     said ponder  relieved .      and he can ask either guard .         yes .         oh  right .  well  in that case he goes up to the smallest guard and says     tell me which is the door to freedom if you don   t want to see the colour of your kidneys and incidentally i   m walking through it behind you  so if you   re trying for the mr clever award just remember who   s going through it first            no  no  no .         sounds logical to me     said ridcully .     very good thinking .         but you haven   t got a weapon .      yes i have .  i wrested it from the guard while he was considering the question     said casanunda .      ponder stibbons tries to explain parallel universes to ridcully      parallel universes  i said .  universes where things didn   t happen like       he hesitated .     well  you know that girl .         what girl .         the girl you wanted to marry .         how   d you know that .         you were talking about her just after lunch .         was i .  more fool me .  well  what about her .         well     in a way  you did marry her     said ponder .   ridcully shook his head .     nope .  pretty certain i didn   t .  you remember that sort of thing .         ah  but not in this universe           you suggestin    i nipped into some other universe to get married .     said ridcully .      no .  i mean  you got married in that universe and not in this universe     said ponder .      did i .  what .  a proper ceremony and everything .      yes .         hmm .     ridcully stroked his beard .     you sure .         certain  archchancellor .         my word .  i never knew that .      ponder felt he was getting somewhere .      so        yes .         why don   t i remember it .      ponder had been ready for this .      because the you in the other universe is different from the you here     he said .     it was a different you that got married .  he   s probably settled down somewhere .  he   s probably a great grandad by now .         he never writes  i know that     said ridcully .     and the bastard never invited me to the wedding .         who .         him .         but he   s you .         is he .  huh .  you   d think i   d think of me  wouldn   t you .  what a bastard .        it wasn   t that ridcully was stupid .   truly stupid wizards have the life expectancy of a glass hammer .  he had quite a powerful intellect  but it was powerful like a locomotive  and ran on rails and was therefore almost impossible to steer .     shawn took a deep breath and leaned over the battlements .      halt .  who goes there .     he said .      it   s me  shawn .  your mum .         oh  hello  mum .  hello  mistress weatherwax .         let us in  there   s a good boy .         friend or foe .         what .         it   s what i   ve got to say  mum .  it   s official .  and then you   ve got to say friend .         i   m your mum .      you   ve got to do it properly  mum     said shawn     otherwise what   s the point .         it   s going to be foe in a minute  my lad .         oooaaaww  mum .         oh  all right .  friend  then .         yes  but you could just be saying that           a witch   s cottage is a very specific architectural item .  it is not exactly built  but put together over the years as the areas of repair join up  like a sock made entirely of darns .  the chimney twists like a corkscrew .  the roof is thatch so old that small but flourishing trees are growing in it  the floors are switchbacks  it creaks at night like a tea clipper in a gale .  if at least two walls aren   t shored up with balks of timber then it   s not a true witch   s cottage at all  but merely the home of some daft old bat who reads tea leaves and talks to her cat .      the bandit chief knocked on the coach door .  the window slid down .      i wouldn   t like you to think of this as a robbery     he said .     i   d like you to think of it more as a colourful anecdote you might enjoy telling your grandchildren about .      a wizard   s staff poked out .  the chieftain saw the knob on the end .      now  then     he said  pleasantly .     i know the rules .  wizards aren   t allowed to use magic against civilians except in genuine life threatening situa        there was a burst of octarine light .      actually  it   s not a rule     said ridcully    it   s more a guideline .            i thought that sort of thing was  you know     the king grinned sickly     folklore .         of course it   s folklore  you stupid man .         i do happen to be king  you know     said verence reproachfully .      you stupid king  your majesty .         thank you .           elves are beautiful .  they   ve got style .  beauty .  grace .   that   s what matters .  if cats looked like frogs we   d realize what nasty  cruel little bastards they are .  style .  that   s what people remember .           nanny  would you like to be a bridesmaid .         not really  dear .  bit old for that sort of thing .     nanny hovered .     there isn   t anything you need to ask me  though  is there .         what do you mean .         what with your mum being dead and you having no female relatives and everything         magrat still looked puzzled .      after the wedding  is what i   m hinting about     said nanny .      oh  that .  no  most of that   s being done by a caterer .         it wasn   t that nanny ogg sang badly .  it was just that she could hit notes which  when amplified by a tin bath half full of water  ceased to be sound and became some sort of invasive presence .   there had been plenty of singers whose high notes could smash a glass  but nanny   s high c could clean it .         swish city bastards .         they don   t know what it   s like to be up to the armpit in a cow   s backside on a snowy night .  hah .         and there ain   t one of    em that    what   re you talking about .  you ain   t got a cow .         no  but i know what it   s like .            what do we do with the mail .     said ridcully     i take the palace stuff  and we generally leave the sack hanging up on a nail outside the tavern so that people can help themselves     said shawn .      isn   t that dangerous .     said ponder .      don   t think so .  it   s a strong nail     said shawn .         i remember years ago my granny telling me about queen amonia  well  i say queen  but she never was queen except for about three hours because of what i   m about to unfold  on account of them playing hide and seek at the wedding party and her hiding in a big heavy old chest in some attic and the lid slamming shut and no one finding her for seven months  by which time you could definitely say the wedding cake was getting a bit stale .           that   s the thing about witchcraft     she said .     it doesn   t exactly keep you young  but you do stay old for longer .        nanny said     funny to think of our magrat being married and everything .         what do you mean  everything .         well  you know   married     said nanny .     i gave her a few tips .  always wear something in bed .  keeps a man interested .         you always wore your hat .         right .            what was that dance your jason and his men did when they   d got drunk .     said granny .      it   s the lancre stick and bucket dance  esme .         it   s legal  is it .         technically they shouldn   t do it when there   s women present     said nanny .     otherwise it   s sexual morrisment .         the monks of cool  whose tiny and exclusive monastery is hidden in a really cool and laid back valley in the lower ramtops  have a passing out test for a novice .  he is taken into a room full of all types of clothing and asked  yo  my son  which of these is the most stylish thing to wear .  and the correct answer is  hey  whatever i select .       be a man in the city watch .  the city watch needs men .     but what it   s got includes corporal carrot  technically a dwarf   lance constable detritus  a troll   lance constable angua  a woman     most of tbe time  and corporal nobbs  disqualified from the human race for shoving  .   and they need all the help they can get .  because they   ve only got twenty four hours to clean tip the town and this is ankh morpork we   re talking about        sergeant colon     said angua .     he was the fat one  yes .         that   s right .         why has he got a pet monkey .         ah     said carrot .     i think it is corporal nobbs to whom you refer               who was that man with the granite face i saw in the watch house .     said angua .      that was detritus the troll     said carrot .      no  that man     said angua  learning as had so many others that carrot tended to have a bit of trouble with metaphors .     face like thu    face like someone very disgruntled .         oh  that was captain vimes .  but he   s never been gruntled  i think        vimes   s meeting with the patrician ended as all such meetings did  with the guest going away in possession of an unfocused yet nagging suspicion that he   d only just escaped with his life .      sybil ramkin lived in the kind of poverty that was only available to the very rich  a poverty approached from the other side .  women who were merely well off saved up and bought dresses made of silk edged with lace and pearls  but lady ramkin was so rich she could afford to stomp around the place in rubber boots and a tweed skirt that had belonged to her mother .  she was so rich she could afford to live on biscuits and cheese sandwiches .  she was so rich she lived in three rooms in a thirty four roomed mansion  the rest of them were full of very expensive and very old furniture  covered in dust sheets .      the reason that the rich were so rich  vimes reasoned  was because they managed to spend less money .   take boots  for example .  he earned thirty eight dollars a month plus allowances .  a really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars .  but an affordable pair of boots  which were sort of okay for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out  cost about ten dollars .  those were the kind of boots vimes always bought  and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in ankh morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles .   but the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years .  a man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that   d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years    time  while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet .   this was the captain samuel vimes    boots    theory of socio economic unfairness .      the natural condition of the common swamp dragon is to be chronically ill  and the natural state of an unhealthy dragon is to be laminated across the walls  floor and ceiling of whatever room it is in .  a swamp dragon is a badly run  dangerously unstable chemical factory one step from disaster .  one quite small step .   it has been speculated that its habit of exploding violently when angry  excited  frightened or merely plain bored is a developed survival trait    to discourage predators .  eat dragons  it proclaims  and you   ll have a case of indigestion to which the term    blast radius    will be appropriate .      to understand why dwarfs and trolls don   t like each other you have to go back a long way .   they get along like chalk and cheese .  very like chalk and cheese  really .  one is organic  the other isn   t  and also smells a bit cheesy .  dwarfs make a living by smashing up rocks with valuable minerals in them and the silicon based lifeform known as trolls are  basically  rocks with valuable minerals in them .      carrot often struck people as simple .  and he was .   where people went wrong was thinking that simple meant the same thing as stupid .   carrot was not stupid .  he was direct  and honest  and good natured and honourable in all his dealings .  in ankh morpork this would normally have added up to    stupid    in any case and would have given him the survival quotient of a jellyfish in a blast furnace  but there were a couple of other factors .  one was a punch that even trolls had learned to respect .  the other was that carrot was genuinely  almost supernaturally  likeable .  he got on well with people  even while arresting them .  he had an exceptional memory for names .     vimes would be the first to admit that he wasn   t a good copper   but he   d probably be spared the chore because lots of other people would happily admit it for him .     there were such things as dwarf gods .  dwarfs were not a naturally religious species  but in a world where pit props could crack without warning and pockets of fire damp could suddenly explode they   d seen the need for gods as the sort of supernatural equivalent of a hard hat .  besides  when you hit your thumb with an eight pound hammer it   s nice to be able to blaspheme .  it takes a very special and strong minded kind of atheist to jump up and down with their hand clasped under their other armpit and shout     oh  random fluctuations in the space time con tinuum .     or    aaargh  primitive and outmoded concept on a crutch .        no clowns were funny .   that was the whole purpose of a clown .  people laughed at clowns  but only out of nervousness .  the point of clowns was that  after watching them  anything else that happened seemed enjoyable .  it was nice to know there was someone worse off than you .     three and a half minutes after waking up  captain samuel vimes  night watch  staggered up the last few steps on to the roof of the city   s opera house  gasped for breath and threw up allegro ma non troppo .      he didn   t know much about gargoyles .  carrot had said something once about how marvellous it was  an urban troll species that had evolved a symbiotic relationship with gutters  and he had admired the way they funnelled run off water into their ears and out through fine sieves in their mouths .  you didn   t get many birds nesting on buildings colonized by gargoyles .      vimes snorted .  i grew up here  he thought  and when i walk down the street everyone says     who   s that glum bugger .     carrot   s been here a few months and everyone knows him .  and he knows everyone .  everyone likes him .  i   d be annoyed about that  if only he wasn   t so likeable .         i   d like a couple of eggs     said vimes     with the yolks real hard but the whites so runny that they drip like treacle .  and i want bacon  that special bacon all covered with bony nodules and dangling bits of fat .  and a slice of fried bread .  the kind that makes your arteries go clang just by looking at it .         tough order     said harga .      you managed it yesterday .         probably no other world in the multiverse has warehouses for things which only exist in potentia  but the pork futures warehouse in ankh morpork is a product of the patrician   s rules about baseless metaphors  the literal mindedness of citizens who assume that everything must exist somewhere  and the general thinness of the fabric of reality around ankh  which is so thin that it   s as thin as a very thin thing .  the net result is that trading in pork futures   in pork that doesn   t exist yet   led to the building of the warehouse to store it in until it does .      c .  m .  o .  t .  dibbler had a number of bad points  but species prejudice was not one of them .  he liked anyone who had money  regardless of the colour and shape of the hand that was proffering it .  for dibbler believed in a world where a sapient creature could walk tall  breathe free  pursue life  liberty and happiness  and step out towards the bright new dawn .  if they could be persuaded to gobble something off dibbler   s hot food tray at the same time  this was all to the good .      leonard of quirm was not all that old .  he was one of those people who started looking venerable around the age of thirty  and would probably still look about the same at the age of ninety .  he wasn   t exactly bald  either .  his head had just grown up through his hair  rising like a mighty rock dome through heavy forest .         this city is full of clever men     said the patrician       they never think .  they do things like open the three jolly luck take away fish bar on the site of the old temple in dagon street on the night of the winter solstice when it also happens to be a full moon .            captain vimes .     said carrot  waving a hand in front of his eyes .  there was no response .      how much has he had .         two nips of whiskey  that   s all .         that shouldn   t do this to him  even on an empty stomach     said carrot .   angua pointed at the neck of a bottle protruding from vimes   s pocket .      i don   t think he   s been drinking on an empty stomach     she said .     i think he put some alcohol in it first .            oh  no     said sergeant colon .     he   s had a whole bottle .      angua picked out the bottle and looked at the label .      c .  m .  o .  t dibbler   s genuine authentic soggy mountain dew     she read .     he   s going to die .  it says     one hundred and fifty per cent proof    .         nah  that   s just old dibbler   s advertising     said nobby .     it ain   t got no proof .  just circumstantial evidence .            he only drinks when he gets depressed     said carrot .      why does he get depressed .         sometimes it   s because he hasn   t had a drink .            i appear     to be losing a lot of blood     said lord vetinari .      who would have thought you had it in you     said vimes  with the frankness of those probably about to die .        captain quirket said carrot .     but he   s     not a good choice .         mayonnaise quirke  we used to call him     said colon .     he   s a pillock .         don   t tell me     said angua .     he   s rich  thick and oily  yes .         and smells faintly of eggs     said carrot .     it   s generally very quiet in the unseen university library .  there   s perhaps the shuffling of feet as wizards wander between the shelves  the occasional hacking cough to disturb the academic silence  and every once in a while a dying scream as an unwary student fails to treat an old magical book with the caution it deserves .      carrot could lead armies  angua thought .  some people have inspired whole countries to great deeds because of the power of their vision .  and so could he .  not because he dreams about marching hordes  or world domination  or an empire of a thousand years .  just because he thinks that everyone   s really decent underneath and would get along just fine if only they made the effort  and he believes that so strongly it burns like a flame which is bigger than he is .  he   s got a dream and we   re all part of it  so that it shapes the world around him .  and the weird thing is that no one wants to disappoint him .  it   d be like kicking the biggest puppy in the universe .  it   s a kind of magic .         captain vimes always told me  sir  that there   s big crimes and little crimes .  sometimes the little crimes look big and the big crimes you can hardly see  but the crucial thing is to decide which is which .         foul ole ron was a beggars    guild member in good standing .  he was a mutterer  and a good one .  he would walk behind people muttering in his own private language until they gave him money not to .  people thought he was mad  but this was not  technically  the case .  it was just that he was in touch with reality on the cosmic level  and had a bit of trouble focusing on things smaller  like other people  walls and soap  although on very small things  such as coins  his eyesight was grade a  .        you can really talk .     said carrot .  gaspode rolled his eyes .         course not     he said .        who are you .     said the patrician .      corporal nobbs  sir .     said nobby  saluting .      do we employ you .         yessir .         ah .  you   re the dwarf  are you .         nosir .  that was the late cuddy  sir .  i   m one of the human beings  sir .      you   re not employed as the result of any     special hiring procedures .         nosir     said nobby  proudly .      my word .         the patrician steepled his fingers and looked at carrot over the top of them .  it was a mannerism that had unnerved many .       from the point of view of the species as a whole .  not from the point of view of the dragon now landing in small pieces around the landscape .       other children got given xylophones .  susan just had to ask her grandfather to take his vest off .   yes .  there   s a death in the family .   it   s hard to grow up normally when grandfather rides a white horse and wields a scythe   especially when you have to take over the family business  and everyone mistakes you for the tooth fairy .  and especially when you have to face the new and addictive music that has entered the discworld .   it   s lawless .  it changes people .   it   s called music with rocks in .   it   s got a beat and you can dance to it  but     it   s alive .   and it won   t fade away .   it was raining in the small  mountainous country of llamedos .  it was always raining in llamedos .  rain was the country   s main export .  it had rain mines .     people came to ankh morpork to seek their fortune .   unfortunately  other people sought it too .   lord vetinari had encouraged the growth of the guilds .  they were the big wheels on which the clockwork of a well regulated city ran .  a drop of oil here     a spoke inserted there  of course     and by and large it all worked .      it looked the kind of musical instrument emporium which doubles as a pawnshop  since every musician has at some time in his life to hand over his instrument if he wants to eat and sleep indoors .         we haven   t even practised together properly     said imp .      we   ll practise as we go along     said glod .     welcome to the world of professional musicianship .         the raven had grown up in the forever crumbling  ivy clad tower of art  overlooking unseen university in far ankh morpork      the wizard who thought he owned him called him quoth .      there is a type of girl who  while incapable of cleaning her bedroom even at knifepoint  will fight for the privilege of being allowed to spend the day shovelling manure in a stable .      quirm wasn   t a night town .  people who came to quirm looking for a good time went somewhere else .  quirm was so respectable that even dogs asked permission before going to the lavatory .         ride the horse .         where to .         that   s for me not to know and you to find out .         curry gardens  curry with vegetable          .   .   p  curry with meat              .   .    p  curry with named meat      .   .    p     albert was bent over the stove .     morning     he said .     you want fried bread with your sausages .      susan looked at the mess sizzling in the huge frying pan .  it wasn   t a sight to be seen on an empty stomach  although it could probably cause one .  albert could make an egg wish it had never been laid .      the mended drum had traditionally gone in for  well  traditional pub games  such as dominoes  darts and stabbing people in the back and taking all their money .         why   d you want to come here .     she said .      this is a battlefield  isn   t it .     said the raven patiently .     you   ve got to have ravens afterwards .     its freewheeling eyes swivelled in its head .     carrion regardless  as you might say .         death decides to join the klatchian foreign legion .  he arrives at one of their forts and knocks   is this the klatchian foreign legion .   the face of the little man on the other side of the door went blank .      ah     he said     you   ve got me there .  hang on a moment .     the hatch shut .  there was a whispered discussion on the other side of the door .  the hatch opened .      yes  it appears we are the  .   .  .  the     what was that again .  right  got it     the klatchian foreign legion .  yes .  what was it you were wanting .      i wish to join .      join .  join what .      the klatchian foreign legion .      where   s that .      there was some more whispering .      oh .  right .  sorry .  yes .  that   s us .      the doors swung open .  the visitor strode in .  a legionary with corporal   s stripes on his arm walked up to him .   you   ll have to report to        his eyes glazed a little         you know     big man  three stripes     on the tip of my tongue a moment ago         sergeant .      right     said the corporal  with relief .     what   s your name  soldier .      er     you don   t have to say  actually .  that   s what the     the         klatchian foreign legion .          what it   s all about .  people join to     to     with your mind  you know  when you can   t    things that happened         forget .      right .  i   m        the man   s face went blank .     wait a minute  would you .      he looked down at his sleeve .     corporal        he said .  he hesitated  looking worried .  then an idea struck him and he pulled at the collar of his vest and twisted his neck until he could squint  with considerable difficulty  at the label thus revealed .      corporal     medium .  does that sound right .      i don   t think so .      corporal     hand wash only .      probably not .      corporal     cotton .      it   s a possibility .      right .  well  welcome to the     er         klatchian foreign legion         right .  the pay is three dollars a week and all the sand you can eat .         the tradition of promotion in the university by filling dead men   s shoes  sometimes by firstly ensuring the death of the man in those shoes  had lately ceased .  this was largely because of ridcully himself  who was big and kept himself in trim and  as three late night aspirants to the archchancellorship had found  also had very good hearing .  they had been variously hung out of the window by their ankles  knocked unconscious with a shovel  and had their arm broken in two places .  besides  ridcully was known to sleep with two loaded crossbows by his bed .  he was a kind man and probably wouldn   t shoot you in both ears .      there was an ankh morpork legend about some old drum in the palace that was supposed to bang itself if an enemy fleet was seen sailing up the ankh .  the legend had died out in recent centuries  partly because this was the age of reason and also because no enemy fleet could sail up the ankh without a gang of men with shovels going in front .      unseen university was used to eccentricity among the faculty .  after all  humans derive their notions of what it means to be a normal human being by constant reference to the humans around them  and when those humans are other wizards the spiral can only wiggle downwards .  the librarian was an orang utan  and no one thought that was at all odd .  the reader in esoteric studies spent so much time reading in what the bursar referred to as    the smallest room    that he was generally referred to as the reader in the lavatory  even on official documents .     the bursar himself in any normal society would have been considered more unglued than a used stamp in a downpour .  the archchancellor  who regularly used the long gallery above the great hall for archery practice and had accidentally shot the bursar twice  thought the whole faculty was as crazy as loons  whatever a loon was .     not enough fresh air     he   d say .     too much sittin    around indoors .  rots the brain .     more often he   d say     duck .         leonard of quirm  skilled artist and certified genius with a mind that wandered so much it came back with souvenirs .   leonard   s books were full of sketches   of kittens  of the way water flows  of the wives of influential ankh morporkian merchants whose portraits had provided his means of making a living .  but leonard had been a genius and was deeply sensitive to the wonders of the world  so the margins were full of detailed doodles of whatever was on his mind at that moment   vast water powered engines for bringing down city walls on the heads of the enemy  new types of siege guns for pumping flaming oil over the enemy  gunpowder rockets that showered the enemy with burning phosphorus  and other manufactures of the age of reason .         proper footwear for a wizard is pointy shoes or good stout boots     said ridcully .     when one   s footwear turns creepy  something   s amiss .         it   s cr  pe     said the dean .     it   s got a little pointy thingy over the        ridcully breathed heavily .     when your boots change by themselves       he growled .      there   s magic afoot .         susan     it wasn   t a good name  was it .  it wasn   t a truly bad name  it wasn   t like poor iodine in the fourth form  or nigella  a name which means    oops  we wanted a boy    .  but it was dull .  susan .  sue .  good old sue .  it was a name that made sandwiches  kept its head in difficult circumstances and could reliably look after other people   s children .   it was a name used by no queens or goddesses anywhere .   and you couldn   t do much even with the spelling .  you could turn it into suzi  and it sounded as though you danced on tables for a living .  you could put in a z and a couple of ns and an e  but it still looked like a name with extensions built on .  it was as bad as sara  a name that cried out for a prosthetic h .     dwarfs respected learning  provided they didn   t have to experience it .     the patrician leaned back in an attitude that suggested attentive listening .  he was extremely good at listening .  he created a kind of mental suction .  people told him things just to avoid the silence .         mumblemumblemumble     said the dean defiantly  a rebel without a pause .      chrysoprase had been a very quick learner when he arrived in ankh morpork .  he began with an important lesson  hitting people was thuggery .  paying other people to do the hitting on your behalf was good business .      there is something very sad about an empty dressing room .  it   s like a discarded pair of underpants  which it resembles in a number of respects .  it   s seen a lot of activity .  it may even have witnessed excitement and a whole gamut of human passions .  and now there   s nothing much left but a faint smell .      foul ole ron was a physical schizophrenic .  there was foul ole ron  and there was the smell of foul ole ron  which had obviously developed over the years to such an extent that it had a distinct personality .  anyone could have a smell that lingered long after they   d gone somewhere else  but the smell of foul ole ron could actually arrive somewhere several minutes before he did  in order to spread out and get comfortable before he arrived .  it had evolved into something so striking that it was no longer perceived with the nose  which shut down instantly in self defence  people could tell that foul ole ron was approaching by the way their ear wax started to melt .         ah  drumknott     said lord vetinari     just go and tell the head of the musicians    guild he wants a word with me  will you .         glod the dwarf looked up at a blank wall .      i knew it .     he said .     didn   t i say .  magic .  how many times have we heard this story .  there   s a mysterious shop no one   s ever seen before  and someone goes in and buys some rusty old curio  and it turns out to           glod              be some kind of talisman or a bottle full of genie  and then when there   s trouble they go back and the shop           glod    .            has mysteriously disappeared and gone back to whatever dimension it came from    yes  what is it .         you   re on the wrong side of the road .  it   s over here .         senior wizards developed a distinctive       waist        leg shape that suggested someone who sat on a wall and required royal assistance to be put together again .      the patrician was a pragmatist .  he never tried to fix things that worked .  things that didn   t work  however  got broken .      the question seldom addressed is where medusa had snakes .  underarm hair is an even more embarrassing problem when it keeps biting the top of the deodorant bottle .      according to rural legend   at least in those areas where pigs are a vital part of the household economy   the hogfather is a winter myth figure who  on hogswatchnight  gallops from house to house on a crude sledge drawn by four tusked wild boars to deliver presents of sausages  black puddings  pork scratchings and ham to all children who have been good .  he says    ho ho ho    a lot .  children who have been bad get a bag full of bloody bones  it   s these little details which tell you it   s a tale for the little folk  .  there is a song about him .  it begins  you   d better watch out .  .   .   the hogfather is said to have originated in the legend of a local king who  one winter   s night  happened to be passing  or so he said  the home of three young women and heard them sobbing because they had no food to celebrate the midwinter feast .  he took pity on them and threw a packet of sausages through the window .         rats had featured largely in the history of ankh morpork .  shortly before the patrician came to power there was a terrible plague of rats .  the city council countered it by offering twenty pence for every rat tail .  this did  for a week or two  reduce the number of rats   and then people were suddenly queuing up with tails  the city treasury was being drained  and no one seemed to be doing much work .  and there still seemed to be a lot of rats around .  lord vetinari had listened carefully while the problem was explained  and had solved the thing with one memorable phrase which said a lot about him  about the folly of bounty offers  and about the natural instinct of ankh morporkians in any situation involving money     tax the rat farms .        old shoes always turn up in the bottom of every wardrobe .   if a mermaid had a wardrobe old shoes would turn up in the bottom of it .           the reader had a theory that all the really good books in any building   at least  all the really funny ones   gravitate to a pile in the privy but no one ever has time to read all of them  or even knows how they came to be there .  x the ones with cartoons about cows and dogs .  and captions like     as soon as he saw the duck  elmer knew it was going to be a bad day .          badly concussing one of them  but there   s no point in spoiling a good legend .       mighty battles .  revolution .  death .  war .   and his sons terror and panic  and daughter glancy  .   the oldest and most inscrutable empire on the discworld is in turmoil  brought about by the revolutionary treatise what i did on my holidays .  workers are uniting  with nothing to lose but their water buffaloes .  war  and clancy  are spreading throughout the ancient cities .   and all that stands in the way of terrible doom for everyone is   rincewind the wizzard  who can   t even spell the word    wizard        cohen the barbarian hero  five foot tall in his surgical sandals  who has a lifetime   s experience of not dying         and a very special butterfly .   it was  as always  a matter of protocol      lord vetinari  as supreme ruler of ankh morpork  could in theory summon the archchancellor of unseen university to his presence and  indeed  have him executed if he failed to obey .   on the other hand mustrum ridcully  as head of the college of wizards  had made it clear in polite but firm ways that he could turn him into a small amphibian and  indeed  start jumping around the room on a pogo stick .   alcohol bridged the diplomatic gap nicely .  sometimes lord vetinari invited the archchancellor to the palace for a convivial drink .  and of course the archchancellor went  because it would be bad manners not to .  and everyone understood the position  and everyone was on their best behaviour  and thus civil unrest and slime on the carpet were averted .      many things went on at unseen university and  regrettably  teaching had to be one of them .  the faculty had long ago confronted this fact and had perfected various devices for avoiding it .  but this was perfectly all right because  to be fair  so had the students .   the system worked quite well and  as happens in such cases  had taken on the status of a tradition .  lectures clearly took place  because they were down there on the timetable in black and white .  the fact that no one attended was an irrelevant detail .  it was occasionally maintained that this meant that the lectures did not in fact happen at all  but no one ever attended them to find out if this was true .  anyway  it was argued that lectures had taken place in essence  so that was all right  too .   and therefore education at the university mostly worked by the age old method of putting a lot of young people in the vicinity of a lot of books and hoping that something would pass from one to the other  while the actual young people put themselves in the vicinity of inns and taverns for exactly the same reason .         round everyone up .  my study .  ten minutes     said ridcully .  he was a great believer in this approach .  a less direct archchancellor would have wandered around looking for everyone .  his policy was to find one person and make their life difficult until everything happened the way he wanted it to .         oh  no     said the lecturer in recent runes  pushing his chair back .     not that .  that   s meddling with things you don   t understand .         well we are wizards     said ridcully .     we   re supposed to meddle with things we don   t understand .  if we hung around waitin    till we understood things we   d never get anything done .         lord hong had risen to the leadership of one of the most influential families in the empire by relentless application  total focusing of his mental powers  and six well executed deaths .  the last one had been that of his father  who   d died happy in the knowledge that his son was maintaining an old family tradition .  the senior families venerated their ancestors  and saw no harm in prematurely adding to their number .         comrades  we must strike at the very heart of the rottenness .  we must storm the winter palace .        excuse me  but it is june .        then we can storm the summer palace .         lord hong was playing chess  against himself .  it was the only way he could find an opponent of his calibre but  currently  things were stalemated because both sides were adopting a defensive strategy which was  admittedly  brilliant .      there was this to be said about cohen .  if there was no reason for him to kill you  such as you having any large amount of treasure or being between him and somewhere he wanted to get to  then he was good company .         you know their big dish down on the coast .      said cohen .       no .         pig   s ear soup .  now  what   s that tell you about a place  eh .      rincewind shrugged .     very provident people .         some other bugger pinches the pig     there   s men here who can push a wheelbarrow for thirty miles on a bowl of millet with a bit of scum in it .  what does that tell you .  it tells me someone   s porking all the beef     self doubt was not something regularly entertained within the cohen cranium .  when you   re trying to carry a struggling temple maiden and a sack of looted temple goods in one hand and fight off half a dozen angry priests with the other there is little time for reflection .  natural selection saw to it that professional heroes who at a crucial moment tended to ask themselves questions like    what is my purpose in life .     very quickly lacked both .      cohen   s father had taken him to a mountain top  when he was no more than a lad  and explained to him the hero   s creed and told him that there was no greater joy than to die in battle .   cohen had seen the flaw in this straight away  and a lifetime   s experience had reinforced his belief that in fact a greater joy was to kill the other bugger in battle and end up sitting on a heap of gold higher than your horse .         we are a travelling theatre     she said .     it is convenient .  noh actors are allowed to move around .         aren   t they .     said rincewind .      you do not understand .  we are noh actors .         oh  you weren   t too bad .         merchants always had money .  but it seemed wrong to think of it as belonging to them  it belonged to whoever took it off them .  merchants didn   t actually own it  they were just looking after it until it was needed .      the silver horde were honest  from their specialized point of view  and decent  from their specialized point of view  and saw the world as hugely simple .  they stole from rich merchants and temples and kings .  they didn   t steal from poor people  this was not because there was anything virtuous about poor people  it was simply because poor people had no money .   and although they didn   t set out to give the money away to the poor  that was nevertheless what they did  if you accepted that the poor consisted of innkeepers  ladies of negotiable virtue  pickpockets  gamblers and general hangers on   because although they would go to great lengths to steal money they then had as much control over it as a man trying to herd cats .  it was there to be spent and lost .  so they kept the money in circulation  always a praiseworthy thing in any society .      eventually an officious voice said     what do you have to say for yourself  miserable louse .         well  i           silence .      ah .  so it was going to be that kind of interview .      six beneficent winds had the same sense of humour as a chicken casserole .  true  he played the accordion for amusement  and disliked cats intensely  and had a habit of dabbing his upper lip with his napkin after his tea ceremony in a way that had made mrs beneficent winds commit murder in her mind on a regular basis over the years .  and he kept his money in a small leather shovel purse  and counted it out very thoroughly whenever he made a purchase  especially if there was a queue behind him .      rincewind and twoflower lay in their separate cells and talked about the good old days .  at least  twoflower talked about the good old days .  rincewind worked at a crack in the stone with a piece of straw  it being all he had to hand .  it would take several thousand years to make any kind of impression  but that was no reason to give up      a little piece of mortar fell away .  not bad for ten minutes    work  thought rincewind .  come the next ice age  we   re out of here            but there are causes worth dying for     said butterfly .      no  there aren   t .  because you   ve only got one life but you can pick up another five causes on any street corner .         good grief  how can you live with a philosophy like that .      rincewind took a deep breath .      continuously .           luck is my middle name     said rincewind  indistinctly .     mind you  my first name is bad .        it was something about cohen .  maybe it was what they called charisma .  it overpowered even his normal smell of a goat that had just eaten curried asparagus .      there was muttering from the horde .      bruce the hoon never went in the back way        shut up .         never one for back gates  bruce the hoon .         shut up .         when bruce the hoon attacked al khali  he did it right at the main guard tower  with a thousand screaming men on very small horses .         yeah  but    last i saw of bruce the hoon  his head was on a spike .         all right  i   ll grant you that .  but at least it was over the main gate .  i mean  at least he got in .         his head did .            who   re you .     said cohen .  he drew his sword .     i need to know so   s it can be put on your gravestone              they want to parley    said six beneficent winds .      why don   t we just invite them to dinner and massacre them all when they   re drunk .         you heard the man .  there   s seven hundred thousand of them .         ah .  so it   d have to be something simple with pasta  then .         the four horsemen whose ride presages the end of the world are known to be death  war  famine and pestilence .  but even less significant events have their own horsemen .  for example  the four horsemen of the common cold are sniffles  chesty  nostril and lack of tissues  the four horsemen whose appearance foreshadows any public holiday are storm  gales  sleet and contra flow .      lord hong looked at himself in the mirror .   he   d gone to great lengths to achieve this .  he had used several agents  none of whom knew the whole plan .  but the ankh morpork tailor had been good at his work and the measurements had been followed exactly .  from pointy boots to hose to doublet  cloak and hat with a feather in it  lord hong knew he was a perfect ankh morpork gentleman .  the cloak was lined with silk .   he   d walk through the city on that first great day and the people would be silent when they saw their natural leader .   it never crossed his mind that anyone would say         ere  wot a toff .     eave    arf a brick at    im .            you sound a very educated man for a barbarian     said rincewind .      i didn   t start out a barbarian .  i used to be a school teacher .  but i decided to give it up and make a living by the sword .         after being a teacher all your life .         it did mean a change of perspective  yes .         but     well     surely     the privation  the terrible hazards  the daily risk of death         mr saveloy brightened up .     oh  you   ve been a teacher  have you .            there   s a lot of waiting in warfare     said boy willie .      ah  yes     said mr saveloy .     i   ve heard people say that .  they say there   s long periods of boredom followed by short periods of excitement .         not really    said cohen .     it   s more like short periods of waiting followed by long periods of being dead .         there were a large number of ranks in the armies of the empire  and many of them were untranslatable .  three pink pig and five white fang were  loosely speaking  privates  and not just because they were pale  vulnerable and inclined to curl up and hide when danger threatened .      pushing their way angrily through the soldiers came an altogether different breed of warrior .  they were taller  and heavier armoured  with splendid helmets and moustaches that looked like a declaration of war in themselves .      wassat .     said cohen .      he   s a samurai     said mr saveloy .   one samurai glared at cohen .  he pulled a scrap of silk out of his armour and tossed it into the air .  his other hand grabbed the hilt of his long  thin sword      there was hardly even a hiss  but three shreds of silk tumbled gently to the ground .      get back  teach     said cohen slowly .     i reckon this one   s mine .  got another hanky .  thanks .      the samurai looked at cohen   s sword .  it was long  heavy and had so many notches it could have been used as a saw .      you   ll never do it     he said .     with that sword .  never .      cohen blew his nose noisily .      you say .     he said .     watch this .      the handkerchief soared into the air .  cohen gripped his sword      he   d beheaded three upward staring samurai before the handkerchief started to tumble .      and the message is     said cohen     either fight or muck about  it   s up to you .         golem     they were usually just figures made out of clay and animated with some suitable spell or prayer .  they pottered about doing simple odd jobs .  the problem was not putting them to work but stopping them from working  if you set a golem to digging the garden and then forgot about it  you   d come back to find it   d planted a row of beans      miles long .     woolly thinking .  which is like fuzzy logic  only less so .       the opera house  ankb morpork         a huge  rambling building  where masked figures and hooded shadows do wicked deeds in the wings    where dying the death on stage is a little bit more than just a metaphor    where innocent young sopranos are lured to their destiny by an evil mastermind in a hideously deformed evening dress     where         there   s a couple of old ladies in pointy hats eating peanuts in the gods and looking tip at the big chandelier and saying things like     there   s an accident waiting to happen if ever i saw one .      yes     granny weatherwax and nanny ogg  the discworld   s greatest witches  are back for an innocent night out at the opera .   so there   s going to be trouble  but nevertheless a good evening   s entertainment with murders you can really hum       black aliss  pushed into her own stove by a couple of kids  and everyone said it was a damn    good thing  even if it took a whole week to clean the oven .   they said weapons couldn   t pierce her .  swords bounced off her skin .  and she turned people into gingerbread and had a house made of frogs .      she stopped .  at least  most of agnes stopped .  there was a lot of agnes .  it took some time for outlying regions to come to rest .      agnes had woken up one morning with the horrible realization that she   d been saddled with a lovely personality .  it was the lack of choice that rankled .  no one had asked her  before she was born  whether she wanted a lovely personality or whether she   d prefer  say  a miserable personality but a body that could take size   in dresses .  instead  people would take pains to tell her that beauty was only skin deep  as if a man ever fell for an attractive pair of kidneys .      people were generally glad to see nanny ogg .  she was good at making them feel at home in their own home .      lancre had always bred strong  capable women .  a lancre farmer needed a wife who   d think nothing of beating a wolf to death with her apron when she went out to get some firewood .  and  while kissing initially seemed to have more charms than cookery  a stolid lancre lad looking for a bride would bear in mind his father   s advice that kisses eventually lost their fire but cookery tended to get even better over the years  and direct his courting to those families that clearly showed a tradition of enjoying their food .      granny is always there for the difficult times .      maybe you could     help us .         what   s wrong .         it   s my boy         granny opened the door further and saw the woman standing behind mr slot .  one look at her face was enough .  there was a bundle in her arms .   granny stepped back .     bring him in and let me have a look at him .      she took the baby from the woman  sat down on the room   s one chair  and pulled back the blanket .      hmm     said granny  after a while .      there   s a curse on this house  that   s what it is     said slot .     my best cow   s been taken mortally sick  too .         oh .  you have a cowshed .     said granny .     very good place for a sickroom  a cowshed .  it   s the warmth .  you better show me where it is .      you want to take the boy down there .         right now .      the man looked at his wife  and shrugged .     well  i   m sure you know your business best     he said .     it   s this way     he led the witches down some back stairs and across a yard and into the fetid sweet air of the byre .  a cow was stretched out on the straw .  it rolled an eye madly as they entered  and tried to moo .   granny took in the scene and stood looking thoughtful for a moment .   then she said     this will do .         what do you need .     said slot .      all i shall require is a candle     said granny .     a new one  for preference .         that   s all .         and some matches     said granny .  a pack of cards might be useful  too .      the child was brought down in a blanket and made as comfortable as possible .      you just leave me in here tonight .  and no one is to come in  right .  no matter what .      the mother gave a worried curtsey .     but i thought i might look in about midn           no one .  now  off you go .      granny closed the door .   she spent some time arranging boxes and barrels so that she had a crude table and something to sit on .  the air was warm and smelled of bovine flatulence .  periodically she checked the health of both patients  although there was little enough to check .   she waited a little longer and then lit the candle .  its cheery flame gave the place a warm and comforting glow .   after some immeasurable piece of time the flame flickered .  it would have passed unnoticed by anyone who hadn   t been concentrating on it for some while .   she took a deep breath and        good morning     said granny weatherwax .   good morning  said a voice by her ear .   granny breathed out  slowly .      come and sit where i can see you .  that   s good manners .  and let me tell you right now that i ain   t at all afraid of you .      the tall  black robed figure walked across the floor and sat down on a handy barrel  leaning its scythe against the wall .  then it pushed back its hood .  granny folded her arms and stared calmly at the visitor  meeting his gaze eye to socket .   death leaned forward .  the candlelight raised new shadows on his skull .   courage is easy by candlelight .  your faith  i suspect  is in the flame .   granny leaned forward  and blew out the candle .  then she folded her arms again and stared fiercely ahead of her .   after some length of time a voice said  all right  you   ve made your point .   granny lit a match .  its flare illuminated the skull opposite  which hadn   t moved .      fair enough     she said  as she relit the candle .     we don   t want to be sitting here all night  do we .  how many have you come for .      one .      the cow .      death shook his head .      it could be the cow .      no .  that would be changing history .      history is about things changing .      no .   granny sat back .      then i challenge you to a game .  that   s traditional .  that   s allowed .      death was silent for a moment .   this is true .      good .      however     you understand that to win all you must gamble all .      double or quits .  yes  i know .      but not chess .      can   t abide chess .      or cripple mr onion .  i   ve never been able to understand the rules .      very well .  how about one hand of poker .  five cards each  no draws .  sudden death  as they say     death thought about this  too .   you know this family .   no .   then why .      are we talking or are we playing .      oh  very well .   granny picked up the pack of cards and shuffled it  not looking at her hands  and smiling at death all the time .  she dealt five cards each .   granny looked at her cards  and threw them down .   four queens .  hmm .  that is very high .   death looked down at his cards  and then up into granny   s steady  blue eyed gaze .   neither moved for some time .   then death laid the hand on the table .   i lose  he said .  all i have is four ones .   he looked back into granny   s eyes for a moment .  there was a blue glow in the depth of his eye sockets .  maybe  for the merest fraction of a second  barely noticeable even to the closest observation  one winked off .   granny nodded  and extended a hand .   she prided herself on the ability to judge people by their gaze and their handshake  which in this case was a rather chilly one .      take the cow     she said .   it is a valuable creature .      who knows what the child will become .      death stood up  and reached for his scythe .   he said  ow .      ah  yes .  i couldn   t help noticing     said granny weatherwax  as the tension drained out of the atmosphere     that you seem to be sparing that arm .      oh  you know how it is .  repetitive actions and so on         it could get serious if you left it .      how serious .      want me to have a look .      would you mind .  it certainly aches on cold nights .   granny   s hands touched smooth bone .  she felt  thought  gripped  twisted      there was a click .   ow .      now try it above the shoulder .      er .  hmm .  yes .  it does seem considerably more free .  yes  indeed .  my word  yes .  thank you very much .   death walked away .  a moment later there was a faint gasp from the cow .  that and a slight sagging of the skin were all that apparently marked the transition from living animal to cooling meat .   granny picked up the baby and laid a hand on its forehead .      fever   s gone     she said .   mistress weatherwax .  said death from the doorway .      yes  sir .      i have to know .  what would have happened if i had not     lost .      at the cards  you mean .      yes .  what would you have done .   granny laid the baby down carefully on the straw  and smiled .      well     she said     for a start     i   d have broken your bloody arm .            so you   ll go and see mr goatberger and have this stopped  right .      yes  esme .         and i   ll come with you to make sure you do .      yes  esme .         and we   ll talk to the man about your money        yes  esme .         and we might just drop in on young agnes to make sure she   s all right .         yes  esme .         but we   ll do it diplomatic like .  we don   t want people thinkin    we   re pokin    our noses in .         yes  esme .         no one could say i interfere where i   m not wanted .  you won   t find anyone callin    me a busybody     yes  esme .         that was     yes  esme  you won   t find anyone callin    you a busybody     was it .         oh  yes  esme .      you sure about that .      yes  esme .         good .           it   s too draughty on broomsticks this time of year  esme .  the breeze gets into places i wouldn   t dream of talking about .         really .  can   t imagine where those   d be  then .        she looked around with a wide  friendly grin at the occupants of the coach .      morning     she said  delving into the sack .     i   m gytha ogg  i   ve got fifteen children  this is my friend esme weatherwax  we   re going to ankh morpork  would anyone like an egg sandwich .  i   ve brung plenty .  the cat   s been sleepin    on them but they   re fine  look  they bend back all right .  no .  please yourself  i   m sure .  let   s see what else we   ve got     ah  has anybody got an opener for a bottle of beer .      a man in the corner indicated that he might have such a thing .      fine     said nanny ogg .     anyone got something to drink a bottle of beer out of .      another man nodded hopefully .      good     said nanny ogg .     now  has anybody got a bottle of beer .        ahahahahaha .  ahahahaha .  aahahaha .  beware .  .  .  .  .  yrs sincerely  the opera ghost     what sort of person     said salzella     sits down and writes a maniacal laugh .  and all those exclamation marks  you notice .  five .  a sure sign of someone who wears his underpants on his head .  opera can do that to a man .        most people in lancre  as the saying goes  went to bed with the chickens and got up with the cows .            i grew up in rookery yard in the shades .  they   re in ankh morpork     said henry .     it was a terrible rough place .  there were only three ways out .  you could sing your way out or you could fight your way out .         what was the third way .     said nanny .      oh  you could go down that little alleyway into shamlegger street and then cut down into treacle mine road     said henry .     but no one ever amounted to anything who went that way        you     you do know what kind of place this is  do you  esme .     said nanny ogg .      oh  yes     said granny  calmly .   nanny   s patience gave out .     it   s a house of ill repute  is what it is .         on the contrary    said granny .     i believe people speak very highly of it .            i   m mrs ogg     said nanny ogg .   the man looked her up and down .      oh yes .  can you identify yourself .         certainly i   d know me anywhere .            honestly  salzella  .  .   .  what is the difference between opera and madness .         is this a trick question .         the opera house was that most efficiently multifunctional of building designs .  it was a cube .  but the architect had suddenly realized late in the day that there ought to be some sort of decoration  and had shoved it on hurriedly  in a riot of friezes  pillars  corybants and curly bits .  gargoyles had colonized the higher reaches .  the effect  seen from the front  was of a huge wall of tortured stone .   round the back  of course  there was the usual drab mess of windows  pipes and damp stone walls .  one of the rules of a certain type of public architecture is that it only happens at the front .         well  basically there are two sorts of opera     said nanny  who also had the true witch   s ability to be confidently expert on the basis of no experience whatsoever .     there   s your heavy opera  where basically people sing foreign and it goes like    oh oh oh  i am dyin     oh  i am dyin     oh  oh  oh  that   s what i   m doin        and there   s your light opera  where they sing in foreign and it basically goes    beer .  beer .  beer .  beer .  i like to drink lots of beer .      although sometimes they drink champagne instead .  that   s basically all of opera  reely        someone tapped granny weatherwax on her shoulder .     madam  kindly remove your hat .      nanny ogg choked on her peppermint .   granny weatherwax turned to the red faced gentleman behind her .     you do know what a woman in a pointy hat is  don   t you .     she said .      yes  madam .  a woman in a pointy hat is sitting in front of me .         people didn   t take any notice of little old ladies who looked as though they fitted in  and nanny ogg could fit in faster than a dead chicken in a maggot factory .     nanny had a mind like a buzzsaw behind a face like an elderly apple .     this was ankh morpork   s most prestigious dress shop  and one way of telling was the apparent absence of anything so crass as merchandise .  the occasional carefully placed piece of expensive material merely hinted at the possibilities available .   this was not a shop where things were bought .  this was an emporium where you had a cup of coffee and a chat .  possibly  as a result of that muted conversation  four or five yards of exquisite fabric would change ownership in some ethereal way  and yet nothing so crass as trade would have taken place .     there was a crash from the direction of the kitchen   although it was really more of a crashendo   the long drawn out clatter that begins when a pile of plates begins to slip  continues when someone tries to grab at them  develops a desperate counter theme when the person realizes they don   t have three hands  and ends with the roinroin roin of the one miraculously intact plate spinning round and round on the floor .        everyone acts as if it   s only the music that matters .  the plots don   t make sense .  half the stories rely on people not recognizing their servants or wives because they   ve got a tiny mask on .  large ladies play the part of consumptive girls .  no one can act properly .  there should be a sign on the door saying    leave your common sense here    .  if it wasn   t for the music the whole thing would be ridiculous .            madam has marvellous hair     said the hairdresser .     what is the secret .         you   ve got to make sure there   s no newts in the water     said granny .      the hulking figure seated at the organ turned around and gave her a friendly grin  which was much wider than the average grin .  its owner was covered in red hair and  while shortchanged in the leg department  had obviously been first in the queue when the arm counter opened .  and had also been given a special free offer of lip .      nanny didn   t so much enter places as insinuate herself  she had unconsciously taken a natural talent for liking people and developed it into an occult science .         and what can i get you  officers .     she said .      officers .  us .  what makes you think we   re watchmen .         he   s got a helmet on     nanny pointed out .      milit   ry chic     nobby said .     it   s just a fashion accessory .  actually  we are gentlemen of means and have nothing to do with the city watch whatsoever .         well  gentlemen  would you like some wine .         not while we on duty  t   anks     said the troll .      granny weatherwax could be nasty  but then nastiness was always in the window  you were aware that it might turn up on the menu .  sharpness from nanny ogg  though  was like being bitten by a big friendly dog .  it was all the worse for being unexpected .      what about the show .  we can   t just stop .  you never stop the show  not even if someone dies .         oh  we have stopped when people died            yes  but only as long as it took to get the body off stage .            corporal nobbs has got some papers to prove he   s a human being .         forged .         i don   t think so .          er .  that is to say  they went to bed at the same time as the chickens went to bed  and got up at the same time as the cows got up .  loosely worded sayings can really cause misunderstandings .       here   s a werewolf with pre lunar tension in ankfe morpork .  and a dwarf with attitude and a golem who   s begun to think for itself .   but for commander vimes  head of ankh morpork city watch  that   s only the start     there   s treason in the air .   a crime has happened .   he   s not only got to find out whodunit  but howdunit too .  he   s not even sure what they dum .   but as soon as he knows what the questions are  he   s going to want some answers .      your sedan chair is outside  sir .      it had been a wedding present from the patrician .  lord vetinari knew that vimes loved walking the streets of the city  and so it was very typical of the man that he presented him with something that did not allow him to do so .   it was waiting outside .  the two bearers straightened up expectantly .   vimes looked at the front man and motioned with a thumb to the chair   s door .     get in     he commanded .      but sir           it   s a nice morning     said vimes  taking off his coat .     i   ll drive myself     through werewolf eyes the world was different .   for one thing  it was in black and white .  at least  that small part of it which as a human she   d thought of as    vision    was monochrome   but who cared that vision had to take a back seat when smell drove instead  laughing and sticking its arm out of the window and making rude gestures at all the other senses .      she kept telling herself she had it under control and she did  in a way .  she prowled the city on moonlit nights and  okay  there was the occasional chicken  but she always remembered where she   d been and went round next day to shove some money under the door .   it was hard to be a vegetarian who had to pick bits of meat out of her teeth in the morning .   it was easy to be a vegetarian by day .  it was preventing yourself from becoming a humanitarian at night that took the real effort .      vimes has some problems with his imp driven personal organizer      memo  see corporal nobbs re timekeeping  also re earldom .         got it     said the imp .     would you like to be reminded of this at any particular time .         i think i   ll write it in my notebook  if you don   t mind     said vimes .      oh  well  if you prefer  i can recognize handwriting     said the imp proudly .     i   m quite advanced .      vimes pulled out his notebook and held it up .     like this .     he said .   the imp squinted for a moment .     yep     it said .     that   s handwriting  sure enough .  curly bits  spiky bits  all joined together .  yep .  handwriting .  i   d recognize it anywhere .         mr raddley drew himself up .      we want to take father tubelcek away to bury him     he said .   detritus turned to cheery littlebottom .     you done everyt   ing you need .         i suppose so            he dead .         oh  yes .         he gonna get any better .         better than dead .  i doubt it .         okay den you people can take him away       the patrician is taken unwell and receives a visit from horse doctor doughnut jimmy .      commander vimes is right .  it could be arsenic     cheery said .     it looks like arsenic poisoning to me .  look at his colour .         nasty stuff     said doughnut jimmy .     has he been eating his bedding .         all the sheets seem to be here  so i suppose the answer is no .         how   s he pissing .         er .  the usual way  i assume .         walk him round a bit on the loose rein     doughnut said .   the patrician opened his eyes .     you are a doctor  aren   t you .     he said .      well  yeah     i have a lot of patients     he said .      indeed .  i have very little     said the patrician .        do you remember your father  nobby .         old sconner  sir .  not much  sir .  never used to see him much except when the milit   ry police used to come for to drag him outa the attic     vimes waved a hand vaguely .     he didn   t     leave you anything .  or anything .         coupla scars  sir .  and this trick elbow of mine .  it aches sometimes  when the weather changes .  and this  o    course        the corporal pulled out a leather thong that hung around his neck .  there was a gold ring on it .      he left it to me when he was on his deathbed     said nobby .     well  when i say    left it               did he say anything .         well  yeah  he did say    give it back  you little bugger .      sir .         cheery is new to the watch and has gone out on an official visit with angua .      you can knock .         me .  they won   t take any notice of me .     said cheery .   you show them your badge and tell them you   re the watch .         they   ll ignore me .  they   ll laugh at me .         you   re going to have to do it sooner or later .  go on .      the door was opened by a stout man     a dwarf voice in the region of his navel said     we   re the watch  right .  oh  yes .  and if you don   t let us in we   ll have your guts for starters .         good try    murmured angua .         i   ve got a lot to learn  i can see     said cheery .     i never thought you had to  carry bits of blanket  for a start .         it   s special equipment if you   re dealing with the undead .         well  i knew about garlic and vampires .  anything holy works on vampires .  what else works on werewolves .         a gin and tonic   s always welcome     said angua distantly .      the tincture of night began to suffuse the soup of the afternoon .   lord vetinari considered the sentence  and found it good .  he liked    tincture    particularly .  tincture .  tincture .  it was a distinguished word  and pleasantly countered by the flatness of    soup    .  the soup of the afternoon .  yes .  in which may well be found the croutons of teatime .         i have to admit     said mrs palm     that under vetinari it has certainly been safer to walk the streets           you should know  madam     said mr sock .  mrs palm gave him an icy look .  there were a few sniggers .      i meant that a modest payment to the thieves    guild is all that is required for perfect safety    she finished .      and  indeed  a man may visit a house of ill           negotiable hospitality    said mrs palm quickly .      indeed  and be quite confident of not waking up stripped stark naked and beaten black and blue     said sock .      unless his tastes run that way    said mrs palm .     we aim to give satisfaction .  very accurately  if required .         life has certainly been more reliable under vetinari     said mr potts of the bakers    guild .      he does have all street theatre players and mime artists thrown into the scorpion pit     said mr boggis of the thieves    guild .      true .  but let   s not forget that he has his bad points too .           what   s this .         a klatchian hots without anchovies     said vimes  lifting the cover .     we got it from ron   s pizza hovel round the corner .         has someone already eaten this  vimes .         no  sir .  that   s just how they chop up the food .         oh  i see .  i thought perhaps the food tasters were getting over enthusiastic     said the patrician .     my word .  what a treat i have to look forward to .           i think he   s got a sort of soft spot for the patrician  in his way .  he once said that if anyone was going to kill vetinari he   d like it to be him .            i   ve been running around looking for damn clues instead of just thinking for five minutes .     said vimes .     what is it i   m always telling you .         never trust anybody  sir .         no  not that .         everyone   s guilty of something  sir .         not that  either .         just because someone   s a member of an ethnic minority doesn   t mean they   re not a nasty small minded little jerk  sir .         n    when did i say that .         last week  sir .  after we   d had that visit from the campaign for equal heights  sir .         angua thinks carrot is about to propose .      hello  angua .     said carrot cheerfully .     i was just coming to see you .      he took off his helmet  and smoothed back his hair .     er        he began .      i know what you   re going to ask     said angua .      you do .         i know you   ve been thinking about it .  you knew i was wondering about going .         it was obvious  was it .         and the answer   s no .  i wish it could be yes .      carrot looked astonished .     it never occurred to me that you   d say no     he said .     i mean  why should you .         good grief  you amaze me     she said .     you really do .         i thought it   d be something you   d want to do     said carrot .  he sighed .     oh  well    it doesn   t matter  really     angua felt that a leg had been kicked away .     it doesn   t matter .     she said .      i mean  yes  it   d have been nice  but i won   t lose any sleep over it .      you won   t .         well  no .  obviously not .  you   ve got other things you want to do .  that   s fine .  i just thought you might enjoy it .  i   ll do it by myself     what .  how can    .     angua stopped .     what are you talking about  carrot .         the dwarf bread museum .  i promised mr hopkinson   s sister that i   d tidy it up .  i just thought it might cheer you up  but i appreciate that bread isn   t everyone   s cup of tea .        detritus was particularly good when it came to asking questions .  he had three basic ones .  they were the direct     did you do it .       the persistent     are you sure it wasn   t you what done it .      and the subtle     it was you what done it  wasn   t it .      .  although they were not the most cunning questions ever devised  detritus   s talent was to go on patiently asking them for hours on end  until he got the right answer  which was generally something like  yes .  yes .  i did it .  i did it .   now please tell me what it was i did .        it is a pervasive and beguiling myth that the people who design instruments of death end up being killed by them .  there is almost no foundation in fact .  colonel shrapnel wasn   t blown up  m .  guillotin died with his head on  colonel gatling wasn   t shot .  if it hadn   t been for the murder of cosh and blackjack maker sir william blunt instrument in an alleyway  the rumour would never have got started .     the ankh morpork view of crime and punishment  was that the penalty for the first offence should prevent the possibility of a second offence .       it   s the night before hogswatch .  and it   s too quiet .   where is the big jolly fat man .  why is death creeping down chimneys and trying to say ho ho ho .  the darkest night of the year is getting a lot darker     susan the gothic governess has got to sort it out by morning  otherwise there won   t be a morning .  ever again     the   th discworld novel is a festive feast of darkness and death  but with jolly robins and tinsel too  .   as they say  you   d better watch out     everything starts somewhere  although many physicists disagree .      the senior wizards of unseen university stood and looked at the door .   there was no doubt that whoever had shut it wanted it to stay shut .  dozens of nails secured it to the door frame .  planks had been nailed right across .  and finally it had  up until this morning  been hidden by a bookcase that had been put in front of it .      and there   s the sign  ridcully    said the dean .     you have read it  i assume .  you know .  the sign which says    do not  under any circumstances  open this door    .         of course i   ve read it     said ridcully .     why d   yer think i want it opened .         lord downey was an assassin .  or  rather  an assassin .  the capital letter was important .  it separated those curs who went around murdering people for money from the gentlemen who were occasionally consulted by other gentlemen who wished to have removed  for a consideration  any inconvenient razorblades from the candyfloss of life .      the members of the guild of assassins considered themselves cultured men who enjoyed good music and food and literature .  and they knew the value of human life .  to a penny  in many cases .      it was a quiet day for susan  although on the way to the park gawain trod on a crack in the pavement .  on purpose .      gawain .     she said  eyeing a nervous bear who had suddenly spotted her and was now trying to edge away nonchalantly .   yes .      you meant to tread on that crack so that i   d have to thump some poor creature whose only fault is wanting to tear you limb from limb .         i was just skipping           quite .  real children don   t go hop pity skip unless they are on drugs .      he grinned at her .      if i catch you being twee again i will knot your arms behind your head     said susan levelly     susan reads a bedtime story          and then jack chopped down the beanstalk  adding murder and ecological vandalism to the theft  enticement and trespass charges already mentioned  but he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge about what he had done .  which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you   re a hero  because no one asks inconvenient questions .         death in person did not turn up upon the cessation of every life .  it was not necessary .  governments govern  but prime ministers and presidents do not personally turn up in people   s homes to tell them how to run their lives  because of the mortal danger this would present .  there are laws instead .      it was the night before hogswatch .  all through the house          one creature stirred .  it was a mouse .   and someone  in the face of all appropriateness  had baited a trap .  although  because it was the festive season  they   d used a piece of pork crackling .  the smell of it had been driving the mouse mad all day but now  with no one about  it was prepared to risk it .   the mouse didn   t know it was a trap .  mice aren   t good at passing on information .  young mice aren   t taken up to famous trap sites and told     this is where your uncle arthur passed away    all it knew was that  what the hey here was something to eat .  on a wooden board with some wire round it .   a brief scurry later and its jaw had closed on the rind .   or  rather  passed through it .   the mouse looked around at what was now lying under the big spring  and thought     oops         then its gaze went up to the black clad figure that had faded into view by the wainscoting .      squeak .     it asked .   squeak  said the death of rats .        never say die  master .  that   s our motto  eh .     said albert .  i can   t say it   s ever really been mine .     in biers  unless you weren   t choosy  it paid to order a drink that was transparent because igor also had undirected ideas about what you could stick on the end of a cocktail stick .  if you saw something spherical and green  you just had to hope that it was an olive .         did you check the list .      yes .  twice .  are you sure that   s enough .      definitely     couldn   t really make head or tail of it  to tell you the truth .  how can i tell if he   s been naughty or nice  for example .      oh  well     i don   t know     has he hung his clothes up  that sort of thing         and if he has been good i may give him this klatchian war chariot with real spinning sword blades .      that   s right .      and if he   s been bad .   albert scratched his head .     when i was a lad  you got a bag of bones     s   mazing how kids got better behaved towards the end of the year .      oh dear .  and now .   albert held a package up to his ear and rustled it .     sounds like socks .      socks .      could be a woolly vest .      serve him right  if i may venture to express an opinion        the guard was cowering behind an overturned cabinet .  he cringed back as teatime stepped over it .     what   re you doing here .     he shouted .     who are you .         ah  i   m glad you asked .  i   m your worst nightmare .     said teatime cheerfully .   the man shuddered .      you mean     the one with the giant cabbage and the sort of whirring knife thing .         sorry .     teatime looked momentarily nonplussed .      then you   re the one about where i   m falling  only instead of ground underneath it   s all           no  in fact i   m        the guard sagged .     awww  not the one where there   s all this kind of  you know  mud and then everything goes blue           no  i   m           oh  shit  then you   re the one where there   s this door only there   s no floor beyond it and then there   s these claws           no     said teatime .     not that one .     he withdrew a dagger from his sleeve .     i   m the one where this man comes out of nowhere and kills you stone dead .      the guard grinned with relief .     oh  that one     he said .     but that one   s not very           the snow had done what even wizards and the watch couldn   t do  which was clean up ankh morpork .  it hadn   t had time to get dirty .  in the morning it   d probably look as though the city had been covered in coffee meringue  but for now it mounded the bushes and trees in pure white .      susan had never been able to see the attraction in cats .  they were owned by the kind of people who liked puddings .  there were actual people in the world whose idea of heaven would be a chocolate cat .      the late  or at least severely delayed  bergholt stuttley johnson was generally recognized as the worst inventor in the world  yet in a very specialized sense .  merely bad inventors made things that failed to operate .  he wasn   t among these small fry .  any fool could make something that did absolutely nothing when you pressed the button .  he scorned such fumble fingered amateurs .  everything he built worked .  it just didn   t do what it said on the box .  if you wanted a small ground to air missile  you asked johnson to design an ornamental fountain .  it amounted to pretty much the same thing .  but this never discouraged him  or the morbid curiosity of his clients .  music  landscape gardening  architecture   there was no start to his talents .      johnson   s inventiveness didn   t just push the edge of the envelope but often went across the room and out through the wall of the sorting office .         amazin        said ridcully    this thing   s a kind of big artificial brain  then .         you could think of it like that     said ponder  carefully .     of course  hex doesn   t actually think .  not as such .  it just appears to be thinking .         ah .  like the dean     said ridcully .     any chance of fitting a brain like this into the dean   s head .         it does weigh ten tons  archchancellor .      ah .  really .  oh .  quite a large crowbar would be in order  then .            i     think my name is bilious .  i   m the     i   m the oh god of hangovers .         i   ve never heard of a god of hangovers            you   ve heard of bibulous  the god of wine .         oh  yes .         big fat man  wears vine leaves round his head  always pictured with a glass in his hand     ow .  well  you know why he   s so cheerful .  him and his big face .  it   s because he knows he   s going to feel good in the morning .  it   s because it   s me that              gets the hangovers .     said susan .      i don   t even drink .     bilious swayed .     you know when people say    i had fifteen lagers last night and when i woke up my head was clear as a bell    .         oh  yes .         bastards .  that   s because i was the one who woke up groaning in a pile of recycled chilli .  just once  i mean just once  i   d like to open my eyes in the morning without my head sticking to something .            how do we usually test stuff .         generally we ask for student volunteers     said the dean .      what happens if we don   t get any .         we give it to them anyway        isn   t that a bit unethical .         not if we don   t tell them  archchancellor .            i am not losing my hair .     snapped the dean .     it is just very finely spaced .         half on your head and half on your hairbrush     said the lecturer in recent runes .      no sense in bein    bashful about goin    bald     said ridcully evenly .     anyway  you know what they say about bald men  dean .         yes  they say     look at him  he   s got no hair .            at the far end of the corridor was one of the very tall  very thin windows .  it looked out on to the black gardens .  black bushes  black grass  black trees .  skeletal fish cruising in the black waters of a pool  under black water lilies .   there was colour  in a sense  but it was the kind of colour you   d get if you could shine a beam of black through a prism .  there were hints of tints  here and there a black you might persuade yourself was a very deep purple or a midnight blue .  but it was basically black  under a black sky  because this was the world belonging to death and that was all there was to it .         just shut up  will you .     ridcully said .     it   s hogswatch .  that   s not the time for silly arguments  all right .         oh  yes it is     said the chair of indefinite studies glumly .     it   s exactly the time for silly arguments .  in our family we were lucky to get through dinner without a reprise of what a shame henry didn   t go into business with our ron .  or why hasn   t anyone taught those kids to use a knife .  that was another favourite .         and the sulks     said ponder stibbons .      oh  the sulks     said the chair of indefinite studies .     not a proper hogswatch without everyone sitting staring at different walls .         the games were worse     said ponder .      worse than the kids hitting one another with their toys  do you think .  not a proper hogswatch afternoon without wheels and bits of broken dolly everywhere and everyone whining .  assault and battery included .         we had a game called hunt the slipper     said ponder .     someone hid a slipper .  and then we had to find it .  and then we had a row .         and then later on someone   ll suggest a board game     said ponder .      that   s right .  where no one exactly remembers all the rules .         which doesn   t stop someone suggesting that you play for pennies .         and five minutes later there   s two people not speaking to one another for the rest of their lives because of tuppence .         and some horrible little kid           i know  i know .  some little kid who   s been allowed to stay up wins everyone   s money by being a nasty little cut throat swot .         and don   t forget the presents     said the chair of indefinite studies  as if reading off some internal list of gloom .     how     how full of potential they seem in all that paper  how pregnant with possibilities     and then you open them and basically the wrapping paper was more interesting and you have to say    how thoughtful  that will come in handy .     it   s not better to give than to receive  in my opinion  it   s just less embarrassing .         i   ve worked out     said the senior wrangler     that over the years i have been a net exporter of hogswatch presents           oh  everyone is     said the chair .     you spend a fortune on other people and what you get when all the paper is cleared away is one slipper that   s the wrong colour and a book about ear wax .            you didn   t get that stuff out of the sack .  not cigars and peaches in brandy and grub with fancy foreign names .      yes  it came out of the sack .   albert gave him a suspicious look .      but you put it in the sack in the first place  didn   t you .      no .   you did  didn   t you .     albert stated .   no .   you put all those things in the sack .      no .   you got them from somewhere and put them in the sack .      no .   you did put them in the sack  didn   t you .      no .   you put them in the sack .      yes .         they   re title deeds     said medium dave .     and they   re better than money        paper   s better   n money .     said catseye .      if we steal them  do they become ours .     said chickenwire .      is that a trick question .     said catseye  smirking .        i know people say i   d kill them as soon as look at them     whispered teatime .     and in fact i   d much rather kill you than look at you  mr lilywhite .           and what   ll you do when he comes after you .         he can   t look everywhere .      medium dave shook his head .  you only had to look into teatime   s mismatched eyes to know one thing  which was this  that if teatime wanted to find you he would not look everywhere .  he   d look in only one place  which would be the place where you were hiding .        they   ve piled the teeth up in a magic circle downstairs     said susan .   violet   s eyes and mouth formed three os .  it was like looking at a pink bowling ball .      what for .         i think they   re using them to control the children .  by magic     violet   s mouth opened wider .      that   s horrid .      horrible  thought susan .  the word is    horrible    .     horrid    is a childish word selected to impress nearby males with one   s fragility  if i   m any judge .     it is said that the prospect of hanging concentrates the mind wonderfully  but it was valium compared to being watched by mister teatime .         i could certainly run a marvellous university here if only we didn   t have to have these damn students underfoot all the time .            all right     said susan .     i   m not stupid .  you   re saying humans need     fantasies to make life bearable .      really .  as if it was some kind of pink pill .  no .  humans need fantasy to be human .  to be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape .      tooth fairies .  hogfathers .  little        yes .  as practice .  you have to start out learning to believe the little lies .      so we can believe the big ones .      yes .  justice .  mercy .  duty .  that sort of thing .      they   re not the same at all .      you think so .  then take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve and then show me one atom of justice  one molecule of mercy .  and yet    death waved a hand .  and yet you act as if there is some ideal order in the world  as if there is some     some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged .   yes  but people have got to believe that  or what   s the point        my point exactly .      death fumbled inside his robe .   i have made this for you .   susan reached out and took a square of damp cardboard .  water dripped off the bottom .  somewhere in the middle  a few brown feathers seemed to have been glued on .      thank you .  er     what is it .      albert said there ought to be snow on it  but it appears to have melted  said death .  it is  of course  a hogswatch card .      oh         there should have been a robin on it as well  but i had considerable difficulty in getting it to stay on .      ah         it was not at all co operative .      really      .      it did not seem to get into the hogswatch spirit at all .       disgworld goes to war  with armies of sardines  warriors  fishermen  squid and at least one very camp follower .   as two armies march  commander vimes of ankfe morpork city watch faces unpleasant foes who are out to get mm     and that   s just the people on his side .  the enemy might be even worse .   jingo makes the world cup look like a friendly five a side .   as every student of exploration knows  the prize goes not to the explorer who first sets foot upon the virgin soil but to the one who gets that foot home first .  if it is still attached to his leg  this is a bonus .      detritus   s intelligence wasn   t too bad for a troll  falling somewhere between a cuttlefish and a line dancer .      lord vetinari looked attentive  because he   d always found that listening keenly to people tended to put them off .        oh  history     said lord selachii .  that   s all in the past .           gentlemen  please     said the patrician .     let   s have no fighting  please .  this is  after all  a council of war           a klatchian bigwig is coming here .     said vimes .     no one told me .         strange as it may seem  sir samuel  i am occasionally capable of governing this city for minutes at a time without seeking your advice and guidance .            my mum   s uncle was a sailor     said nobby .     but after the big plague he got press ganged .  bunch of farmers got him drunk  he woke up next morning tied to a plough .         sergeant colon had had a broad education .  he   d been to the school of my dad always said  the college of it stands to reason  and was now a postgraduate student at the university of what some bloke in the pub told me .      technically they were all in uniform  too  except that mostly they weren   t wearing the same uniform as anyone else .  everyone had just been sent down to the armoury to collect whatever fitted  and the result was a walking historical exhibit  funny shaped helmets through the ages .         dad .         yes  lad .         who was mr hong .         how should i know .         only  when we was all heading back for the boats one of the other men said     we all know what happened to mr hong when he opened the three jolly luck take away fish bar on the site of the old fish god temple in dagon street on the night of the full moon  don   t we      .     well  i don   t know .         ah        solid jackson hesitated .  still  les was a big lad now         he     closed up and left in a bit of a hurry  lad .  so quick he had to leave some things behind .         like what .         if you must know     half an ear hole and one kidney        a few moments later sergeant colon walked carefully down to the main office .  he toyed with some paper for a while and then said      you don   t mind what people call you  do you  nobby .         i   d be minding the whole time if i minded that  sarge     said corporal nobbs cheerfully .      right .  right .  and i don   t mind what people call me  neither    colon scratched his head .     don   t make sense  really .  i reckon sir sam is missing too much sleep .         he   s a very busy man  fred .         trying to do everything  that   s his trouble .  and     nobby .         yes .         it   s sergeant colon  thanks .         there was sherry .  there was always sherry at these occasions .  sam vimes had heard they made sherry by letting wine go rotten .  he couldn   t see the point of sherry .      vimes stood up .     you know what i always say    he said .   carrot removed his helmet and polished it with his sleeve .  yes  sir .      everyone   s guilty of something  especially the ones that aren   t     sir        no  not that one            er        always take into consideration the fact that you might be dead wrong     sir .         no  nor that one either        er        how come nobby ever got a job as a watchman .      sir .  you say that a lot .         no .  i meant    always act stupid     carrot .         ah  right  sir .  from now on i shall remember that you always said that  sir           colon and nobbs are investigating this .     said the patrician .     really .         yes  sir        if i were to ask you why  you   d pretend not to understand .      vimes let his forehead wrinkle in honest perplexity .     sir .         if you say    sir .     again in that stupid voice  vimes  i swear there will be trouble .         they   re good men  sir        however  some people might consider them to be unimaginative  stolid and     how can i put this .      possessed of an inbuilt disposition to accept the first explanation that presents itself and then bunk off somewhere for a quiet smoke .  a certain lack of imagination .  an ability to get out of their depth on a wet pavement .         vetinari peered at a small heap of bent and twisted metal .      what was it  leonard .     he said .      an experimental device for turning chemical energy into rotary motion     said leonard .     the problem  you see  is getting the little pellets of black powder into the combustion chamber at exactly the right speed and one at a time .  if two ignite together  well  what we have is the external combustion engine .         and  er  what would be the purpose of it .     said the patrician .      i believe it could replace the horse     said leonard proudly .   they looked at the stricken thing .      one of the advantages of horses that people often point out     said vetinari  after some thought     is that they very seldom explode .         leonard   s incredible brain sizzled away alarmingly  an overloaded chip pan on the stove of life .  it was impossible to know what he would think of next  because he was constantly reprogrammed by the whole universe .  the sight of a waterfall or a soaring bird would send him spinning down some new path of practical speculation that invariably ended in a heap of wire and springs and a cry of    i think i know what i did wrong .     he   d been a member of most of the craft guilds in the city but had been thrown out for getting impossibly high marks in the exams or  in some cases  correcting the questions .  it was said that he   d accidentally blown up the alchemists    guild using nothing more than a glass of water  a spoonful of acid  two lengths of wire and a ping pong ball .      nobby and colon go on a call   in plain clothes      come on  open up .  watch business .      corporal nobbs pulled at sergeant colon   s sleeve and whispered in his ear .      not watch business .     said colon  pounding the door again .     nothing to do with the watch at all .  we are just civilians  all right .      the door opened a crack .      are you the watch .     said a voice .      no .  i think i just made that clear           piss off  copper .      the door slammed .      you sure this is the right place  sarge .         don   t call me sarge when we   re in plain clothes .         right you are  fred .         that   s       colon hesitated in an agony of status .     well  that   s frederick to you  nobby        right  frederick .  and that   s cecil  thank you .         cecil .         that is my name     said nobby coldly .      have it your way    said colon .     just remember who   s the superior civilian around here  all right .      he hammered on the door again .      we hear you   ve got a room to let  missus .     he yelled .      brilliant  frederick     said nobby .     that was bloody brilliant .         well  i am the sergeant  right .     colon whispered .      no .         er     yeah     right     well  just you remember that  right .            sam .      vimes looked up from his reading .      your soup will be cold     said lady sybil from the far end of the table .     you   ve been holding that spoonful in the air for the last five minutes by the clock .         sorry dear .      belatedly  his nuptial radar detected a certain chilliness from the far side of the cruet .      is  er  there something wrong  dear .     he said .      can you remember when we last had dinner together  sam .         tuesday  wasn   t it .         that was the guild of merchants    annual dinner  sam .      vimes   s brow wrinkled .     but you were there too  weren   t you .         ankh morpork no longer had a fire brigade .  the citizens had a rather disturbingly direct way of thinking at times  and it did not take long for people to see the rather obvious flaw in paying a group of people by the number of fires they put out .  the penny really dropped shortly after charcoal tuesday .   since then they had relied on the good old principle of enlightened self interest .  people living close to a burning building did their best to douse the fire  because the thatch they saved might be their own .        mr vimes saved the day .     said sergeant colon excitedly .      just went straight in and saved everyone  in the finest tradition of the watch .         fred .     said vimes  wearily .   yessir .         fred  the finest tradition of the watch is having a quiet smoke somewhere out of the wind at   a . m .  let   s not get carried away  eh .        colon rummaged in a pocket and produced a very small book  which he held up for inspection .      this belonged to my great grandad     he said .     he was in the scrap we had against pseudopolis and my great gran gave him this book of prayers for soldiers     cos you need all the prayers you can get  believe you me  and he stuck it in the top pocket of his jerkin     cos he couldn   t afford armour  and next day in battle   whoosh  this arrow came out of nowhere  wham  straight into this book and it went all the way through to the last page before stopping  look .  you can see the hole .         pretty miraculous     carrot agreed .      yeah  it was  i s   pose     said the sergeant .  he looked ruefully at the battered volume .     shame about the other seventeen arrows  really .        another little memory burst open as silently as a mouse passing wind in a hurricane .        he is a d   reg .         dreg .     said angua .      a warlike desert tribe     said carrot .     very fierce .  honourable  though .  they say that if a d   reg is your friend he   s your friend for the rest of your life .         and if he   s not your friend .         that   s about five seconds .            everything   s gone all to pot these days .         not like when we were kids  sarge .         not like when we were kids indeed  nobby        people trusted one another in them days  didn   t they  sarge .         people trusted one another  nobby .      yes  sarge .  i know .  and people didn   t have to lock their doors  did they .         that   s right  nobby .  and people were always ready to help .  they were always in and out of one another   s houses .         sright  sarge     said nobby vehemently .     i know no one ever locked their houses down our street .         that   s what i   m talking about .  that   s my point .         it was    cos the bastards even used to steal the locks .      colon considered the truth of this .   yes  but at least it was each other   s stuff they were nicking  nobby        lord rust   s expression would have preserved meat for a year .      you  vimes  certainly are no knight .  before a knight is created he must spend a night   s vigil watching his armour           practically every night of my life     said vimes .     a man doesn   t keep an eye on his armour round here  that man   s got no armour in the morning .         in prayer     said rust sharply .      that   s me     said vimes .     not a night has gone by without me thinking     ye gods  i hope i get through this alive .               and he must have proved himself on the field of combat .  against other trained men  vimes .  not vermin and thugs .      vimes started to undo the strap of his helmet .      well  this isn   t the best of moments  my lord  but if someone   ll hold your coat i can spare you five minutes               it is always useful to face an enemy who is prepared to die for his country .  this means that both you and he have exactly the same aim in mind .         the engravers    guild was against printing .  there was something pure  they said  about an engraved page of text .  it was there  whole  unsullied .  their members could do very fine work at very reasonable rates .  allowing unskilled people to bash lumps of type together showed a disrespect for words and no good would come of it .   the only attempt ever to set up a printing press in ankh morpork had ended in a mysterious fire and the death by suicide of the luckless printer .  everyone knew it was suicide because he   d left a note .  the fact that this had been engraved on the head of a pin was considered an irrelevant detail .         hour ahmed was not superstitious .  he was substitious  which put him in a minority among humans .  he didn   t believe in the things everyone believed in but which nevertheless weren   t true .  he believed instead in the things that were true in which no one else believed .  there are many such substi tions  ranging from    it   ll get better if you don   t pick at it    all the way up to    sometimes things just happen .           so what   re you going to do when we catch the other ship .         er        vimes hadn   t given this a lot of thought .  but he recalled a very bad woodcut he   d once seen in a book about pirates .      we   ll swing across on to them with our cutlasses in our teeth .     he said .      really .     said jenkins .     that   s good .  i haven   t seen that done in years .  only ever seen it done once  in fact .         oh  yes .         yes  this lad   d seen the idea in a book and he swung across into the other ship   s rigging with his cutlass clenched  as you say  between his teeth .         yes .         topless harry  we wrote on his coffin .        angua was aware that she had a slight advantage over male werewolves in that naked women caused fewer complaints  although the downside was that they got some pressing invitations .  some kind of covering was essential  for modesty and the prevention of inconvenient bouncing  which was why fashioning impromptu clothes out of anything to hand was a lesser known werewolf skill .         it   s the waiting that   s the worst part     said his sergeant  next to him .      it might be the worst part     said the commander .     or  there again  the bit where they suddenly rise out of the desert and cut you in half might be the worst part .         lord vetinari helped him up .     our very lives depend on your appearing to be a stupid fat idiot     he hissed  putting colon   s fez back on his head .      i ain   t very good at acting  sir           good .            your predecessor  lord snapcase  now he was mental .  but  like i   ve always said  people know where they stand with lord vetinari           well done .         they might not like where they   re standing of course             it   s the discworld   s last continent and it   s going to die in a few days  except     who is this hero striding across the red desert .  sheep shearer  beer drinker  bush ranger  and someone who   ll even eat a meat pie floater when he   s sober .   a man in a hat whose luggage follows him on little legs .  yes  it   s rincewind  the inept wizard who can   t even spell wizard .  he   s the only hero left .   still    no worries  eh .   there are some people who have a legend that the whole universe is carried in a leather bag by an old man .   other people say  hold on  if he   s carrying the entire universe in a sack  right  that means he   s carrying himself and the sack inside the sack  because the universe contains everything .  including him .  and the sack  of course .  which contains him and the sack already .  as it were .   to which the reply is  well .   all tribal myths are true  for a given value of    true    .      the ceremony of the keys went on every night in every season .  mere ice  wind and snow had never stopped it .  you couldn   t stop tradition .  you could only add to it .   mcabre  head bledlow  with his two escorts  reached the shadows by the main gate .  the bledlow on duty was waiting for them .      halt .  who goes there .     he shouted .   mcabre saluted .  the arch chancellor   s keys .         pass  the archchancellor   s keys .      the head bledlow took a step forward  extended both arms in front of him with his palms bent back towards him  and patted his chest at the place where some bledlow long buried had once had two breast pockets .  pat  pat .  then he extended his arms by his sides and stiffly patted the sides of his jacket .  pat  pat .      damn .  could have sworn i had them a moment ago .     he bellowed  enunciating each word with a sort of bulldog carefulness .   the gatekeeper saluted .  mcabre saluted .      have you looked in all your pockets .      mcabre saluted .  the gatekeeper saluted .      i think i must have left them on the dresser .  it   s always the same  isn   t it .         you should remember where you put them down .         hang on  perhaps they   re in my other jacket .      the young bledlow who was this week   s keeper of the other jacket stepped forward .  each man saluted the other two .  the youngest cleared his throat and managed to say      no  i looked in     there this     morning .      mcabre gave him a slight nod to acknowledge a difficult job done well  and patted his pockets again .      hold on  stone the crows  they were in this pocket after all .  what a muggins i am .         don   t worry  i do the same myself .         is my face red .  forget my own head next .      here   s the keys  then .     said mcabre .      much obliged .             all safe and secure .     shouted the gatekeeper  handing the keys back .      gods bless all present .         careful where you put them this time .  ha .  ha .  ha .         ho .  ho .  ho .     yelled mcabre .  he saluted stiffly  went about turn with a large amount of foot stamping and  the ancient exchange completed  marched back to the bledlows    lodge .      light travels slowly on the disc and is slightly heavy  with a tendency to pile up against high mountain ranges .  research wizards have speculated that there is another  much speedier type of light which allows the slower light to be seen  but since this moves too fast to see they have been unable to find a use for it .      ponder stibbons was one of those unfortunate people cursed with the belief that if only he found out enough things about the universe it would all  somehow  make sense .  the goal is the theory of everything  but ponder would settle for the theory of something and  late at night  he despaired of even a theory of anything .      any true wizard  faced with a sign like    do not open this door .  really .  we mean it .  we   re not kidding .  opening this door will mean the end of the universe     would automatically open the door in order to see what all the fuss was about .         hah  i remember when i was a student     said the lecturer in recent runes .     old    bogeyboy    swallett took us on an expedition to find the lost reading room .  three weeks we were wandering around .  had to eat our own boots .         did you find it .     said the dean .      no  but we found the remains of the previous year   s expedition .         what did you do .         we ate their boots  too .            we   re a university .  we have to have a library .     said ridcully    what sort of people would we be if we didn   t go into the library .         students     said the senior wrangler morosely .         a man whose ability to find water was limited to checking if his feet were wet       ridcully was good at doing without other people   s sleep .      unseen university was much bigger on the inside .  thousands of years as the leading establishment of practical magic in a world where dimensions were largely a matter of chance in any case had left it bulging in places where it shouldn   t have places .  there were rooms containing rooms which  if you entered them  turned out to contain the room you   d started with  which can be a problem if you are in a conga line .      rincewind had always been happy to think of himself as a racist .  the one hundred metres  the mile  the marathon   he   d run them all .  later  when he   d learned with some surprise what the word actually meant  he   d been equally certain he wasn   t one .  he was a person who divided the world quite simply into people who were trying to kill him and people who weren   t .         when you   ve been a wizard as long as i have  my boy  said the senior wrangler   you   ll learn that as soon as you find anything that offers amazing possibilities for the improvement of the human condition it   s best to put the lid back on and pretend it never happened .         droit de mortis  broadly speaking  the acceleration of a wizard through the ranks of wizardry by killing off more senior wizards .  it is a practice currently in abeyance  since a few enthusiastic attempts to remove mustrum ridcully resulted in one wizard being unable to hear properly for two weeks .  ridcully felt that there was indeed room at the top  and he was occupying all of it .      it is a simple universal law .  people always expect to use a holiday in the sun as an opportunity to read those books they   ve always meant to read  but an alchemical combination of sun  quartz crystals and coconut oil will somehow metamorphose any improving book into a rather thicker one with a name containing at least one greek word or letter  the gamma imperative  the delta season  the alpha project and  in the more extreme cases  even the mu kau pi caper  .  sometimes a hammer and sickle turn up on the cover .  this is probably caused by sunspot activity  since they are invariably the wrong way round .      any seasoned traveller soon learns to avoid anything wished on them as a    regional speciality     because all the term means is that the dish is so unpleasant the people living everywhere else will bite off their own legs rather than eat it .  but hosts still press it upon distant guests anyway     go on  have the dog   s head stuffed with macerated cabbage and pork noses   it   s a regional speciality .         the university   s housekeeper  it had been unkindly said  had a face full of chins  there was a glossiness about her that put some people in mind of a candle that had been kept in the warm for too long .  there wasn   t anything approaching a straight line anywhere on mrs whitlow  until she found that something hadn   t been dusted properly  when you could use her lips as a ruler .      the wizards were civilized men of considerable education and culture .  when faced with being inadvertently marooned on a desert island they understood immediately that the first thing to do was place the blame .         remember what we   d say in those days .     said the senior wrangler .         never trust a wizard over sixty five    .  whatever happened .         we got past the age of sixty five  senior wrangler .         the bursar was  as he would probably be the first to admit  not the most mentally stable of people .  he would probably be the first to admit that he was a tea strainer .      once a moderately jolly wizard camped by a dried up waterhole under the shade of a tree that he was completely unable to identify .  and he swore as he hacked and hacked at a can of beer  saying     what kind of idiots put beer in tins .         beer .  it was only water  really  with stuff in it .  wasn   t it .  and most of what was in it was yeast  which was practically a medicine and definitely a food .  in fact  when you thought about it  beer was only a kind of runny bread .         is it true that your life passes before your eyes before you die .      yes .      ghastly thought  really    rince wind shuddered .     oh  gods  i   ve just had another one .  suppose i am just about to die and this is my whole life passing in front of my eyes .      i think perhaps you do not understand .  people   s whole lives do pass in front of their eyes before they die .  the process is called    living    .       mightily oats has not picked a good time to be a priest .   he thought he   d come to lancre for a simple ceremony .  now lie   s caught tip in a war between vampires and witches .   there   s voting agnes  who is really in two minds about everything .  magrat  who is trying to combine witchcraft and nappies  nanny ogg     and granny weatherwax  who is big trouble .   and the vampires are intelligent .  they   ve got style and fancy waistcoats .  they   re out of the casket  and want a bite of the future .  mightily oats knows he has a prayer  but he wishes he had an axe .   in lancre the only truly flat places were tables and the top of some people   s heads .      those who are inclined to casual cruelty say that inside a fat girl is a thin girl and a lot of chocolate .      agnes thought that a dumpy girl should not wear a tall hat  especially with black .  it made her look as though someone had dropped a liquorice flavoured ice cream cone .      the lancrastian idea of posh sanitation was a non slippery path to the privy and a mail order catalogue with really soft pages .      sometimes witches have to be the ones that make the difficult decisions for people .  life and death .  choosing between saving a mother or her new born son .      you got to come to mrs ivy and her baby missus .         i thought old mrs patternoster was seeing to her     said granny  ramming her hatpins into place with the urgency of a warrior preparing for sudden battle .      she says it   s all gone wrong miss .           slice was perched along the sides of a cleft in the mountains that couldn   t be dignified by the name of valley .  in the moonlight granny saw the pale upturned face waiting in the shadows of the garden as she came in to land .      evening  mr ivy    she said  leaping off .     upstairs  is she .         in the barn     said ivy flatly .     the cow kicked her     hard .      granny   s expression stayed impassive .      we shall see     she said     what may be done .      in the barn  one look at mrs patternoster   s face told her how little that might now be .      it   s bad     she whispered  as granny looked at the moaning figure on the straw .     i reckon we   ll lose both of them     or maybe just one         there was  if you were listening for it  just the suggestion of a question in that sentence .  granny focused her mind .      it   s a boy    she said .   mrs patternoster didn   t bother to wonder how granny knew  but her expression indicated that a little more weight had been added to a burden .      i   d better go and put it to john ivy  then     she said .   she   d barely moved before granny weatherwax   s hand locked on her arm .      he   s no part in this     she said .      but after all  he is the           he   s no part in this .      mrs patternoster looked into the blue stare and knew two things .  one was that mr ivy had no part in this  and the other was that anything that happened in this barn was never  ever  going to be mentioned again .      i think i can bring    em to mind     said granny  letting go and rolling up her sleeves .     pleasant couple  as i recall .  he   s a good husband  by all accounts .     she poured warm water from its jug into the bowl that the midwife had set up on a manger .   mrs patternoster nodded .      of course  it   s difficult for a man working these steep lands alone     granny went on  washing her hands .  mrs patternoster nodded again  mournfully .      well  i reckon you should take him into the cottage  mrs patternoster  and make him a cup of tea     granny commanded .     you can tell him i   m doing all i can .      this time the midwife nodded gratefully .   when she had fled  granny laid a hand on mrs ivy   s damp forehead .      well now  florence ivy     she said     let us see what might be done .  but first of all     no pain         indeed .   granny didn   t bother to turn round .      i thought you   d be here     she said  as she knelt down in the straw .   where else .  said death .      do you know who you   re here for .      that is not my choice .  on the very edge you will always find some uncertainty .   granny felt the words in her head for several seconds  like little melting cubes of ice .  on the very  very edge  then  there had to be     judgement .      there   s too much damage here     she said  at last .     too much .      a few minutes later she felt the life stream past her .  death had the decency to leave without a word .   when mrs patternoster tremulously knocked on the door and pushed it open  granny was in the cow   s stall .  the midwife saw her stand up  holding a piece of thorn .      been in the beast   s leg all day    she said .     no wonder it was fretful .  try and make sure he doesn   t kill the cow  you understand .  they   ll need it .      mrs patternoster glanced down at the rolled up blanket in the straw .  granny had tactfully placed it out of sight of mrs ivy  who was sleeping now .      i   ll tell him     said granny  brushing off her dress .     as for her  well  she   s strong and young and you know what to do .  you keep an eye on her  and me or nanny ogg will drop in when we can .      it was doubtful that anyone in slice would defy granny weatherwax  but granny saw the faintest grey shadow of disapproval in the midwife   s expression .      you still reckon i should   ve asked mr ivy .     she said .      that   s what i would have done        the woman mumbled .      you don   t like him .  you think he   s a bad man .     said granny  adjusting her hatpins .      no .         then what   s he ever done to me  that i should hurt him so .         the people of lancre wouldn   t dream of living in anything other than a monarchy .  they   d done so for thousands of years and knew that it worked .  but they   d also found that it didn   t do to pay too much attention to what the king wanted  because there was bound to be another king along in forty years or so and he   d be certain to want something different and so they   d have gone to all that trouble for nothing .  in the meantime  his job as they saw it was to mostly stay in the palace  practise the waving  have enough sense to face the right way on coins and let them get on with the ploughing  sowing  growing and harvesting .  it was  as they saw it  a social contract .  they did what they always did  and he let them .         i used to know an igor from uberwald     said nanny .     walked with a limp .  one eye a bit higher than the other .  had the same manner of     speaking .  very good at brain juggling  too .         that thoundth like my uncle igor     said igor .     he worked for the mad doctor at blinz .  ha  an    he wath a proper mad doctor  too  not like the mad doctorth you get thethe dayth .  and the thervantth .  even worthe .  no pride thethe dayth .     he tapped the brandy flask for emphasis .     when uncle igor wath thent out for a ge niuth   th brain  that   th what you damn well got .  there wath none of thith fumble finger thtuff and then pinching a brain out of the    really inthane    jar and hopin    no one   d notithe .  they alwayth do  anyway     nanny took a step back .  the only sensible way to hold a conversation with an igor was when you had an umbrella .      not many people ever tasted nanny ogg   s home made brandy  it was technically impossible .  once it encountered the warmth of the human mouth it immediately turned into fumes .  you drank it via your sinuses .         the trouble is that people always think of vampires in terms of their diet     said the count  as nanny hurried away .     it   s really rather insulting .  you eat animal flesh and vegetables  but it hardly defines you  does it .            how does perdita work  then .     said nanny .   agnes sighed .     look  you know the part of you that wants to do all the things you don   t dare do  and thinks the thoughts you don   t dare think .      nanny   s face stayed blank .  agnes floundered .     like     maybe     rip off all your clothes and run naked in the rain .     she hazarded .      oh  yes .  right     said nanny .      well     i suppose perdita is that part of me .         really .  i   ve always been that part of me     said nanny .     the important thing is to remember where you left your clothes .            people have quite the wrong idea about vampires  you see .  are we fiendish killers .     he beamed at them .     well  yes  of course we are .  but only when necessary        they were listening quite contentedly to the worst music since shawn ogg   s bagpipes had been dropped down the stairs .      they watched the servant limp off .  the count shook his head .      he   ll never retire     said vlad .     he   ll never take a hint .         and it   s so old fashioned having a servant called igor     said the countess .     he really is too much .         look  it   s simple     said lacrimosa .     just take him down to the cellars  slam him in the iron maiden  stretch him on the rack over a fire for a day or two  and then slice him thinly from the feet upwards  so he can watch .  you   ll be doing him a kindness  really        i suppose it   s the best way    said the count sadly .      there was more to mr oats than met the eye .  there had to be .      books that were all about the world tended to be written by people who knew all about books rather than all about the world .         look  you said you   ve studied vampires  didn   t you .  what   s good for vampires .      oats thought for a moment .     er     a nice dry coffin  er  plenty of fresh blood  er  overcast skies        his voice trailed off when he saw her expression .     ah     well  it depends exactly where they   re from  i remember .  uberwald is a very big place .  er  cutting off the head and staking them in the heart is generally efficacious .         but that works on everyone     said nanny .         you don   t know what he   s like     said agnes .     he looks at me as if he   s undressing me with his eyes .         eyes is allowed     said nanny .      agnes   s arm whirled .  the holy water spiralled out of the bottle and hit vlad full in the chest .   he threw his arms wide and screamed as water cascaded down and poured into his shoes .      look at this waistcoat .  will you look at this waistcoat .  do you know what water does to silk .  you just never get it out .  no matter what you do  there   s always a mark .         few birds could sit more meekly than the lancre wowhawk  or lappet faced worrier  a carnivore permanently on the lookout for the vegetarian option .     the count blew a smoke ring .      good evening     he said  as it drifted away .     you must be the mob .           may i introduce you to sergeant kraput  and this gentleman here picking his teeth with his knife is corporal svitz .  they and their men will be going on duty in  oh  about an hour .  purely for reasons of security  you understand .         an    then we   ll gut yer like a clam and stuff yer with straw     said corporal svitz .      ah .  this is technical military language of which i know little     said the count .     i do so hope there is no unpleasantness .         i don   t     said sergeant kraput .      what scamps they are     said the count .         it   th a pleathure to be commanded in a clear  firm authoritative voithe  mithtreth     said igor  lurching over to the bridles .     none of thith    would you mind        rubbith .  an igor liketh to know where he thtandth .         slightly lopsidedly .     said magrat .         the prophet brutha said that om helps those who help one another .         and does he .         to be honest  there are a number of opinions of what was meant .         how many .         about one hundred and sixty  since the schism of    .    a . m .   february    .  that was when the re united free chelonianists  hubwards convocation  schismed from the re united free chelonianists  rimwards convocation  .  it was rather serious .         blood spilled .     said agnes .  she wasn   t really interested  but it took her mind off whatever might be waking up in a minute .      no  but there were fisticuffs and a deacon had ink spilled on him .            the omnians used to burn witches            they never did     said granny .      i   m afraid i have to admit that the records show           they never burned witches     said granny .     probably they burned some old ladies who spoke up or couldn   t run away .  i wouldn   t look for witches bein    burned     she added  shifting position .     i might look for witches doin    the burning  though .  we ain   t all nice .            there is a very interesting debate raging at the moment  among omnians  about the nature of sin  for example .         and what do they think .  against it  are they .      said granny      it   s not as simple as that .  it   s not a black and white issue .  there are so many shades of grey        there   s no greys  only white that   s got grubby .  i   m surprised you don   t know that .  and sin  young man  is when you treat people as things .  including yourself .  that   s what sin is .         it   s a lot more complicated than that           no .  it ain   t .  when people say things are a lot more complicated than that  they means they   re getting worried that they won   t like the truth .  people as things  that   s where it starts .         oh  i   m sure there are worse crimes           but they starts with thinking about people as things            scraps tried to lick igor .  he was a dog with a lot of lick to share .      thcrapth  play dead     said igor .  the dog dropped and rolled over with his legs in the air .      thee .     said igor .     he rememberth .         agnes indicated the headless vampire .     er     is that one vlad .     she said .      we can check .  piotr  show her the head .      a young man obediently went to the fireplace  pulled on a glove  lifted the lid of a big saucepan and held up a head by its hair .      that   s not vlad     said agnes  swallowing .  no  said perdita  vlad was taller .      the countess clutched his arm .      oh  this does so remind me of our honeymoon     she said .     don   t you remember those wonderful nights in grjsknvij .         oh  fresh morning of the world indeed     said the count solemnly .      such romance     and we met such lovely people  too .  do you remember mr and mrs harker .         very fondly .  i recall they lasted nearly all week .         vampires are not naturally co operative creatures .  it   s not in their nature .  every other vampire is a rival for the next meal .  in fact  the ideal situation for a vampire is a world in which every other vampire has been killed off and no one seriously believes in vampires any more .       sam vimes is a man on the run .   yesterday he was a me  a chief of police and the ambassador to the mysterious  fat rich country of uberwald .   now he has nothing but his native wit and the gloomy trousers of uncle vanya  don   t ask  .  it   s snowing .  it   s freezing .  and if he can   t make it through the forest to civilization there   s going to be a terrible war .   but there are monsters on his trail .  they   re bright .  they   re fast .  they   re werewolves   and they   re catching tip .   starring dwarfs  diplomacy  intrigue and big lamps of fat .   all jolson was a man who   d show up on an atlas and change the orbit of small planets .  paving stones cracked under his feet .  he combined in one body     and there was plenty of room left over     ankh morpork   s best chef and its keenest eater  a circumstance made in mashed potato heaven .  he   d picked up the nickname by general acclaim  since no one seeing him in the street for the first time could believe that it was all jolson .      it is in the nature of the universe that the person who always keeps you waiting ten minutes will  on the day you are ten minutes tardy  have been ready ten minutes early and will make a point of not mentioning this .      uberwald was so thickly forested  so creased by little mountain ranges and beset by rivers  that it was largely unmapped .  it was mostly unexplored  too .    at least by proper explorers .  just living there doesn   t count .         i could   ve bin a wolf  you know     said gaspode .      with diff   rent parents  of course .           someone said something blotto voice     said captain colon .      i   m sure they didn   t  captain     said nobby .      and i won   t be eyeballed like that  neither .         no one   s looking at you .     wailed nobby .      aha  you think i don   t know that one .     colon shouted .     there   s plenty of ways to eyeball someone without lookin    at    em  corporal .  that man over there is earlobing me .         gaspode settled down in the pose he almost unconsciously categorized as faithful companion keeping watch  got bored  scratched himself absent mindedly  curled up in the pose known as faithful companion curled up with his nose pressed on his bottom  and fell asleep .      lord vetinari paused .  he found it difficult to talk to frederick colon .  he dealt on a daily basis with people who treated conversation as a complex game  and with colon he had to keep on adjusting his mind in case he overshot .      gaspode wasn   t sure of his own ancestry .  there was some terrier  and a touch of spaniel  and probably someone   s leg  and an awful lot of mongrel .           i believe you were an alcoholic  sir samuel .        no     said vimes .     i was a drunk .  you have to be richer than i was to be an alcoholic          everyone   s heard of commander vimes .  i mean no offence  of course  but we were a little surprised when the patrician said that you would be coming .  we were expecting one of the more     experienced     diplomats .         oh  i can hand around the thin cucumber sandwiches like anything     said vimes .     and if you want little golden balls of chocolate piled up in a heap  i   m your man .            igors heal very fast     said lady sybil .      they   d have to .         mister skimmer said they   re very gifted surgeons  sam .         except cosmetically  perhaps .            this stuff     this stuff is spying .  i wondered how vetinari always seems to know so much .         did you think it came to him in dreams  dear .         but there   s loads of details here     i didn   t know we did this sort of thing .         you use spies all the time  dear     said sybil .      i do not .         well  what about people like foul ole ron and no way jose and cumbling michael .         that is not spying  that is not spying .  that   s just    information received    .  we couldn   t do the job if we didn   t know what   s happening on the street .         well  perhaps havelock just thinks in terms of     a bigger street  dear .         vimes had once discussed the ephebian idea of    democracy    with carrot  and had been rather interested in the idea that everyone had a vote until he found out that while he  vimes  would have a vote  there was no way in the rules that anyone could prevent nobby nobbs from having one as well .  vimes could see the flaw there straight away .      the marquis of fantailler got into many fights in his youth  most of them as a result of being known as the marquis of fantailler  and wrote a set of rules for what he termed    the noble art of fisticuffs     which mostly consisted of a list of places where people weren   t allowed to hit him .  many people were impressed with his work and later stood with noble chest out thrust and fists balled in a spirit of manly aggression against people who hadn   t read the marquis   s book but did know how to knock people senseless with a chair .  the last words of a surprisingly large number of people were    stuff the bloody marquis of fantailler           vimes is being pursued through an unfriendly landscape .   so  what were his options .  well  he could stay in the tree and die  or run for it and die .  of the two  dying in one piece seemed better .   you   re doing very well for a man of your age .   death was sitting on a higher branch of the tree .      are you following me or what .      are you familiar with the words    death was his constant companion    .     lady sybil wasn   t a good cook .   she   d never been taught proper cookery  at her school it had always been assumed that other people would be doing the cooking and that in any case it would be for fifty people using at least four types of fork .       william just wants to get at the truth .   unfortunately  everyone else wants to get at william .  and it   s only the third edition     william de worde is the accidental editor of the discworld   s first newspaper .  now he must cope with the traditional perils of a journalist   s life   people who want him dead  a recovering vampire with a suicidal fascination for flash photography  some more people who want him dead in a different way and  worst of all  the man who keeps begging him to publish pictures of his humorously shaped potatoes .   the rumour spread through the city like wildfire  which had quite often spread through ankh morpork since its citizens had learned the words    fire insurance     .      selling hot sausages from a tray was by way of being the ground state of dibbler   s existence  from which he constantly sought to extricate himself and back to which he constantly returned when his latest venture went all runny .  which was a shame  because dibbler was an extremely good hot sausage salesman .  he had to be  given the nature of his sausages .      as for mr pin and mr tulip  all that need be known about them at this point is that they are the kind of people who call you    friend    .  people like that aren   t friendly .        you know i   ve always wanted a paperless office           yes  archchancellor  that   s why you hide it all in cupboards and throw it out of the window at night .        there are  it has been said  two types of people in the world .  there are those who  when presented with a glass that is exactly half full  say  this glass is half full .  and then there are those who say  this glass is half empty .   the world belongs  however  to those who can look at the glass and say     what   s up with this glass .  excuse me .  excuse me .  this is my glass .  i don   t think so .  my glass was full .  and it was a bigger glass .         hugglestones was a boarding school so bleak and spartan that only the upper classes would dream of sending their sons there .   it was a granite building on a rain soaked moor  and its stated purpose was to make men from boys .  the policy employed involved a certain amount of wastage  and consisted of very simple and violent games in the healthy outdoor sleet .  the small  slow  fat or merely unpopular were mown down  as nature intended .         ah     said mr pin .     right .  you are concerned citizens .     he knew about concerned citizens .  wherever they were  they all spoke the same private language  where    traditional values    meant    hang someone    .         clear my appointments this morning  will you .  i will see the guild of towncriers at nine o   clock and the guild of engravers at ten past .         i wasn   t aware they had appointments  sir .         they will have     said lord vetinari .         i am looking for mister william der worde     rumbled a voice .      that   s me     said william .      der patrician will see you now     said the troll .      i don   t have an appointment with lord vetinari .         ah  well     said the troll     you   d be amazed at how many people has appointments wid der patrician an    dey don   t know it .         dibbler opened the special section of his tray  the high class one that contained sausages whose contents were    meat     from a known four footed creature     probably land dwelling .              a naked man  hotly pursued by members of the watch  burst through the window and ran around the room  causing much disarray of the tarts before being apprehended by the trifles .      an innocent young reporter writes .      william wondered why he always disliked people who said    no offence meant    .  maybe it was because they found it easier to say    no offence meant    than actually refrain from giving offence .      william felt predisposed to like vimes  if only because of the type of enemies he made  but as far as he could see everything about the man could be prefaced by the word    badly     as in  spoken   educated and  in need of a drink .         ah  just the man i was looking for .     said william .      am i .     wheezed nobbs  smoke curling out of his ears .      yes  i   ve been talking to commander vimes  and now i would like to see the room where the crime was committed .     william had great hopes of that sentence .  it seemed to contain the words    and he gave me permission to    without actually doing so .      one of the strange things about eating at mrs arcanum   s was that you got more leftovers than you got original meals .  that is  there were far more meals made up from what were traditionally considered the prudently usable remains of earlier meals     stews  bubble and squeak  curry     than there were meals at which those remains could have originated .   the curry was particularly strange  since mrs arcanum considered foreign parts only marginally less unspeakable than private parts and therefore added the curious yellow curry powder with a very small spoon  lest everyone should suddenly tear their clothes off and do foreign things .  the main ingredients appeared to be swede and gritty rainwater tasting sultanas and the remains of some cold mutton .      the best way to describe mr windling would be like this  you are at a meeting .  you   d like to be away early .  so would everyone else .  there really isn   t very much to discuss  anyway .  and just as everyone can see any other business coming over the horizon and is already putting their papers neatly together  a voice says    if i can raise a minor matter  mr chairman        and with a horrible wooden feeling in your stomach you know  now  that the evening will go on for twice as long with much referring back to the minutes of earlier meetings .  the man who has just said that  and is now sitting there with a smug smile of dedication to the committee process  is as near mr windling as makes no difference .  and something that distinguishes the mr windlings of the universe is the term    in my humble opinion     which they think adds weight to their statements rather than indicating  in reality     these are the mean little views of someone with the social grace of duckweed    .      classically  very few people have considered that cleanliness is next to godliness  apart from in a very sternly abridged dictionary .  a rank loincloth and hair in an advanced state of matted entanglement have generally been the badges of office of prophets whose injunction to disdain earthly things starts with soap .         you don   t think a dress like this would be a bit     forward  do you .     said sacharissa  holding the dress against herself .   rocky looked worried .   you   re quite a lot forward already    he opined .     sacharissa   s knowledge of vintages extended just as far as knowing that chateau maison was a very popular wine .     sacharissa pulled a brown leather wallet out of the jacket .      any clue to who he is .     said william .      er     there   s something done on the leather in pokerwork     said sacharissa .      what does it say .             not a very nice person at all        she read .     i wonder what kind of person would put that on a wallet .         someone who wasn   t a very nice person     said william .   death sighed and shook his head .   who knows what evil lurks in the heart of men .   the death of rats looked up .   squeak  he said .   death waved a hand dismissively well  yes  obviously me  he said .  i just wondered if there was anyone else .         oh  i see     said lord vetinari .     you mean you should be free to print what you like .         well     broadly  yes  sir .         because that   s in the public interest .         i think so  sir .         stories about man eating goldfish and people   s husbands disappearing in big silver dishes .         no  sir .  that   s what the public is interested in .  we do the other stuff  sir .         amusingly shaped vegetables .         well  a bit of that  sir .  sacharissa calls them human interest stories .         about vegetables and animals .         yes  sir .         so     we have what the people are interested in  and human interest stories  which is what humans are interested in  and the public interest  which no one is interested in .         except the public  sir     said william  trying to keep up .      which isn   t the same as people and humans .         i think it   s more complicated than that  sir .         obviously do you mean that the public is a different thing from the people you just see walking about the place .  the public thinks big  sensible  measured thoughts while people run around doing silly things .         i think so .  i may have to work on that idea too  i admit .            i   m sure we can pull together  sir .      lord vetinari raised his eyebrows .     oh  i do hope not  i really do hope not .  pulling together is the aim of despotism and tyranny .  free men pull in all kinds of directions .     he smiled .     it   s the only way to make progress .         you think that   s really true .     william said .   sacharissa shrugged .     really true .  who knows .  this is a newspaper  isn   t it .  it just has to be true until tomorrow .          time is a resource .  everyone knows it has to be managed .   and on discworld that is the job of the monks of history  who store it and pump it from the places where it   s wasted  like underwater     how much time does a codfish need .   to places like cities  where there   s never enough time .   but the construction of the world   s first truly accurate clock starts a race against  well  time for lu tze and his apprentice lobsang ludd .  because it will stop time .  and that will only be the start of everyone   s problems .   complete with a full supporting cast of heroes and villains  yetis  martial artists and ronnie  the fifth horseman of the apocalypse  who left before they became famous  .      she has told me everything     said wen .     i know that time was made for men  not the other way round .  i have learned how to shape it and bend it .  i know how to make a moment last for ever  because it already has .  and i can teach these skills even to you  clodpool .  i have heard the heartbeat of the universe .  i know the answers to many questions .  ask me .      the apprentice gave him a bleary look .      er     what does master want for breakfast .     he said .   wen looked down from their camp and across the snowfields and purple mountains to the golden daylight creating the world  and mused upon certain aspects of humanity .      ah     he said .     one of the difficult ones .         this is the desk of a professional .  it is clear that their job is their life .  there are     human touches  but these are the human touches that strict usage allows in a chilly world of duty and routine .   mostly they   re on the only piece of real colour in this picture of blacks and greys .  it   s a coffee mug .  someone somewhere wanted to make it   jolly mug .  it bears a rather unconvincing picture of a teddy bear  and the legend    to the world   s greatest grandad    and the slight change in the style of lettering on the word    grandad    makes it clear that this has come from one of those stalls that have hundreds of mugs like this  declaring that they   re for the world   s greatest grandad dad mum granny uncle  aunt blank .  only someone whose life contains very little else  one feels  would treasure a piece of gimcrackery like this .      they were not lifeforms .  they were     non lifeforms .  they were the observers of the operation of the universe  its clerks  its auditors .  they saw to it that things spun and rocks fell .   and they believed that for a thing to exist it had to have a position in time and space .  humanity had arrived as a nasty shock .  humanity practically was things that didn   t have a position in time and space  such as imagination  pity  hope  history and belief .  take those away and all you had was an ape that fell out of trees a lot .   intelligent life was  therefore  an anomaly .  it made the filing untidy .  the auditors hated things like that .      wen considered the nature of time and understood that the universe is  instant by instant  recreated anew .  therefore  he understood  there is in truth no past  only a memory of the past .  blink your eyes  and the world you see next did not exist when you closed them .  therefore  he said  the only appropriate state of the mind is surprise .  the only appropriate state of the heart is joy .  the sky you see now  you have never seen before .  the perfect moment is now .  be glad of it .      lobsang heard the dojo master say     dojo .  what is rule one .         do not act incautiously when confronting little bald wrinkly smiling men .         if children were weapons  jason would have been banned by international treaty .  jason had doting parents and an attention span of minus several seconds  except when it came to inventive cruelty to small furry animals  when he could be quite patient .  jason kicked  punched  bit and spat .  his artwork had even frightened the life out of miss smith  who could generally find something nice to say about any child .  he was definitely a boy with special needs .  in the view of the staffroom  these began with an exorcism .   madam frout had stooped to listening at the keyhole .  she had heard jason   s first tantrum of the day  and then silence .  she couldn   t quite make out what miss susan said next .   when she found an excuse to venture into the classroom half an hour later  jason was helping two little girls to make a cardboard rabbit .   later his parents said they were amazed at the change  although apparently now he would only go to sleep with the light on .         what precisely was it you wanted  madam .     she said .     it   s just that i   ve left the class doing algebra  and they get restless when they   ve finished .         algebra .     said madam frout  perforce staring at her own bosom  which no one else had ever done .     but that   s far too difficult for seven year olds .         yes  but i didn   t tell them that and so far they haven   t found out     said susan .     the class had built a full size white horse out of cardboard boxes   during which time they   d learned a lot about horses and susan learned about jason   s remarkably accurate powers of observation .  she   d had to take the cardboard tube away from him and explain that this was a polite horse .     the stationery cupboard .  that was one of the great battlegrounds of classroom history  that and the playhouse .  but the ownership of the playhouse usually sorted itself out without susan   s intervention  so that all she had to do was be ready with ointment  a nose blow and mild sympathy for the losers  whereas the stationery cupboard was a war of attrition .  it contained pots of powder paint and reams of paper and boxes of crayons and more idiosyncratic items like a spare pair of pants for billy  who did his best .  it also contained the scissors  which under classroom rules were treated as some kind of doomsday machine  and  of course  the boxes of stars .  the only people allowed in the cupboard were susan and  usually  vincent .  despite everything susan had tried  short of actual deception  he was always the official    best at everything    and won the coveted honour every day  which was to go into the stationery cupboard and fetch the pencils and hand them out .  for the rest of the class  and especially jason  the stationery cupboard was some mystic magic realm to be entered whenever possible .   honestly  thought susan  once you learn the arts of defending the stationery cupboard  outwitting jason and keeping the class pet alive until the end of term  you   ve mastered at least half of teaching .      according to the second scroll of wen the eternally surprised  wen the eternally surprised sawed the first procrastinator from the trunk of a wamwam tree  carved certain symbols on it  fitted it with a bronze spindle and summoned the apprentice  clodpool .      ah .  very nice  master     said clodpool .     a prayer wheel  yes .         no  this is nothing like as complex     said wen .     it merely stores and moves time .         that simple  eh .         and now i shall test it     said wen .  he gave it a half turn with his hand .      ah .  very nice  master     said clodpool .     a prayer wheel  yes .         no  this is nothing like as complex     said wen .     it merely stores and moves time .         that simple  eh .         and now i shall test it     said wen .  he moved it a little less this time .      that simple  eh .         and now i shall test it     said wen .      lu tze bent down  picked up a fallen cork helmet  and solemnly handed it to lobsang .      health and safety at work     he said .     very important .         will it protect me .     said lobsang  putting it on .      not really .  but when they find your head  it may be recognizable .            all roads lead to ankh morpork .         i thought all roads led away from ankh morpork .         not the way we   re going .         now the cold crept in  slowly  like a sadist   s knife .   lu tze strode on ahead  seemingly oblivious of it .   lu tze  it was said  would walk for miles during weather when the clouds themselves would freeze and crash out of the sky .  cold did not affect him  they said .      sweeper .      lu tze stopped and turned .     yes  lad .         i don   t know how you can stand this cold .         ah  you don   t know the secret .         is it the way of mrs cosmopilite that gives you such power .      lu tze hitched up his robe and did a little dance in the snow  revealing skinny legs encased in thick  yellowing tubes .      very good  very good     he said .     she still sends me these double knit combinations  silk on the inside  then three layers of wool  reinforced gussets and a couple of handy trapdoors .  very reasonably priced at six dollars a pair because i   m an old customer .  for it is written     wrap up warm or you   ll catch your death .            the auditors hated questions .  they hated them almost as much as they hated decisions  and they hated decisions almost as much as they hated the idea of the individual personality .  but what they hated most was things moving around randomly .      the apprentice clodpool  in a rebellious mood  approached wen and spake thusly      master  what is the difference between a humanistic  monastic system of belief in which wisdom is sought by means of an apparently nonsensical system of questions and answers  and a lot of mystic gibberish made up on the spur of the moment .      wen considered this for some time  and at last said     a fish .      and clodpool went away  satisfied .      the code of the igors was very strict .   never contradict  it was no part of an igor   s job to say things like    no  thur  that   th an artery    the marthter was always right .   never complain  an igor would never say    but that   th a thouthand mileth away .      never make personal remarks  no igor would dream of saying anything like    i thould have thomething done about that laugh  if i wath you .      and never  ever ask questions .  admittedly  igor knew  that meant never ask big questions .     would thur like a cup of tea around now .     was fine  but    what do you need a hundred virginth for .     or    where do you ecthpect me to find a brain at thith time of night .     was not .      death found pestilence in a hospice in llamedos .  pestilence liked hospitals .  there was always something for him to do .   currently he was trying to remove the    now wash your hands    sign over a cracked basin .      and what is this  .      it is a cat .  it arrived .  it does not appear to wish to depart .      and the reason for its presence .      it appears to tolerate the company of humans  asking nothing in return but food  water  shelter and comfort .            look at the bird .      it was perched on a branch by a fork in the tree  next to what looked like a birdhouse .      looks like some kind of old box to me     said lobsang .  he squinted to see better .     is it an old     clock .     he added .      look at what the bird is nibbling     suggested lu tze .      well  it looks like     a crude gearwheel .  but why           well spotted .  that  lad  is a clock cuckoo .  a young one  by the look of it  trying to build a nest that   ll attract a mate .  not much chance of that     see .  it   s got the numerals all wrong and it   s stuck the hands on crooked .         a bird that builds clocks .  i thought a cuckoo clock was a clock with a mechanical cuckoo that came out when           and where do you think people got such a strange idea from .         but that   s some kind of miracle .         why .     said lu tze .     they barely go for more than half an hour  they keep lousy time and the poor dumb males go frantic trying to keep them wound .         of the very worst words that can be heard by anyone high in the air  the pair known as    oh oh    possibly combine the maximum of bowel knotting terror with the minimum wastage of breath .         we   re having rabbit     mrs war said .     i   m sure i can make it stretch to three .      war   s big red face wrinkled .     do i like rabbit .         yes  dear .         i thought i liked beef .         no  dear .  beef gives you wind .         oh .     war sighed .     any chance of onions .         you don   t like onions  dear .         i don   t .         because of your stomach  dear .         oh .      war smiled awkwardly at death .     it   s rabbit     he said .   despite himself  death was fascinated .  he had never come across the idea of keeping your memory inside someone else   s head .      perhaps i would like a beer .     war ventured .      you don   t like beer  dear .         i don   t .         no  it brings on your trouble .         ah .  uh  how do i feel about brandy .         you don   t like brandy  dear .  you like your special oat drink with the vitamins .         oh  yes     said war mournfully .     i   d forgotten i liked that .            the poet hoha once dreamed he was a butterfly  and then he awoke and said     am i a man who dreamed he was a butterfly  or am i a butterfly dreaming he is a man .        said lobsang .      really .     said susan briskly .     and which was he .         what .  well     who knows .         how did he write his poems .     said susan .      with a brush  of course .         he didn   t flap around making information rich patterns in the air or laying eggs on cabbage leaves .         no one ever mentioned it .         then he was probably a man .        lu tze had long considered that everything happens for a reason  except possibly football .     ankh morpork had not had a king for many centuries  but palaces tend to survive .  a city might not need a king  but it can always use big rooms and some handy large walls  long after the monarchy is but a memory and the building is renamed the glorious memorial to the people   s industry .      wienrich and boettcher were foreigners  and according to ankh morpork   s guild of confectioners they did not understand the peculiarities of the city   s tastebuds .   ankh morpork people  said the guild  were hearty  no nonsense folk who did not want chocolate that was stuffed with cocoa liquor  and were certainly not like effete la di dah foreigners who wanted cream in everything .  in fact they actually preferred chocolate made mostly from milk  sugar  suet  hooves  lips  miscellaneous squeezings  rat droppings  plaster  flies  tallow  bits of tree  hair  lint  spiders and powdered cocoa husks .  this meant that according to the food standards of the great chocolate centres in borogravia and quirm  ankh morpork chocolate was formally classed as    cheese    and only escaped  through being the wrong colour  being defined as    tile grout    .      the quirm college for young ladies had been very advanced in that respect  and its teachers took the view that a girl who couldn   t swim two lengths of the pool with her clothes on wasn   t making an effort .     her one chocolate today and it was damn artificial damn pink and white damn sickly damn stupid nougat .   well  no one could be expected to believe that counted .        the yeti of the ramtops  where the discworld   s magical field is so intense that it is part of the very landscape  are one of the few creatures to utilize control of personal time for genetic advantage .  the result is a kind of physical premonition     you find out what is going to happen next by allowing it to happen .  faced with danger  or any kind of task that involves risk of death  a yeti will save its life up to that point and then proceed with all due caution  yet in the comfortable knowledge that  should everything go pancake shaped  it will wake up at the point where it saved itself with  and this is the important part  knowledge of the events which have just happened but which will not now happen because it   s not going to be such a damn fool next time .  this is not quite the paradox it appears because  after it has taken place  it hasn   t happened .  all that actually remains is a memory in the yeti   s head  which merely turns out to be a remarkably accurate premonition .  the little eddies in time caused by all this are just lost in the noise of all the kinks  dips and knots put in time by every other living creature .      susan returned to the classroom and spent the rest of the day performing small miracles  which included removing the glue from richenda   s hair  emptying the wee out of billy   s shoes and treating the class to a short visit to the continent of fourecks .         this is true .  a chocolate you did not want to eat does not count as chocolate .  this discovery is from the same branch of culinary physics that determined that food eaten while walking contains no calories .       he   s been a legend in his own lifetime .   he can remember the great days of high adventure .   he can remember when a hero didn   t have to worry about fences and lawyers and civilization .   he can remember when people didn   t tell you off for killing dragons .   but he can   t always remember  these days  where he put his teeth     he   s really not happy about that bit .   so now  with his ancient sword and his new walking stick and ms old friends     and they   re very old friends     cohen the barbarian is going on one final quest .  it   s been a good life .  he   s going to climb the highest mountain in the discworld and meet his gods .  he doesn   t like the way they let men grow old and die .   it   s time  in fact  to give something back .   the last hero in the world is going to return what the first hero stole .  with a vengeance .  that   ll mean the end of the world  if no one stops him in time .   someone is going to try .  so who knows who the last hero really is .   the place where the story happened was a world on the back of four elephants perched on the shell of a giant turtle .  that   s the advantage of space .  it   s big enough to hold practically anything  and so  eventually  it does .      people think that it is strange to have a turtle ten thousand miles long and an elephant more than two thousand miles tall  which just shows that the human brain is ill adapted for thinking and was probably originally designed for cooling the blood .  it believes mere size is amazing .   there   s nothing amazing about size .  turtles are amazing  and elephants are quite astonishing .  the fact that there   s a big turtle is far less amazing than the fact that there is a turtle anywhere .         ah  well  life goes on     people say when someone dies .  but from the point of view of the person who has just died  it doesn   t .  it   s the universe that goes on .  just as the deceased was getting the hang of everything it   s all whisked away  by illness or accident or  in one case  a cucumber .  why this has to be is one of the imponderables of life  in the face of which people either start to pray     or become really  really angry .      the wizards  once they understood the urgency of a problem  and then had lunch  and argued about the pudding  could actually work quite fast .   their method of finding a solution was by creative hubbub .  if the question was     what is the best spell for turning a book of poetry into a frog .      then the one thing they would not do was look in any book with a title like major amphibian spells in a literary environment  a comparison .  that would  somehow  be cheating .  they would argue about it instead  standing around a blackboard  seizing the chalk from one another and rubbing out bits of what the current chalk holder was writing before he   d finished the other end of the sentence .  somehow  though  it all seemed to work .      the gods play games with the fate of men .  not complex ones  obviously  because gods lack patience .   cheating is part of the rules .  and gods play hard .  to lose all believers is  for a god  the end .  but a believer who survives the game gains honour and extra belief .  who wins with the most believers  lives .   believers can include other gods  of course .  gods believe in belief .      lord vetinari  despite his education  had a mind like an engineer .  if you wished to open something  you found the appropriate spot and applied the minimum amount of force necessary to achieve your end .  possibly the spot was between a couple of ribs and the force was applied via a dagger  or between two warring countries and applied via an army  but the important thing was to find that one weak spot which would be the key to everything .      the dungeons of the palace held a number of felons imprisoned    at his lordship   s pleasure     and since lord vetinari was seldom very pleased they were generally in for the long haul .      leonard of quirm was so absent mindedly clever that he could paint pictures that didn   t just follow you around the room but went home with you and did the washing up .         so how come you left the evil dark lord business  harry .     said cohen .      werl  you know how it is these days     said evil harry dread .   the horde nodded .  they knew how it was these days .      people these days  when they   re attacking your dark evil tower  the first thing they do is block up your escape tunnel     said evil harry .      bastards .     said cohen .     you   ve got to let the dark lord escape .  everyone knows that .         that   s right     said caleb .     got to leave yourself some work for tomorrow .            anyone heard of ning the uncompassionate .         sort of     said boy willie .     i killed him .         you couldn   t have done .  what was it he always said .     i shall revert to this vicinity .            sort of hard to do that     said boy willie  pulling out a pipe and beginning to fill it with tobacco     when your head   s nailed to a tree .            how about pamdar the witch queen .     said evil harry .     now there was           retired     said cohen .      she   d never retire .         got married     cohen insisted .      but she was a devil woman .         we all get older  harry .  she runs a shop now .  pam   s pantry .  makes marmalade     said cohen .      what .  she used to queen it in a throne on top of a pile of skulls .         i didn   t say it was very good marmalade .         hughnon ridcully  chief priest of blind io  shared many of the characteristics of his brother mustrum .  he also saw his job as being  essentially  one of organizer .  there were plenty of people who were good at the actual believing  and he left them to it .  it took a lot more than prayer to make sure the laundry got done and the building was kept in repair .      there were so many gods now     at least two thousand .  many were  of course  still very small .  but you had to watch them .  gods were very much a fashion thing .  look at om  now .  one minute he was a bloodthirsty little deity in some mad hot country and then suddenly he was one of the top gods .  it had all been done by not answering prayers  but doing so in a sort of dynamic way that left open the possibility that one day he might and then there   d be fireworks .      and then  of course  you had your real newcomers like aniger  goddess of squashed animals .  who would have thought that better roads and faster carts would have led to that .  but gods grew bigger when called upon at need  and enough minds had cried out     oh god  what was that i hit .         death tries to come to grips with schroedinger   s cat   in the study of his dark house on the edge of time  death looked at the wooden box .   perhaps i shall try one more time  he said .   he reached down and lifted up a small kitten  patted it on the head  lowered it gently into the box  and closed the lid .   the cat dies when the air runs out .      i suppose it might  sir     said albert  his manservant .     but i don   t reckon that   s the point .  if i understand it right  you don   t know if the cat   s dead or alive until you look at it .      things will have come to a pretty pass  albert  if i did not know whether a thing was dead or alive without having to go and look .      er     the way the theory goes  sir  it   s the act of lookin    that determines if it   s alive or not .      death looked hurt .  are you suggesting i will kill the cat just by looking at it .      it   s not quite like that  sir .      i mean  it   s not as if i make faces or anything .      to be honest with you  sir  i don   t think even the wizards understand the uncertainty business     said albert .   death opened the box and took out the kitten .  it stared at him with the normal mad amazement of kittens everywhere .   i don   t hold with cruelty to cats  said death  putting it gently on the floor .        some people say you achieve immortality through your children     said the minstrel .      yeah .     said cohen .     name one of your great grandads  then .        discworld briefly discovers space travel  and carrot  rincewind and leonard of quirm look down on the disc from its moon   you know  i   m not sure i ever really believed it before     said carrot .     you know     about the turtle and the elephants and everything .  seeing it all like this makes me feel very     very            scared .     suggested rincewind .      no .         upset .         no .         easily intimidated .         no .      beyond the rimfall  the continents of the world were coming into view under swirls of white cloud .   you know  .  .   .  from up here     you can   t see the boundaries between nations     said carrot  almost wistfully .      is that a problem .     said leonard .     possibly something could be done .         maybe huge  really huge buildings in lines  along the frontiers     said rincewind .     or     or very wide roads .  you could paint them different colours to save confusion .         should aerial travel become widespread     said leonard     it would be a useful idea to grow forests in the shape of the name of the country  or of other areas of note .  i will bear this in mind .         i wasn   t actually sugges       carrot began .  and then he stopped  and just sighed .      on the veldt of howondaland live the n   tuitif people  the only tribe in the world to have no imagination whatsoever .   for example  their story about the thunder runs something like this     thunder is a loud noise in the sky  resulting from the disturbance of the air masses by the passage of lightning .     and their legend    how the giraffe got his long neck    runs     in the old days the ancestors of old man giraffe had slightly longer necks than other grassland creatures  and the access to the high leaves was so advantageous that it was mostly long necked giraffes that survived  passing on the long neck in their blood just as a man might inherit his grandfather   s spear .  some say  however  that it is all a lot more complicated and this explanation only applies to the shorter neck of the okapi .  and so it is .      the n   tuitif are a peaceful people  and have been hunted almost to extinction by neighbouring tribes  who have lots of imagination  and therefore plenty of gods  superstitions and ideas about how much better life would be if they had a bigger hunting ground .   of the events on the moon that day  the n   tuitif said     the moon was brightly lit and from it rose another light which then split into three lights and faded .  we do not know why this happened .  it was just a thing .      they were then wiped out by a nearby tribe who knew that the lights had been a signal from the god ukli to expand the hunting ground a bit more .  however  they were soon defeated entirely by a tribe who knew that the lights were their ancestors  who lived in the moon  and who were urging them to kill all non believers in the goddess glipzo .  three years later they in turn were killed by a rock falling from the sky  as a result of a star exploding a billion years ago .   what goes around  comes around .  if not examined too closely  it passes for justice .      few religions are definite about the size of heaven  but on the planet earth the book of revelation  ch .  xxi  v .     gives it as a cube        furlongs on a side .  this is somewhat less than                             cubic feet .  even allowing that the heavenly host and other essential services take up at least two thirds of this space  this leaves about one million cubic feet of space for each human occupant     assuming that every creature that could be called    human    is allowed in  and that the human race eventually totals a thousand times the number of humans alive up until now .  this is such a generous amount of space that it suggests that room has also been provided for some alien races or     a happy thought     that pets are allowed .      many of the things built by the architect and freelance designer bergholt stuttley     bloody stupid     johnson were recorded in ankh morpork  often on the line where it says    cause of death    .  he was  people agreed  a genius  at least if you defined the word broadly .  certainly no one else in the world could make an explosive mixture out of common sand and water .  a good designer  he always said  should be capable of anything .  and  indeed  he was .       truth .  justice .  freedom .  and a hard boiled egg .   commander  am vimes of the ankfe morpork city watch bad it all .  but now he   s back in his own rough  tough past without even the clothes he was standing tip in when the lightning struck .   living in the past is hard .  dying in the past is incredibly easy .  but he must survive  because he has a job to do .  he must track down a murderer  teach his younger self how to be a good copper and change the outcome of a bloody rebellion .  there   s a problem  if he wins  he   s got no wife  no child  no future .   a discworld tale of one city  with a full chorus of street urchins  ladies of negotiable affection  rebels  secret policemen and other children of the revolution .   plain old sam vimes had ended up with a dress uniform that at least looked as though its owner was male .  but the helmet had gold decoration  and the bespoke armourers had made a new  gleaming breastplate with useless gold ornamentation on it .  sam vimes felt like a class traitor every time he wore it .  he hated being thought of as one of those people that wore stupid ornamental armour .  it was gilt by association .         if i had a dollar for every copper   s funeral i   ve attended up here     said colon     i   d have     nineteen dollars and fifty pence .         fifty pence .     said nobby .      that was when corporal hildebiddle woke up just in time and banged on the lid     said colon .     privilege just means    private law    .  two types of people laugh at the law  those that break it and those that make it .     sweeper took a deep  long breath .     i like building gardens     he said .     life should be a garden .      vimes stared blankly at what was in front of them .     okay    he said .     the gravel and rocks  yes  i can see that .  shame about all the rubbish .  it always turns up  doesn   t it           yes     said lu tze .     it   s part of the pattern .         what .  the old cigarette packet .         certainly .  that invokes the element of air     said sweeper .      and the cat doings .         to remind us that disharmony  like a cat  gets everywhere .         the cabbage stalks .  the used sonky .            at our peril we forget the role of the organic in the total harmony .  what arrives seemingly by chance in the pattern is part of a higher organization that we can only dimly comprehend .  this is a very important fact  and has a bearing on your case .         and the beer bottle .      for the first time since vimes had met him  the monk frowned .      y   know  some bugger always tosses one over the wall on his way back from the pub on friday nights .  if it wasn   t forbidden to do that kind of thing  he   d feel the flat of my hand and no mistake .         it   s not part of the higher organization .         possibly .  who cares .         the night watch .  they were in the night watch because they were too scruffy  ugly  incompetent  awkwardly shaped or bloody minded for the day watch .  they were honest  in that special policeman sense of the word .  that is  they didn   t steal things too heavy to carry .  and they had the morale of damp gingerbread .         a copper doesn   t keep flapping his lip .  he doesn   t let on what he knows .  he doesn   t say what he   s thinking .  no .  he watches and listens and he learns and he bides his time .  his mind works like mad but his face is a blank .  until he   s ready        dr lawn opened his back door and vimes brushed past  the body over his shoulders .      you minister to all sorts  right .     said vimes .      within reason  but           this one   s an unmentionable     said vimes .     tried to kill me .  needs some medicine .         why   s he unconscious .     said the doctor .      didn   t want to take his medicine .         apart from the curfew and manning the gates  the night watch didn   t do a lot .  this was partly because they were incompetent  and partly because no one expected them to be anything else .  they walked the streets  slowly  giving anyone dangerous enough time to saunter away or melt into the shadows  and then rang the bell to announce to a sleeping world  or at any rate a world that had been asleep  the fact that all was  despite appearances  well .  they also rounded up the quieter sort of drunk and the more docile kinds of stray cattle .        what   re you going to charge our man with  sarge .     said sam .      attempted assault on a copper .  you saw the knives .      you did kick him  though .         right  i forgot .  we   ll do him for resisting arrest  too .        dr lawn put the tweezers down and pinched the bridge of his nose .     that   s it     he said  wearily .     a bit of stitching and he   ll be fine .         and there   s some others i need you to take a look at     said vimes .      you know  that comes as no surprise     said the doctor .      one   s got a lot of holes in his feet  one dropped through the privy roof and has got a twisted leg  and one   s dead .         i don   t think i can do much about the dead one     said the doctor .     how do you know he   s dead .  i realize that i may regret asking that question .         he   s got a broken neck from falling off a roof and i reckon he fell off because he got a steel crossbow bolt in his brain .         ah .  that sounds like dead  if you want my medical opinion .  did you do it .         no .         well  you   re a busy man  sergeant .  you can   t be everywhere .            i understand  havelock  that you scored zero in your examination for stealthy movement .         may i ask how you found that out  madam .         oh  one hears things     madam said lightly .      well  it was true     said the assassin .      and why was this .         the examiner thought i   d used trickery  madam .         and did you .         of course .  i thought that was the idea .         and you never attended his lessons  he said .         oh  i did .  religiously        he says he never saw you at any of them .      havelock smiled .     and your point  madam  is      .         vimes turned his back and faced the crowd .  he said     anything   s a weapon  used right .  your bell is a club .  anything that pokes the other man hard enough to give you more time is a good thing .  never  ever threaten anyone with your sword unless you really mean it  because if he calls your bluff you suddenly don   t have many choices and they   re all the wrong ones .  don   t be frightened to use what you learned when you were kids .  we don   t get marks for playing fair .  and for close up fighting  as your senior sergeant i explicitly forbid you to investigate the range of coshes  blackjacks and brass knuckles sold by mrs goodbody at no .    easy street  at a range of prices to suit all pockets  and should any of you approach me privately i absolutely will not demonstrate a variety of specialist blows suitable for these useful yet tricky instruments .         sometimes the principles behind a glorious revolution don   t stand much close examination .      i   ve got a question     said someone in the crowd of onlookers .     harry supple   s my name .  got a shoe shop in new cobblers            yes  comrade supple .         it says here in article seven of this here list       mr supple ploughed on .         people   s declaration of the glorious twenty fourth of may    said reg .      yeah  yeah  right     well  it says we   ll seize hold of the means of production  sort of thing  so what i want to know is  how does that work out regarding my shoe shop .  i mean  i   m in it anyway  right .  it   s not like there   s room for more   n me and my lad garbut and maybe one customer .         ah  but after the revolution all property will be held in common by the people     er     that is  it   ll belong to you but also to everyone else  you see .      comrade supple looked puzzled .     but i   ll be the one making the shoes .         of course .  but everything will belong to the people .         so     who   s going to pay for the shoes .     said mr supple .      everyone will pay a reasonable price for their shoes and you won   t be guilty of living off the sweat of the common worker     said reg  shortly .     now  if we           you mean the cows .     said supple .      what .         well  there   s only the cows  and the lads at the tannery  and frankly all they do is stand in a field all day  well  not the tannery boys  obviously  but           look     said reg .     everything will belong to the people and everyone will be better off .  do you understand .      the shoemaker   s frown grew deeper .  he wasn   t certain if he was part of the people .      the major was not a fool  even though he looked like one .  he was idealistic  and thought of his men as    jolly good chaps    despite the occasional evidence to the contrary  and on the whole did the best he could with the moderate intelligence at his disposal .  when he was a boy he   d read books about great military campaigns  and visited the museums and looked with patriotic pride at the paintings of famous cavalry charges  last stands and glorious victories .  it had come as rather a shock  when he later began to participate in some of these  to find that the painters had unaccountably left out the intestines .  perhaps they just weren   t very good at them .         what   s it look like to you  tom .     said the major .      we   ve lost nearly eighty men     said the captain .      what .  that   s terrible .         oh  about sixty of them are deserters  as far as i can see .  as for the rest  well  as far as i can see only six or seven of them went down to definite enemy action .  three men got stabbed in alleyways  for example .         sounds like enemy action to me .      yes  clive .  but you were born in quirm .  getting murdered in alleyways is just part of life in the big city           tom .      yes  clive .         have you ever sung the national anthem .         oh  lots of times  sir .         i don   t mean officially .         you mean just to show i   m patriotic .  good gods  no .  that would be a rather odd thing to do     said the captain .      and how about the flag .         well  obviously i salute it every day  sir .         but you don   t wave it  at all .     the major enquired .      i think i waved a paper one a few times when i was a little boy .  patrician   s birthday or something .  we stood in the streets as he rode by and we shouted    hurrah .             never since then .         well  no  clive     said the captain  looking embarrassed .     i   d be very worried if i saw a man singing the national anthem and waving the flag  sir .  it   s really a thing foreigners do .         really .  why .         we don   t need to show we   re patriotic  sir .  i mean  this is ankh morpork .  we don   t have to make a big fuss about being the best  sir .  we just know .            it   s called victory stew  sergeant     said dibbler .     tuppence a bowl or i   ll cut my throat  eh .         close enough     said vimes  and looked at the strange  and  what was worse  occasionally hauntingly familiar  lumps seething in the scum .     what   s in it .         it   s stew     explained dibbler .     strong enough to put hairs on your chest .         yes  i can see that some of those bits of meat have got bristles on them already    said vimes .      there were rules .  when you had a guild of assassins  there had to be rules which everyone knew and were never  ever broken .   an assassin  a real assassin  had to look like one     black clothes  hood  boots and all .  if they could wear any clothes  any disguise  then what could anyone do but spend all day sitting in a small room with a loaded crossbow pointed at the door .   and they couldn   t kill a man incapable of defending himself  although a man worth more than am        a year was considered automatically capable of defending himself or at least of employing people to do it for him  .   and they had to give the target a chance .       named after wallace sonky  a man without whose experiments with thin rubber pressure on the housing in ankh morpork would have been a good deal more pressing .       imagine a million clever rats .  rats that don   t run .  rats that fight     maurice  a scruffy tomcat with an eye for the main chance  has the perfect fiddle going .  he has a stupid looking kid for a piper  and he has his very own plague of rats     rats who are strangely educated  so maurice can no longer think of them as    lunch    .  and everyone knows the stories about rats and pipers     and is giving him lots of money     until they try the trick in the far flung town of bad blintz  and the nice little con suddenly goes down the drain .   someone there is playing a different tune .  a dark  shadowy tune .  something very  very bad is waiting in the cellars .  the rats must learn a new word .   evil .     everyone needs their little dreams .  if you knew what it was that people really  really wanted  you very nearly controlled them .     cats are good at steering people .  a miaow here  a purr there  a little gentle pressure with a claw     cats didn   t have to think .  they just had to know what they wanted .  humans had to do the thinking .  that   s what they were for .      everyone knew about plagues of rats .  there were famous stories about the rat pipers  who made their living going from town to town getting rid of plagues of rats .   and that  really  was it .  you didn   t need many rats for a plague  not if they knew their business .  one rat  popping up here and there  squeaking loudly  taking a bath in the fresh cream and widdling in the flour could be a plague all by himself .   after a few days of this  it was amazing how glad people were to see the stupid looking kid with his magical rat pipe .  and they were amazed when rats poured out of every hole to follow him out of the town .  they were so amazed that they didn   t bother much about the fact that there were only a few hundred rats .   they   d have been really amazed if they   d ever found out that the rats and the piper met up with a cat somewhere in the bushes out of town  and solemnly counted out the money .      there were three loud knocks from below .  they were repeated .  and then they were repeated again .  finally  malicia   s voice said     are you two up there or not .      keith crawled out of the hay and looked down .     yes     he said .      didn   t you hear the secret knock .     said malicia  staring up at him in annoyance .      it didn   t sound like a secret knock     said maurice .      it is a secret knock .     malicia snapped .     i know about these things .  and you   re supposed to give the secret knock in return .         but if it   s just someone knocking on the door in  you know  general high spirits  and we knock back  what are they going to think is up here .     said maurice .     an extremely heavy beetle .      malicia went uncharacteristically silent for a moment .  then she said     good point  good point .  i know  i   ll shout    it   s me  malicia .     and then give the secret knock  and that way you   ll know it   s me and you can give the secret knock back .  okay .         why don   t we just say    hello  we   re up here    .     said keith innocently .   malicia sighed .     don   t you have any sense of drama .        cat singing consists of standing two inches in front of other cats and screaming at them until they give in .        never rush  never run .  we don   t want to be like the first mouse  eh .         no  darktan     the rats chorused dutifully .     we don   t want to be like the first mouse .         right .  what mouse do we want to be like .         the second mouse  darktan .     said the rats  who   d had this lesson dinned into them many times .      right .  and why do we want to be like the second mouse .         because the second mouse gets the cheese  darktan .         good .     said darktan .   a young rat was holding up its paw .      yes .         er     can i ask a question  sir .         all right     he said .      er     you said the second mouse gets the cheese  sir .  but     doesn   t the first mouse get something  sir .      darktan stared at the young rat .     i can see you   re going to be a valuable addition to the squad .     he raised his voice .     squad .  what does the first mouse get .      the roar of voices made dust fall down from the ceiling .     the trap .            you were stolen away at birth  i expect  said malicia  .  you probably are the rightful king of some country  but they found someone who looked like you and did a swap .  you were probably found on a doorstep .         i was  yes     said keith .      see .  i   m always right .         what were you doing on a doorstep .     said maurice .      i don   t know .  gurgling  i expect     said keith .      there was a magic sword or a crown in the basket with you  probably .  and you   ve got a mysterious tattoo or a strange shaped birthmark  too     said malicia .      i don   t think so .  no one ever mentioned them     said keith .     there was just me and a blanket .  and a note .         a note .  but that   s important .         it said       pints and a strawberry yoghurt        said keith .         well  you probably won   t be surprised to know that i   ve got two dreadful step sisters     said malicia .     and i have to do all the chores .         gosh  really     said maurice .      well  most of the chores     said malicia  as if revealing an unfortunate fact .     some of them  definitely .  i have to clean up my own room  you know .  and it   s extremely untidy .         gosh  really .         and it   s very nearly the smallest bedroom .  there   re practically no cupboards and i   m running out of bookshelf space .         gosh  really .         and people are incredibly cruel to me .  you will note that we   re here in a kitchen .  and i   m the mayor   s daughter .  should the daughter of a mayor be expected to wash up at least once a week .  i think not .         gosh  really .         and will you just look at these torn and bedraggled clothes i have to wear .      maurice looked .  as far as he could tell  malicia   s dress was pretty much like any other dress .      here  just here     said malicia  pointing to a place on the hem which  to maurice  looked no different from the rest of the dress .     i had to sew that back myself  you know .         keith grabbed the back edge of the dresser with both hands  and braced one foot against the wall  and heaved .   slowly  like a mighty forest tree  the dresser pitched forward .  the crockery started to fall out as it tipped  plate slipping off plate in one glorious chaotic deal from a very expensive pack of cards .  even so  some of them survived the fall on to the floor  and so did some of the cups and saucers as the cupboard opened and added to the fun  but that didn   t made any difference because then the huge  heavy woodwork thundered down on top of them .   one miraculously whole plate rolled past keith  spinning round and round and getting lower on the floor with the groiyuoiyoi yooooinnnnggg sound you always get in these distressing circumstances .         do you know what an aglet is .      aglet .  aglet .  what   s an aglet got to do with anything .     snapped malicia .      it   s those little metal bits on the end of shoelaces     said maurice .      how come a cat knows a word like that .     said the girl .      everyone   s got to know something     said maurice .         they   ll tell my father i   ve been telling stories and i   ll get locked out of my room again .         you get locked out of your room as a punishment .     said maurice .      yes .  it means i can   t get at my books .  i   m rather a special person  as you may have guessed     said malicia  proudly .     of course there are no cat gods . that would be too much like     work .        when i woke up there was a rat dancing on my dressing table     said corporal knopf .     tapitty  tapitty  tap .         that   s odd     said sergeant doppelpunkt  giving his corporal a strange look .      and it was humming    there   s no business like show business    .  i call that more than just    odd    .         no  i meant it   s odd you   ve got a dressing table .  i mean  you   re not even married .            scuse me     scuse me     said a voice from beside him .  he looked down at a dirty  half scorched cat  which grinned at him .      did that cat just speak .     said the mayor .   maurice looked around .     which one .     he said .      you .  did you just talk .         would you feel better if i said no .     said maurice .         look  there   s two types of people in the world .     said malicia .     there are those who have got the plot  and those that haven   t .         the world hasn   t got a plot     said maurice .     things just     happen  one after another .         only if you think of it like that     said malicia  far too smugly in maurice   s opinion .     there   s always a plot .  you just have to know where to look .     she paused for a moment and then said     look .  that   s the word .  there   ll be a secret passage  of course .  everyone look for the entrance to the secret passage .         er     how will we know it   s the entrance to a secret passage .     said keith  looking even more bewildered than normal .     what does a secret passage look like .         it won   t look like one  of course .         oh  well  in that case i can see dozens of secret passages     said maurice .     doors  windows  that calendar from the acme poison company  that cupboard over there  that rat hole  that desk  that        you   re just being sarcastic     said malicia  lifting up the calendar and sternly inspecting the wall behind it .      actually  i was just being flippant     said maurice .     but i can do sarcastic if you like .      keith stared at the long bench which was in front of a window frosted with ancient cobwebs .      you might try to be some help     said malicia  tapping the walls .      i don   t know how to look for something that doesn   t look like the thing i   m looking for     said keith .   malicia stood back and brushed her hair out of her eyes .     this isn   t working     she said .      i suppose there might not be a secret passage .     said maurice .     i know it   s a rather daring idea  but perhaps this is just an ordinary shed .      even maurice leaned back a little from the force of malicia   s stare .      there has to be a secret passage     she said .     otherwise there   s no point .      she snapped her fingers .     of course .  we   re doing it wrong .  everyone knows you never find the secret passage by looking for it .  it   s when you give up and lean against the wall that you inadvertently operate the secret switch .      maurice looked at keith for help .  he was a human  after all .  he should know how to deal with something like malicia .  but keith was just wandering around the shed  staring at things .   malicia leaned against the wall with incredible nonchalance .  there was not a click .  a panel in the floor did not slide back .     probably the wrong place     she said .     i   ll just rest my arm innocently on this coat hook .     a sudden door in the wall completely failed to happen .     of course  it   d help if there was an ornate candlestick     said malicia .     they   re always a sure fire secret passage lever .  every adventurer knows that .         there isn   t a candlestick     said maurice .      i know .  some people totally fail to have any idea of how to design a proper secret passage     said malicia .  she leaned against another piece of wall  which had no effect whatsoever .      i don   t think you   ll find it that way    said keith  who was carefully examining a trap .      oh .  won   t i .     said malicia .     well  at least i   m being constructive about things .  where would you look  if you   re such an expert .         why is there a rat hole in a ratcatchers    shed .     said keith .     it smells of dead rats and wet dogs and poison .  i wouldn   t come near this place if i was a rat .         ye es     said malicia .     that usually works  in stories .  it   s often the stupid person who comes up with the good idea by accident .     she crouched down and peered into the hole .     there   s a sort of little lever     she said .     i   ll just give it a little push         there was a clonk under the floor  part of it swung back  and keith dropped out of sight .      oh  yes     said malicia .     i thought something like that would probably happen               now i want to ask you a question     said darktan .     you   ve been the leader for     how long .         ten years     said the mayor .      isn   t it hard .         oh  yes .  oh  yes .  everyone argues with me all the time     said the mayor .     although i must say i   m expecting a little less arguing if all this works .  but it   s not an easy job .         it   s ridiculous to have to shout all the time just to get things done     said darktan .      that   s right     said the mayor .      and everyone expects you to decide things     said darktan .      true .         the last leader gave me some advice just before he died  and do you know what it was .     don   t eat the green wobbly bit    .         good advice .     said the mayor .      yes     said darktan .     but all he had to do was be big and tough and fight all the other rats that wanted to be leader .         it   s a bit like that with the council     said the mayor .      what .     said darktan .     you bite them in the neck .         not yet     said the mayor .     but it   s a thought  i must say        it   s just all a lot more complicated than i ever thought it would be .     said darktan  bewildered .     because after you   ve learned to shout you have to learn not to .         right again     said the mayor .     that   s how it works     see the river .  see the houses .  see the people in the streets .  i have to make it all work .  well  not the river  obviously  that works by itself .  and every year it turns out that i haven   t upset enough people for them to choose anyone else as mayor .  so i have to do it again .  it   s a lot more complicated than i ever thought it would be .         what  for you too .  but you   re a human .     said darktan in astonishment .      hah .  you think that makes it easier .  i thought rats were wild and free .         hah .     said darktan .   they stared out of the window .      it   s just like i always tell my daughter     said the man .     stories are just stories .  life is complicated enough as it is .  we have to plan for the real world .  there   s no room for the fantastic        exactly    said the rat .     the thing about stories is that you have to pick the ones that last .       there   s trouble on the aching farm   nightmares spreading down from the hills .  and now tiffany aching   s little brother has been stolen by the queen of the fairies  although tiffany doesn   t think this is entirely a bad thing  .   tiffany   s got to get him back .  to help her  she has a weapon  a frying pan   her granny   s magic book  well  diseases of the sheep  actually  and        crivens .  whut aboot us  ye daftie .         oh  yes .  she   s also got the nac mac feegle  the wee free men  the fightin     thievin     tiny blue skinned pictsies who were thrown out of fairyland for being drunk and disorderly     ordinary fortune tellers tell you what you want to happen  witches tell you what   s going to happen whether you want it to or not .  strangely enough  witches tend to be more accurate but less popular .      there was a small part of tiffany   s brain that wasn   t too certain about the name tiffany .  she was nine years old and felt that tiffany was going to be a hard name to live up to .  besides  she   d decided only last week that she wanted to be a witch when she grew up  and she was certain tiffany just wouldn   t work .  people would laugh .      the teachers were useful .  they went from village to village delivering short lessons on many subjects .  they kept apart from the other travellers  and were quite mysterious in their ragged robes and strange square hats .  they used long words  like    corrugated iron    .  they lived rough lives  surviving on what food they could earn from giving lessons to anyone who would listen .  when no one would listen  they lived on baked hedgehog .  they went to sleep under the stars  which the maths teachers would count  the astronomy teachers would measure and the literature teachers would name .  the geography teachers got lost in the woods and fell into bear traps .         i would like a question answered today    said tiffany .     it   s about zoology .         zoology  eh .  that   s a big word  isn   t it .         no  actually it isn   t     said tiffany .     patronizing is a big word .  zoology is really quite short .            are you a witch .     said tiffany .     i don   t mind if you are .         what a strange question to spring on someone     said the woman .     why would i be a witch .         you   re wearing a straw hat with flowers in it .         aha .     said the woman .     that proves it  then .  witches wear tall pointy hats .  everyone knows that  foolish child .         yes  but witches are also very clever     said tiffany calmly .     they sneak about .  probably they often don   t look like witches .  and a witch coming here would know about the baron and so she   d wear the kind of hat that everyone knows witches don   t wear .         that was an incredible feat of reasoning     the woman said at last .     whatever kind of hat i   ve got on  you   d say it proves i   m a witch  yes .         well  the frog sitting on your hat is a bit of a clue  too     said tiffany .      i   m a toad  actually    said the creature  which had been peering at tiffany from between the paper flowers .   you   re very yellow for a toad .         i   ve been a bit ill     said the toad .      and you talk     said tiffany .   you only have my word for it     said the toad  disappearing into the paper flowers .     you can   t prove anything .            witches have animals they can talk to  called familiars .  like your toad there .         i   m not familiar     said a voice from among the paper flowers .     i   m just slightly presumptuous .            if you have a grandmother who can pass on her pointy hat to you  that saves a great deal of expense .  they are incredibly hard to come by  especially ones strong enough to withstand falling farmhouses .            you might make a decent witch one day    she said .     but i don   t teach people to be witches .  they learn in a special school .  i just show them the way  if they   re any good .  all witches have special interests  and i like children .         why .         because they   re much easier to fit in the oven     said miss tick .         i will give you some free advice .         will it cost me anything .         you could say it is priceless .  are you listening .         yes .         good .  now     if you trust in yourself         yes .             and believe in your dreams         yes .             and follow your star         yes .             you   ll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren   t so lazy        a lot of the stories were highly suspicious  in her opinion .  there was the one that ended when the two good children pushed the wicked witch into her own oven .  tiffany had worried about that after all that trouble with mrs snapperly stories like this stopped people thinking properly  she was sure .  she   d read that one and thought  excuse me .  no one has an oven big enough to get a whole person in  and what made the children think they could just walk around eating people   s houses in any case .  and why does some boy too stupid to know a cow is worth a lot more than five beans have the right to murder a giant and steal all his gold .  not to mention commit an act of ecological vandalism .  and some girl who can   t tell the difference between a wolf and her grandmother must either have been as dense as teak or come from an extremely ugly family .      they were all about six inches tall and mostly coloured blue  although it was hard to know if that was the actual colour of their skins or just the dye from their tattoos  which covered every inch that wasn   t covered with red hair .  they wore short kilts  and some wore other bits of clothing too  like skinny waistcoats .  a few of them wore rabbit or rat skulls on their heads  as a sort of helmet .  and every single one of them carried  slung across his back  a sword nearly as big as he was .        whut   s the plan  rob .     said one of them .      okay lads  this is what we   ll do .  as soon as we see somethin     we   ll attack it .  right .      this caused a cheer .   ach     tis a good plan     said daft wullie .     glint  glisten  glitter  gleam      tiffany thought a lot about words .     onomatopoeic     she   d discovered in the dictionary  meant words that sounded like the noise of the thing they were describing  like    cuckoo    .  but she thought there should be a word meaning    a word that sounds like the noise a thing would make if that thing made a noise even though  actually  it doesn   t  but would if it did    .   glint  for example .  if light made a noise as it reflected off a distant window  it   d go    glint .     and the light of tinsel  all those little glints chiming together  would make a noise like    glitterglitter    .     gleam    was a clean  smooth noise from a surface that intended to shine all day .  and    glisten    was the soft  almost greasy sound of something rich and oily .         what   s your name  pictsie .     she said .      no    as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock  mistress .  there   s no    that many feegle names  ye ken  so we ha    to share .         well  not as big as little jock       tiffany began .      that   d be medium sized jock  mistress     said not as big as medium  sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock .      well  not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock  i can           that   s no    as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock  mistress     said not as big as medium sized jock but bigger than wee jock jock .     ye were one jock short     he added helpfully .      there was some method in the way the nac mac feegle fought .  for example  they always chose the biggest opponent because  as rob anybody said later     it makes them easier to hit  ye ken    .  and they simply didn   t stop .  it was that which wore people down .  it was like being attacked by wasps with fists .         the thing about witchcraft     said mistress weatherwax     is that it   s not like school at all .  first you get the test  and then afterwards you spend years findin    out how you passed it .  it   s a bit like life in that respect .            and what do you really do .     said tiffany .      we look to     the edges     said mistress weatherwax .  there   re a lot of edges  more than people know .  between life and death  this world and the next  night and day  right and wrong     an    they need watchin    .  we watch    em  we guard the sum of things .  and we never ask for any reward .  that   s important .            hooses  banks  dreams     tis a    the same to us     said rob anybody .     there   s nothing we cannae get in or oot of .         except maybe pubs     said big yan .      oh  aye     said rob anybody cheerfully .     gettin    oot o    pubs sometimes causes us a cerrrtain amount o    difficulty  i   ll grant ye that .          it began as a sudden strange fancy     polly perks had to become a boy in a tarry .  slitting off her hair and wearing trousers was easy .  learning to fart and belch in public and walk like an ape took more time     and now she   s enlisted in the army  and is searching for her lost brother .   but there   s a war on .  there   s always a war on .  and polly and her fellow recruits are suddenly in the thick of it  without any training  and the enemy is hunting them .   all they have on their side is the most artful sergeant in the army and a vampire with a lust for coffee .  well     they have the secret .  and as they take the war to the heart of the enemy  they have to use all the resources of    the monstrous regiment .   and then there was the young male walk .  at least women swung only their hips .  young men swung everything  from the shoulders down .  you have to try to occupy a lot of space .  it makes you look bigger  like a tomcat fluffing his tail .  the boys tried to walk big in self defence against all those other big boys out there .  i   m bad  i   m fierce  i   m cool  i   d like a pint of shandy and me mam wants me home by nine         polly reached the troll bridge  which crossed the river in a narrow gorge .  it cost one penny to cross  or one hundred gold pieces if you had a billygoat .  trolls might not be quick thinkers but they don   t forget in a hurry  either .         ever eaten scubbo .  no .  nothing like a bowl of scubbo when you   re hungry .  you can put anything in scubbo .  pork  beef  mutton  rabbit  chicken  duck     anything .  even rats  if you   ve got    em .  it   s food for the marching man  scubbo .  got some on the boil right now .  you can have some of that  if you like .      the squad brightened up .      thoundth good     said igor .     what   th in it .         boiling water     said the corporal .     it   s what we call    blind scubbo    .         you could try scrounging something at the inn .         scrounge .     said polly .   yeah .  scrounge .  scrounge  nick  have a lend of  borrow  thieve  lift  acquire  purrrr loin .  that   s what you   ll learn  if you   re gonna survive this war .         we have to steal our food .     said maladict .      no  you can starve if that takes your fancy    said the corporal .     i   ve starved a few times .  there   s no future in it .  ate a man   s leg when we were snowed up in the ibblestarn campaign but  fair   s fair  he ate mine .         lieutenant blouse was standing in the middle of the floor in his breeches and shirtsleeves  holding a sabre .  polly was no expert in these matters  but she thought she recognized the stylish  flamboyant pose as the one beginners tend to use just before they   re stabbed through the heart by a more experienced fighter .         these are tricky times  sergeant .  command has never been so burdensome .  the great general tacticus says that in dangerous times the commander must be like the eagle and see the whole  and yet still be like the hawk and see every detail .      yessir     said jackrum .     and if he acts like a common tit  sir  he can hang upside down all day and eat fat bacon .         a woman always has half an onion left over  no matter what the size of the onion  the dish or the woman .      jackrum stepped back .     we are heading for the front  lads .  the war .  and in a nasty war  where   s the best place to be .  apart from on the moon  o    course .  no one .      slowly  jade raised a hand .      go on  then     said the sergeant .      in the army  sarge     said the troll .         cos        she began to count on her fingers .     one  you got weapons an    armour an    dat .  two  you are surrounded by other armed men .  er     many  youse gettin    paid and gettin    better grub than the people in civilian street .  er     lots  if   n you gives up  you getting taken pris   ner and dere   s rules about that like not kicking pris   ners inna head and stuff     cos if you kick their pris   ners inna head they   ll kick your pris   ners inna head so dat   s  like  you   re kickin    your own head  but dere   s no rule say you can   t kick enemy civilians inna head .  there   s other stuff too  but i ran outa numbers .            you know what most of the milit   ry training is  perks .     jackrum went on .     it   s to turn you into a man who will  on the word of command  stick his blade into some poor sod just like him who happens to be wearing the wrong uniform .  he   s like you  you   re like him .  he doesn   t really want to kill you  you don   t really want to kill him .  but if you don   t kill him first  he   ll kill you .  that   s the start and finish of it .  it don   t come easy without trainin    .         polly wondered if jackrum ever slept .  she did a spell of guard duty  and he stepped out from behind her with    guess who  perks .  you   re on lookout .  you should see the dreadful enemy before they see you .  what   re the four ss .         shape  shadow  silhouette and shine  sarge .     said polly  snapping to attention .   that caused a moment   s pause from the sergeant before he said     just knew that  did yer .         nosir .  a little bird told me when we changed guard  sir .  said you   d asked him  sir .         oh  so jackrum   s little lads are gangin    up on their kindly ol    sergeant  are they .     said jackrum .      nosir .  sharing information important to the squad in a vital survival situation  sarge .         but i see you   re not standing in a bleedin    shadow  perks  nor have you done anything to change your bleedin    shape  you   re silhouetted against the bleedin    light and your sabre   s shining like a diamond in a chimney sweep   s bleedin    ear   ole .  explain .         it   s because of the one c  sarge .     said polly  still staring straight ahead .      and that is .         colour  sarge .  i   m wearing bleedin    red and white in a bleedin    grey forest  sarge .      she risked a sideways glance .  in jackrum   s little piggy eyes there gleamed a gleam .  it was the one you got when he was secretly pleased .      ashamed of your lovely  lovely uniform  perks .     he said .      don   t want to be seen dead in it  sarge     said polly .         general tacticus said the fate of a battle may depend upon the actions of one man in the right place  sergeant     said blouse  calmly .      and having a lot more soldiers than the other bugger  sir     jackrum insisted .         is that rum  sarge .     said polly .      well done  my little bar steward .  and wouldn   t it be nice if it was rum  upon my word .  or whisky or gin or brandy .  but this don   t have none of those fancy names .  this is the genuine stingo  this is .  pure hangman .         hangman .     said shufti .      one drop and you   re dead     said polly .         all right     polly whispered .     remember  no swearing .  no weapons  either .  anyone brought a weapon .      there was a shaking of heads .      did you bring a weapon  tonk    magda .         no  polly        no item of any sort with a certain weapon like quality .     polly insisted .      no  polly    said tonker demurely .      anything  perhaps  with an edge .         oh  you mean this .         yes  magda .         well  a woman can carry a knife  can   t she .         it   s a sabre  magda .  you   re trying to hide it  but it   s a sabre .         but i   m only using it like a knife  polly        it   s three feet long  magda .         size isn   t important  polly        no one believes that .  leave it behind a tree  please .          it is an established fact that  despite everything society can do  girls of seven are magnetically attracted to the colour pink .        sir  you know you said you were going to steal a gate key off a guard and break his neck .     said polly .      indeed .         do you know how to break a man   s neck  sir .         i read a book on martial arts  perks .         but you haven   t actually done it  sir .         well  no .  i was at hq  and you are not allowed to practise on real people  perks .         look  sir  i   m just a     what is your name  please .         sam vimes .  special envoy  which is kind of like an ambassador but without the little gold chocolates .         trying to break into a fortified and heavily guarded keep  the male lieutenant blouse comes up with a cunning plan  which he explains to one of his soldiers  who  unknown to him  is really female .  this is the inexorable law of comic cross dressing      astonishingly enough  perks     said blouse     in your boyish enthusiasm you have given me a very interesting idea     because  of course  we only need one    washerwoman    to get us inside  do we not .  and if one thinks    outside of the box     the    woman    does not in fact need to be a woman .      blouse beamed .  polly allowed her brow to wrinkle in honest puzzlement .      doesn   t she  sir .     she said .     i don   t think i quite understand  sir .            she     could be a man .  one of us .  in disguise .         i   ll go     said polly quietly .      really private .  it would simply not work     said blouse .     oh  you   re brave  certainly  but what makes you think you stand a chance of passing yourself off as a woman .         well  sir     what .      blouse shook his head .     no  they would see through you in a flash .  you are a fine bunch of lads  but there is only one man here who   d stand a chance of getting away with it .  manickle .         yessir .     said shufti  rigid with instant panic .      can you find me a dress  do you think .         sir  are you telling us     you   re going to try to get in dressed as a woman .         well  i   m clearly the only one who   s had any practice     said blouse  rubbing his hands together .     at my old school we were in and out of skirts all the time .      he looked around at the circle of absolutely expressionless faces .      theatricals  you see .     he said brightly .     no gels at our boarding school  of course .  but we didn   t let that stop us .  why  my lady spritely in a comedy of cuckolds is still talked about .  no  if we need a woman  i   m your man .          eleyen year old tiffany aching wants to be a real witch .  but a real witch doesn   t casually step out of her body  leaving it empty .  tiffany does   and there   s something just waiting for a handy body to take over .  something ancient and horrible  which can   t die .  now tiffany   s got to learn to be a real witch really quickly  with the help of arch witch mistress weatherwax and the truly amazing miss level .      crivens .  and us .      oh  yes .  and the nac mac feegle   the rowdiest  toughest  smelliest bunch of fairies ever to be thrown out of fairyland for having been drunk at two in the afternoon .  they   ll fight anything      the nac mac feegle are the most dangerous of the fairy races  particularly when drunk .  they love drinking  fighting and stealing  and will in fact steal anything that is not nailed down .  if it is nailed down  they will steal the nails as well .      the origin of the nac mac feegle is lost in the famous mists of time .  they say that they were thrown out of fairyland by the queen of the fairies because they objected to her spiteful and tyrannical rule .  others say they were just thrown out for being drunk .      little is known about their religion  if any  save for one fact  they think they are dead .  they like our world  with its sunshine and mountains and blue skies and things to fight .  an amazing world like this couldn   t be open to just anybody  they say .  it must be some kind of a heaven or valhalla  where brave warriors go when they are dead .  so  they reason  they have already been alive somewhere else  and then died and were allowed to come here because they have been so good .   this is a quite incorrect and fanciful notion because  as we know  the truth is exactly the other way around .      the new boots were all wrong .  they were stiff and shiny .  shiny boots .  that was disgraceful .  clean boots  that was different .  there was nothing wrong with putting a bit of a polish on boots to keep the wet out .  but boots had to work for a living .  they shouldn   t shine .     witches were a bit like cats .  .   they didn   t much like one another   s company  but they did like to know where all the other witches were  just in case they needed them .     people in the chalk country didn   t trust witches .  they thought they danced around on moonlit nights without their drawers on .   tiffany had made enquiries about this  and had been slightly relieved to find out that you didn   t have to do this to be a witch .  you could if you wanted to  but only if you were certain where all the nettles  thistles and hedgehogs were .       if there   s one thing a feegle likes more than a party  it   s a bigger party  and if there   s anything better than a bigger party  it   s a bigger party with someone else paying for the drink .      if you want to upset a witch you don   t have to mess around with charms and spells  you just have to put her in a room with a picture that   s hung slightly crooked and watch her squirm .      rob anybody had mastered the first two rules of writing  as he understood them .      steal some paper .      steal a pencil .   unfortunately there was more to it than that .      twoshirts was just a bend in the road  with a name .  there was nothing there but an inn for the coaches  a blacksmith   s shop  and a small store with the word souvenirs written optimistically on a scrap of cardboard in the window .  and that was it .  around the place  separated by fields and scraps of woodland  were the houses of people for whom twoshirts was  presumably  the big city .  every world is full of places like twoshirts .  they are places for people to come from  not go to .      the wood was about half an hour   s walk away .  it was nothing special  as woods go  being mostly full grown beech  although once you know that beech drips unpleasant poisons on the ground beneath it to keep it clear it   s not quite the timber you thought it was .      first thoughts are the everyday thoughts .  everyone has those .  second thoughts are the thoughts you think about the way you think .  people who enjoy thinking have those .  third thoughts are thoughts that watch the world and think all by themselves .  they   re rare  and often troublesome .  listening to them is part of witchcraft .      she had a dobby stone  which was supposed to be lucky because it had a hole in it .   she   d been told that when she was seven  and had picked it up .  she couldn   t quite see how the hole made it lucky  but since it had spent a lot of time in her pocket  and then safe and sound in the box  it probably was more fortunate than most stones  which got kicked around and run over by carts and so on .       every kitchen drawer tiffany had ever seen might have been meant to be neat but over the years had been crammed with things that didn   t quite fit  like big ladles and bent bottle openers  which meant that they always stuck unless you knew the trick of opening them .         have you ever been to a circus .      once  tiffany admitted .  it hadn   t been much fun .  things that try too hard to be funny often aren   t .  there had been a moth eaten lion with practically no teeth  a tight rope walker who was never more than a few feet above the ground  and a knife thrower who threw a lot of knives at an elderly woman in pink tights on a big spinning wooden disc and completely failed to hit her every time .  the only real amusement was afterwards  when a cart ran over the clown .         he   s always talking about     his funeral .         well  it   s important to him .  sometimes old people are like that .  they   d hate people to think that they were too poor to pay for their own funeral .  mr weavall   d die of shame if he couldn   t pay for his own funeral .            we do what can be done     said miss level .     mistress weatherwax said you   ve got to learn that witchcraft is mostly about doing quite ordinary things .         and you have to do what she says .     said tiffany .      i listen to her advice     said miss level  coldly .      mistress weatherwax is the head witch  then  is she .         oh no .     said miss level  looking shocked .     witches are all equal .  we don   t have things like head witches .  that   s quite against the spirit of witchcraft .         oh  i see     said tiffany .      besides     miss level added     mistress weatherwax would never allow that sort of thing .         tiffany couldn   t help noticing that petulia had jewellery everywhere  later she found that it was hard to be around petulia for any length of time without having to unhook a bangle from a necklace or  once  an earring from an ankle bracelet  nobody ever found out how that one happened  .  petulia couldn   t resist occult jewellery .  most of the stuff was to magically protect her from things  but she hadn   t found anything to protect her from looking a bit silly .      you had to remember that pictsies weren   t brownies .  in theory  brownies would do the housework for you if you left them a saucer of milk .   the nac mac feegle     wouldn   t .      in truth  most witches could get through their whole life without having to do serious  undeniable magic  making shambles and curse nets and dreamcatchers didn   t really count  being rather more like arts and crafts  and most of the rest of it was practical medicine  common sense and the ability to look stern in a pointy hat  .  but being a witch and wearing the big black hat was like being a policeman .  people saw the uniform  not you .  when the mad axeman was running down the street you weren   t allowed to back away muttering    could you find someone else .  actually  i mostly just do  you know  stray dogs and road safety        you were there  you had the hat  you did the job .  that was a basic rule of witchery  it   s up to you .         how many fingers am i holdin    up .     he said .      five     whispered miss level .      am i .  ah  well  ye could be right  ye   d have the knowin    o    the countin        said rob .      the feegle way of reading      worrds     said rob anybody .      yes  they say       billy began .      i ken weel what they say .     snapped rob anybody .     i ha    the knowin    of the readin    .  they say        he looked up again .     ok  they say     that   s the snake  an    that   s the kinda like a gate letter  an    the comb on its side  two o    that  an    the fat man standin    still  an    the snake again  and then there   s whut we calls a    space    and then there   s the letter like a saw   s teeth  and two o    the letters that   s roound like the sun  and the letter that   s a man sittin    doon  and onna next line we ha        the man wi    his arms oot  and the letter that   s you  an    ha  the fat man again but noo he   s walkin     an    next he   s standin    still again  an    next is the comb  an    the up an    doon ziggy zaggy letter  and the man   s got his arms oot  and then there   s me  and that ziggy zaggy and we end the line with the comb again     an    on the next line we starts wi    the bendy hook  that   s the letter roound as the sun  them   s twa men sittin    doon  there   s the letter reaching ooot tae the sky  then there   s a space    cos there   s nae letter  then there   s the snaky again  an    the letter like a hoose frame  and then there   s the letter that   s me  aye  an    another fella sitting doon  an    another big roound letter  and  ha  oor ol    friend  the fat man walkin    .  the end .      he stood back  hands on hips  and demanded     there .  is that readin    i just did  or wuz it no    .       and the words were  sheep   s wool  turpentine  jolly sailor .       everyone in the mountains had heard of mistress weatherwax .  if you didn   t have respect  she said  you didn   t have anything .   they were treated like royalty  not the sort who get dragged off to be beheaded or have something nasty done with a red hot poker  but the other sort  when people walk away dazed saying     she actually said hello to me  very graciously .  i will never wash my hand again .            let   s get moving .         we haven   t even had anything to eat .     said tiffany  running after her .      i had a lot of voles last night     said mistress weatherwax over her shoulder .      yes  but you didn   t actually eat them  did you .     said tiffany .     it was the owl that actually ate them .         technic   ly yes     mistress weatherwax admitted .     but if you think you   ve been eating voles all night you   d be amazed how much you don   t want to eat anything next morning .        for an old woman mistress weatherwax could move quite fast .  she strode over the moors as if distance was a personal insult .     there were no judges  and no prizes .  the witch trials weren   t like that  as petulia had said .  the point was to show what you could do  to show what you   d become  so that people would go away thinking things like    that caramella bottlethwaite  she   s coming along nicely    .  it wasn   t a competition  honestly .  no one won .   and if you believed that you   d believe that the moon is pushed around the sky by a goblin called wilberforce .         if you don   t know when to be a human being  you don   t know when to be a witch .  and if you   re too afraid of goin    astray  you won   t go anywhere .            i   m clever enough to know how you manage not to think of a pink rhinoceros if someone says    pink rhinoceros        she managed to say aloud .      ah  that   s deep magic  that is     said granny weatherwax .      no .  it   s not .  you don   t know what a rhinoceros looks like  do you .      sunlight filled the clearing as the old witch laughed  as clear as a downland stream .      that   s right .     she said .       moist von lipwig is a con artist on          an and a fraud and a man faced with a life choice  be hanged  or put ankh morpork   s ailing postal service back on its feet .   it   s a tough decision .   but he   s got to see that the mail gets through  come rain  hail  sleet  dog the post office workers    friendly and benevolent society  the evil chairman of the grand trunk semaphore company  and a midnight killer killer .   getting a date with adora belle dearheart would be nice  too .   they say that the prospect of being hanged in the morning concentrates a man   s mind wonderfully  unfortunately  what the mind inevitably concentrates on is that it is in a body that  in the morning  is going to be hanged .         i   d get some rest if i was you  sir     cos we   re hanging you in half an hour     said mr wilkinson .      hey  don   t i get breakfast .         breakfast isn   t until seven o   clock  sir .            i   m offering you a job  mr lipwig  that of postmaster general of the ankh morpork post office .  the job  mr lipwig  involves the refurbishment and running of the city   s postal service  preparation of the international packets  maintenance of post office property  et cetera  et cetera           if you stick a broom up my arse i could probably sweep the floor  too     said moist .   lord vetinari gave him a long  long look .      well  if you wish     he said  and turned to a hovering clerk .     drumknott  does the housekeeper have a store cupboard on this floor  do you know .            i believe in freedom  mr lipwig .  not many people do  although they will of course protest otherwise .  and no practical definition of freedom would be complete without the freedom to take the consequences .  indeed  it is the freedom upon which all the others are based .         the world was blessedly free of honest men  and wonderfully full of people who believed they could tell the difference between an honest man and a crook .     he had a beard of the short bristled type that suggested that its owner had been interrupted halfway through eating a hedgehog .     a large black and white cat had walked into the room .      that   s mr tiddles  sir     said groat .      tiddles .     said moist .     you mean that really is a cat   s name .  i thought it was just a joke .         not so much a name  sir  more of a description     said groat .      before you could sell glass as diamonds you had to make people really want to see diamonds .  that was the trick  the trick of all tricks .  you changed the way people saw the world .  you let them see it the way they wanted it to be         being an absolute ruler today was not as simple as people thought .  at least  it was not simple if your ambitions included being an absolute ruler tomorrow .  there were subtleties .  oh  you could order men to smash down doors and drag people off to dungeons without trial  but too much of that sort of thing lacked style and anyway was bad for business  habit forming and very  very dangerous for your health .  a thinking tyrant  it seemed to vetinari  had a much harder job than a ruler raised to power by some idiot vote yourself rich system like democracy .  at least they could tell the people he was their fault .         looks like you   re genuine after all  then     the old man said .     one of the dark clerks wouldn   t have  done  that .  we thought you was one of his lordship   s special gentlemen  see .  no offence  but you   ve got a bit more colour than the average penpusher .         dark clerks .     said moist  and then recollection dawned .     oh     do you mean those stocky little men in black suits and bowler hats .         the very same .  scholarship boys at the assassins    guild  some of    em .  i heard that they can do some nasty things when they   ve a mind .         i thought you called them pen pushers .      yeah  but i didn   t say where  hee hee .         mr pump  a golem  points out to conman moist von lipwig the downstream consequences of what had seemed to moist to be harmless scams to separate fools from their money   you can   t just go around killing people .     shouted moist .      why not .  you do .         what .  i do not .  who told you that .         i worked it out .  you have killed two point three three eight people     said the golem calmly .      i have never laid a finger on anyone in my life  mr pump .  i may be  all the things you know i am  but i am not a killer .  i have never so much as drawn a sword .         no  you have not .  but you have stolen  embezzled  defrauded and swindled without discrimination  mr lipvig .  you have ruined businesses  and destroyed jobs .  when banks fail  it is seldom bankers who starve .  your actions have taken money from those who had little enough to begin with .  in a myriad small ways you have hastened the deaths of many .  you do not know them .  you did not see them bleed .  but you snatched bread from their mouths and tore clothes from their backs .  for sport  mr lipvig .  for sport .  for the joy of the game .      moist   s mouth had dropped open .  it shut .  it opened again .  it shut again .  you can never find repartee when you need it .      i have read the details of your many crimes  mr lipvig .  you took from others because you were clever and they were stupid .         hold on  most of the time they thought they were swindling me .         you set out to trap them  mr lipvig .        people in ankh morpork  always paid attention to people on rooftops  in case there was a chance of an interesting suicide .     by law and tradition the great library of unseen university is open to the public  although they aren   t allowed as far as the magical shelves .  they don   t realize this  however  since the rules of time and space are twisted inside the library and so hundreds of miles of shelving can easily be concealed inside a space roughly the thickness of paint .   people flock in  nevertheless  in search of answers to those questions only librarians are considered to be able to answer  such as    is this the laundry .        how do you spell surreptitious .     and  on a regular basis     do you have a book i remember reading once .  it had a red cover and it turned out they were twins .         the hub or nerve centre of the coach business was a big shed next to the stable .  it smelled   no  it stank   no  it fugged of horses  leather  veterinary medicine  bad coal  brandy and cheap cigars .  that   s what a fug was .  you could have cut cubes out of the air and sold it for cheap building material .      ankh morpork was a lot more civilized these days .  between them the watch and the guilds had settled things down enough to ensure that actually being attacked while going about your lawful business in ankh morpork was now merely a possibility instead of  as it once was  a matter of course .  and the streets were so clean now that you could sometimes even see the street .      the mended drum could be depended upon .  if someone didn   t come out of the door backwards and fall down in the street just as you passed  then there was something wrong with the world .      stanley took down  from the shelf  the book of regulations .  he turned the pages methodically until he came to the bookmark he   d put in a minute ago  on the page what to do in case of fire .   so far he   d done    upon discovery of the fire  remain calm .   now he came to    shout    fire .     in a loud  clear voice .      fire .     he shouted  and then ticked off   with his pencil .   next was     endeavour to extinguish fire if possible .   stanley went to the door and opened it .  flames and smoke billowed in .  he stared at them for a moment  shook his head  and shut the door .   paragraph   said  if trapped by fire  endeavour to escape .  do not open doors if warm .  do not use stairs if burning .  if no exit presents itself remain calm and await a  rescue or b  death .   this seemed to cover it .          anoia  a minor goddess of things that stick in drawers .  often  but not uniquely  a ladle  but sometimes a metal spatula or  rarely  a mechanical egg whisk that nobody in the house admits to ever buying .  the desperate mad rattling and cries of    how can it close on the damn thing but not open with it .  who bought this .  do we ever use it .     is as praise unto anoia .  she also eats corkscrews .      ankh morpork never slept  the city never did more than doze  and would wake up around   a . m .  for a glass of water .     ridcully practised the first available surface method of filing .        was there something else  mr stibbons .      ponder looked at his clipboard .     there   s a polite letter from lord vetinari asking on behalf of the city whether the university might consider including in its intake  oh  twenty five per cent of less able students  sir .         can   t have a bunch of grocers and butchers telling a university how to run itself  stibbons .     ridcully said firmly .     thank them for their interest and tell them we   ll continue to take one hundred per cent of complete and utter dullards  as usual .  take    em in dull  turn    em out sparklin     that   s always been the uu way .         if there   s one thing a wizard hates  it   s having to wait while the person in front of them is in two minds about coleslaw .  it   s a salad bar  they say  it   s got the kind of stuff salad bars have  if it was surprising it wouldn   t be a salad bar  you   re not here to look at it .  what do you expect to find .  rhino chunks .  pickled coelacanth .   the lecturer in recent runes ladled more bacon bits into his salad bowl  having artfully constructed buttresses of celery and breastworks of cabbage to increase its depth five times .         the grand trunk will remain closed in the interim     said lord vetinari .      it   s private property .     greenham burst out .      tyrant  remember     said vetinari .     see a pin and pick it up  and all day long you   ll have a pin .       koom valley .  that was where the trolls ambushed the dwarfs  or the dwarfs ambushed the trolls .  it was far away .  it was a long time ago .   but if he doesn   t solve the murder of just one dwarf  commander sam .  vimes of ankfe morpork city watch is going to see it fought again  right outside his office .   with his beloved watch crumbling around him and war drums sounding  he rnust unravel every clue  outwit every assassin and brave any darkness to find the solution .  and darkness is following him .   oh     and at six o   clock every day  without fail  with no excuses  he rnust go home to read where   s my cow .   with all the right farmyard noises  to his little boy .   there are some things you have to do .   vimes is chatting to his butler      tell me  willikins  did you fight much when you were a kid .  were you in a gang or anything .         i was privileged to belong to the shamlegger street rude boys  sir     said the butler .      really .     said vimes  genuinely impressed .     they were pretty tough nuts  as i recall .         thank you  sir     said willikins smoothly .     i pride myself i used to give somewhat more than i got if we needed to discuss the vexed area of turf issues with the young men from rope street .  stevedore   s hooks were their weapon of choice  as i recall .         and yours      .     said vimes  agog .      a cap brim sewn with sharpened pennies  sir .         ye gods  man .  you could put someone   s eye out with something like that .         with care  sir  yes     said willikins  meticulously folding a towel .      vimes knew all the arguments for having different species in the watch .  they were good arguments .  some of the arguments against them were bad arguments .  there were trolls in the watch  plenty of dwarfs  one werewolf  three golems  an igor and  not least  corporal nobbst            fred colon was not the greatest gift to policing .  he was slow  stolid and not very imaginative .  but he   d plodded his way around the streets for so long that he   d left a groove and somewhere inside that stupid fat head was something very smart  which sniffed the wind and heard the buzz and read the writing on the wall  admittedly doing the last bit with its lips moving .      to look at fred colon  you   d see a man who might well  if he fell over a cliff  have to stop and ask directions on the way down .             that girl you   re going out with     she   s nearly six feet tall and she   s got a bosom like     well  she   s a big girl  nobby    fred colon was at a loss .     she told me  nobby  that she   s been miss may on the centrefold of girls  giggles and garters  well  i mean     .         what do you mean  sarge .  anyway  she wasn   t just miss may  she was the first week in june as well     nobby pointed out .     it was the only way they had room .         err  well  i ask you     fred floundered     is a girl who displays her body for money the right kind of wife for a copper .  ask yourself that .      nobby   s face wrinkled up in deep thought .      is this a trick question  sarge .     he said  at last .      corporal nobbs attends a burglary at the royal art museum .      hey  this must be a clue  sarge .     said nobby .     look  someone dumped a load of stinking ol    rubbish here .         don   t touch that  please .     said sir reynold  rushing over .     that   s don   t talk to me about mondays .  it   s daniellarina pouter   s most controversial hwork .         it   s only a lot of old rubbish     nobby protested  backing away .      art is greater than the sum of its mere mechanical components  corporal     said the curator .      what about this one  then .     said nobby  pointing to the adjacent plinth .     it   s just a big stake with a nail in it .  is this art  too .         freedom .  if it hwas ever on the market  it hwould probableah fetch thirty thousand dollars     said sir reynold .      for a bit of wood with a nail in it .     said fred colon .     who did it .         after he viewed don   t talk to me about mondays .  lord vetinari graciously had ms pouter nailed to the stake by her ear     said sir reynold .     however  she did manage to pull free during the afternoon .         i bet she was mad .     said nobby .      not after she hwon several awards for it .  i believe she   s planning to nail herself to several other things .  it could be a very exciting exhibition .         colon knew in his heart that spinning upside down around a pole wearing a costume you could floss with definitely was not art  and being painted lying on a bed wearing nothing but a smile and a small bunch of grapes was good solid art  but putting your finger on why this was the case was a bit tricky .         dave said the government hushed it up .         yeah  but your mate dave says the government always hushes things up  nobby    said fred .      well  they do .         except he always gets to hear about    em  and he never gets hushed up     said fred .      i know you like to point the finger of scoff  sarge  but there   s a lot goes on that we don   t know about .         like what  exactly .     colon retorted .     name me one thing that   s going on that you don   t know about .            don   t try to put me at my ease     said vimes .     it makes me nervous when people do that .         coppers stayed alive by trickery .  that   s how it worked .  you had your watch houses with the big blue lights outside  and you made certain there were always burly watchmen visible in the big public places  and you swanked around like you owned the place .  but you didn   t own it .  it was all smoke and mirrors .  you magicked a little policeman into everyone   s head .  you relied on people giving in  knowing the rules .  but in truth a hundred well armed people could wipe out the watch  if they knew what they were doing .  once some madman finds out that a copper taken unawares dies just like anyone else  the spell is broken .      ankh morpork was built on ankh morpork .  everyone knew that .  they had been building with stone here ten thousand years ago .  as the annual flooding of the ankh brought more silt  so the city had risen on its walls until attics had become cellars .  even at basement level today  it was always said  a man with a pickaxe and a good sense of direction could cross the city by knocking his way through underground walls  provided he could also breathe mud .      blackboard monitor .  well  he had been  in that little street school more than forty five years ago .  mum had insisted .  gods knew where she   d sprung the penny a day it cost  although most of the time dame slightly had been happy to accept payment in old clothes and firewood .  numbers  letters  weights  measures  it was not what you   d call a rich curriculum .  vimes had attended for nine months or so  until the streets demanded he learn much harder and sharper lessons .  but  for a while  he   d been trusted to hand out the slates and clean the blackboard .  oh  the heady  strutting power of it  when you   re six years old .      vimes carefully lifted the top of the bacon  lettuce and tomato sandwich  and smiled inwardly .  good old cheery .  she knew what a vimes blt was all about .  it was about having to lift up quite a lot of crispy bacon before you found the miserable skulking vegetables .  you might never notice them at all .     a young man of godlike proportions    was standing in the doorway .     vimes takes parental duty seriously      he   d be home in time .  would a minute have mattered .  no  probably not  although young sam appeared to have a very accurate internal clock .  possibly even two minutes would be okay .  three minutes  even .  you could go to five  perhaps .  but that was just it .  if you could go to five minutes then you   d go to ten  then half an hour  a couple of hours     and not see your son all evening .  so that was that .  six o   clock  prompt .  every day .  read to young sam .  no excuses .  he   d promised himself that .  no excuses .  no excuses at all .  once you had a good excuse  you opened the door to bad excuses .      and the book he reads      it was called where   s my cow .   the unidentified complainant had lost their cow .  that was the story  really .   page one started promisingly   where   s my cow .   is that my cow .   it goes     baa .      it is a sheep .   that   s not my cow .   then the author began to get to grips with their material   where   s my cow .   is that my cow .   it goes     neigh .      it is a horse .   that   s not my cow .   at this point the author had reached an agony of creation and was writing from the racked depths of their soul .   where   s my cow .   is that my cow .   it goes     hruuugh .      it is a hippopotamus .   that   s not my cow .    rest assured  the cow is found .          when did you last eat .     said sybil .      i had a lettuce  tomato and bacon sandwich  dear     vimes said  endeavouring by tone of voice to suggest that the bacon had been a mere condiment rather than a slab barely covered by the bread .      i expect you jolly well did     said sybil  rather more accurately conveying the fact that she didn   t believe a word of it .     tomato ketchup is not a vegetable .        what   s the password .     vimes said quickly .   the shadowy figure  who was cloaked and hooded  hesitated .      pathword .  ecthcuthe me  i   ve got it written down thomewhere           okay  igor  come on in     said carrot .      how did you know it wath me  thur .     said igor .         i   m going to have a look for angua     said carrot .     she hasn   t slept in her bed .         but at this time of the month           i know  sir .  she hasn   t slept in her basket  either .         vetinari drummed his fingers on the table .     what would you do if i asked you an outright question  vimes .         i   d tell you a downright lie  sir        then i will not do so     said vetinari  smiling faintly .      thank you  sir .  nor will i .            we need to talk to you     said carrot .     do you want a lawyer .         no  i ate already        you eat lawyers .     said carrot .   brick gave him an empty stare until sufficient brain cells had been mustered .      what d   y   call dem fings  dey kinda crumble when you eat dem .     he ventured .   carrot looked at detritus and angua  to see if there was going to be any help there .      could be lawyers     he conceded .      dey go soggy if you dips    em in somefing     said brick .      more likely to be biscuits  then .     carrot suggested .      there was an old military saying that fred colon used to describe total bewilderment and confusion .  an individual in that state  according to fred     couldn   t tell if it was arsehole or breakfast time    .      the plain fact was that while tawneee had a body that every other woman should hate her for  she was actually very likeable .  this was because she had the self esteem of a caterpillar and  as you found out in any kind of conversation with her  about the same amount of brain .  perhaps it all balanced out  perhaps some kindly god had said to her     sorry  kid  you are going to be thicker than a yard of lard  but the good news is  that   s not going to matter           it   s the jerk syndrome .  it means     sometimes a woman is so beautiful that any man with half a brain isn   t going to think of asking her out  okay .  because it   s obvious that she   s far too grand for the likes of him .  are you with me .         i think so .         well  that   s tawneee .  and  for the purposes of this explanation  nobby has not got half a brain .  he   s so used to women saying no when he asks them out that he   s not afraid of being blown out .  so he asks her  because he figures  why not .  and she  who by now thinks there   s something wrong with her  is so grateful she says okay           needs eating up .     that was a phrase of sybil   s that got to vimes .  she   d announce at lunch     we must have the pork tonight  it needs eating up .     vimes never had an actual problem with this  because he   d been raised to eat what was put in front of him  and do it quickly  too  before someone else snatched it away .  he was just puzzled at the suggestion that he was there to do the food a favour .      when did lord vetinari sleep .  presumably the man must get his head down at some point  vimes reasoned .  everyone slept .  catnaps could get you by for a while  but sooner or later you need a solid eight hours  right .   it was almost midnight  and there was vetinari at his desk  fresh as a daisy and chilly as morning dew .      mustrum ridcully was capable of enormous powers of concentration when absolutely no alternative presented itself .         this is all rather fun     said sybil  as the coaches headed out of the city .     do you remember when we last went on holiday  sam .         that wasn   t really a holiday  dear     said vimes .      well  it was very interesting  all the same     said sybil .      yes  dear .  werewolves tried to eat me .         historical re creation .  with people dressing up and running around with blunt weapons  and people selling hot dogs  and the girls all miserable because they can only dress up as wenches  wenching being the only job available to women in the olden days .         this was a bit of a slur on nobby  vimes had to admit .  nobby was human  just like many other officers .  it was just that he was the only one who had to carry a certificate to prove it .       the better class of gods  anyway .  not the ones with the tentacles  obviously      tiffany aching put one foot wrong  made one little mistake      and now the spirit of winter is in lo love with her her .  he give her roses and iceber icebergs  says it with avalanches and showers her with snowflakes     which is tough when you   re thirteen  but also just a little bit     cool .   and just because the wintersmith wants to marry you is no excuse for neglecting the chores .  so she must look after miss treason  who   s     and has far too many eyes  learn the secret of boffo  catch horace the cheese  stop annagramm hawkin from becoming an embarrassment to all witches  avoid nanny ogg giving her a lecture on sex  stop the gods from seeing her in the bath        crivens .         oh  yes  and be helped by the nac mac feegles  whether she wants it or not .   it   s unfair  but as granny weatherwax says  no one ever said it was going to be fair .  and if tiffany doesn   t work it all out  there will never be another springtime        when the gods made sheep they must   ve left their brains in their other coat .        cackling     to a witch  didn   t just mean nasty laughter .  it meant your mind drifting away from its anchor .  it meant you losing your grip .  it meant loneliness and hard work and responsibility and other people   s problems driving you crazy a little bit at a time  each bit so small that you   d hardly notice it  until you thought that it was normal to stop washing and wear a kettle on your head .  it meant you thinking that the fact you knew more than anyone else in your village made you better than them .  it meant thinking that right and wrong were negotiable .  and  in the end  it meant you    going to the dark     as the witches said .  that was a bad road .  at the end of that road were poisoned spinning wheels and gingerbread cottages .      everyone had something inside them that told the world they were there .  that was why you could often sense when someone was behind you  even if they were making no sound at all .  you were receiving their    i am here .     signal .   some people had a very strong one .  they were the people who got served first in shops .  granny weatherwax had an    i am here    signal that bounced off the mountains when she wanted it to  when she walked into a forest  all the wolves and bears ran out the other side .      mrs earwig was all wrong to granny weatherwax .  she wasn   t born locally  which was almost a crime to begin with .  she wrote books  and granny weatherwax didn   t trust books .  and mrs earwig believed in shiny wands and magical amulets and mystic runes and the power of the stars  while granny weatherwax believed in cups of tea  dry biscuits  washing every morning in cold water and  well  she believed mostly in granny weatherwax .      most witches liked black  but miss treason even had black goats and black chickens .  the walls were black .  the floor was black .  if you dropped a stick of liquorice  you   d never find it again .  and  to tiffany   s dismay  she had to make her cheeses black  which meant painting the cheeses with shiny black wax .  it did keep them moist  but tiffany distrusted black cheeses .  they always looked as though they were plotting something .         gods  elementals  demons  spirits     sometimes it   s hard to tell    em apart wi   oot a map .         you could hear the snow falling .  it made a strange little noise  like a faint  cold sizzle .      the chalk hill feegles were more at home with the drinkin     stealin    and fightin     and rob anybody was good at all three .  but he   d learned to read and write because jeannie had asked him to .  he did them with a lot more optimism than accuracy .  when he was faced with a long sentence he tended to work out a few words and then have a great big guess .      the white kitten watched the snowflakes .  it was called you  as in    you .  stop that .     and    you .  get off there .     when it came to names  granny weatherwax didn   t do fancy .         the important thing     said miss treason     is to stay the passage of the wind .  you should avoid rumbustious fruits and vegetables .  beans are the worst  take it from me .         i don   t think i understand       tiffany began .      try not to fart  in a nutshell .         in a nutshell i imagine it would be pretty unpleasant .     said tiffany  nervously .      the feegles didn   t know the meaning of the word    fear    .  sometimes tiffany wished they   d read a dictionary .  they fought like tigers  they fought like demons  they fought like giants .  what they didn   t do was fight like something with more than a spoonful of brain .      nanny ogg was good at listening  at least .  she listened like a great big ear  and before tiffany realized it she was telling her everything .  everything .  nanny sat on the opposite side of the big kitchen table  puffing gently at a pipe with a hedgehog carved on it .  sometimes she   d ask a little question  like    why was that .     or    and then what happened .     and off they   d go again .  nanny   s friendly little smile could drag out of you things you didn   t know you knew .      from the best chair in the room of ornaments  a large grey cat watched tiffany with a half open eye that glinted with absolute evil .  nanny had referred to him as    greebo     don   t mind him  he   s just a big old softie     which tiffany knew enough to interpret as    he   ll have his claws in your leg if you go anywhere near him .        it was hard to be embarrassed by nanny ogg  because her laugh drove it away she wasn   t embarrassed about anything .     she opened the cutlery drawer for a spoon .  it stuck .  she rattled it  pulled at it and swore a few times  but it stayed stuck .      oh  yes  go ahead     said a voice behind her .     see how much help that is .  don   t be sensible and stick your hand under the top and carefully free up the stuck item .  oh no .  rattle and curse  that   s the way .      tiffany turned .   there was a skinny  tired looking woman standing by the kitchen table .  she seemed to be wearing a sheet draped around her and was smoking a cigarette .  tiffany had never seen a woman smoke a cigarette before  but especially never a cigarette that burned with a fat red flame and gave off sparks .      who are you .     she said sharply .      anoia  goddess of things that get stuck in drawers     said the woman .     pleased to meet you .         there   s a goddess just for that .     said tiffany .      well  i find lost corkscrews and things that roll under furniture     said anoia  off handedly    they want me to do stuck zips  and i   m thinking about that .  but mostly i manifest whensoever people rattle stuck drawers and call upon the gods .     she puffed on her cigarette .     got any tea .         but i didn   t call on anyone .         you did     said anoia .     you cussed .  sooner or later  every curse is a prayer .     she waved the hand that wasn   t holding the cigarette and something in the drawer went pling .     it   ll be all right now .  it was the fish slice .  everyone has one  and no one knows why .  did anyone in the world ever knowingly go out one day and buy a fish slice .  i don   t think so .        annagramma was as vain as a canary in a room full of mirrors .     roland tugged the sword out of its scabbard .  it was heavy and not at all like the flying  darting silver thing that he   d imagined .  it was more like a metal club with an edge .   he gripped it in both hands and managed to hurl it out into the middle of the slow  dark river .   just before it hit the water a white arm rose and caught it .  the hand waved the sword a couple of times  and then disappeared with it under the water .      was that supposed to happen .     he said .      a man throwin    his sword awa    .     yelled rob .     no .  ye   re no    supposed tae bung a guid sword intae the drinkie .        no  i mean the hand     said roland .     it just           ach  they turn up sometimes .     rob anybody waved a hand as if midstream underwater sword jugglers were an everyday occurrence .      when the noise had died down a bit the drummer beat the drum a few times and the accordionist played a long drawn out chord  the legal signal that a morris dance is about to begin  and people who hang around have only got themselves to blame .       it   s an offer y you can   t refuse .   who would not wish to be the man in charge of ankh morpork   s royal mint and the bank next door .   it   s a job for life .  but  as former conman moist von lipwig is learning  life is not necessarily for long .   the chief cashier is almost certainly a vampire .  there   s something nameless in the cellar  and the cellar itself is pretty nameless   and it turns out that the royal mint runs at a loss .  a three hundred year old wizar is after his girlfriend  he   s about to be exposed as a fraud  but the assassins    guild might get him first .  in fact  lots of people want him dead .   oh .  and every day he has to take the chairman for walkies .   everywhere he look looks he   s making enemies .   what he should be doing is     making money .   the guild of thieves paid a twenty dollar bounty fee for a non accredited thief brought in alive  and there were oh  so many ways of still being alive when you were dragged in and poured out on the floor .         you have an appointment now with lord vetinari     said the golem .      i   m sure i don   t .         there are two guards outside who are sure you do .         lord vetinari lifted an eyebrow with the care of one who  having found a piece of caterpillar in his salad  raises the rest of the lettuce .          the bank  was built as a temple  but never used as one .         really .     said moist .     which god .         none  as it turned out .  one of the kings of ankh commanded it to be built about nine hundred years ago     said bent .     i suppose it was a case of speculative building .  that is to say  he had no god in mind .         he hoped one would turn up .         exactly sir .         like bluetits .     said moist  peering around .     this place was a kind of celestial bird box .            it costs more than a penny to make a penny    moist murmured .     is it just me  or is that wrong .         but  you see  once you have made it  a penny keeps on being a penny    said mr bent .     that   s the magic of it .         it is .     said moist .     look  it   s a copper disc .  what do you expect it to become .         in the course of a year  just about everything     said mr bent  smoothly .     it becomes some apples  part of a cart  a pair of shoelaces  some hay  an hour   s occupancy of a theatre seat .  it may even become a stamp and send a letter  mr lipwig .  it might be spent three hundred times and yet   and this is the good part   it is still one penny  ready and willing to be spent again .  it is not an apple  which will go bad .  its worth is fixed and stable .  it is not consumed .         mr fusspot was the smallest and ugliest dog moist had ever seen .  it reminded him of those goldfish with the huge bulging eyes that look as though they are about to explode .  its nose  on the other hand  looked stoved in .  it wheezed  and its legs were so bandy that it must sometimes trip over its own feet .   the dog gave a little yappy bark and then covered moist   s face in all that was best in dog slobber .         i don   t really understand how banks work .         how do you think they work .         well  you take rich people   s money and lend it to suitable people at interest  and give as little as possible of the interest back .         yes  and what is a suitable person .         someone who can prove they don   t need the money .            old money    meant that it had been made so long ago that the black deeds which had originally filled the coffers were now historically irrelevant .  funny  that  a brigand for a father was something you kept quiet about  but a slave taking pirate for a great great great grandfather was something to boast of over the port .  time turned the evil bastards into rogues  and rogue was a word with a twinkle in its eye and nothing to be ashamed of .         i did not become ruler of ankh morpork by understanding the city .  like banking  the city is depressingly easy to understand .  i have remained ruler by getting the city to understand me .        the city bleeds  mr lipwig  and you are the clot i need .  .     the lady in the boardroom was certainly an attractive woman  but since she worked for the times moist felt unable to award her total ladylike status .  ladies didn   t fiendishly quote exactly what you said but didn   t exactly mean  or hit you around the ear with unexpectedly difficult questions .  well  come to think of it  they did  quite often  but she got paid for it .         the world is full of things worth more than gold .  but we dig the damn stuff up and then bury it in a different hole .  where   s the sense in that .  what are we  magpies .  good heavens  potatoes are worth more than gold .         surely not .         if you were shipwrecked on a desert island  what would you prefer  a bag of potatoes or a bag of gold .         yes  but a desert island isn   t ankh morpork .         and that proves gold is only valuable because we agree it is  right .  it   s just a dream .  but a potato is always worth a potato  anywhere .  a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and you   ve got a meal  anywhere .  bury gold in the ground and you   ll be worrying about thieves for ever .  bury a potato and in due season you could be looking at a dividend of a thousand per cent .            vetinari has a dog .         had .  wuffles .  died some time ago .  there   s a little grave in the palace grounds .  he goes there alone once a week and puts a dog biscuit on it .         vetinari does that .         yes .         vetinari the cool  heartless  calculating tyrant .         indeed .         don   t let me detain you .  what a wonderful phrase vetinari had devised .  the jangling double meaning set up undercurrents of uneasiness in the most innocent of minds .  the man had found ways of bloodless tyranny that put the rack to shame .      stamp collecting .  it had started on day one  and then ballooned like some huge     thing  running on strange  mad rules .  was there any other field where flaws made things worth more .  would you buy a suit just because one arm was shorter than the other .  or because a bit of spare cloth was still attached .      claud maximillian overton transpire dibbler  a name bigger than the man himself .  everyone knew c .  m .  o .  t dibbler .  he sold pies and sausages off a tray  usually to people who were the worse for drink who then became the worse for pies .      moist had eaten the odd pork pie and occasional sausage in a bun and that very fact interested him .  there was something about the stuff that drove you back for more .  there had to be some secret ingredient  or maybe the brain just didn   t believe what the taste buds told it  and wanted to feel once again that flood of hot  greasy  not entirely organic  slightly crunchy substances surfing across the tongue .  so you bought another one .   and  it had to be said  there were times when a dibbler sausage in a bun was just what you wanted .  sad  yet true .  everyone had moments like that .  life brought you so low that for a vital few seconds that charivari of strange greases and worrying textures was your only friend in all the world .      the watch armour fitted like a glove .  he   d have preferred it to fit like a helmet and breastplate .  it was common knowledge that the watch   s approach to uniforms was one size doesn   t exactly fit anybody and that commander vimes disapproved of armour that didn   t have that kicked by trolls look .  he liked it to make it clear that it had been doing its job .        i   m an igor  thur .  we don   t athk quethtionth .         really .  why not .         i don   t know  thur .  i didn   t athk .          students  eh .  love    em or hate    em  you   re not allowed to hit    em with a shovel .        i   m afraid i have to close the office now  reverend .     the voice of ms houser broke into cribbins   s dreams      ms houser was standing there  not gloriously naked and pink as so recently featured in the reverie  but in a plain brown coat and an unsuitable hat with feathers in it .      talking to the watch was like tap dancing on a landslide .  if you were nimble you could stay upright  but you couldn   t steer and there were no brakes and you just knew that it was going to end in a certain amount of fuss .      the price of a good woman was proverbially above rubies  so a bad one was presumably a lot more .      he slapped hubert twice across the face and pulled a jar out of his pocket .      mr hubert .  how many fingerth am i holding up .      hubert slowly focused .     thirteen .     he quavered .   igor relaxed  and dropped the jar back into his pocket .     jutht in time .  well done  thur .         all heads turned .  a path  in the crowd  cleared itself for lord vetinari  paths do for men known to have dungeons in their basements .         the law must be obeyed  miss dearheart  said lord vetinari  .  even tyrants have to obey the law .     he paused  looking thoughtful  and continued     no  i tell a lie  tyrants do not have to obey the law  obviously  but they do have to observe the niceties .  at least  i do .         it was   a . m .   and the fog seemed glued to the windows  so thick that it should have contained croutons .         is he allowed to do that .         i think that comes under the rule of quia ego sic dico .         yes  what does that mean .             because i say so     i think .         that doesn   t sound like much of a rule .         actually it   s the only one he needs .            every problem is an opportunity     said moist .      well  if you upset vetinari again you will have a wonderful opportunity to never have to buy a hat .         no  i think he likes a little opposition .         and are you any good at knowing how much .         no .  it   s what i enjoy .  you get a wonderful view from the point of no return .         moist von lipwig quizzes staff at the bank about the cost of making money      so how do you get paid .      there was a moment   s silence  and then mr shady said  like a man talking to a child     this is a mint  sir .         you make your own wages .  well  at least you   re in a profitable business     said moist cheerfully .     i mean  you must be making money hand over fist .         we manage to break even  sir  yes     said shady  as if it was a close run thing .      break even .  you   re a mint .     said moist .     how can you not make a profit by making money .         overheads  sir .  there   s overheads wherever you look .         even underfoot .         there too  sir     said shady .     it   s ruinous  sir  it really is .  y   see  it costs a ha   penny to make a farthin    an    nearly a penny to make a ha   penny .  a penny comes in at a penny far thin    .  sixpences costs tuppence farthin     so we   re in pocket there .  half a dollar costs seven pence .  and it   s only sixpence to make a dollar  a definite improvement  but that   s    cos we does    em here .  the real buggers are the mites     cos they   re worth half a farthin    but cost sixpence    cos it   s fiddly work  bein    so small and havin    that hole in the middle .  the thru penny bit  sir  we   ve only got a couple of people makin    those  a lot of work which runs out at seven pence .  and don   t ask me about the tuppenny piece .         what about the tuppenny piece .         i   m glad you asked me that  sir .  fine work  sir
