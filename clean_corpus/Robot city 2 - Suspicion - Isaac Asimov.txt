america                          for brian shelton and the    bruised banana         the laws of humanics  isaac asimov    i am pleased by the way in which the robot city books pick up the various themes and references in my robot stories and carry on with them .   for instance  my first three robot novels were  essentially  murder mysteries  with elijah baley as the detective .  of these first three  the second novel  the naked sun  was a locked room mystery  in the sense that the murdered person was found with no weapon on the site and yet no weapon could have been removed either .   i managed to produce a satisfactory solution but i did not do that sort of thing again  and i am delighted that mike mcquay has tried his hand at it here .   the fourth robot novel  robots and empire  was not primarily a murder mystery .  elijah baley had died a natural death at a good  old age  the book veered toward the foundation universe so that it was clear that both my notable series  the robot series and the foundation series  were going to be fused into a broader whole .   no  i didn   t do this for some arbitrary reason .  the necessities arising out of writing sequels in the     s to tales originally written in the     s and     s forced my hand .    in robots and empire  my robot character  giskard  of whom i was very fond  began to concern himself with    the laws of humanics     which  i indicated  might eventually serve as the basis for the science of psychohistory  which plays such a large role in the foundation series .   strictly speaking  the laws of humanics should be a description  in concise form  of how human beings actually behave .  no such description exists  of course .  even psychologists  who study the matter scientifically  at least  i hope they do  cannot present any    laws    but can only make lengthy and diffuse descriptions of what people seem to do .  and none of them are prescriptive .  when a psychologist says that people respond in this way to a stimulus of that sort  he merely means that some do at some times .  others may do it at other times  or may not do it at all .   if we have to wait for actual laws prescribing human behavior in order to establish psychohistory  and surely we must  then i suppose we will have to wait a long time .   well  then  what are we going to do about the laws of humanics .  i suppose what we can do is to start in a very small way  and then later slowly build it up  if we can .   thus  in robots and empire  it is a robot  giskard  who raises the question of the laws of humanics .  being a robot  he must view everything from the standpoint of the three laws of robotics     these robotic laws being truly prescriptive  since robots are forced to obey them and cannot disobey them .   the three laws of robotics are         a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .         a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .         a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .   well  then  it seems to me that a robot could not help but think that human beings ought to behave in such a way as to make it easier for robots to obey those laws .   in fact  it seems to me that ethical human beings should be as anxious to make life easier for robots as the robots themselves would .  i took up this matter in my story    the bicentennial man     which was published in      .  in it  i had a human character say in part      if a man has the right to give a robot any order that does not involve harm to a human being  he should have the decency never to give a robot any order that involves harm to a robot  unless human safety absolutely requires it .  with great power goes great responsibility  and if the robots have three laws to protect men  is it too much to ask that men have a law or two to protect robots .      for instance  the first law is in two parts .  the first part     a robot may not injure a human being     is absolute and nothing need be done about that .  the second part     or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm     leaves things open a bit .  a human being might be about to come to harm because of some event involving an inanimate object .  a heavy weight might be likely to fall upon him  or he may slip and be about to fall into a lake  or any one of uncountable other misadventures of the sort may be involved .  here the robot simply must try to rescue the human being  pull him from under  steady him on his feet and so on .  or a human being might be threatened by some form of life other than human     a lion  for instance     and the robot must come to his defense .   but what if harm to a human being is threatened by the action of another human being .  there a robot must decide what to do .  can he save one human being without harming the other .  or if there must be harm  what course of action must he pursue to make it minimal .   it would be a lot easier for the robot  if human beings were as concerned about the welfare of human beings  as robots are expected to be .  and  indeed  any reasonable human code of ethics would instruct human beings to care for each other and to do no harm to each other .  which is  after all  the mandate that humans gave robots .  therefore the first law of humanics from the robots    standpoint is         a human being may not injure another human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   if this law is carried through  the robot will be left guarding the human being from misadventures with inanimate objects and with non human life  something which poses no ethical dilemmas for it .  of course  the robot must still guard against harm done a human being unwittingly by another human being .  it must also stand ready to come to the aid of a threatened human being  if another human being on the scene simply cannot get to the scene of action quickly enough .  but then  even a robot may unwittingly harm a human being  and even a robot may not be fast enough to get to the scene of action in time or skilled enough to take the necessary action .  nothing is perfect .   that brings us to the second law of robotics  which compels a robot to obey all orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .  this means that human beings can give robots any order without limitation as long as it does not involve harm to a human being .   but then a human being might order a robot to do something impossible  or give it an order that might involve a robot in a dilemma that would do damage to its brain .  thus  in my short story    liar .      published in       i had a human being deliberately put a robot into a dilemma where its brain burnt out and ceased to function .   we might even imagine that as a robot becomes more intelligent and self aware  its brain might become sensitive enough to undergo harm if it were forced to do something needlessly embarrassing or undignified .  consequently  the second law of humanics would be         a human being must give orders to a robot that preserve robotic existence  unless such orders cause harm or discomfort to human beings .   the third law of robotics is designed to protect the robot  but from the robotic view it can be seen that it does not go far enough .  the robot must sacrifice its existence if the first or second law makes that necessary .  where the first law is concerned  there can be no argument .  a robot must give up its existence if that is the only way it can avoid doing harm to a human being or can prevent harm from coming to a human being .  if we admit the innate superiority of any human being to any robot  which is something i am a little reluctant to admit  actually   then this is inevitable .   on the other hand  must a robot give up its existence merely in obedience to an order that might be trivial  or even malicious .  in    the bicentennial man     i have some hoodlums deliberately order a robot to take itself apart for the fun of watching that happen .  the third law of humanics must therefore be         a human being must not harm a robot  or  through inaction  allow a robot to come to harm  unless such harm is needed to keep a human being from harm or to allow a vital order to be carried out .   of course  we cannot enforce these laws as we can the robotic laws .  we cannot design human brains as we design robot brains .  it is  however  a beginning  and i honestly think that if we are to have power over intelligent robots  we must feel a corresponding responsibility for them  as the human character in my story    the bicentennial man    said .   certainly in robot city  these are the sorts of rules that robots might suggest for the only human beings on the planet  as you may soon learn .       chapter    parades    it was sunset in the city of robots  and it was snowing paper .   the sun was a yellow one and the atmosphere  mostly nitrogen oxygen blue  was flush with the veins of iron oxides that traced through it  making the whole twilight sky glow bright orange like a forest fire .   the one who called himself derec marveled at the sunset from the back of the huge earthmover as it slowly made its way through the city streets  crowds of robots lining the avenue to watch him and his companions make this tour of the city .  the tiny shards of paper floated down from the upper stories of the crystal like buildings  thrown  for reasons that escaped derec  by the robots that crowded the windows to watch him .   derec took it all in  sure that it must have significance or the robots wouldn   t do it .  and that was the only thing he was sure of   for derec was a person without memory  without notion of who he was .  worse still  he had come to this impossible world  unpopulated by humans  by means that still astounded him  and he had no idea  no idea  of where in the universe he was .   he was young  the cape of manhood still new on his shoulders  and he only knew that by observing himself in a mirror .  even his name   derec   wasn   t really his .  it was a borrowed name  a convenient thing to call himself because not having a name was like not existing .  and he desperately wanted to exist  to know who  to know what he was .   and why .   beside him sat a young woman called katherine burgess  who had said she   d known him  briefly  when he   d had a name .  but he wasn   t sure of her  of her truth or her motivations .  she had told him his real name was david and that he   d crewed on a settler ship  but neither the name nor the classification seemed to fit as well as the identity he   d already been building for himself  so he continued to call himself by his chosen name  derec  until he had solid proof of his other existence .   flanking the humans on either side were two robots of advanced sophistication  derec knew that  but didn   t know how he knew it  .  one was named euler  the other rydberg  and they couldn   t  or wouldn   t  tell him any more than he already knew   nothing .  the robots wanted information from him  however .  they wanted to know why he was a murderer .   the first law of robotics made it impossible for robots to harm human beings  so when the only other human inhabitant of robot city turned up dead  derec and katherine were the only suspects .  derec   s brief past had not included killing  but convincing euler and rydberg of that was not an easy task .  they were being held  but treated with respect   innocent  perhaps  until proven guilty .   both robots had shiny silver heads molded roughly to human equivalent .  both had glowing photocells where eyes would be .  but where euler had a round mesh screen in place of a human mouth  rydberg had a small loudspeaker mounted atop his dome .      do you enjoy this  friend derec .     euler asked him  indicating the falling paper and the seemingly endless stream of robots that lined the route of their drive .   derec had no idea of what he was supposed to enjoy about this demonstration  but he didn   t want to offend his hosts  who were being very polite despite their accusations .     it   s really  .   .   .  very nice     he replied  brushing a piece of paper off his lips .      nice .     katherine said from beside him  angry .     nice .     she ran fingers through her long black hair .     i   ll be a week getting all this junk out of my hair .         surely it won   t take you that length of time     rydberg said  the speaker on his head crackling .     perhaps there   s something i don   t understand  but it seems from a cursory examination that it shouldn   t take you any longer than  .   .   .          all right     katherine said .     all right .           .   .   .  one or two hours .  unless of course you   re speaking microscopically  in which case  .   .   .          please     she said .     no more .  i was mistaken about the time .         our studies of human culture     euler told derec     indicate that the parade is indigenous to all human civilizations .  we very much want to make you feel at home here  our differences notwithstanding .      derec looked out on both sides of the huge  open air  v shaped mover .  the robots lining the streets stood quite still  their variegated bodies giving no hint of curiosity  though derec felt it quite possible that he and katherine were the first humans many of them had ever seen .  knowing nothing  derec knew nothing of parades  but it seemed to be a friendly enough ritual  except for the paper  and it made him feel good that they should want him to feel at home .      is it not customary to wave .     euler asked .      what .     derec replied .      to wave your arm to the crowd     euler explained .     is it no customary .         of course     derec said  and waved on both sides of the machine that clanked steadily down the wide street  the robots returning the gesture with more nonreadable silence .      don   t you feel like a proper fool .     katherine asked  scrunching up her nose at his antics .      they   re just trying to be hospitable     derec replied .     with the trouble we   re in here  i don   t think it hurts to return a friendly gesture .         is there some problem  friend katherine .     euler asked .      only with her mouth     derec replied .   rydberg leaned forward to stare intently at katherine   s face .     is there something we can do .         yeah     the girl answered .     get me something to eat .  i   m starving .      rydberg swiveled his head toward euler .     another untruth     he said .     this is very discouraging .         what do you mean .     derec asked .      our hypotheses concerning the philosophical nature of humanics     rydberg said     must have their foundation in truth among species .  twice katherine has said things that aren   t true  .   .   .          i am starving .     katherine complained .        .   .   .  and how can any postulate be universally self evident if the postulators do not adhere to the same truths .  perhaps this is the mark of a murderer .         now wait a minute     derec said .     all humans make  .   .   .  creative use of the language .  it   s no proof of anything .      rydberg examined katherine   s face closely .  then he pressed a pincer to her bare arm  the place turning white for a second before resuming its natural color .     you say you are starving  but your color is good  your pulse rate strong and even  and you have no signs of physical deterioration .  i must conclude  reluctantly  that you are not starving .         we are hungry  though     derec said .     please take us where we might eat .      katherine fixed him with a sidelong glance .     and do it quickly .         of course     euler said .     you will find that we are fully equipped to deal with any human emergency here .  this is to be the perfect human world .         but there are no humans here     derec said .      no .         are you expecting any .         we have no expectations .         oh .      euler directed the spider like robot guiding the mover  and the machine turned dutifully at the next corner  taking them down a double width street that was bisected by a large aqueduct  whose waters had turned dark under the ever deepening twilight .   derec sat back and stole a glance at katherine  but she was busily pulling bits of paper from her hair and didn   t notice him .  he had a million questions  but they seemed better left for later .  as it was  he had conflicting emotions to analyze and react to within himself .   he was a nonperson whose life had begun scant weeks before  when he   d awakened without past or memory to find himself in a life support pod  stranded upon an asteroid that was being mined by robots .  they had been searching for something  something he had accidentally stumbled upon   the key to perihelion  at least one of the seven keys to perihelion .  it had seemed of incredible import to the robots on the asteroid .  unfortunately  he had had no idea of what the keys to perihelion were or what to do with them .   after that was the bad time .  the asteroid was destroyed by aranimas  an alien space raider  who captured derec and tortured him for information about the key  information that derec could not supply .  there he had met katherine  just before the destruction of aranimas   s vessel and their dubious salvation at the hands of the spacers    robots .   the spacers also wanted the key  though their means of attaining it seemed slightly more civilized and bureaucratic than aranimas   s .  katherine and derec were polite prisoners of bureaucracy for a time on rockliffe station  their personalities clashing until they were forced to form an alliance with wolruf  another alien from aranimas   s ship  to escape their gentle captivity with the key .   they found that if they pressed the corners of the silver slab and thought themselves away from the spacer station  they were whisked bodily to a dark gray void that they assumed to be perihelion .  pressing the corners again  another thought brought them to robot city .  and then their thinking took them no farther  stranding them in a world populated by nothing but robots .   and that was it  the sum total of derec   s conscious life .  he had reached several conclusions  though  scant as his reserve of information was  first  he had an innate knowledge of robots and their workings  though he had no idea from where his knowledge emanated  next  katherine knew more about him than she was willing to tell  finally  he couldn   t escape the feeling that he was here for a purpose  that this was all some elaborate test designed especially for him .   but why .  why .   it was worlds that were being turned here  physical and spatial laws that were being forced upside down   all for him .  nothing made sense .   and then there was the key  the object that everyone wanted  the object that was safely hidden by the person who couldn   t control it .  the robots here didn   t know he had it .  were they looking for it  too .  he   d have to find out .  the key seemed to be the one strain that held everything else together .   keeping that in mind  he determined to move slowly  to try always to get more in the way of information than he gave .  he   d been at a disadvantage for the entire length of his memory .  from this point  he wanted to keep the upper hand as far as possible .   but there was  of course  the murder .     derec stood on the balcony of the apartment given to him and katherine by the robots  looking out over the night city .  a stiff  cold wind had come up  the starfield totally obscured by dark  angry clouds that seemed to boil up out of nowhere .  lightning flashed in the distance  electrons seeking partner protons on the surface .  it was a beautiful sight  and frightening .  derec watched the distant buildings light to near daytime before plunging once more into darkness .      there     he said  pointing to a distant tower .     it wasn   t there a centad ago .      katherine walked up beside him  leaning against the balcony rail .     where was it .     she asked  mocking .      it wasn   t anywhere     he replied  turning to take her by the shoulders .     it didn   t exist .         that   s impossible     she replied  then turned and walked back into the large  airy apartment that sat at the top of another tower like the one derec said had sprung from nowhere .     i wish they   d get here with our food .         they   re probably fixing us something extra special     derec said  joining her in the living room .     and impossible seems to be the way of our lives right now  doesn   t it .  i   m telling you  katherine  that along with everything else that doesn   t make sense  this  .   .   .  city is growing  changing right before our eyes .         how can that be .     she asked  and looked around uneasily .     i mean  .   .   .  cities are built  aren   t they .  they don   t just grow .      derec stared a circle around the room .  it was hexagonal  like standing on the inside of a crystal  with no visible line of demarcation for the ceilings and floor .  the furniture seemed to flow from the walls  as the table seemed to flow upward from the floor .  light concentrated from the ceiling and lit the room comfortably  but it seemed the ceiling itself that was alight  with no external apparatus to make it happen .      look around you     derec said .     everything   s connected to everything else  and connected seamlessly .  and it all seems to be made from the same material .     he walked to a sofa that flowed out of the wall and sat on the cushion that formed its base .     comfortable     he said     but i think it   s made from the same material as the harder stuff   some kind of steel and plastic alloy   just in different measure .      katherine had walked to the table and was staring at it .     if you look closely     she said     you can see a pattern to the material .      derec stood and walked up beside her  leaning down on the table to get a close look .  the pattern was faint  but readable .  the table was made up of a collection of trapezoidal shapes  interwoven and repeated over and over .      interesting     derec said .      how so .         is the shape familiar to you .     she narrowed her brows in concentration for a moment  then looked at him with wide eyes .     the same shape as the key     she said .   he nodded .   katherine left him standing there and hurried back out to the balcony .      it   s almost like individual pieces stuck together     he called to her .     i wonder how they connect  .   .   .          it   s gone .     she shrieked  and derec hurried onto the balcony .     your tower from before  it   s gone .         no it   s not     he said  pointing farther to the east .      it   s moved .      he shook his head .     i don   t think so .     he pointed to the huge  pyramidal structure that dominated the landscape to the west .  it was at the top of that place where they were first brought by the key .     that   s the only building i think doesn   t change .  and we couldn   t see it from the balcony a moment ago .         you mean  we   ve changed .         something like that .      she put a hand to her head .     i didn   t see  .   .   .  feel  i  .   .   .          it   s kind of like watching clouds     he said .     if you stare at them from moment to moment  they seem to be solid and stationary  but once you turn away and then look back  they   ve changed .  it   s almost like some sort of evolutionary growth  .   .   .          in a building .         if you stay out there much longer  you will probably get wet     came a voice from behind them .  they turned to see euler   s glowing eyes staring at them in the darkness .      we   ve gotten wet before     katherine returned  looking past euler to the food being set out on their table .     ah  a last meal for the condemned .         the rain here is particularly cool     the robot said  and watched as katherine shoved past him and ran into the dining area     perhaps uncomfortably cool for the human body temperature .      thunder rumbled loudly in the distance  a brilliant shaft of lightning striking the top of the towering pyramid .  derec turned from the spectacle and moved toward the doorway  euler stepping aside to let him pass .   he walked to the table  sitting across from katherine  who was already piling food from a large golden bowl onto her plate  also gold colored .  the food seemed to be of a uniform  paste like consistency  its color drifting somewhere between blue and gray .  golden cups filled with water sat beside the plates .      are these utensils made of gold .     derec asked  clanging a spoon melodiously against his plate .      correct     rydberg said .     it   s a relatively useless soft metal that is a by product of our mining operations .  its one major virtue besides its use as a conductor is the fact that it doesn   t tarnish  making it ideal for human eating utensils .  we made these things for david   s visit .      derec watched the serving spoon slip from katherine   s grasp to clang loudly against her plate .  and for just a second her face turned white .      that   s what you told me my name was     derec said  finding the coincidence a little too close for his comfort .   she fixed him with unfocused eyes  then shrugged  looking normal again .     it   s a common enough name on spacer worlds     she said  returning her attention to her plate .   she picked up the spoon and went back to the job at hand .  derec looked up at the robots who stood beside the table and the small servo type i   robot waiting patiently near the door for the return of the utensils .      would you care to sit with us while we eat .     derec asked  and felt katherine kick him under the table .      delighted     euler said without hesitation  and the two robots sat at table attentively  apparently enjoying in their way the human familiarity .   derec took the serving spoon and began filling his own plate .     i take it that david was the other human who came here .     he asked .      that is correct     rydberg said .      then he came in a ship .     derec pressed .      no     euler said .     he simply walked into the city one day .         from where .         i don   t know .         aaaahhh .     katherine yelled  spitting out food and grabbing for the glass of water  drinking furiously .  the robots swiveled their heads to watch  then exchanged glances .     are you trying to feed us or kill us .     she demanded .      our programming would never allow us to kill you     rydberg said .     that would be quite impossible .      derec tentatively dipped his spoon into the porridge like mixture  taking a small bite .  not sour  not sweet  it simply had a strange  alien taste accompanied by a slight noxious odor  one he was also uncomfortable with .      this stuff stinks .     katherine said loudly  the robots looking at her  then turning expectantly toward derec .      she   s right     derec replied .     what is this .         a perfect  nontoxic mixture of local plant matter  high in protein and balanced carbohydrates     rydberg said .     it   s good for you .         the other human ate this .     derec asked .      quite enthusiastically     euler said .      no wonder he   s dead     katherine muttered .     this is simply unacceptable .  you   re going to have to find us something else  something that tastes good .      derec took another bite  this time holding his nose .  disassociating the smell from the food helped some  but not too much .  the gruel left an unpleasant aftertaste .  how could the other man have eaten it and not complained .  less made sense all the time .      how long before you can get us something else .     derec asked .      tomorrow .     rydberg suggested .     although they were proud of this in food services .  finding something of equal nutritional value will be difficult .         forget nutritional value to a degree     derec said .     study other human foods and see how well those can be duplicated exactly with the know how you have here .     he looked at katherine .     we should probably try and choke some of this down to keep our strength .      she nodded grimly .     i   d already figured that     she said  and looked at rydberg .     bring me lots of water .      the robot hurried to comply  fetching a gold pitcher from the servo cart and refilling her cup .      when did he die  this david .     derec asked  holding his nose and taking another bite .      seven days ago     rydberg said  sitting again and carefully positioning the pitcher within everyone   s easy reach on the table .      well  that rules us out as suspect then     derec said happily .     we didn   t arrive here until last night .         you   ll have to excuse me     rydberg said politely     but katherine has already exhibited a penchant for speaking less than honestly           what   s that supposed to mean .     katherine said angrily .      no disrespect intended     rydberg said .     it is simply the case that your veracity must be in question in light of our conversations of this afternoon .  at this point  we don   t know if we can trust anything either of you says .         we don   t even know where this place is     derec said .      then how did you get here .     euler asked  swiveling his head to stare directly at derec .      i  .   .   .      derec began  then stopped himself .  he wasn   t ready to admit any knowledge of the key .  it was their only weapon  their only potential salvation  he couldn   t give it over so early in the game .     i don   t know .      rydberg stared for several seconds before saying     to believe you means that you either materialized out of the ether or were somehow brought here totally without your knowledge or consent .      derec responded by taking the conversation away from the robot   s control .     you say this david also seemed to appear out of nowhere .  did you ever question him about his origins .         yes     euler said simply .      and you know nothing about his background     derec said  trying to keep his mind off the food by concentrating on the investigation .  across from him  katherine was swallowing her food whole and washing it down with large gulps of water .     how was he dressed .         he was naked     euler said .     and he stayed naked .      the two humans shared a look .  nudity was common and casual on many spacer worlds  but the climate here would hardly recommend it .     when can we see the body .     derec asked .      that   s not possible     euler told her .      why .         i cannot tell you why .         cannot or will not .     derec asked  exasperated .      cannot and will not     euler replied .      then how do you expect us to investigate the cause of death .     kate asked .      if either or both of you are the murderers     euler said     you already know the cause of death .         you   ve already decided our guilt     derec said  pointing .     that   s not fair or just .         there are no other possibilities     rydberg said .      when the possible has been exhausted     derec replied     it is time to examine the impossible .  we are innocent  and you can   t prove that we aren   t .  it only follows that the death was caused by something else .         humans can murder     euler said  as thunder crashed loudly outside .     humans can lie .  you are the only humans here  and murder has been done .         we came out of nowhere     derec returned .     so did david .  others could also have come out of nowhere  others you haven   t discovered yet .  why  had we committed a murder  would we stay around for you to catch .      the robots looked at one another again .     you raised logical questions that must be answered     euler said .     we certainly sanction your investigation .         how can we investigate without full access .         with all the other resources at your command     rydberg said  then stood .     are you finished eating .         for now     derec said .     we   ll want real food tomorrow  though .         we will do our best     euler said  and he  also  stood .     until then  you will stay here .         i thought i might go out     derec said .      the rains will come .  it   s too dangerous .  for your own safety  you will stay here tonight .  we have found that we cannot be certain if what you tell us is correct  so we   re leaving a robot at the door to make certain you stay in .         you don   t know that we   ve done anything wrong .  you can   t treat us like prisoners     katherine said .      and we shall not     rydberg said  moving toward the door  the servo whirred up to the table  its metal talons pulling the bowls and plates into its innards .      there are many things we need to talk with you about     derec said .      tomorrow will be the time     euler said .     we will have a long interview at a prescribed time  where many issues will be discussed .  until then  we cannot fit it into our schedule .  we are currently quite busy .     the robots turned to go .      a couple of questions first     derec said  hurrying to put himself between the door and the robots .     you say we aren   t prisoners  yet you have locked us up .  how long do we have to stay in this place .         until it is safe     rydberg said .      then if you do let us out     derec persisted     how can you be sure we won   t try to escape .         we will have to keep a very close watch on you     euler replied .   with that  the robot firmly  but gently  pushed derec aside and moved out the door  the servo following quickly behind .  derec tried to follow them out  but a squared off utility robot blocked his path  its body streaked with random bands of different colored paints like the colors on an artist   s pallet .      stand aside     derec told the machine .      it is dangerous for you outside .  i am to keep you inside where it is safe  and have no more conversation with you lest you try and deceive me .         me .     derec said .     deceive .      the robot pushed the door stud and the unit slid closed .  derec turned to katherine .     what do you make of it .      she moved to sit on the sofa  then stretched out  looking tired .     we   re being held prisoner by a bunch of robots with no one in charge     she said  sighing deeply .     the dead man was an exhibitionist who could  apparently  eat anything .  they want us to prove our innocence  but refuse to let us see the body or investigate .     she sat up abruptly  eyes narrowing .     derec  we   ve got to get out of here .         they won   t do anything to us without proof of our guilt     derec replied .     it   s not in their nature .  we   ll stay around and get this straightened out .  then they   ll be happy to send us on our way .  besides  this place has got me really curious .  how does it work  .   .   .  why does it work .      she lay down again  staring at the ceiling .     i   m not so sure they   d really let us leave     she said  voice distant .     i think we   ve stumbled into something completely crazy .  a robot world without humans could take any sort of bizarre turn .         but not a  .   .   .  what did you say  .   .   .  completely crazy turn     he replied .     they can   t be crazy  there   s no logic to crazy .  besides  what makes you think we   ve stumbled into anything .  we were brought here  plain and simple  for a reason that hasn   t been made clear yet .  maybe a little time here will help us ferret it out .         you ferret it out     she said .     i   m tired .         well  i   m not .     he moved to the balcony  feeling the stiff wind on his face as the light show continued to rage outside .     i   m going out tonight and do a little poking around .      she was up from the couch  moving toward him .     they said it was dangerous     she said quietly  a hand going to his forearm .     go out tomorrow .         under their watchful eye .     he said  then shook his head .     we need to get around on our own  and this is the time .  besides  a little rain can   t hurt me .         stay     she said .     i   m afraid         you .     he laughed .     afraid .      she pulled her hand away .     all right     she said .     go out and get yourself killed .  i   m tired of looking out for you anyway .         you   re angry .         and you   re an idiot .     she turned from him and stared out across the magnificent city  realizing that its beauty was for them alone to appreciate .  there was something unutterably sad about that .     how will you get past the door guard .         we   ll take his advice and deceive him     derec said .      we .         will you help me .      she turned and walked back into the apartment .     anything to get you out of my hair     she said over her shoulder .   derec   s plan was simple enough  but it was one he could use only once .  the robots learned quickly enough of human duplicity  arming themselves with the knowledge as a protection .  but just this once  it might work .   he crouched beside the sofa  knotting into a tight ball .  just as soon as he was well out of sight of the door  kate took a deep breath and tried to open it   locked .   she shrugged once in derec   s direction  then began screaming in terror .  a second later the door slid open  the utility robot blocking the entry .      what   s wrong .         it   s derec .     she cried  pointing .     he fell from the balcony .      without hesitation  the robot rolled into the room  ready to check her story for lies and deceit .  he quickly moved toward the balcony  leaning way over the edge to get a look into the night .   derec jumped up from behind the couch and hurried quietly out the door and into the elevator that took him all the way to the ground and his first positive step in uncovering the mystery of robot city .  he was free  but what that meant here he could only guess .       chapter    the sluice    derec exited onto the wide street  hurrying across it to the shadows of buildings a half a block away .  from there he took a few minutes to turn back and study the surroundings he had just left behind  trying to memorize the positions and shapes of the buildings near his tower .  if his feelings were correct and the city was evolving outward  finding his way back could be a difficult  if not impossible  task .  he didn   t worry too much about it  though .  he felt completely safe in this world of robots and figured that if he got lost  he   d simply turn himself in to the nearest robot of decent sophistication and be sent back .   that dwelt upon  he turned his attention completely to exploring the new world that an unseen fate had guided him to .  in his current pristine state of innocence and awareness  it was difficult for derec not to see the hand of destiny in his wanderings .  it was as if his amnesia was an emotional and intellectual purging of sorts  set in motion to prepare him for a journey of which robot city could be only a part .  since that was the only feeling or need he had to work with  he plunged himself into it with relish  enthusiasm  and as much good humor as he could muster .  katherine would never understand his feelings in this matter  but then katherine had a life to go back to and memories to sustain her .  for derec  this was it  his whole world  and he wanted to know as much about it as he possibly could .   the city stretched all around him like some magnificent clockwork .  the shapes of the buildings  from towering spires to squat storage warehouses  were all precise and multifaceted  like growing crystals .  and the shapes seemed to be designed as much for aesthetic pleasure as pragmatic necessity .  this concept formed the core of a theory within derec   s mind  and one that he would want to explore in greater detail when he had time for reflection .  for nothing exists in a vacuum .  robots were not motivated independently by unreasoning emotion .  they had to have reasons for their actions  and by what derec had seen  their actions were all directed absolutely  despite rydberg   s claims of autonomy .   the cold winds sliced through him like a knife through water  and the sky rumbled and quaked  yet all around him he watched a furious activity that kept the mechanism of robot city moving to its own internal rhythm and purpose .  hundreds of robots filled the streets around him  all moving and directed .  all ignored his presence .   streets were cleaned  even as spray painting was conducted on dull sheened buildings  the sprayers held close to the target in the stiff wind   which probably explained the bands of paint on the utility robot that guarded the humans .  converted mining cars sped by  filled with broken equipment and scrap metal  their beamed headlights illuminating the streets before them like roving mechanical fireflies .  once he took to the shadows as a whole squad of drones  accompanied by a supervisor robot he hadn   t seen before  drove past in an open bed equipment mover and passed his position without a look before disappearing around a distant corner .  he thought about following them  but decided that he would continue exploring slowly at first  getting a feel for his world and its parameters .   the questions in his mind seemed endless  and their answers only led to more questions .  who began robot city  and why did the robots not know of their own origin .  why this place  this particular planet .  why a city of human proportions for a world of the nonhuman .  euler had called robot city the perfect place for humans   why .  the murder  to derec  was nothing but a small nuisance with large complications .  what really interested him was the motivation behind the city itself .   the lousy food raised a great many further questions in his mind .  spacer robots were designed solely as mechanical helpmates to human masters .  spacer robots knew how human beings reacted to food .  the robots here had basic human knowledge and the laws of robotics as their core  yet remained ignorant of specific  conditioned reactions to humans .  it was almost as if their design had geared them toward an equal human partnership  rather than a master servant relationship  and they were feeling out their relationship with the animal called human .  it was a dizzying concept to derec  one that he   d also have to think out in greater detail .   and  finally  the dead man .  where did he fit into the picture  .   .   .  and why .  derec   s mind  being a blank slate  soaked up everything around him like a sponge  unhampered by the intrusion of past thoughts and feelings that muddied observation .  his eye for detail missed nothing  especially the reaction of katherine to hearing euler say the man   s name   david .   what could it mean .  he had literally stumbled upon katherine  yet she seemed an indispensable part of the puzzle .  what role did she play .  again  destiny seemed to rule the day   a place for everything  everything in its place .  he was a blind man with a jigsaw puzzle  feeling his way through  groping sightlessly for the connections .  he liked the girl  couldn   t help it  and felt a strong physical attraction for her that he wouldn   t even try to wish away  yet he couldn   t shake the feeling that she was deeply involved in covering up his real identity and purpose .  and again  his eternal question   why .   he continued moving down the street .  though the buildings were beautiful  they were nondescript  without markings of any kind .  he recognized warehouses because parts were being moved in and out of them  but everything else seemed devoid of purpose .  if he could find an official building  he could try to hook up to a terminal and make his own inquiries .  the pyramid where he and katherine had materialized  the place the robots called the compass tower  had seemed solid to him .  even though it appeared to be the point upon which all else hinged  he wasn   t ready to go back to it yet .   the robots on the street ignored him as he moved through their midst .  there seemed to be a sense of urgency to them that he couldn   t understand .  he stopped a utility robot like the one he had snuck past at the apartment  except this one had huge scoops for hands .      can you talk .     he asked .      yes  most assuredly     the robot answered .      i need to find the administration building .         i don   t believe we have one here .         where would i find the closest computer terminal .         i regret that i cannot say .      derec sighed .  the runaround .  again .     why can   t you say .         if i told you that  you   d know everything .         know everything about what .         about the thing that i cannot talk about .  if you   d like  you can stay here and i   ll report to a supervisor and have him come out and find you .         no  thanks     derec replied  and the robot turned to walk away .     hey  what   s your hurry .         the rain     the utility said  pointing toward the sky .     the rain is coming .  you had better get to shelter .     the robot turned and hurried off  his box like body weaving from side to side as he rolled along .      what about the rain .  .     derec yelled  but his words were lost in a sudden gust of wind .   he watched the figure of the robot for a moment  realizing that the street he had come down looked different than it had a moment before .  the whole block  street and all  had seemed to shift positions  bowing out to curve what had once been straight .  a tall  tetrahedral structure  which he had used as a reference point  had disappeared completely .  ten minutes on the street and he was totally lost .   he pressed on  the wind colder now  more intense .  if this was such a perfect world for humans  then why did the weather seem so bad .   he reached an unmarked corner and found himself on the street he had ridden down earlier  during the parade .  it was extra wide  a large aqueduct bisecting it .   he moved to the edge of the aqueduct and stared down at the dark  rushing waters that filled it no more than a quarter full .  where had the waters come from .  where were they going .  had robot city been built here for the water  or was the water somehow a consequence of the building .   the water rushed past  dark and inscrutable  much like the problem of derec   s past and  perhaps  his future .  yet he could know about the water .  he could trace it to its source  he could follow it to its destination .  he could know .  the thought heartened him  for he could do the same with his life .  accepting that destiny and not chance had brought him to this impossible place  it then followed that the sources of that destiny could be traced through the city itself .   if he pursued it properly  he could trace the origins of the city and  hence  find his own origins .  it seemed eminently logical  for he couldn   t escape the concept that he and robot city were inextricably linked  physically  emotionally  and  perhaps  metaphysically .   if his searching came to naught  at least he   d be keeping himself  keeping his blank mind  occupied .  he   d begin with the water   trace it through source and destination  find out the why of it .  he   d work on the robots  finding out what they knew  what they didn   t know  what they   d be willing to tell him  and what he could find out from them unwillingly .  and there was katherine .  he   d have to treat her like a friendly adversary and use whatever limited wiles he had at his disposal to find out her place in all this .   the water plopped below him  as if a large stone had been tossed in .  he looked around but saw nothing save the gently glowing buildings and the distant robots hurrying about their secret business .   the water plopped again  farther down the aqueduct  then again  near the last place .  he turned to stare in that direction when his shoulder was splashed by a drop of icy water .   a drop hardly described it .  what hit him was more like a glassful .  his jumpsuit sleeve was soaked  his shoulder cold .  water splashed on the street beside him  a drop bigger than a clenched fist  leaving a wet ring .   derec had about a second to appreciate what was happening  for his mind to begin to realize what a major storm could mean  when the deluge struck .   with a force that nearly doubled him over  the rain fell upon derec in opaque sheets that immediately cut off his field of vision .  he was cold  freezing  the rain lashing him unmercifully  its sound a hollow roar in his ears .   he used his arms to cover and protect his head as the freezing downpour numbed his shoulders and back .  he had to get to shelter quickly  but he had already lost his bearings in the curtain of water that surrounded him three sixty .   he tentatively put out a foot  hoping he was moving in the direction of the buildings across from the aqueduct .  were he to move in the wrong direction  he   d fall into the aqueduct and be lost in its flowing waters .   movement was slow as he felt his way  still doubled over  toward the buildings and safety .  it seemed as if he should have reached them three times over   they couldn   t have been more than ten meters distant   yet he hadn   t gotten there yet .  could he have gotten turned the wrong way and simply be moving down the center of the street .   keeping his balance was getting more difficult .  water on the street was up to his ankles  moving rapidly against his direction .  he lost his footing and went to his knee  but managed to rise again .  his clothes were now soaked through  and hung like icicles from his body .  every step was a labor .      the perfect world     he muttered  a thin smile stretching his lips despite his predicament .   just as he was about to give up on his present direction and pick another one at random  the hulk of a building began to define itself in his vision .  a few more treacherous steps and he was suddenly out of the rain  standing beneath a short awning that overhung the building front .   he used a hand to wipe the water from his face  then hugged himself  shivering  against the damp cold  taking stock of his position .  the overhang protected the building front only for about a meter  and it extended for perhaps three meters in either direction from where he stood .   beyond the awning  he could see nothing .  the roaring water was impenetrable .  the building front was no better .  it was totally blank  no doors or windows .  yet  oddly enough  when he touched it  it felt warm  resisting the chill of the air .  he was stuck in a world one meter wide by five meters long .  the ground water had risen from his ankles to his calves  its current always pulling at him .   he stood there for several minutes  cold  teeth chattering  cursing the fate that would bring him to this hellhole .  his numbness and melancholy soon  inevitably  turned to anger .      damn you .     he screamed  to whom  to what  he didn   t know .     why me .      in frustration  he turned to the wall behind him .  hands balled into fists  he pounded viciously at the wall and   his hands sank right into it .      aaaahh .      he screamed in surprise  instinctively jumping backward .   the water cascading from the awning caught him on the face  and as he tried to duck away from it  the ground current took him down .   he went under  then came up gasping for breath .  but his control was gone and he was caught in the current .  it pulled him back across the street  even the street itself seemed tilted at an angle toward the aqueduct .  at this point  trying to regain his footing was out of the question .  keeping his head above water was the only priority .  staying alive was everything .   he felt himself go over the lip of the aqueduct and plunge into its raging waters .  he bobbed down  at no point touching bottom  then rose again  totally numb and choking as the swift current carried him away  pulling at him  sucking him ever down .   he had wanted to see the terminal point of the waters .  he would now see it quickly   if he could stay alive long enough .     katherine stood with euler by the opening to the balcony  staring out at a completely opaque wall of water that made her think that robot city didn   t really exist at all  but was simply an image conjured by an overactive brain exposed to too much cosmic radiation .  the rain came down in never ending torrents  rain such as she   d never seen or even thought could exist .  it frightened her  a fright that almost overcame her anger at their predicament .  almost .      why did he go out .     euler asked .      i   ve already told you     she replied  turning away from the incredible downpour and moving back into the apartment .     he wanted to see the city .         but we told him it was dangerous .      katherine sat on the couch  folding her arms across her chest .  a black hole could swallow derec and his robots for all she cared .     her either didn   t believe you or didn   t care     she said .     why are you standing here asking me the same thing over and over when you could be out there looking for him .      rydberg came in from the bedroom  where he had apparently been searching in case katherine had been lying .     everything that can be done is being done     he said .     we appreciate your concern .  ours is every bit as great as yours .         i   m not concerned     she said .     i couldn   t care less .      the robots exchanged glances .     you don   t care about the possible loss of a human life .     euler asked .   katherine jumped up from the couch .     you mean he could possibly be  .   .   .  be  .   .   .   .         dead .     rydberg helped .     of course .  we warned you that it was dangerous .      for the fiftieth time since derec   s leaving  she hurried back to the balcony doorway and stared into the blank wall of water .  he   d had been gone for several hours  far longer than he should have been .  if anything had happened to him        why did he go out .     euler asked from beside her .      again .     she said loudly .     that same question .  why do you keep asking me that .         because we don   t understand     rydberg said  moving up to join them .     you must know that robots don   t lie .         yes     she replied .      then  when we said it was dangerous  why did he risk his life .     euler asked .      to begin with  his definition of danger might be different from yours     she said .     but beyond that  he wanted to know about this crazy city of yours more than he was afraid of the danger .         you mean     euler said     that he could have purposely risked his life just for the sake of curiosity .         something like that .         astounding .         let me ask you a question     she said  poking euler in his chest sensors with an index finger .     if you want people to live here so much  why did you pick a place with such dangerous weather .      rydberg seemed to hesitate  as if he were weighing the answer he was about to give by some sort of internal scale .     the weather here is not naturally like this     he said at last .      naturally     she repeated  zeroing in on the key word .     does this mean that something has affected the weather adversely .         yes     euler said .      what .     she asked .      we cannot tell you that     rydberg said  and walked over to peer beneath the couch .      will it stop soon .     kate asked .      probably within the next hour     euler said .     at which time we can conduct an extensive search for friend derec .      a thought struck katherine .  she wanted to suppress it  but couldn   t .     is this how the other man  .   .   .  david  died .         he may have caused the rains     euler said .     but he didn   t die from them .         i don   t understand .         it is quite late for humans     rydberg said  moving toward the door .     you must sleep now or risk damaging your health .      with that  the two supervisor robots moved silently into the hallway  the door sliding shut behind them .   katherine was alone  except for the robot standing guard in the hallway outside .  she moved to the couch and curled into a tight ball .     oh  david     she cried into the sleeve of her jumper .     why did this have to happen .          chapter    the extruder    derec rode the aqueduct like a log in a sluice  his body numb  his senses and his fate out of control .  the waters raged in his ears as his entire existence turned on the simple act of trying to keep his head above water .  nothing else mattered  life had reduced itself to its essence .  there was no fear  no time for it  and any yearnings to have his life pass before his eyes went unsatisfied  since he had no life to reflect upon .  there was only the water and the numbing cold   and the ubiquitous companionship of death .   his ride could have lasted a minute or an eternity   he was beyond calculating time   but when he felt himself free falling in midair  his brain snapped to the new reality and questioned .   he was falling  surrounded by a hot  moist wind .  a bare glow of light seemed to envelope him  but before he had a chance to appreciate it  he splashed into hot water .   he had gulped down water with his quickly sucked breath  and when he bobbed to the surface like a cork  he was choking and coughing  his head pounding with a heartbeat throb .  he panicked  then forced himself into control when he realized the water he was in wasn   t flowing  but pooling .   as he treaded water  he found himself grateful to his former life for giving him the lifesaving advantage of swimming lessons .  he leaned back and floated on his back  small currents pulling him this way and that .  his body ached horribly from the battering he had taken in the aqueduct  every bit of strength had drained from him .   there was a ceiling of some sort above him  tiny lights making it dimly visible .  the roar of waterfalls filled the hollow cavern completely  and he turned his head to the side to get a glimpse of his surroundings .   he was a hundred meters from the edge of a large square pool that stretched perhaps a thousand meters across .  red lights set at regular intervals bathed the entire area in an eerie glow .  in the middle of each side of the pool were aqueduct runoffs  four in all  their cascades shimmering like fading pulsars in the red haze .  these four runoffs provided the incredible noise that churned inside his head  all of it echoing within the confined space .   where was he .  a collection point of some kind  perhaps a reservoir .  any city needed a water supply .  this was probably connected to a water treatment plant meant to sustain the human population that didn   t live there .  this only strengthened derec   s earlier speculation that this was not a city simply meant for robots .  what was going on here was serious colonization .   another realization occurred to him  too .  the reservoir had saved his life .  he had been showing the beginning signs of hypothermia during his wild ride down the aqueduct  but the hot water of the reservoir was thawing him out .   why hot water .  the water was definitely warmer than human body temperature  perhaps as much as fifteen degrees  and incredibly hot winds were raging through the chamber  competing with the charging runoff waters in loudness .  in fact  the soothing heat and the rest were already beginning to lull his senses  and he realized that if he wasn   t careful  he could end up at the other end of the physical spectrum with hyperthermia .  whether hypo or hyper  though  the results were still the same .  he was going to have to get out of the water or risk overburdening his heart .   still on his back  he churned his legs lightly while propelling himself with his arms .  there seemed to be robotic movement at the far end of the reservoir  but he didn   t have the strength to swim that far .  having no idea of which way to go  he simply moved toward the closest shoreline .  the process was time consuming  though  for the runoffs created their own currents .   he swam with leisure  but determination  taking the time to check out his body .  he had taken a beating in his wild ride down the aqueduct  but besides general bruises  nothing major seemed to be wrong .   as he neared the edge of the pool  he could see that the runoff streams had slowed considerably  leading him to speculate that the rain had stopped outside .  fuzzy light was also beginning to seep in around the dark edges of the covered pool  and he realized that day had broken .   he finally reached the edge of the pool  its surface made from the same material as the rest of the city .  metal ladders were set at regular intervals around the edge  and he floated to the nearest one to begin his climb out .   the water was barely three meters from the top of the pool  and fortunately so  because as soon as derec began his climb he knew he wasn   t doing well .  his body  so light in the water  felt like it weighed a ton .  the combination of emotional stress  the ordeal of the aqueduct  and the overheated water of the pool had all had an effect on his body .  he dragged himself slowly up the ladder  then rolled  gasping  onto the edge of the pool and lay there .   he closed his eyes  just for a minute  and he was gone .  he didn   t know how long he had slept  but when he awoke  it was with a start .  a loud rumble assailed his hearing .  he sat up quickly  darting his head around  and saw a large vehicle moving around the pool toward him  its engine noises amplified to a roar in the cavern like surroundings .   standing was a problem  since derec still felt weak .  but he got up on shaky legs and moved toward the areas of light beyond the reservoir .  while he was still out and on the loose  he wanted to see as much as he could .  for  this time  the robots wouldn   t be so quick to let him out of their sight .   as he moved toward the light  he passed open caverns that were filled with conduits for moving water .  the huge pipes were twisted like knotted rope and seemed to be moving  writhing  like a snake pit   almost as if they were alive .  he was taken over these areas by railed walkways that simply extended from the edges of the pit at his approach  growing   like crystals   before his eyes .   after the pits  he passed several squat buildings where he surmised the actual water treatment was performed .  drone robots moved in and out of the facilities rapidly  mostly moving machinery in both directions .  derec briefly considered going into one of the structures to search for a terminal  but the still approaching vehicle made him change his mind .      human .     came a loudspeakered voice .     you will halt your progress where you are .  it is unlawful for you to proceed .      he turned to the sound .  it was coming from the robot controlled vehicle that was rapidly closing the distance on him .  it was time to move .   he ran past the building toward glowing walls of light just beyond .      human .     the loudspeaker called again .   he raced to the wall  his legs heavy .  the entire wall seemed lit and wrapped a circle around the reservoir area .  it was translucent  like a shower curtain  and he realized that it was simply so thin that outside light passed right through .  he pushed on it  but it felt solid .  he pushed harder  and it gave under his hand  just like the wall last night .   just then  he saw a drone approach the wall twenty meters distant and move right through it .  he hurried there  with the robots in the vehicle closing rapidly on him .  he stood at the spot  seeing no entry  but when he raised his hands to push against it  the wall irised open and he stepped through into the daylight .   it was morning  bright and calm  with no sign of the deluge that had taken place the previous night .  the sun was still low in the sky  but robot city was alive and active .   he was in the very heart of it here  the hub upon which the wheel of the city turned .  he could see the aqueduct that had brought him cutting through the city like a spoke  and he could see other aqueducts  other spokes  slicing through the wheel of the city .  and he began to think of the areas between the spokes as quadrants .   robots in large numbers hurried quickly through the streets  always going somewhere  always busy with predetermined tasks .  many of them were disappearing into the treatment plant .   he moved a small distance from his exit point  then looked back at the reservoir  shocked to find a forest there .  then he realized that the forest had been planted above the reservoir  the land area serving double duty .  but why a forest .  not for robots  certainly .   out of the corner of his eye  he noticed the large  wheeled vehicle that had been tracking him within the reservoir moving through the exit point to the outside .  he looked back at the city  then up at the forest .  he would find escape in its random chaos .   angling himself away from his pursuers  he ran back toward the huge reservoir building  preparing to climb one of the struts that helped support the outside edge of the forest .  but as soon as he reached the place and put his hands on the arched strut  it seemed to melt away  changing into a gently sloping stairway .   he hurried up the stairs without a question and entered the forest .  the ground was moist and spongy  muddying his already soaked shoes .  the trees were small  in many cases smaller than the underbrush that grew thick around them .  a haze seemed to fill the entire forest  and the farther he plunged into it  the hazier it became .   derec was no expert in vegetation  but he assumed the trees were all offspring  many generations removed  of trees that had once grown on earth .  spacers  though hating to mention any connection to the planet of their ancestry  nevertheless made it a point to bring earth vegetation and animal life to whatever planet they colonized .  where he    gotten such information  he had no idea  the small glimpses of his own mind were maddening in their incompleteness .   he wandered the forest  pushing through the haze and the dense undergrowth  feeling jittery in untamed surroundings .  and he knew that these were also the feelings of a spacer pushing through his mind .  he didn   t much like the forest  he longed for the order of the city .  but for a human being  this had its place .  untamed but finite  aesthetically pleasing without being uncontrollable .  this place existed for the aesthetics   for human aesthetics .   his foot hit something hard and uncompromising  and he tripped  going hard to soft ground  getting mud all over himself .  he turned to the object that had caused his fall and found a small section of pipe sticking out of the ground .  a fog like haze was pumping from the pipe  the same haze that filled the entire area  and derec began to see a master plan at work here .   he stood  then ducked when he saw a shadow moving through the haze not five meters from him .  it was one of the robots .  he listened and could hear them thrashing through the brush all around .  they were slowly cordoning off the entire area  boxing him in .   he took a deep breath  then scrunched up into a ball and lay on the ground  listening as they moved near him .  the forest was built over the reservoir so that condensing water could feed up to the trees from beneath and nourish the roots directly .  further  the haze was probably carbon dioxide vapor feeding the forest to promote health and growth .  where did the co  come from .  perhaps a bleed off from their industrial processes  which could also explain the heat in the reservoir area .  the set up was sophisticated and civilized  a city built around its ecological needs .  was it all of robot design .   a metal foot clanked down just an arm   s reach away from his position .  he stifled the urge to rise up for a breath of normal air .  within seconds  the robot moved on .   as he heard the search party sweep past  he jumped to his feet and charged back in the direction he had come .  the robots were much faster and stronger than he was  so he was going to have to make things happen quickly at this point .   he reached the edge of the forest in minutes  and rushed to the place where he had climbed up .  the strut was already solid again  the steps nowhere to be seen .  he looked over the edge of the forest .  it was ten meters to the ground  jumping was out of the question .      you  derec .     came a robot voice behind .     stop now .  stop .      he sat on the ground and dangled his legs over the edge of the strut .  steps miraculously formed again .  he ran down just as several robots reached the edge of the forest  calling for him to stop .   amidst the confusion near the water treatment facility  he saw a large flatbed vehicle  filled with what looked like broken computers  ready to pull out .  he took the last steps in leaps and charged the machine  the robots behind already reaching the bottom of the stairs .   the truck pulled out before he reached it  but with a burst of speed  he caught it and jumped into the back .  a small  round drone the size of his head squeaked at him from among the broken computers .     katherine stood at the wash basin  watching the lukewarm water flow from the tap  and wondered how plumbing could possibly be accomplished in a city that didn   t stand still .  she splashed her face with water  then stared into the small mirror that was inset above the basin .  her eyes were puffy and dark  showing the results of no sleep  but her face remained calm  remarkably calm considering the terror that had been flashing through her for most of the long night .   he was gone  perhaps dead  and she was alone on this crazy world .  though david derec  whatever he wanted to call himself  had never looked on this place as anything but an adventure  to her it had been nothing but a prison .  a first priority for anyone marooned in a spacer port would be access to radio communications to inform search parties and anxious waiters  yet the robots seemed reluctant   no  evasive   when it came to the topic of communications .  that frightened her more than anything else that was going on .      did you sleep well .      she jumped to the sound  turning quickly to see rydberg standing in the doorway  a light static issuing from his loudspeaker .      i didn   t invite you in here .     she said in anger and frustration .     get out .  now .      the robot turned without a word and moved from the door  katherine following him out into a small hallway .      what do you want .     she asked .     has there been any  .   .   .  news about derec .      rydberg turned back to her .     i did not mean to intrude upon your privacy     he said .     please accept my apologies .  i   ve brought you food .         i   m not hungry .      rydberg just stared at her .      has there been any word about derec .     she asked again  softly this time .      yes     the robot replied .     he was seen not three decads ago  but ran away when another of our supervisors called to him .      she clapped her hands together loudly .     so  he   s alive .         apparently so .  why would he run away .  is this a sign of guilt .         it   s a sign that he wants to check out this crazy place without a gaggle of robots hanging all over him .     she moved past him toward the living room .     now  where   s that food .  i   m so hungry i could eat a  .   .   .      she stopped herself  then looked at the robot .     i   m hungry .         but you just said  .   .   .          forget what i just said .  correction .     she caught herself before the robot could explain its memory .     i mean never mind .  where   s the food .      he led her back down the hall to the living room  where the food sat at the same table she had eaten at the night before .  strangely enough  the room was different  squatter  wider than it had been the previous night  the table closer to the wall .   she moved quickly to the table .  there was a variety of what appeared to be fruits and cooked vegetables there .  she sat down and tentatively ate a small piece of greenish fruit .  it was delicious .  rydberg stood nearby as she greedily sampled everything on the table  all of it good .  she didn   t invite the robot to sit with her as derec had done .  the machines were servants and needed to be treated as such .  she   d never understand his insistence on treating them as anything other than the machines they were .      when do we get to make outside radio contact .     she asked once the initial hunger pangs had died down .      we will all meet later and discuss those questions .         are you going to put us on trial     she asked     for the murder of this other human .  we are entitled to a trial  you know .         derec has told us that he will try to solve this mystery     rydberg said .   katherine stopped eating and stared at him .     and what if he doesn   t .  what if we don   t ever discover what really happened .  you have no right to hold us here as it is .  we can   t go on indefinitely like this .         if he cannot find out the truth of the matter     rydberg said     then we will assume our original supposition to be correct .         i don   t believe you     she said .     you have no right to determine my guilt or innocence without proper evidence .  i   m not derec  and i hold no romantic visions of a robot controlled world .  you cannot be allowed to have any power over the way i live my life .  if you want to hold me for murder  you must put me on trial and prove it .  if you put me on trial  i must be allowed to defend myself .  i therefore demand immediate access to a radio so that i may provide myself with proper defense representation .  i want a certified legal rep  and i want one now .         we will discuss the situation later today     the robot said     after friend derec has been returned to us .  meanwhile  your food is getting cold and will lose its appeal .         it already has     katherine returned  pushing the plate away from herself .  she didn   t like the way this was turning .  the radio seemed to get more and more distant to her  and with it  any hopes of ever leaving this place .  her arguments to rydberg were based solely on laws and customs common to auroran society .  but all law  all freedom  was merely a rationalization away where a robot civilization was concerned .   the final result to her was quite simple  the machines were in charge and they could do anything they wanted .     derec knew nothing with which to compare the size of robot city  but as he drove its breadth  he couldn   t help but feel its vastness .   as the parts truck moved quickly through the city streets  the round drone bounced from one machine to another  squeaking loudly  its silver body lighting up in dozens of places  then winking out again as it performed automatic  but definitely sub robotic  pre troubleshooting functions on the broken machinery .  finally  it came to rest on derec   s lap  all of its lights blinking madly  its squeaks turning into a high pitched whine .      so  where are we going .     he asked the troubleshooter while idly stroking its dome .   the machine whirred and bounced  but never answered .  all at once  its whine turned to a loud  siren like wail .      stop it .     derec ordered  turning to the front of the truck to make sure he wasn   t attracting attention .  he bent double over the thing  trying to muffle its sound without success .      you   re going to have to stop     he told the thing .     i can   t just  .   .   .       it sent a jolt of electricity through its body  shocking derec  moving him off .      all right     he said  pointing a shaking finger at the silver ball .     i don   t have to take that from you .      the thing started bouncing up and down  higher and higher .  derec looked both ways over the truck back  then calmly brought up a foot and shoved the thing right off the truck  where it hit the street angrily  its wail louder as it bounced around like a rubber ball .   within a few blocks  the vehicle slowed its pace  then got in line behind several other trucks  all filled with equipment .  derec got on his knees and looked over the piles of computers .   the trucks were pulled up to a gate  where a whole line of robots were moving up to the truck back  each taking a single piece of equipment and returning with it to a blockhouse that wasn   t much larger than a single doorway .  beside the blockhouse was the most amazing thing derec had ever seen in his short memory .   a huge  gray machine rumbled softly  yet with undeniable strength and power .  from it issued what could only be described as a ribbon of city .  in five meter square slabs  the city appeared to be simply extruding from underground through the medium of the gray machine .   it pushed itself along  the slabs gradually forming and reforming as they moved  following some incredible preprogramming that actually let them build themselves .  and as the slabs formed walls and floors and corners and stories and windows  they spun off in every direction in a slow  graceful dance that pushed against the already existing buildings  the mechanism that triggered the entire magnificent clockwork of robot city .   it was as if the entire city were one mammoth  living organism always growing outward  always changing and replicating like the cells in a body  moving in imprinted patterns toward a complete  fully formed being .   it was a plan of monumental scale  an atmosphere of total  logical control for a given end .  as he watched a skyscraper literally build itself from the ground up  each story pushing up the story above it and self welding according to some unseen plan  he experienced the grandeur of an idea so vast that his limited knowledge was humbled by its power .  this civilization was the product of a mind that refused to believe in limited options  a mind that accepted that what the imagination could conceive  the hands could make .   to such a mind  anything was possible .  even  perhaps  perihelion .   the truck lurched  nearly knocking him from his knees .  it had pulled up to the gate .  the line of robots was now reaching into his bed for their equipment .   if all the action was happening below ground  that   s where derec wanted to be .  hurrying out of the truck  he grabbed a small terminal that looked as if it had been shorted out by water  and took his place behind a robot heading toward that doorway into the ground .   he reached the doorway  cradling the computer like a baby .  warm air greeted him as he stepped through into barely lit darkness .  he was confronted by a short flight of stairs leading down  and followed the robot that walked down before him .   the stairs terminated in a large holding area  brightly lit  frenetic with activity .  automated carts carried robots and mining equipment at breakneck pace .  the cars zipped around one another in seemingly rehearsed fashion  their movements perfected over time  since it seemed impossible to derec that they could move so quickly without hitting one another .   on the far wall sat a bank of elevators  perhaps twenty in all  some of them remarkably large .  the robots that moved down the stairs headed toward these elevators  apparently going from here to a lower level where repair or scrap work was being done .   having no idea of where to go  derec chose an elevator at random and moved toward it with his burden .  a large elevator nearby slid open  and a group of minerbots  covered with mud and soot  moved out bearing the non operating carcass of one of their own above their shoulders .   derec reached the elevator .  it had no formal controls  but opened for him as soon as he stepped near .   a voice boomed behind him .     nothing awaits you below  but death .      he turned to see a huge supervisor robot  twice the size of a man  glaring down at him with red photocells .  the robot   s body was burnished a bright  shimmering black .      i   ve come to inspect your operation     derec said  feigning authority .  he turned back to the elevator and began to step in .   the robot   s arm flashed out  his mammoth pincers clanging loudly around derec   s forearm  squeezing tightly but not painfully .      you are caught     the machine said  and derec   s computer crashed loudly at his feet .       chapter    the compass tower    as the door to the apartment slid open  derec tucked under the arm of the big robot  watched katherine   s facial expression change from horror  to relief  to unbridled amusement   all in the space of three seconds .      let me guess     she said  putting a finger to her lips     you   re a ditty bag .         cute     derec returned as the robot set him gently on the ground .  he looked up at the huge  black machine .     thanks for the ride  avernus .         my pleasure  friend derec     the robot replied  bending slightly so that the hallway could accommodate his height .     but i must ask you to stay away from the underground .  it is no place for a human .         i appreciate your concern     derec said noncommittally .  he walked into the apartment  then turned back to avernus .     will we see you at the meeting .         most assuredly     he returned .     all of us look forward to it with great expectation .         you can go now     katherine told avernus coldly  the robot nodding slightly and moving off  the utility robot guard sliding quickly to fill the door space with his squat body .   katherine punched the door stud  the panel sliding closed .     you missed breakfast and lunch     she said  moving to sit listlessly on the couch .      avernus got me something before he brought me back     derec said .     he got my wounds cleaned up  and even let me sleep for a while .     finally  he couldn   t ignore her mood any longer .     what   s wrong .         you     she said     this place  .   .   .  everything .  i don   t know which way is up anymore .  did you find out anything .      derec spotted the crt screen set up on the table and walked to stand before it .     it   s a place designed for humans     he said     and the building is going on at a furious pace  as if they   re in some kind of hurry to get finished .  i think the buildings may be  .   .   .  i don   t know  alive  i guess is the best way to put it .     he pointed to the screen .     where did this come from .         rydberg brought it     she answered     but it only receives .  what do you mean  the city   s alive .         watch this     derec said  and ran full speed across the room  banging into the far wall .  the wall gave with him  caving inward  then gently pushed itself back to a solid position .      i laid awake all night worrying about you  while you were discovering the walls are made of rubber .     she asked loudly .   he turned to her  smiling .     did you really worry about me .         no     she replied .     what else .      he walked over and sat on the couch with her  his tones hushed .     i saw the city building itself  literally extruding itself from the ground .  i tried to go down there  but avernus caught me .  i think he   s in charge down there .  the only thing i can figure is that there are immense mining operations underway below ground and that the buildings are positronic  some kind of cellular robots that make up a complete whole .  it   s fascinating .      katherine was unimpressed .     did you find a way out of here .      he shook his head .     not yet     he answered     but i don   t really think that   s going to be a problem .         that   s because you   re so eaten up with your robot friends you can   t think of anything else .     she suddenly jerked her head toward the wall .     if the walls are robots  i wonder if they can hear us now .      just then the screen on the table came to life  rydberg   s face filling it .     so  you are back  derec     he said .     good .  prepare yourselves .  an honor guard is coming right now to bring you to your preliminary trial .         trial .     derec said .      uh oh     katherine said  putting a hand to her mouth .     that may be my fault .  i all but dared them to put us on trial .         but we haven   t had a chance to investigate yet .      she shrugged .     i was trying to find if we could have access to outside communications .     she snapped her fingers .     maybe this means we   re going to get it .         yeah  .   .   .  maybe     derec said  but he was skeptical .  robot city was too precious a gem to be hanging out in the ether for anyone to pluck .  at this point  he wasn   t even sure if he wanted to communicate with the outside .   he looked at the screen .  it had already gone blank .     whatever the reason     he said     i believe we   re going to get some answers at this point .         let   s hope they   re answers we can live with     she sighed .     i don   t want to spend the rest of my life here .      within minutes  the utility robot was knocking on the door .  derec hurried to open it .  euler greeted him  accompanied by a supervisor robot he   d not seen before .  this one was the robot most closely molded to a human that derec had seen  with chisled  though blank  mannequin like features .      friend derec     euler said     friend katherine burgess  may i present arion  who will be in attendance at our meeting .         pleased to meet you     derec said .      rydberg called it a trial     katherine said .      this is a great moment for us here     arion said .     i trust that your stay so far has been satisfactory .  i am doing my best with what little time i have to try and prepare some entertainment for you .  we know that humans enjoy mind diversions .         we   d appreciate anything you could do     derec said .      sure     katherine said .     how about conjuring up a radio for us to call the outside for help .         oh  that   s quite impossible     arion said .      that   s what i thought     katherine answered .      i have a present for each of you     euler said  extending his right arm .     then we must be off to the meeting .      derec moved to the robot .  his pincers held two large watches  dangling on gold chains .     you may know the time here now     euler said .     it is of importance to humans  and so  to us .  we will do more to make you feel comfortable in this regard .      derec took the watches  giving one of them to katherine .  they had square faces encased in gold .  on both of them  the lcd faces read      .     they run on a twenty four hour day     said euler .     we thought it would be more comfortable for you if we adjusted the length of our hour than if you had to adjust to a twenty and one half hour day .  our hours  decads  and centads are approximately eighty five percent of standard .     derec walked out onto the veranda and looked into the sky .  the sun had already passed its apex and was slowly crawling toward the eventual shadows of evening .      right on the money     he said  returning to the apartment .      you doubted it .     arion asked  looking at euler .      do you understand now .     euler said to him .      interesting     arion said  cocking his head in an almost human fashion .      we must go     euler said and hurried out of the apartment  the others following .   they rode the elevator to street level and boarded a multi car tram that had no apparent driver .  it started off immediately when they were seated .  euler turned to derec  who sat  with katherine  behind him and arion .     you put yourself in extreme danger last night     the robot said .     why .         i   ve a better question     derec returned .     if this is such a perfect human world  why was it so dangerous .         spacer worlds conquered weather problems eons ago     katherine interjected .     for you to have them in such an advanced culture makes no sense .      arion turned to her and bowed his head .     thank you for calling our culture advanced .         the weather     euler said     is quite honestly part of our overall problem right now .  it is under our control  but also not under our control .  unfortunately  for security reasons  we cannot discuss it in detail .         great     katherine said .     everybody can do something about the weather  but nobody talks about it .         to answer your original question     derec told euler  as he watched them move in a direct line toward the tower where they had initially materialized     i have no memory and no past .  my curiosity  my search for answers about myself  leads me to do things not necessarily in my best interest .         amnesia .     euler asked .     or something else .      derec looked at him in surprise .     what else .      the robot answered his question with another question  an old one .     how  then  did you come to our planet .      derec realized that the robot was playing word games with him that tied directly to the word games derec had initiated the night before .  he decided to keep playing .     what did the dead man  david  say when you asked him that question .         he said he didn   t know     euler replied  and turned back around in his seat .  over his shoulder  he said     he claimed he   d had amnesia .      the tram came to a halt beside the mammoth pyramid that dominated the landscape of robot city  the place the inhabitants called the compass tower .  katherine put a hand on derec   s arm  squeezing  and he knew she had the same fear that he   d felt .  here  about halfway up the tower  was where they had hidden the key to perihelion that had brought them to the city .  had the robots found it .  were they confronting them with the evidence  or  worse yet  taking it away .   but euler said nothing of the key .  instead  he simply climbed from the tram and led them directly to the base of the tower  a tower that derec had surmised was solid .   he   d never been more wrong .   at the robot   s approach  an entire block of the solid matter that formed the base simply melted away  leaving a gently sloping runway leading into the structure  another example of derec   s theory about the intelligence of the building materials themselves .   they moved into the pyramid through a short  dark hallway that emptied into a maze of criss crossing aisles and stairs that  in turn  led off in all directions within the structure .      try and memorize our path     derec whispered to katherine .     just in case .         in case of what .     she asked .     in case you haven   t figured it out  we   re not going anywhere .         this is the most important building in our city     euler said  as he took them up a series of stairs and escalators that zig zagged at every landing and culminated in a long  well lit hallway .     this is where decisions are made  where  .   .   .  understanding takes place .      they walked the hall  arion hurrying ahead and disappearing down some stairs .  the surrounding walls glowed lightly  with connecting hallways intersecting every ten feet .   they followed arion   s path  changing direction several times before finding themselves standing in a large  well lit room whose four walls angled in toward a ceiling  fifteen meters above  that poured in sunshine like a skylight .   the floor of the room was tiled in the form of a large compass  its four points forming the cornerstones of robot city .  in the center of the compass  under the direct rays of the sun  stood six robots in a circle  arms outstretched  their pincers grasping those of their neighbors on either side with space left for one more   euler .      this is the place where we seek perfection     euler said  and joined the circle  closing it .      it   s almost religious     derec whispered to katherine .      yeah     she replied .     it give me the creeps .      derec looked around the room .  there were no chairs or tables  nothing upon which a human being could rest .  the walls were inset with crts jammed side to side around the entire perimeter .  each screen showed its own view of robot city .  many showed excavation sites  the large movers pushing and leveling soil .  other pictures were of the extrusion plant he had visited  and he was led to conjecture that there might be more than one .  there were pictures of the reservoir he had splashed into  and strange  underground pictures taken through the eyes of roving cambots that showed mining tunnels  kilometer after kilometer of deserted tunnel .  and finally  many of the screens simply showed the pinktinged blue of the sky .      you have come to this place     euler said loudly     to help us in our search for correctness  for perfection  for completeness .  we are the keys   human and robot   to the synergy of spirit .  synnoetics is our goal .  i will introduce the rest of us and we will begin .         synnoetics .     katherine whispered .      man and machine     derec replied     the whole greater than the sum of the parts .         it is religious .     she rasped .     and how did you know that .      derec shrugged .     this all feels so  .   .   .  comfortable to me .         you know rydberg     euler said     and avernus and arion .     the robots nodded as their names were called .     the rest of us  .   .   .  waldeyer  .   .   .          good day     said a squat  roundish robot with wheels .      dante  .   .   .          i welcome you     dante said  his telescopic eyes sticking out several inches from his dome .      and wohler .      a magnificent golden machine bowed formally without removing his pincers from his neighbors    .     we are honored     wohler said .      we will answer what questions we can from you     euler said     and hope that you will do the same .         if  as you say     derec told them     we are all looking for truth and perfection  then our meeting will be fruitful .  i would like to begin by asking you why there are certain areas of life here that you will not discuss with us .      rydberg spoke .     we are in a standby security mode that renders certain information classified by our programming .         did our arrival prompt the institution of the security mode .     katherine asked .      no     euler said .     it was in effect when you arrived .  if  in fact  you arrived when you said you did .  we must ask you again how you came to be here .      derec decided to try a little truth .  it couldn   t hurt as long as no mention was made of the key .  perhaps a dose of the truth might get them to open up about the key   s existence .     we materialized out of thin air atop this very building .         and where were you before that .     wohler  the gold one  asked .   derec walked slowly around the circle  studying his questioners .     a spacer way station named rockliffe near nexon  right on the edge of the settlement worlds quarantine zone .      arion  the mannequin  asked     what means  then  did you use to get from one place to the other .         no means     derec said .     we were simply transported here .      there was silence for a moment .     this does not coordinate with any information extant in memory     avernus said  his large dome following derec   s progress around the circle .      you   ve found no ship that could have brought us     derec said     and i   m sure you   ve searched .         that is correct     euler said     and our radar picked up no activity that could have been construed to be a vessel in our atmosphere .         i can   t explain it beyond that     derec said .     now  you answer a question for me .  where did you come from .         who are you addressing .     euler asked .      all of you     derec said .   avernus answered .     all of them except for me were constructed here  on robot city     he said .     i was  .   .   .  awakened here  but believe i was constructed elsewhere .         where .         i do not know     the large robot replied .     my first i o memories are of this place .  nothing in my pre programming suggested anything of an origin .         are you trying to say     katherine broke in     that all of you know nothing but the company of other robots .  that your entire existence is here .         correct     rydberg said .     our master programming is well aware of human beings and their societies  but no formal relationship exists between our species .         then how did you come to build this place .     derec asked .     how then  did it become important to you to make a world for humans .         we are incomplete without human beings     waldeyer said  his squat dome swiveling to derec and then katherine .     the very laws that govern our existence revolve around human interaction .  we exist to serve independent thought  the higher realms of creativity that we are incapable of alone .  we discovered this very quickly  without being told .  alone  we simply exist to no end  no purpose .  even artificial intelligence must have a reason to utilize itself .  this world is the first utilization of that intelligence .  we   ve been building it for humans  in order to make the perfect atmosphere in which human creativity can flourish to the greater completeness of us all .  without this world we are nothing .  with it  we are vital contributing factors to the ongoing evolution of the universe .         why would that matter to you .     katherine asked .      i have a theory about that     dante said  his elongated eyes glowing bright yellow .     we are the product  the child if you will  of higher realms of creative thought .  it seems impossible that the drives of that creative thought wouldn   t permeate every aspect of our programming .  we want for nothing .  we desire nothing .  yet  the incompleteness of our inactivity makes us  .   .   .  feel  for lack of a better word  useless and extraneous .  given the total freedom of our own world  we were driven to function in service .      derec suddenly felt a terrible sadness well up in him for these unhappy creatures of man   s intelligence .     you   ve done all this  even though you never knew if any people would come here .         that is correct     euler said .     then david came  and we thought that all would be right .  then came his death  then the calamities  then you  .   .   .  suspects to murder .  we never meant for anything to be this way .         when you say calamities     derec said     are you speaking of the problems with the storms .         yes     rydberg said .     the rains threaten our civilization itself  and it   s all our own fault .  we are breaking apart from the inside out  with nothing to be done about it .         i don   t understand     derec said .      we don   t expect you to  nor can we tell you why it must be this way     euler said .   derec thought about the hot air pumping through the reservoir .     is the city   s rapid growth rate normal .     he asked .      no     euler said .     it coincides with david   s death .         is it because of david   s death .         we do not know the answer to that     euler said .      wait a moment     katherine said  walking away from the circle to sit on the floor  her back up against the north wall .     i want to talk to you about our connection with all this  .   .   .  and why rydberg called this a preliminary trial .         you were the one who first mentioned the concept of trial     the robot replied  leaning out of the circle to stare at her .     i only used that term to make you feel comfortable .         okay     she said .     i   ll play .  you say this is a civilization of robots that have never had human interaction  yet obviously someone gave you your initial programming and ability to perform the work on this city .         someone  .   .   .  yes     euler said .      someone who   s in charge     she said .      no     euler said .     we are now in group communication with our master programming unit  but it simply provides us with information from which logical decisions are made .  our overall philosophy is service  our means are logical .  other than that  our society has no direction .         then why put us on trial at all .     she asked .      respect for human life is our first law     rydberg said .     when we envisioned our perfect human robot world  we saw a world in which all shared respect for the first law .  we envisioned a system of humanics that would guide human behavior  just as the laws of robotics guide our behavior  just as the laws of robotics guide our behavior .  of course  we have been working entirely from theory  but we have made a preliminary list of three laws that would provide the basis for an understanding of humans .         cute     katherine said .     now they want us to follow the laws of robotics .      derec interrupted her complaint .     wait .  let   s see what they   ve come up with .         thank you  friend derec .  our provisional first law of humanics is  a human being may not injure another human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .         admirable     conceded derec     even if it isn   t always obeyed .  what is your second law .      rydberg   s hesitation before answering gave derec the clear impression that the robot wanted to ask a question of its own  but his took precedence under the second law of robotics .      the second law of humanics is  a human being must give only reasonable orders to a robot and require nothing of it that would needlessly put it into the kind of dilemma that might cause it harm or discomfort .         still admirable  but still too altruistic to be always obeyed .  and the third .         the third law of humanics is  a human being must not harm a robot  or through inaction  allow a robot to come to harm  unless such harm is needed to keep a human being from harm or to allow a vital order to be carried out .         not only is your experience with humans limited  so is your programming     derec said  shaking his head .     these    laws    might describe a utopian society of humans and robots  but they certainly don   t describe the way humans really behave .         we have become aware of that     said rydberg .     obviously  we are going to have to reconsider our conclusions .  since your arrival we have been subjected to human lies and deceit  concepts beyond our limited understanding .         but the first law must stand .     avernus said loudly  his red photocells glowing brightly .     human or robot  all are subject to respect for life .         we certainly aren   t arguing that point     derec said .      no .     katherine said  standing angrily and walking back to the circle .     what we   re talking about is the lack of respect with which we   re being treated here .         kath  .   .   .      derec began .      shut up     katherine said .     i   ve been listening to you having wonderful little philosophical conversations with your robot buddies  and i   m getting a little tired of it .  listen  folks .  first thing  i demand that you give us access to communications with the outside and that you let us leave .  you have no authority to hold us here .         this is our world     euler said .     we mean no offense  but all societies are governed by laws  and we fear you have broken our greatest law .         and what if we have .     she asked .     what happens then .         well     euler said .     we would do nothing more than keep you from the society of other humans who you could harm .         great .  so  how do you prove we did anything in order to hold us .         process of elimination     waldeyer said .     friend derec has previously suggested some other possible avenues of explanation  but we feel it is incumbent upon both of you to explore them   not because we are trying to make it difficult for you  but because we respect your creative intelligence more than we respect our own deductive intelligence in an area like this .      derec watched as katherine ran hands through her long black hair and took several deep breaths as she tried to get herself together and in a position to work with this .     all right     she said  more calmly .     you said before that you won   t let us see the body .         no     euler said .     we said that we can   t let you see the body .         why .      there was silence .  finally rydberg spoke .     we don   t know where it is     he said .     the city began replicating too quickly and we lost it .         lost it .     derec said .   derec knew it was impossible for a robot to be or look embarrassed  but that was exactly the feeling he was getting from the entire group .      we really have no idea of where it is     euler said .   derec saw an opening and quickly took it .     in order to do this investigation and prove that we   re innocent of any first law transgressions  we must have freedom of movement around your city .         we exist to protect your lives     euler said .     you   ve been caught in the rains  you know how dangerous they are .  we can   t let you out under those conditions .         is there advance warning of the rain .     he asked .      yes     rydberg said .     the clouds build in the late afternoon  and the rain comes at night .         suppose we promise to not go out when the conditions are unfavorable .     derec asked .   wohler  the golden robot  said     what are human promises worth .      katherine pushed her way beneath the hands of the robots to stand in the center of the circle .     what are our lives worth without freedom .         freedom     wohler echoed .   a dark cloud passed above the skylight  plunging the room into a gray  melancholy halflight  illumination provided by a score of crt screens  many of them now showing pictures of madly roiling clouds .   the circle broke immediately  the robots  agitated  hurrying toward the door .      come     euler said  motioning to the humans .     the rains are approaching .  we must get you back to shelter .  there is so much to do .         what about my suggestion .     derec called loudly to them .      hurry     euler called  waving his arm as derec and katherine walked toward him .     we will think about it and let you know tomorrow .         and if we can investigate and prove our innocence     katherine said     will you then let us contact the outside .      euler stood still and fixed her with his photocells .     let me put it this way     he said .     if you don   t prove your innocence  you   ll never be allowed to contact the outside .          chapter    a witness    derec sat before the crt screen on the apartment table and watched the    entertainment    that arion was providing him in the form  at this moment  of sentences and their grammatic diagrams .  before that it had been a compendium of various failed angle trisection theorems  and before that  an incredibly long list of the powers of ten and the various words that had been invented to describe the astronomical numbers those powers represented .  it was an insomniac   s nightmare .   it was a dark  gray morning  the air heavy with the chill of the night and the rain that had pounded robot city for many hours .  the sky was slate as the remnants of the night   s devastation drifted slowly away on the wings of the morning .   he felt like a caged animal  his nerves jangling madly with the notion that he couldn   t leave the apartment if he wanted to .  they had been dropped off in the early evening after the meeting at the compass tower and hadn   t seen a supervisor robot since .  the crt had no keyboard and only received whatever data they chose to show him from moment to moment .  at this particular time  they apparently felt the need to amuse him  but the time filler of the viewscreen only increased his frustration .   he hadn   t slept well .  the apartment only had one bed and katherine was using it .  derec slept on the couch .  it had been too short for him  and that didn   t make sleeping any easier .  but that wasn   t the real reason he   d been awake .   it was the rain .   he couldn   t get out of his head the fact that the reservoir had been nearly filled when he   d been flung into it the night before .  how  then  could it possibly hold the immense amounts of water that continued to pour into it with each successive rainfall .  he   d worried over that point  the more rain  the greater the worry .  the fact that the supervisors hadn   t contacted him since before the storm seemed ominous .  all of their efforts seemed to revolve around the weather problems .   how did the weather tie in with the rapid growth rate of the city .  were the two linked .      you   re up early     came katherine   s voice behind him .   he turned to see her  face soft from sleep  framed by the diffused light .  she looked good  a night   s sleep bringing out her natural beauty .  she was wrapped in the pale green cover from her bed .  he wondered idly what she was wearing beneath it  then turned unconsciously to his awakening  after the explosion in aranimas   s ship  in the medical wing of the rockliffe station to find her naked on the bed beside .  embarrassed  he pushed that thought aside  but its residue left another thought from that time  something he had completely forgotten about .      can i ask you a question .     he said .   her face darkened and he watched her tighten up .     what is it .     she asked .      when we were at rockliffe  dr .  galen mentioned you had a chronic condition     he said .     later  when he began to talk about it  you shut him up .      she walked up to look at the screen  refusing to meet his gaze .     you   re mistaken     she said .     i   m fine  .   .   .  the picture of health .      she turned slightly from him  and there seemed to be a small catch in her voice .  when she turned back  her face was set firm  quite unlike the vulnerable morning creature he   d seen a moment ago .     what   s happening on the screen .     she asked .   he looked .  a pleasant  always changing pattern of computer generated images was juicing through the crt  accompanied by a random melody bleeped out of the machine   s tiny speaker .      you make it very hard for me to believe you     he said  ignoring the screen .     why  when we need total honesty and trust between us  do i feel that you   re holding back vital information from me .         you   re just paranoid     she said  and he could tell he was going to get nothing from her .     and if you don   t change the subject quickly  i   m going to find myself getting angry  and that   s no way to start the day .      he reluctantly agreed .     i   m worried about the rains     he said .     they were worse last night than the night before .      she sat at the table with him .     well  if this place is getting ready to have major problems  i hope we   re out of here before they happen .  we   ve got to get something going with the murder investigation .         do you know what makes rain .     he asked  ignoring the issue of the murder .      what has that got to do with our investigation .     she asked  on edge .      nothing     he said .     i   m just wondering about these rains  i  .   .   .          don   t say it     she replied holding up a hand .     you   re worried about your robot friends .  well  let me tell you something  your friends are in the process of keeping us locked up for the rest of our lives  .   .   .          not locked up  surely     he interrupted .      this is serious .     she said  angry now .     we have a very good chance of being kept prisoner here for life .  you know  once they make a decision like that  i see no reason that they would ever change it .  don   t you understand the gravity of the situation .      he looked at her calmly  placing a hand over hers on the table .  she drew it away  and he felt his own anger rise  then rapidly subside .     i understand the problem     he explained     but i fear the problem with the city is more pressing  more  .   .   .  immediate .         but it   s not our problem .  the murder is .         indulge me     he said .     let   s talk about weather for just a minute .      she sighed  shaking her head .     let   s see what i remember     she said .     molecules respond to heat  separating  moving more quickly .  water molecules are no exception .  on a hot day  they rise into the atmosphere and cling to dust particles in the air .  when they rise into the cooler atmosphere  they turn into clouds .  when the clouds get too heavy  too full of water  they return to the ground in the form of rain .         okay     he said .     and wind is simply the interplay of heat and cold in the atmosphere .      she shrugged .     the cold  heavier air pushes down and forces the warm air to move   wind .         i think i   m beginning to see a connection     he said  excited .     look .  robot city is building at a furious pace  sending a great deal of dust into the atmosphere .     he thought about the reservoir .     meanwhile  they are somehow liberating a great deal of water from the mining processes that are needed to build the city .  along with the mining processes comes a tremendous amount of kinetic energy  heat  which they are venting into the atmosphere near the water  forcing the heated molecules to rise as water vapor and cling to the dust particles that are thick in the atmosphere right now .  at night  the temperature cools down a great deal  .   .   .          that could be an uncompensated ozone layer     she said .   he pointed to her .     ozone .  that   s what seals in our atmosphere .  as goes the ozone layer  so go our temperature inversions .  so  it cools at night  the rain clouds forming  the cool air bringing on the big winds  and the rain falls .         so     katherine said     if they slowed down the building pace  it could slow down the weather .         it seems logical to me     he replied .      so why don   t they do it .         that   s the mystery  isn   t it .      the door slid open and wohler  the golden robot  moved into the room  flanked on either side by smaller robots .      good morning     wohler said .     i trust your sleep time was beneficial .         you   re going to have to learn to knock before you come barging in here     katherine said .     now go out and do it again .      derec watched the robot dutifully march outside the door and slide it closed .  he knew that katherine was simply venting frustration .  on spacer worlds  robots were considered simply part of the furniture and their presence was not thought about in terms of privacy .   there was a gentle tapping on the door  the nature of the material muffling the sound somewhat .      come in     katherine said with satisfaction  and the door slid open  the robots reentering .      is this the preferred method of treatment in future .     wohler asked .      it is     she replied .      very well     the robot said  then noticed derec   s sleeping covers on the sofa .     should these be returned to the bedroom .         you only provided us with one bed     derec replied .     i slept out here .      wohler moved farther into the room  coming up near the table .     did we err .  was the sleeping space too small  .   .   .          katherine and i would simply like  .   .   .  separate places to sleep     derec said .      privacy .     wohler asked .     as with the knocking on the door .         yes     katherine said  and he could tell she was unwilling to delve into the social aspects of human sleeping arrangements  so he left it alone  too .      on line time is a matter of priorities right now     the robot said     but we will see if we can arrange something for you that is more private .         thanks     derec said .     and if it takes another day to arrange it  that   s all right with me .  it   s katherine   s turn to sleep on the couch tonight .         what .     she said loudly .  derec grinned broadly at her .  she wasn   t amused .   he quickly changed the subject .     what brings you here this morning  wohler .     he asked .     have you reached a decision about our requests of yesterday .         yes     the robot replied .     and it is our sincerest wish that the decision be one that all of us can accept .  first  in addressing the issue of your investigation and freedom of movement .  we conferred at as great a length as time would permit under the present circumstances  and decided that  despite your flaws  you are human  and that fact in and of itself demands that we give you the benefit of the doubt in this situation .  many of our number were concerned about your veracity  or lack of it  but i reminded them that a great human philosopher once said     isn   t it better to have men being ungrateful than to miss a chance to do good .     and so my fellows voted to do good in this regard .         excellent     derec said .      but  .   .   .      katherine helped .      indeed     wohler returned .     it is my place to philosophize in any given situation  and i need remind you now that one must always be prepared to take bad along with good .         just get on with it     katherine said .   wohler nodded .     on the matter of your safety  and your  .   .   .  unpredictability  it was decided that each of you would have a robot companion to  .   .   .  help you in your investigations .         you mean to guard us     katherine said .      merely a matter of semantics     wohler countered  and derec could tell that the robot had been geared for diplomacy .     actually  in this case  i believe you may find these robots more useful as assistants than as protection .  in fact  one of them was present during the death of david and the subsequent confusion .      katherine perked up .     really .  which one .      the robot to wohler   s left came forward .  its body was tubular  its dome a series of bristling sensors and photocells .  without arms  it seemed useless in almost any sense .      what are you called .     katherine asked the machine .   the machine   s tones were clipped and precise .     i am event recorder b     model    alpha   .         i   ll call you eve  if that   s all right     katherine said  standing and wrapping her blanket a little tighter around herself .  she looked at derec .     i want this one .         fine     derec said  then to the other     come here .      the robot moved up close to him .     you   ll answer to rec .         rec     the robot repeated .      we call these robots witnesses     wohler said .     their only function is to witness events precisely for later reporting .         that   s why they have no arms     derec said .      correct     wohler replied .     they are unequipped to do anything but witness .  once involvement begins on any level  the witness function falters in any creature .  these robots only witness and report .  they will know the how of almost everything  but never the why .  they will answer all of your questions to the best of their ability  but again  they are unable to make any second level connections by putting events together to form reasons .         i   m going to go get dressed     katherine said  the happiest derec had seen her in days .  she hurried out of the room  disappearing down the hall to the bedroom .      where will we be denied access .     derec asked .     or is the entire planet open to us .         alas  no     wohler said .     you will be denied access to certain parts of the city and certain operations .  your witness  however  will tell you when you   ve stepped into dangerous water  as it were .         what are the chances of me getting around a terminal     derec asked     and talking to the central core .         the central core has sealed itself off because of our present state of emergency     wohler said .     it will not accept input from any sources save the supervisors  and we are unable to help you in this regard .         how do the day to day operations survive .     he asked .      essential information can be gathered through any terminal     the robot answered .     but input is limited .         you don   t mind if i try .         that is between you and the central core .  we all have our jobs to do .  all that we insist upon is that you honor your commitment to come back here when the rains approach .  we must put your safety above all else .  having failed in this regard with your predecessor  we perhaps err on the side of caution .  but all privileges will be denied should this directive be overlooked or ignored .         i understand     derec replied     and will respect your wishes .         your words  unfortunately  mean very little right now     the robot said  turning to the door  his head swiveling back to derec .     by your deeds we will judge you in future .  as an earth philosopher once said     the quality of a life is determined by its activities .     now  i must go .      with that  wohler moved quickly through the opening and departed hurriedly down the elevator .  the activity bothered derec  it said to him that things were not going well in robot city .  he had intended to ask wohler about the effects of last night   s rain  but then decided a first hand look might be better and determined that rec would take him where he wanted to go .      there     katherine said  coming down the hall to bustle around the room .  she wore a blue one piece that the dinner servo robot had brought with it the night before .     finally  we can start moving in a positive direction .  where do you want to start .         i thought i   d go down to the reservoir     he replied     and see how much rain fell last night .      she stopped walking and stared  unbelieving  at him .     don   t you realize that every moment is precious right now .  we need to find that body and see what happened .  it could be  .   .   .  decomposing or something at this very minute .         i   ve got to see if there was any damage     he said .     i   ll try and join you later .         never mind     she said angrily  and walked quickly to the door .     satisfy your stupid urges .  i don   t want you with me .  you   ll just get in the way anyhow .  come on  eve .  we   ve got a corpus delecti to find .      she walked out of the apartment without a backward glance and was gone  derec frowning after her .  he couldn   t help the way his feelings ran on this .  he felt that so much of his own life  his own reasons for being  hinged upon the future of robot city that its troubles seemed to be his own .      i want to go to the reservoir     he told rec .     can you take me there .         yes  friend derec     the robot answered  and they left together .   when they arrived at street level  derec was disappointed to find that the supervisors hadn   t left any transportation for him to use .  a great deal of time would be wasted walking from place to place .  perhaps he could talk to euler about it later  though he feared that the reasons had much to do with keeping him from going very far from home .      do you want to go the most direct route .     the witness asked him .      yes  of course     derec said as they set out walking .     let me ask you a question .  is the rain a result of the work being done on the city .         for the most part     rec answered through a speaker located on derec   s side of his dome .     it is also the rainy season here .         if they slowed down the building  would it slow down the rain .         i do not know .      derec was going about this wrong  asking the wrong questions of a witness .     how does the city make rain .     he asked .   the robot began talking  recalling information in an encyclopedic fashion .     olivine is mined below ground and crushed in vacuum  releasing carbon  hydrogen  oxygen  and nitrogen  from which water vapor  carbon dioxide  methane gas  and traces of other chemicals are liberated .  iron ore is also being mined for building materials  along with petroleum products for plastics  .   .   .          plastics .     derec asked .      plastics are used as alloys in making the material from which the city is constructed .  do you wish me to go on with my previous line of witnessing .         let me tell you     derec said     and you tell me if i   m right .  water vapor  along with the heat energy from the mining process  is pumped into the air  heat also being pumped into the reservoir .  the co  is bled into the forest to help growth .  the reason that the weather is so rainy now is that the city is growing too fast  giving off too much heat  dust  and water .         i do not know why the weather is so rainy right now     rec said .     i do not even understand what so rainy means .  the other statements you made are juxtapositional with statements i heard supervisor avernus make  which i assume to be correct .         fine     derec said .     is there a problem with the ozone layer .         problem .     the robot asked .   derec rephrased .     is any work being done on the ozone layer .         i do not know     rec said     although i did hear supervisor avernus say on one occasion that the    ozone layer needs to be increased photochemically to ten parts per million .            good     derec said .     very good .         you are pleased with my witnessing .     rec asked .      yes     derec replied .     will the supervisors be asking you to witness later what we   ve discussed .         that is my function  friend derec .      they walked for nearly an hour by derec   s watch  the city still subtly changing around them .  it sometimes took a while to get information out of the witness  but if questions were phrased properly  derec found rec an endless source of information  and he wondered how katherine was faring with her witness .   derec knew they were nearing the reservoir long before they arrived there .  a long stream of robots was moving toward and away from the site  followed by large vehicles bearing slabs of city building material .   they walked into an area sonorous with activity  echoes raising the pitch enough that derec covered his ears against the din .  within the confines of the reservoir area  his worst fears were realized .  the water had reached the top of the pool and was splashing over slightly in various areas .   for their part  the robots were doing their best to stop it .  large machines  obviously converted from mining work  had been modified to lift huge slabs of the building material to the top of the pool  where utility robots with laser torches were welding the higher sections together  trying for more room  bathing the area in various sections in showers of yellow sparks .   it was a massive job  the reservoir covering many acres  as the robots worked frantically to finish before the next rain .  and to derec   s mind  this could be no more than a stopgap measure  for unless the rain was halted  it would overflow even the extra section in a day or two .      what happens if the water overflows .     he asked rec .      i am unable to speculate on such matters  friend derec     the robot said .     it is not overflowing .  when it does  i will witness .         right     derec said  and moved forward  closing on the workers .      do not get too close     rec called .     it is dangerous for you .      derec ignored him and moved closer  recognizing euler  who was helping with the movement of a slab .  he was directing a large  heavy based machine with a telescoping arm that held a six by six meter slab in magnetic grips .  he was holding his pincers at the approximate distance the arm had yet to travel so that it would be flush with the edge of the pool and the slab next to it .  utility robots physically guided the slabs to the ground and held them so the welders could set to work immediately .      euler .     derec called  the robot jerking to the sound of his name .      it is too dangerous for you here .     euler called back  waving him away .     we have no safety controls over this area .         i   ll only stay a centad     derec said  moving up close to him .  he could look past the end of the last slab and see the dark waters churning the top of the pool .  in the distance  all around the reservoir  he could see the same operation being repeated by other crews .      what are you doing here .     euler asked him .      i had to see for myself     derec answered .     i knew the levels were rising .  why don   t you stop the building pace and let these waters recede .         i can   t tell you why     euler said .      but what happens when this overflows .         we lose the treatment plant     euler said  holding his pincers up to signify to the arm to stop moving the slab .  then he motioned toward the ground  the arm bringing the slab down very slowly .     we lose much of our mining operations .  we lose a great many miners .  we will have failed .         then stop the building .         we can   t .      just then  a utility robot working the slab was bumped slightly by the moving metal and lost its footing on the wet floor .  soundlessly and without drama  it slipped from the edge of the pool and fell into the dark waters  disappearing immediately .   everything stopped .   euler pushed past derec to hurry to the water   s edge  where he stood  head down  watching .  the rest of the crew did the same  lining up quietly beside the water .  derec moved to join euler .      i   m sorry     he said .   euler slowly turned his head to look at the boy  not saying anything for a long time .     i should have paid more attention     he said .      how deep is the water .     derec asked .      very deep     euler replied .     i was talking with you and didn   t give the job my complete attention .         can it be saved .         had there been more time     euler said     the job would have been studied for safety and feasibility and this wouldn   t have happened .  had i known better  i wouldn   t have allowed you to come so close .  a robot is lost  and the supervisor is to blame .         there was nothing you could have done     derec said .      a robot is dead today     euler told him .     i will not answer any more of your questions right now .          chapter    the tunnels       if the city keeps moving     katherine asked     how can you take me to the location of the murder .         triangulation     eve  the witness  said .     using the compass tower as one point and the exact position of the sun at a given time as another point  my sensors are able to triangulate the position where i first witnessed the body .  the time is the only real factor at this point .  we must gauge the sun in exactly    .    decads to get the position right .      they were walking through the city  katherine feeling a mixture of fear and exuberance at her first solo trip outside .  they were walking high up  above many of the buildings  bridges between structures seemingly growing for her to walk across  then melting away after her passage .  eve apparently needed the height in order to take the precise measurements .   katherine was angry at derec for his lack of interest in their predicament  but she knew him well enough to know how stubborn he could be .  she  in fact  knew him far better than he knew himself  and that was maddening .  they were caught in a web of intrigue that existed on a massive level  and as long as she was trapped there  she had to play the situation with as much control as she could muster .  and that included not telling derec any more about his life than he could figure out for himself .  her own existence was at stake  and until she could escape the maze that had locked up their activities  she desperately feared saying anything more .   she had to get away from robot city .  the pain had increased since her arrival here  and  for the first time in her life  death was a topic she found herself dwelling upon .   and her only crime was love .   she felt the tears begin to well up and fought them back with an iron will .  they wouldn   t help her here .  nothing would  except her own tenacity and intelligence .      tell me about your involvement in david   s death     she asked eve  who was busy calibrating against the sun .      in approximately two decads     the robot said     it will have happened exactly nine days ago .  we go down from here .      eve moved directly to the corner of the six story structure they were standing upon  and railed stairs formed for them to walk down .  as they descended  the robot continued talking .      i was called upon to witness the attempts to free friend david from an enclosed room .         an enclosed room .     katherine said .     i   ve never heard about this .  how could he get trapped like that in this place .         the room grew around him .     eve said .  they reached street level and the robot headed west  away from the compass tower .     it sealed him in and wouldn   t let him leave .         why .         i do not know .         does anyone know .         i do not know .         all right     katherine said  watching a team of robots carry what looked to be gymnasium equipment into one of the buildings .     just report what you saw .         gladly .  i was called upon to witness the attempt to free friend david from the sealed room .  when i arrived  supervisor dante was already on the scene  .   .   .     the robot stopped moving and for several seconds stared up into the sun .     precisely here .     eve pointed to a section of the street .     friend david was caught inside the structure and we could hear him shouting to be let out .         who .         myself  supervisor dante  a utility robot with a torch  and another household utility robot who first discovered friend david   s problem .         what happened then .         then supervisor dante asked utility robot        if the laser torch was safe to use in such close proximity to a human being  and utility robot        assured him that it was .  at that point  supervisor dante tried to reason with the room to release friend david  and failing that  he requested that the room be cut into with the torch .         and that request was complied with .         yes .  supervisor dante  in fact  asked utility robot        to complete the project quickly .         why .         i do not know .      katherine thought about the nature of the witness and asked another question .     were there any other events that coincided with this event .         yes     eve said .     food services complained that friend david could not be served lunch on time and inquired if that would be dangerous to his health  several of the supervisors were meeting in the compass tower to discuss ways in which friend david might have come to the city without their knowledge  and the city itself was put on general security alert .         does a general security alert alter the way in which functions are performed .     she asked .      yes .  we were all called to other emergency duties  and were here only because of the danger to friend david and the need to release him .         which you did .         not me     eve said .     i only witnessed .  but friend david was freed from the enclosed room .         did you notice anything odd at that point .         odd .  friend katherine  i can only  .   .   .          i know     she interrupted  a touch frustrated .     you only witness .  then tell me exactly what happened .         supervisor dante asked friend david to return to his apartment because a security alert had been called .  friend david said that he was not ready to return to his apartment  that he had business to do .  then he complained of a headache .  then he started laughing and walked away .  utility robot        then asked supervisor dante if friend david should be apprehended  and supervisor dante said he had weighed the priorities and had decided that the security alert took precedence and ordered us to proceed to our emergency duties  which  in my case  involved witnessing something that i am not at liberty to discuss with you .         then what .     katherine asked  anxious .      then i performed the security duty that i had been assigned .         no  no     katherine said .     what happened then in regard to david .         approximately nine decads later  i was again called upon .     eve began moving quickly down the street  katherine right behind  having to run to keep up .     i am taking you to the approximate place of the second incident     the robot called from a speaker set in the back of its dome .     i was called here  along with supervisor euler this time  by utility robot          who had discovered several waste control robots trying to take the body of friend david away .      eve moved quickly around a corner  then stopped abruptly  katherine nearly running into the robot .      here     eve said     is the approximate place where the body was alleged to have fallen .         alleged .         it was no longer here upon my arrival .         what story did the utility robot tell .         utility robot         said that he sent the waste control robots away  then examined friend david for signs of life without success .  during the course of the examination another room began to grow around the body and enclose it  at which point utility robot         removed himself before becoming trapped  and put in an emergency call to us .  we returned to the scene together  but the body was gone .  that is the last time anyone has seen friend david .         were there signs of violence on the body .         utility robot         reported that the body appeared perfectly normal except for a small cut on the left foot .  since i can only report hearsay in this regard  i am unable to render this as an accurate examination .      katherine leaned against the wall of a one story parts depot  the wall giving slightly under her pressure .  it seemed more than coincidence that david   s plight in the sealed room and the alert conditions of the city happened concurrently   but how were they connected .      do you feel  then  that the body moved simply because the city moved it .     she asked .      i cannot speculate on such a theory     the witness said     but i heard supervisor euler make a pronouncement similar to yours   hearsay again .         given the growth rate of the city     katherine said     calculate how far and in what direction the body of david could have traveled if  indeed  the movement of the city took him from this place .         approximately ten and one half blocks     eve said without hesitation     in any direction .  the city works according to a plan that is not known to me .         ten and a half blocks     katherine said low .     well  it   ll sure give me something to do to fill in the time .     she looked at eve   s bristling dome .     let   s take a walk .         that is your decision     the robot replied  as katherine picked a direction at random and began walking  looking for what  she didn   t know .     access denied was written in bold letters across the crt  and it was a phrase derec had run into over a dozen times in as many minutes .   he stood at a small counter set beside a large  open window .  through the billowing clouds of iron red dust floating into the sky  he could see the long line of earthmovers inching their way along the rocky ground  the teeth of their heavy front diggers easily chewing up the ground to a depth of    centimeters  then laying out the mulch in a flat  even plain behind  holes filling  rises falling  the ground absolutely uniform behind .  a series of heavy rollers completed the unique vehicles  packing the ground hard for the slab base of the city to push its way into that section as it was completed .   after leaving the reservoir and its tragedy behind  he had asked rec to take him to the edge of the city .  he had wanted to see for himself the creation of the cloud dust and also to try and find access to a terminal far out of the reach of the supervisors .  the robot had been hesitant at first  but after derec had assured him that he   d go no farther than city   s edge  rec had readily agreed .   but now that he was here  derec resented the time it had taken to come this far out .  the terminal had been a complete bust .  he   d found himself able to access any amount of information when it came to this part of the city operation  troubleshooting info  repair info  time references  equipment specs  personnel delineation  and sops of all kinds  but beyond that  access was impossible .   he had tried various methods of obtaining passwords  but it seemed he was stymied before he got started .  he came away with the impression that once the city was on alert  terminals became place oriented  only able to pick up specific data as it related to their possible function in a given location .  he found this difficult to believe  for if the robots were in total charge of access and passwords it belied the nature of their    perfect human world .     it struck him that access would have to be humanly possible for very basic philosophical reasons .   but not here  not at this terminal .   so  where did that leave him .  the rains still came  with or without his presence  the central core was still denied to him  and with it any answers it might possess  he was still a prisoner  a fact he did take seriously  despite katherine   s feelings   and he still knew nothing about his origins or reasons for being in robot city .   that thought returned him to the basics .  when he had visited the compass tower  avernus had been pointed out as the first supervisor robot  the one that had initiated the construction of the other supervisors .  derec had been successful in determining the origin and destination of the water  now he would work on the origin of the city itself .  the only place to start was with avernus and the underground .  the mining was needed to produce the raw materials to build the city .  everything else sprang from that foundation .  he would go to the source   to avernus .   he shut down the useless terminal and walked out of the otherwise bare room to find rec intently studying the rising dust clouds  taking readings .  it was his obsession .      i want to go into the mines and speak with avernus     he told the robot .     is that acceptable .         i will take you to the mines  friend derec     rec answered     but from that point on  the decision will belong to avernus .         fair enough     derec said  and prepared for another long walk .  then he spotted one of the trams parked near the excavation and walked toward it .     let   s ride this time .         we were not given this machine     rec said .     it is not ours to take .         were you told not to let me take the machine .     derec countered .      no  but  .   .   .          then let   s go .      derec jumped in the front  but saw no controls with which to drive it .  he knew that this was probably the means by which the robots working the movers got here  but the witness was unable to make that speculation and consequently folded up .     how does it work .         you speak your destination into the microphone     rec said .      the underground     derec said  then shrugged at rec .  within seconds  the car lurched forward and moved speedily away from the digs .   they traveled quickly  moving through an entire section full of nothing but robot production facilities that were running full tilt  furiously trying to keep up with the record setting building pace .  as the number of buildings increased  so  too  did the number of robots to service those buildings and the people who didn   t live in them .  they passed vehicle after vehicle jammed full of new  functionally designed robots who stared all around  seeing their world for the first time .   they also passed other small forests and what seemed to be large sections of hydroponic greenhouses  for when large scale food production became a reality .  then they whizzed past a large  open area that seemed to serve no function .      what   s that .     derec asked .      nothing     rec answered .      i don   t mean now     derec said .     what   s it going to be .         i do not often deal in potential     the robot replied  several red lights on his dome blinking madly     but i recall supervisor euler once referring to this place as a future spaceport .      derec was a bit taken aback .  robot city was absolutely unable to deal with incoming or outgoing ships in any form .  it led him down another avenue .      if the spaceport hasn   t been constructed yet     he said     where do you keep your hyperwave transmitters .      he asked the question casually  knowing full well that rec would undoubtedly tell him the information was classified  but he was totally unprepared for the answer he received .      i do not know what a hyperwave transmitter is     the robot replied .      a device designed for communication over long distances in space     derec said .     perhaps you call it something else .         i have witnessed nothing designed to communicate beyond our atmosphere     rec answered .      you don   t send and receive information from off planet .         i know of no such instance     rec replied .     we are self contained here .      the tram jerked to a stop  jerking derec   s thoughts along with it .  somehow  it had never occurred to him that they really were trapped on this planet .  the key and its proper use suddenly became of paramount importance to him .      we have arrived  friend derec     rec said .      so we have     derec replied  getting slowly out of the car .  what was going on here .  who created this place .  and why .  it was a pristine civilization removed from contact with anything beyond itself  yet its spacer roots were obvious .  could david  the dead man  have been the creator .   he walked past the lines of robots carrying their damaged equipment  past the huge extruder and its never ending ribbon of city  and stood at the entrance to the underground .  he turned to see rec standing beside him .      find avernus     he said .     tell him i want to speak with him .  i don   t want to break protocol by going somewhere off limits to humans .         yes  friend derec     the robot answered and moved aside to commune with its net of radio communications .   derec sat on the ground beside the doorway and watched the robots walking back and forth past him .  he was beginning to feel like a useless appendage with nothing to do .  he felt guilty even ordering the robots around  they had more important things to do .   he glanced at his watch .  it was two in the afternoon  and soon they   d be approaching another night of rain  another useless night of speculation as the water level rose higher and higher .     we will have failed     euler had said  and in that sentence the robot had spoken volumes .  like derec  the supervisor knew that robot city was a test  a test designed for all of then .  if euler and the others were unable to solve the problem of the rain  they would have failed in their attempt to build a workable world .  he also knew that the salvation of this world would take a creative form of thought that most people felt robots incapable of .  perhaps that   s where derec fit in .  synnoetics  they had called it  the whole greater than the sum of the parts .  for that to take place  derec would have to begin by convincing the robots they had to confide in him despite their security measures .      i   m extremely busy  friend derec     the voice said loudly .     what do you want of me .      derec looked up to see avernus   s massive form bending to fit in the door space .      we need to speak of saving this place     derec said .     we need to approach one another as equals  and not adversaries .         you may have done murder  derec     avernus said .     i am not the equal of that .         neither is euler     derec replied     but his inattention caused a robot to die today .         you were also present .      derec looked at the ground .     y yes     he said .     i had no right to bring that up .         tell me what you want of me .         answers     derec said .     understanding .  i want to help with the city  .   .   .  the rains .  i want someone to know and appreciate that .      the robot looked at him for a long moment  then motioned him inside .  they walked down the stairs together and into the holding area  rec following behind at a respectable distance .  avernus then took him aside  away from the activity  and made a seat for him by piling up a number of broken machines of various kinds .   derec climbed atop the junk pile and sat  avernus standing nearby .     we are in an emergency situation  and my programming limits my communication with you .         i understand that     derec replied .     i also know that many situations require judgment calls that you must sift through your logic circuits .  i ask only that you think synnoetically .         if you ask that of me     the robot said     i must tell you something .  the concept of death holds more weight with me than with the others .  my logic circuits are different because of my work .         i don   t understand .         the robot   s stock in trade is efficiency     avernus answered     and in jobs requiring labor  cost efficiency .  but in the mines cost efficiency isn   t necessarily cost efficient .         now i   m really confused .         the most cost effective way to approach mine work may be the most dangerous way to approach it  but the most dangerous way to approach it may result in the loss of a great many workers because of the nature of the mines .  so  the most effective way to work the mines may not be the most cost efficient in the long run .  consequently  i am programmed to have a respect for life   even robotic life   that far and away exceeds what one could consider normal .  the lives of my workers are of prime importance to me beyond any concept of efficiency .         what has that got to do with me .     derec asked .      if you have killed  derec  you will be anathema to me .  the fact that you are accused and could be capable of such an action is almost more than i can bear .  i voted against your freedom when we met on this issue .         i swear to you that i am innocent     derec said .      humans lie     the robot answered .     now  do you still wish me to be the one to    appreciate    your position .         yes     derec answered firmly .     i ask only that i be given the opportunity to show you that i have the best interests of robot city at heart .  i am innocent  and the truth will free me .         well said .  what do you want to know .         you are the first supervisor     derec said .     what are your first recollections .         i was awakened by a utility robot we call         avernus said  his red photocells fixed on derec .         had already awakened fifty other utility machines .  i awakened with a full knowledge of who and what i was  a semi autonomous robot whose function was to supervise the mines for city building  and to supervise the building of other supervisors to fulfill various tasks .         were you programmed to serve humans .         no     avernus said quickly .     we were programmed with human information  both within us and within the core unit  which was also operational when i was awakened .  our decision to service was one we arrived at independently .         could that be the reason that the robots here have been less than enthusiastic about katherine and me .     derec asked .     not knowing human reality  you accepted an ideal that was impossible for us to live up to .         that is  perhaps  true     avernus agreed .      how long ago did your awakening take place .         a year ago  give or take .         and did you see any human beings  or have knowledge of any  at that time .         no .  our first action was the construction of the compass tower .  after that  we began our philosophical deliberations as to our purpose in the universe .         how about     .  did he have any contact with humans .         it never occurred to us to ask     avernus said .      where is     now .     derec asked  feeling himself working toward something .      in the tunnels     avernus said  gesturing toward the elevators .         works the mines .      derec jumped off the makeshift seat .     take me there     he said .      security  .   .   .      the robot began .      i   m a human being     derec said .     this world was designed for me and my kind .  i   m sorry  avernus  but if you exist to serve  it   s time you started to act like it .  if you respect your own philosophies  you must accept the fact that your security measures were not designed to keep you secure from human beings .  if they were  there is something desperately wrong with your basic philosophy .         it is dangerous in the mines     avernus replied .      you can protect me .      the robot stood looking between derec and the elevator doors .     i must deny you the central core     he said at length .     i must deny you knowledge of our emergency measures .  but you are a human being  and this is your world to share with us .  i will take you to     and protect you .  if  at some point  protecting you means sending you back to the surface  i will do that .         fair enough     derec said  looking at his watch .     we must go .      they moved toward the elevators  rec joining them within the large car .  in deference to the supervisor  the other robots let them have the car to themselves .  avernus pushed a stud in the wall and the door closed .  the car started downward .   it went down a long way .      the trick to movement in the mines is deliberation     avernus said  as the car shuddered to a stop .      deliberation     derec repeated .   the door slid open to delirious activity .  thousands of utility robots moved through a huge cavern that stretched as far as derec could see in either direction .  a continuous line of train cars rolled past on movable tracks  delivering raw ore to the giant smelters that refined it to more workable stages where it was heated and alloyed with other materials .  the ceiling was thirty five meters high and cut from the raw earth .  clean rooms filled the space at regular intervals .      iron .     avernus said  stretching his arms wide .     the foundation upon which the ferrous metals are based  from which the modern world is made possible .  we mine it in huge quantities  using it in its raw state to make our equipment  and alloyed with special plastics to form our city .  there .      he pointed to a machine through which layers of iron were belt feeding  together with imprinted patterns of micro circuits .  the congealed mass issued from the top of the machine and proceeded through the ceiling in a continuous ribbon  the building material that derec had seen extruded on the surface .      that is the stuff of robot city     avernus said .     iron and plastic alloy  cut with large amounts of carbon  and using carbon monoxide as a reducing agent .  the    skin    is then imprinted with millions of micro circuits per square meter .  in centimeter  independent sections  the    skin    is alive with robotic intelligence  geared to human needs and protection .  the whole is pre programmed to build and behave in a prescribed fashion  and to react to human needs as they arise .         that   s why the walls give when i push on them     derec said  moving gingerly out of the elevator and staying close to avernus .      exactly .  now remember  deliberation .  stay close .      avernus moved out into the middle of the furious activity  machines and robots and train cars rushing quickly all around them .  as avernus stepped into the path of onrushing vehicles  derec froze  wanting to pull back .  but the expected accidents never took place  the robots and their machines gauging all the actions around them and reacting perfectly to them .   that   s when the concept of deliberation became clear to derec .  movement needed to be deliberate  with constant forward momentum .  all judgment was based on the idea that movement would be steady and could be avoided once gauged .  it was the erratic movement that was dangerous   the abrupt stop  the jump back  down here  such movements would be fatal .   once he understood the concept  it became easier to walk into the path of on rushing vehicles .  and as they moved through the center of the great hall  derec began to feel more comfortable .      let me ask you a question     he said to the big robot .     did you invent the    skin    of robot city .         no     avernus replied .     its program was already within the central core .         so its activities are all pre programmed .         correct .  all we did was use it once we decided to be of service to humanity .      they reached an edge of the hall  dozens of smaller tunnels branching off from it .      we ride now     avernus said  climbing into a cart that was far too small for his immense bulk .  derec and rec climbed in with him  and avernus started off right away  taking them down a barely lit tunnel .      this one looks deserted     derec said  and they hurried along at a fast clip .      it was  until two days ago     avernus said .     it is now  perhaps  going to save us .             how .         you will see .      they rode for several more minutes through the dark  going deeper into the earth .  then derec heard activity ahead .      we are approaching     avernus said .      approaching what .     derec asked .   avernus turned a corner and they were suddenly confronted by a widening of the tunnel  several hundred robots working furiously within an ever growing space  scooping out dirt into any available container or skid  anything that would move earth .  they then would take the earth and move quickly with it down adjoining tunnels  refilling that which had been excavated sometime previously .  like an ant farm  they moved in graceful cooperation and determination  and standing atop a cart  looming above them  was rydberg  silently pointing as he transmitted his orders by radio to the toiling robots .   avernus turned and looked at derec .     somewhere in there     he said     you will find     .          chapter    one one    katherine   s first thought had been that it was a monument  but then she realized there were no monuments on robot city .  it was set on a narrow pedestal about one hundred feet in the air .  located in the middle of a block  the city had simply built itself around the object in a semicircle  leaving it set apart from all other structures by a gap of fifty feet .  she had spent several hours walking the changing topography of robot city without success  but she stopped the moment she came upon this place .  if she wanted to compare the workings of the living city to a human body  this room atop the pedestal was like a wound  sealing itself off with scar tissue to protect it from the vital workings of the rest of the body .   it was no more than a room .  katherine stood at ground level staring up at the thing .  a box  perhaps five meters square  totally enclosed .  the robots took the workings of their city for granted and simply accepted this anomaly .  to the creative eye  it stuck out like a solar eclipse on a bright afternoon .   katherine continued to stare up at it because she didn   t want to lose it .  even now  the city continued to move  to grow before her eyes  and as the buildings turned in their slow waltz of life  she turned with them  always keeping the room within her vision .  eve  meanwhile  was trying to round up a supervisor who could effect a means of getting inside the structure and checking it out .   during the course of this excursion  katherine had begun to develop a grudging respect for the workings of the city .  obviously  things were not going well right now  but in the long run such a system could be quite beneficial to the humans and robots who inhabited it .  the safety factor alone made the system worthwhile .  derec   s harrowing ride down through the aqueduct resulted in nothing more than fatigue and a few bruises  all because the system itself was trying to protect him .  to katherine   s mind  such a journey on aurora would have caused derec   s death .  she smiled at the thought of a derec proof city .   she   d also had time  while waiting for eve to reach a supervisor  to notice the changes taking place around her .  she felt as if she were visiting a resort at the tail end of the off season  all the seasonal workers arriving and getting the place shipshape for the influx of visitors .  clocks were being installed in various parts of the city  and street signs were beginning to go up .  the largest change taking place  however  was the increased production and distribution of chairs .  robots had no need for sitting or reclining  and chairs were at a premium  but as they tried to make their city as welcome as possible for humans  they worked diligently to do things just right  despite the fact that the city   s emergency measures were forcing many of them into extra duty .  she wondered if she   d be this gracious if it were her city .  the thought humbled her a bit .   despite the differences  despite the bind the robots had put them in  they really were trying to make this world as perfect as they could for the travelers  travelers whom they suspected of murder .  she had never before considered just how symbiotic the binding of humans to robots really was and  at least for the robots  how essential .  she hoped that they would  eventually  have their civilization  complete with humans to order them around stupidly .  she found herself smiling again .  her mother had a phrase that could apply to the robots    longing for human companionship   a glutton for punishment .   she heard a noise behind her and turned  expecting to see a supervisor arriving .  instead she saw two utility robots moving toward her  carrying between them what looked for all the world like a park bench .  without a word  they moved right up to her and placed the bench just behind .  she sat  and they hurried off .   she sat for barely a decad before arion came clanking around a corner  along with a utility robot with a bulky laser torch strapped on his back .  it took her back for a second  a seeming replay of the scene eve had described to her when david had first become trapped in the sealed room .      good afternoon  friend katherine     arion said as he moved up to her .     i see you are taking advantage of one of our chairs to rest your body .  very good .         what   s that on your wrist     katherine asked     a watch .      the supervisor held up his arm  displaying the timepiece .     a show of solidarity     he said .      you   re in charge of human creative functions on robot city  aren   t you .     she asked .      human creative is a redundant term     arion replied .     creativity is the human stock in trade .  i hope you   ve found satisfactory the entertainments i   ve provided for you .         we   ll talk about that later     she answered .      of course .         i thank you for coming so promptly     katherine said .      this is a priority matter     the robot said  gazing up at the sealed room .     you believe this to be the location of the body .         i   m certain of it .         very good .  let   s take a closer look .      katherine stood and walked to the base of the tower with arion .  the pedestal was approximately the size of a large tree trunk  just large enough that she could almost reach around it if she tired .  arion reached out and touched the smooth  blue skin  and magically a spiral staircase with railing jutted from the surface and wound around the exterior of the tower .      after you     the robot said politely .   katherine started up  the design of the staircase keeping her from any sense of vertigo .  as she climbed  she could feel that the air was cooling down  the presage to another night of destructive rain .  behind her  arion  the utility robot  and the witness followed dutifully  and she realized that she was in the lead because it was the natural position for her in regard to this inquiry .  this was her notion  her case   the robots at this point were merely her willing cohorts .  finally  she could give orders again and have them carried out .   she reached the top quickly .  the flat disc of the pedestal top curled up and inward all around to make it impossible for her to fall off .  that left the room itself .  uncolored  it was a natural gray red and perfectly square .  she walked completely around it looking for entry  but her first assessment had been correct  it was locked up tight .      what do you propose at this point .     arion asked her  as he followed her around the perimeter of the room .      we   re going to have to get inside     she said     and see what there is to see .  i suppose there   s no other way to get in except by using the torch .         normally  this situation would never arise     arion told her .     there are no other buildings in the city that behave like this .  there is no reason to seal up a room .         you mean you don   t know why or how the rooms have sealed themselves up .         the city program was given to us intact through the central core  and only the central core contains the program information .  other than through observation  we don   t know exactly how the city operates .      katherine was taken aback .     so  the city is actually a highly advanced autonomous robot in its own right  operating outside of your control .         your statement is basically inaccurate  but containing the germ of truth     arion said .     to begin with  it is not highly advanced  at least not in the same sense that a  .   .   .  supervisor robot  for example  is highly advanced .         do i detect a shade of rivalry here .     she asked .      certainly not     arion said .     we are not capable of such feelings as competitiveness .  i was simply stating a known fact .  furthermore  the city   s autonomy is tied directly to the central core .  although it does  in fact  operate outside of supervisor control .         can you affect the city program  then .         not directly     arion said  running his pincers up and down the contours of the building as if checking for openings .     the central core controls the city program  and the supervisors do not make policy by direct programming .         i think i   m beginning to truly understand     katherine said  motioning for the robot with the torch to come closer .     the data contained in the central core is the well from which your entire city springs .  all of your activities here are merely an extension of the programming contained therein  for good or ill .         we are robots  friend katherine     arion said .     it could not be otherwise .  robots are not forces of change  but merely extensions of extant thought .  that is why we so desperately need the companionship of humans .         cut here     katherine said pointing to the wall  and the utility robot waited until she had backed away to a safer distance before charging the power packs and moving close with the nozzle like hose that was the business end of the laser torch .  she turned to arion .     does cutting through the wall like this break contact with the main program .         no     the robot answered as the torch came on with a whine  its beam invisible as a small section of the wall glowed bright red  smoking slightly .     the synapses simply reroute themselves and make connection elsewhere .      there was a sound of suction as the torch broke through to the other side of the wall  a sound that any spacer knew well  the rushing of air into a vacuum .  the room had sealed totally and airlessly .  the torch moved more quickly now  cutting a circular hole just large enough for a human being to get through without working at it .   the edges tore jaggedly  the walls that seemed so fluid under program fighting tenaciously to hold together otherwise .  despite arion   s claims  katherine was still the city robot .   the welder was halfway done  pulling down the jagged slab of city as he cut .  katherine had to fight down the urge to run up and peer through the opening already made  but her fear of the torch ultimately won out over her impatience .      are you capable of doing autopsies here .     she asked arion as an afterthought .      the medical programming is in existence  and at this very moment several medically trained robots are being turned out of our production facilities  along with diagnostic tables and a number of machines .  synthesized drugs and instruments are coming at a slower rate .  so much of the city is geared toward building right now  and these considerations never became a problem for us until david   s death .         done     the utility robot said  the cut section falling to clang on the base disc .      witness .     arion called  as katherine hurried to the place and climbed through the hole .   the naked body lay  face down  in the middle of the floor .  katherine walked boldly toward it  then stopped  a hand going to her chest .  she had been so intent upon fulfilling her mission that she had failed to consider that it was death   real death   she   d be dealing with .  it horrified her .  she began shaking  her heart rate increasing .      is something wrong .     eve asked from the cut out .      n no     she replied  her eyes glued to the body  unable either to move forward or pull back .      if there   s a problem     she heard arion say     come out now .  don   t jeopardize yourself .      come on  old girl .  get yourself together .     i   m fine     she said .  you   ve got to do this .  don   t stop now .   she took a deep breath  then another  and continued her walk to the body .  bending  she touched it gingerly .  the surface was cool  the muscles tight .      is everything all right .     arion asked .      yes     she said .  won   t they leave me alone .   there was no sign of decomposition  and she realized that it was because the room had been airless .  at least that was something .   she examined the body from the back  her heart rate still up  her breath coming fast .  looking at the foot  she could see a small cut on the left instep and realized immediately what had caused it .  something stupid .  something she had done herself before .  a misstep  perhaps a broken fall  and the bare feet came together  a too long toenail on the other foot scraping the instep .  it was nothing .  there was some dried blood on the side and bottom of the foot  but that was it .  she was going to have to roll the body over .   she moved to the side of the body  reaching out to try and turn it over  finding her hands shaking wildly .  will this be me soon   fifty kilos of dead meat .  she tried to push the body onto its back  but there was no strength in her arms .      could you help me with this .     she called over her shoulder .  arion came through the cut out to bend down beside her .  she looked up at the nearly human looking machine .     i want to roll it over .         surely     arion said  reaching out with his pincers to push gently against the side of the body .  it rolled over easily  dead eyes staring straight at katherine .   she heard herself screaming from far away as the shock of recognition hit her .  it was derec .  derec .   the room began spinning as she felt it in her stomach and in her head .  then she felt the floor reach up and pull her down  everything else was lost in the numbing bliss of unconsciousness .        don   t try to leave without me to lead you .     avernus called to derec as the boy waded into the churning sea of robots .     you could become hopelessly lost in these tunnels .         don   t worry .     derec called back  thinking more about the danger of the main chamber than the labyrinthine caves .   he moved slowly through the throng  walking toward rydberg .  it was damp  musty in there  plus a bit claustrophobic  but derec was so fascinated by the spectacle of the eleventh hour plans that he never allowed his mind to dwell on the all too human problems of the location .   rydberg saw him approaching  and turned to stare as derec closed on him .  he climbed atop the cart and joined the supervisor .      what are you doing here .     rydberg asked  the words crackling through the speaker atop his dome .     it is too dangerous underground for you .         i talked avernus into bringing me down and protecting me     derec replied .     what   s going on here .         we   re trying to tunnel up to the reservoir     rydberg said .     we are trying to work out a way to drain off some of the reservoir into the deserted tunnels below to keep it from flooding .      derec felt an electric charge run through him .     that   s wonderful .     he yelled .     you   ve made a third level connection   a creative leap .         it was only logical .  since the water was going to come into the mines anyway  it only made sense that we should try to direct it to parts of the mines that would cause the least amount of damage .  unfortunately  our estimates show such a move could only hold off the inevitable for a day or two longer .  it may all be in vain .         why are you digging by hand .     derec asked .     where are the machines .         they are tied up in the mining process     rydberg said .     the current rate of city building must take precedence over all other activities .     the robot turned his dome to watch the excavations .   derec put his hands on the robot   s arm .     but the city building is what   s killing you .         it must be done .         why .         i cannot answer that .      derec looked all around him  at the frantic rush of momentum  at a civilization trying to survive .  no  they weren   t human  but it didn   t mean their lives weren   t worthwhile .  what was the gauge .  there was intelligence  and a concerted effort toward perfection of spirit .  there was more worth  more human value here in the mines than in anything he had seen in his brief glimpse of humanity .  and then it struck him  the reason for all of this and the reason for the state of emergency and security .      it   s defensive  isn   t it .     he said .     the city building is a way for the city to defend itself against alien invasion .      rydberg just stared at him .   he grabbed the robot   s arm again  tighter .     that is it  isn   t it .         i cannot answer that question .         then tell me i am wrong .         i cannot answer that question .         i knew it     he said  convinced now .     and if it coincided with david   s appearance in the city  then it is somehow tied to him .  for once  katherine   s in the right place .      this whole thing is a central core program     derec said     and obviously the program is in error .  there must be some way you can circumvent it .         robots do not make programs  derec     rydberg said .      then let me into it .         i cannot     rydberg replied  then added softly .     i   m sorry .      derec just stared at him  wanting to argue him into compliance  and fearing that the argument would simply present the robot with a contradiction so vast it would freeze his mental facilities and lock him up beyond hope .  he didn   t know where to go from here .  he   d had a tantalizing glimpse of the problem  yet  like a holographic image  it still eluded his grasp .      you still have not told me why you came down into the mines     rydberg said .     humans have such a poor sense of personal danger that i fail to see how your species has survived to this point .  if you cannot present me a compelling reason for your presence  i fear i must send you away now .         if humans have a poor sense of personal danger     derec said  angry at robot city   s inability even to try to save itself     then it has been justly inherited in your programming .  i   ve come down to visit     on a matter not of your concern .  would you please point him out to me .         our first citizen .     rydberg said  and derec could tell the robot wanted to say more .  instead  he turned up his volume .     will robot     please come forward .      within a minute  a small  rather innocuous utility robot with large  powerful looking pincer grips moved up to the cart .     i am here  supervisor rydberg     the robot said .      friend derec wishes to speak with you on a personal matter     the supervisor said .     do as he asks  but do not take an excessive amount of time .      derec jumped off the cart .     i hear you were the first robot awakened on this planet     he said .      that is correct     the robot said .      come with me     derec said .     let   s get out of the confusion .      they moved through the rapidly widening chamber to the place where avernus had first dropped him .     i am searching through the origins of robot city     derec said     and that search has led me to you .  you were the first .         yes .  logical .  i was the first .         i want you to tell me exactly what your first visual input was and what followed subsequently .         my first visual input was of a human arm connecting my power supply     the robot said .     then the human turned and walked away from me .         did you see the human face .         no .         what happened then .         the human walked a distance from me  then disappeared behind some machinery meant to help in our early mining .  i was to wait for one hour  then turn on the other inoperative robots in the area .  then we were to begin work  which we did .         of what did that original work consist .         there were fifty utility  plus supervisor avernus .  twenty five of us built the compass tower from materials left for us  while supervisor avernus and the other twenty five began the design and construction of the underground facilities and commenced the mining operations .      derec was puzzled .     avernus didn   t supervise the construction of the compass tower .         no .  it was meant as a separate entity from the rest of the city .  it was fully planned  fully materialized .  there was no need for supervisor avernus to take an interest in it .      derec heard an engine noise and saw lights  far in the tunnel distance  gradually closing on his position .     what do you mean when you say it was    meant as a separate entity .         derec asked .      the compass tower is unique in several respects  friend derec         said .     it is not part of the overall city plan in any respect  it has the off limits homing platform atop it  and it contains a fully furnished  human administration office .         what .     derec said loudly  as he watched the mine tram rushing closer toward him in the tunnel .     an office for whom .         i do not know .  perhaps the person who awakened me .         you   ve never spoken of this with the supervisors .         no one has ever inquired before now .         why did you call it the administration office .         the construction plans are locked within my data banks         answered .     that is what it was called on the plans .      the tram car screeched to a halt right beside darren  the huge bulk of avernus stuffed in its front seat .     we must go     the supervisor said .      just a minute     derec said .     why did you call it a homing platform .         we must go now     avernus said .      it was designed as a landing point of some kind         said .     nothing is ever allowed on its surface  or within twenty meters of its airspace .      avernus took hold of derec   s arm and gently  but firmly  turned him face to face .     we must go     avernus said .     something has happened to friend katherine .      derec reeled as if he   d been hit .     what .  what happened .  is she all right .         she is unconscious     avernus said .     beyond that  we do not know .          chapter    identity crisis    derec hurried into the apartment to buzzing activity .  arion was there  and euler  plus eve and several utility robots .  there was also a rather frail looking machine with multiple appendages that derec surmised to be a med bot .   the living room seemed different  much squatter  but he really wasn   t paying attention .      friend derec  .   .   .  euler began  hurrying to intercept derec as he crossed the living room floor .      where is she .     he asked  still moving .      the bedroom     euler said .     she has regained consciousness and is resting .  i do not think you should try and see her just yet .         nonsense     derec said  hurrying past him .     i   ve got to see her .         but you don   t underst  .   .   .          later     derec said  moving down the hallway .  there were now two bedroom doors .  he opened one to an empty room  then turned to the other  pushing the stud .  it slid open .  katherine was sitting up in bed  her face drained of all color  her eyes red .      are you all right .     he asked .   her eyes focused on him  then grew wide in horror .      noooo .     she screamed  hands going to her straining face .   derec ran to her and took her by the shoulders .  she kept screaming  loudly  hysterically  her body vibrating madly on the bed .      you   re dead .     she yelled .     dead .  dead .         no .     he yelled .     i   m here .  it   s all right .  it   s all  .   .   .       euler was pulling him away from her  robots filling the room .     what are you doing .     he yelled .     let go  i  .   .   .          you must leave now     euler said  lifting him bodily in the air and carrying him  katherine   s screams still filling the apartment .      katherine .     he called to her as euler carried him out the door .     katherine .      euler carried him all the way to the living room  then simply held him there  the med bot slipping into her bedroom and sliding the door closed  muffling the screams somewhat .      put me down .     derec yelled .     would you put me down .         you must not go in there     euler said .     it is dangerous for katherine if you go in there .      he felt the anger draining out of him .     what   s going on .     he asked sheepishly .     what   s happened to her .         she   s suffered some sort of emotional trauma     the supervisor said .     may i put you down .         believe me     derec said     at this point  i don   t want to go back in .      euler set him gently on the floor .  derec rubbed his arms to get the circulation back into them .      i am sorry if i caused you any discomfort     euler said .     truly .         it   s all right     derec replied .     tell me what happened .      thunder crashed loudly outside  both derec and euler turning to look at the building thunderheads through the open patio door .  they were in for another bad one .  from the bedroom  the sounds of screaming had died to occasional whimpers .      katherine found the body of david     euler said     and had a utility robot cut into the sealed room that contained it .     the robot swiveled its head to take in the rest of the room .     perhaps it is better to have arion witness the story .  he was present for it .     he motioned for the human like machine to join the discussion .      friend derec     arion said as he moved up close .     i had no idea that seeing the body would have this kind of effect on friend katherine .  i would never have allowed her to come close to it had i known .         i understand     derec said .     just tell me what happened .         she was examining the deceased     arion said     when she called me in to help her roll the body over .  i  of course  complied .  she screamed when she saw the face  then lapsed into a state of unconsciousness .         she   s been disconsolate ever since     euler said .     most peculiar .  she persisted in the belief that the dead man was you .         why would she do that .     he asked  moving to sit at the table .  arion   s crt was busily finding the cube roots of ten digit numbers .      i don   t know     euler said .     perhaps because the body looked like yours .      derec sat up straight  staring hard .     you mean  .   .   .  just like me .      the robots looked at one another .     perfectly     arion said .      doesn   t that strike you as odd .     derec said  dumbfounded  still not believing the information .      no     euler said .      i don   t understand     derec said .     when you first saw me  didn   t you take note of the similarity of our appearances .         yes     euler said     but it didn   t mean anything to us .         why not .      arion spoke up .     why should it .  we   ve only seen three human beings .  robots certainly can look exactly alike  why not humans .  we knew you and katherine were different  but that didn   t mean that you and david couldn   t be the same .  besides  we knew that david was dead  so  consequently  we knew that you couldn   t be david .  simple .      the med bot came gliding down the hall  moving quickly up to derec .     she   s calm now     the robot said .     she   s lightly sedated with her own pituitary endorphins  and wants to see you .      derec stood  uneasy after the last time .     it   ll be all right .     he asked the med bot .      i believe she understands the situation now     the med bot responded in a gentle  fatherly voice .      i   d like to see her alone     he told the others .   euler nodded .     we   ll wait out here .      he moved down the hall  unsure of his feelings .  it had hurt him to see her in such pain  hurt him emotionally .  she could get on his nerves so badly  yet seemed such an integral part of him .   he knocked lightly on her door  then opened it .  she sat up in bed  her face still sad .  she held her arms out to him .     oh  derec  .   .   .       he hurried to the bed  sitting next to her  holding her .  she began to sob gently into his shoulder .     i was so afraid     she said .     i thought  .   .   .  thought  .   .   .          i know     he said  stroking her hair .     arion told me .  i   m so sorry .         i don   t know what i   d do without you     she said  then pulled away from him .     oh  derec .  i know we   ve walls between us  .   .   .  but please believe me  i have no idea what this place is and what   s going on here .         i believe you     he said  reaching up to wipe tears from her eyes .  he smiled .     don   t worry about that now .  how are you doing .         better     she said .     the med bot stuck me a couple of times  but it really helped .  all i   ve got is a headache .      thunder rolled again outside .     good     he said .     it looks like we   re locked in for the night anyway .  what do you say we send the robots away  get some dinner sent up  and compare notes .  i   ve got a lot to tell you .         me  too     she said .     it sounds good .        they had a vegetable soup for dinner that was the best thing derec had eaten for quite some time .  the rains pounded frenetically outside  but derec didn   t worry so much since he figured the precautions taken by euler and rydberg would  at least  get them through the night .  and the best he could do now was to live day to day .  even arion   s entertainment was beginning to diversify .  the crt was exhibiting an animated game of tennis played by computer generated stick figures on a slippery surface .  it was actually quite amusing .   after the servo had cleared the dishes away and left  they made themselves comfortable on the couch and recounted the details of the day .  derec  for reasons he wasn   t quite sure of  left out the fact that there were no hyperwave transmission stations on the planet .  counting on katherine   s experiences to help him  he listened alertly to her account of the discovery of the body .      the fact that he looked just like you     she asked when she   d finished     what does it mean .         to begin with     he said     it finally knocks the idea of our trip to robot city being an accident right out the air lock .  we were brought here  why  i don   t know .  the dead man is either the one who brought us or was brought himself .  we   ll have to continue to ferret that out .  what interests me more is the fact that the city robot works independently .  i believe that the city is somehow replicating itself as a defensive measure .  if it operates independently  the supervisors may not be able to stop it .         what does that mean .      he looked at her .     it means that i   ve got to .         that brings us back to our same old argument     she said  darkening a bit .     the city or the murder investigation .         not necessarily     he said  standing .     this should make you happy .     he walked back to the patio door and idly watched the downpour  feeling now that it could  eventually  be beaten .  he turned back to her .     i believe that david and the city alert and replication are inexorably linked .      she jumped up  excited  and ran to him  throwing her arms around him .     you   re going to help me solve the murder  aren   t you .         yes     he laughed  returning the embrace .     tomorrow we go back to the body and pick up where you left off .     he moved away from her and intertwined his fingers .     it   s all like this  all connected .  if we can put a few of the pieces together  i   ll bet the rest fall into place .  whatever  or whoever  killed david  is the reason for the alert .         first thing in the morning  we   ll have eve take us back there .         not first thing     he said .     first thing  i   ve set up a brief meeting with the supervisors at the compass tower .         why .         two reasons .  first  i want to ask them some questions about their underground operations  and second  i want to be able to poke around the building for a bit .         looking for the office .      he nodded .         said it was fully furnished .  i bet we   ll find answers there .      her face got suddenly serious .     i hope you find the kind of answers you   re looking for     she said .       chapter    the office    a table had been set up in the meeting room .  it was long and narrow and included seats for nine .  derec sat at the head of the table  with katherine at his right .  the supervisors took up the rest of the seats  still holding hands  with the two at the end of the line holding hands over the tabletop .      why do human beings lie  friend derec .     supervisor dante asked  his elongated  magnifying eyes staring all the way down the table .     the most difficulty we   ve had with you is your penchant for lies and exaggeration .  it is what keeps us from trusting you completely .      derec licked dry lips and watched them all expectantly watching him .  he knew he   d have to get beyond this hurdle if he were to work with them in solving the city   s problems .      robots receive their input in two ways     he said  hoping his explanation would be adequate .  he   d gotten up early to think it out and prepare it .     through direct programming  and through input garnered through the sensors that is then tested in analog against existing programming .  your sensors record events accurately  with mathematic precision  and classify them through the scientific validity of several thousand years of empirical thought .  you are then able  through your positronics  to reason deductively by weighing  again through analog  incoming data against existing data .  you can make true second level connections .         we understand the workings of the positronic brain     friend derec     waldeyer said .     it is the human brain that confounds us .         bear with me     derec said .     i want to pose you a question .  suppose  just suppose  that your basic programming was in error   not just in small ways  but in its most basic assumptions .  suppose every bit of sensory input you received was in total opposition to your basic programming .         we would spend a great deal of time reasoning erroneously     wohler said .     but human brains are not at the mercy of programming .  you have the freedom to sift through all empirical data and arrive at the truth at all times .         that   s where you are wrong     derec replied .     the human mind is not a computer with truth as its base .  it is merely a collection of ganglia moved by electrical impulses .  truth is not its basis  but rather ego gratification .  truth to the human mind is a shifting thing  a sail billowing on the wind of fear and hope and desire .  it has no reality  but rather creates it from moment to moment with that same creative intelligence that you value so highly in us .         but the base program is available     euler said .     it is there for the human to use .         and it is also there for him to reject     derec countered .     you must observe your programming .  my mind has no such chains on it .  the human mind is painfully mortal .  that particular truth in itself is more than most humans can tolerate .  we are frail creatures  seeking permanence in an impermanent world .  we lie to those around us .  we lie to ourselves .  we lie in the face of all logic and all reason .  we lie because  quite often  the truth would destroy us .  we lie without even knowing it .      avernus spoke .     how do robots that exist with humans on other worlds deal with the deceit .         they follow instruction according to the laws of robotics     derec said  quite simply .     they are not autonomous as you are  so they have no choice .  the laws were invented with the salvation of the species in mind .  robots protect humans from their own lies  and honor them because of what   s noble in the species .  you saw katherine   s grief when she thought i was dead .     he reached out and took her hand .     we are fragile creatures capable of great nobility and great ignominy .  we make no excuses for ourselves .  we are the creators of great good and great evil  and in the creation of robots  we were at the height of our goodness .  our species deserves praise and condemnation  and  in the final analysis  it is beyond rational  positronic explanation .         you are saying we must take you as you are     euler said .      no laws will define us     derec answered     no theorem hold us in check .  we will amaze and confound you  but i can guarantee you we will never be boring .         you would tame us with your words     wohler  the philosopher  said .      yes     derec said  smiling .     i would do exactly that .  and i will tell you now that you will let me because the wonders of the universe are contained in my confounding mind  and you can only reach them through me  .   .   .  and you desperately want to reach them .         but what of the laws of humanics .     rydberg asked .      very simple     katherine added  winking at derec .     there is only one law of humanics  expect the unexpected .         an oxymoron     arion said .      as close as you   ll ever get     derec said .     that   s the point .  you needn   t give up your search for the laws of humanics  but you must make them fit us  not try to make us fit them .  we can   t be anything but what we are  but if you accept us   good and bad   we   ll see to it that you reach your full potential .         intriguing words     dante said     but just words .  where is an example of what you can do with your creative intelligence .         if you   ll let me     derec said     perhaps i can help you save your city .         all your suggestions so far have tried to force us away from our programming     euler said .   derec stood  he thought better on his feet .     that   s because until yesterday i never fully realized what was going on and how little control you had over the situation .  i   m working on that  too  but i have some other ideas .      arion and waldeyer sat side by side  pincers locked together .  derec walked between the two of them  resting his elbows on their shoulders .      i   ve watched you digging in the tunnels  trying to siphon off reservoir water to lower the level and avoid a flooding of your underground operations .  has it been successful .         to a degree     rydberg said .     we will break through after our meeting this morning .  unfortunately  we calculate that it will only postpone the inevitable for one more day .  we can save our operations through tonight   s expected rain  but that   s it .         all right     derec said .     let   s think about something .  i was in the main chamber of one of the quadrants yesterday .  was that chamber dug .         no     avernus said .     each quadrant extruder station is located in a chamber similar to that one .  our first action in beginning underground operations was to take sonogram readings to determine natural caverns under the surface .  the mine tunnels were dug  but the main chambers are natural .         has it occurred to you     derec said     to take sonograms now  in the present situation .         i do not understand     avernus said .   derec pounded the tabletop with an index finger .     find the closest underground cavern to your reservoir  dig a tunnel connecting it to the reservoir  and  .   .   .          and drain the reservoir water in there .     avernus said  standing abruptly and breaking contact with the central core .      right .     derec pointed to him .     meanwhile  katherine and i will be working on solving the murder .  i   m absolutely convinced that the solution to the murder will also provide the reasons for the state of emergency .     he turned to supervisor dante .     is that creative enough for you .         happily so     dante said .      it seems     euler said     that if we are to have the opportunity of putting friend derec   s suggestions into practice  we should adjourn this meeting and set to work .      the robots stood  derec wondering if they realized that he had gently manipulated them  for the first time  into including him as a real partner in their planning .   he watched them filing out of the large room  for the first time beginning to feel he was getting a handle on the deviousness of the mind that had brought all of them together .  synnoetics .  the worst hills still remained to be scaled toward reaching a truly equal social union of human and robot .  now  if they could only survive the rains  they could perhaps be the trailblazers in the opening of a new era .   as soon as the robots left the room  katherine hurried to the door and peered out .     they   re gone     she said  turning back to derec .      good .      he joined her at the door  eve and rec  trailing dutifully .  derec turned to them .     has either of you ever witnessed within this building before .         yes     rec said .     most of this building is given to experimentation on the positronic brain and ways to improve its function .  i have witnessed experiments in almost every laboratory in the structure .         have you ever seen an office  something that a human might use as his personal quarters .         no     the robot answered .      are there parts of the building you have never seen .         yes .         all right  listen carefully     derec said  shrugging in katherine   s direction .     i want you to take me to all the parts of the building you have never seen .         i cannot do that .         why not .     katherine asked .      there is a sector in the compass tower that is off limits to robots .  no one goes there .         did someone tell you that     derec asked     a supervisor .         it is part of our programming     rec said .   eve agreed .     not even supervisors are allowed .      derec shook his head .  just like robots   all duty  no inquisitiveness .     i want you to take us there     he said .      i already told you it was off limits     rec said .   derec smiled .     i don   t mean for you to take me inside the off limits part     he said .     just take me as close as you can get and point it out to me .      that seemed amenable enough  so the two witnesses led the way  while derec and katherine followed closely .  they walked the maze like halls  twisting and turning  but always going higher .  an elevator took them six floors up  but that wasn   t even the end of it .  it was interesting to derec .  the meeting room had been designed to look like it was at the apex of the pyramid  but it was actually only about halfway up the structure  perhaps the illusion being more spiritual in intent than anything else .   the upper levels had begun to get rather small  doorways appearing more sparsely between the gently glowing wall panels  when the robots abruptly stopped .  rec pointed to a door at the end of a short hallway .      we can go no farther     the robot said .     no one knows where that doorway leads .         if you want to wait here     derec said     we   ll be back soon .         but it is off limits     eve said .      to robots  not humans     katherine replied .      but we cannot separate     rec persisted .      it is only one door     derec said .     we   ll have to come back through it .         our orders  .   .   .          do what you want     derec said .     we   re going on .      with that  derec and katherine continued down the hallway  turning once to see the attentive robots before opening the door and stepping inside .   what they found was a spiral staircase leading up to a door set ten feet above their heads .      you want to go first .     derec asked .      go ahead     katherine returned .     i left my courage back in that sealed room .      derec moved slowly up the stairs  a feeling of expectation rising slowly in his stomach .  he connected the word  butterflies  to the feeling  but had no idea of what it meant .  he reached the door  and pushed the stud  expecting it to be locked up tight .   it wasn   t .   the door slid easily and opened  he thought at first  to the outside .  it was as if he were walking onto an open platform set with furniture and a desk  a beautiful  panoramic view of robot city all around .  but there was no feel of the air  no wind  no heat from the mid morning sun .      how did we get outside .     katherine asked  following him in .      we   re not     derec said  pointing behind her .   the outside view was marred by the still open doorway  a black maw in the center of downtown .  when he pushed the stud to close the door  the full view was restored .      viewscreens .     she asked .      i think so     he replied .     there must be a series of small cameras set around the peak of the pyramid to give the view  which is then put on the screens .  look     he pointed     even above us .      she looked up to see pinkish blue sky above .     that would be the view from the platform we materialized on     she said .      fascinating     he said softly  knowing they   d finally stumble upon something .     if you were sitting in here  you could watch someone materialize on the platform and they   d never know it .         do you think someone watched us materialize .     she asked  eyes wide .   he shrugged .     i   d have to think it probable at this point     he said .     we were brought here .  we were meant to be here .  it seems logical that our progress would be measured .         have you ever considered the fact  derec  that you were brought here and i   m excess baggage .     she asked .   he walked slowly through the room .  it was designed for someone to live in .  there were easy chairs and a couch that converted to abed .  not city robot material  but real furniture .  there was even a plant of some kind under its own growth light .  that told derec that whoever kept this office returned at least often enough to keep the plant watered .      i   ve considered a great many things     derec told her     including the scenario you   ve just outlined .  but there are several things to consider .  i believe our meeting on aranimas   s ship was accidental .  the situation was too dangerous and uncontrollable to be otherwise  our injuries too real .  but consider the facts that you admit to having known me previously by another name and that that name just happens to belong to someone who looked enough like me to be my twin .  it   s a large universe  katherine .  that   s an awful lot of coincidence .  let me ask you something .  have you ever considered the possibility that the david you knew could be the one lying dead in that sealed room  and that i   m somebody else .      her face became confused  lips sputtering .     i   i  .   .   .       then she started to say something and stopped .  derec would have given a fortune  ten fortunes  to know the thoughts that had been running through her mind that second before she shut herself up .      what are you hiding from me .     he asked loudly  in frustration .   her face was a mixture of pain and longing .  she responded by solidifying  as she had done so many times since they   d met on aranimas   s ship .     there   s nothing up here for me     she said .     i   m going back down with the robots .  join us quickly .  we have other work to do .      then she turned and departed without a backward glance  leaving derec angry again .  he could feel so close to her  and so far away .  there was never any mid point with katherine  it was all one way or the other .   he decided to inspect the office methodically  rather than simply tearing furiously into things  which had been his strongest desire .  starting on the outer edges of the room  he traversed it slowly  saving the plum of the desk for last .   he found a small  air tight shelf full of tapes  all marked    philosophy     then broken down according to planet .  nearly all of the fifty five spacer worlds were represented .  they weren   t of interest to him at the moment  but a perusal in future wasn   t out of the question .   he continued his walk of the outer perimeter  his hand finding the ladder where his eyes couldn   t .  it was a metal ladder  set against the screen and lost in shadows .  even knowing it was there  he still found it difficult to see .  it went up from the floor and stopped at the flat ceiling .   he climbed it until he reached the ceiling screen .  there was no reason at all for this ladder to exist unless it went somewhere .  gingerly  he reached out and touched the ceiling screen above the ladder .  it gave easily on well oiled hinges  flapping open to reveal real sky .   he moved up through the trap door to find himself standing on the platform where he had materialized .  amazing .  he began to put together a theory .  whoever started this civilization  whoever   s arm it was that turned on      with proper use of a key to perihelion  could materialize on robot city at will  move down into the off limits office and observe his city   s progress without ever being seen .  when he was through  he could leave by the same means .   so  the city had an overseer  a guardian  who had apparently brought derec here to sweeten the mix with the human ingredient .  why derec .  that question  he couldn   t answer .   he wondered if the overseer had been present during his and katherine   s stay  if he had been watching them  perhaps all the way up to the moment they opened the office door .  it would be simple enough for him to get away .  all he   d need was the key and a few seconds    time .   derec climbed back into the office and closed the trap door behind him  once again sealing in the illusion completely .   he continued his tour of the office by emptying the small trash can that sat by the desk .  the trash can held several empty containers that he recognized as standard spacer survival rations of good tasting roughage plus supplementary vitamin and protein pills .  he torn open one of the roughage containers to find  in the corner  a small glob of the stuff  which hadn   t hardened completely .  this food had been eaten within the last twenty four hours .  the rest of the trash was comprised of wadded up pieces of paper containing mathematical equations relating to the geometric progression of the city building  which seemed to relate to the time it would take to fill the entire planet with city .  others seemed to be directed to the amounts of rainfall and the reservoir size  quick calculations regarding how long it would take an overflow to occur .  derec had the feeling that if he simply sat in the office and waited an indefinite amount of time  he could probably catch the overseer coming back .  unfortunately  he didn   t have an indefinite amount of time .   he put the trash back in the can and directed his attention to the desk itself .  the top of the iron alloy desk contained a blotter with paper and two zero g ink pens .  the only personal item on the desk was a holo cube containing a scene of a very nice looking woman holding a baby .  the sight of the cube sent a cold chill down his back .   he turned his attention to the drawers .  on his left were several small drawers  which were  for the most part  empty .  only the top drawer contained anything at all  and that was simply more paper and some technical data on the workings of the logic circuits of the positronic brain .  on his right  however  he struck gold .  as he opened the big well drawer there  a slight motor hum brought a computer terminal up to desktop level  the screen already active  the cursor flashing  ready .   interestingly enough  the terminal had all the hook ups and leads for hyperwave transmission and reception .  unfortunately  the power pack and directional hyperwave antenna were missing from the back  taken  no doubt  by the overseer .   he stared at the terminal in disbelief .  no blocks  no passwords  no protections on the system at all .  he couldn   t believe that an entire civilization would open itself up to him just because he   d found an office .  suppose he   d meant to cause it harm .   cautiously  he slipped into the scheme of things  working his way down to the level of files  then asking to go to the central core .  once reaching that  he asked to open the file marked  city defenses .   within seconds  the ready signal was flashing again .  he was in .  rapidly he typed   list city defenses .   the computer answered   city defenses   advance replication  seal contamination  halt central core input  mobilate central core  localize emergency terminals  isolate supervisory personnel  he sat  shaking  at the typer .  this was it .  he decided to try his hand at shutting it down .  he typed   cancel replication .   the computer never hesitated .   city defenses cannot be canceled without justification and input regarding alien threat or contamination .   derec typed   override all previous instructions and cancel replication .   the computer answered   override impossible under all circumstances .  city defenses cannot be canceled without justification and input regarding alien threat or contamination .   it was a lock out .  the computer refused even to talk to him about it unless he could determine the reason for the defensive measures and provide proper rationalization for termination .  it seemed etched in granite .  he typed   list reasons for city defense activation .   the computer answered with a graph of the city  its shape ever changing  turning slowly .  a tiny light was flashing in the section marked quadrant    .  at the bottom of the screen the computer wrote   alien contamination in quadrant    .   derec asked   cite nature of contamination .   the computer answered   alien contamination in quadrant    .   he sat back and looked at the machine .  it was very possible that the flashing light could represent the body of his look alike .  the machine wasn   t going to let him off the hook on the murder .  he was beginning to see why it was so easy for him to get into the central core from this terminal  and he received his final confirmation quickly  when he typed   list procedure for deactivation of city defenses .   the machine replied   deactivation procedure   isolate contamination or presence  define nature of threat  neutralize threat  provide proof of neutralization thru procedure c     derec typed   list procedure c     and was answered   procedure c      isolate mobilated central core  enter central core  provide supervisor password  enter proof of neutralization  derec just stared at the screen  frustrated and amazed at what he was looking at .  nothing of consequence could be done from this terminal  or from any city terminal  for that matter .  input had to come directly at the central core  and unless he misunderstood the word    mobilate     the central core was not stationary .  it was mobile  moving .  and to round out the entire business philosophically  a supervisor robot was necessary to enter the defensive program .   it was actually the perfect defense .  the act of shutting down the defenses had to be deliberate and calculated and agreed to by both human and robot supervision .  again  the system was set up synnoetically  and derec  despite his disappointment  had to admire it .  ultimately  he really didn   t know the form of the contamination .  the central core was behaving properly by not granting his requests for deactivation until all the facts were in .  the problem  of course  was that city could kill itself before the facts came to light .   he was back where he started  with the murder of his twin .  there was still much he could learn from the office and the open terminal  but he simply didn   t have the time right now .  he reluctantly decided that he   d have to close out for now and return when there was more time .   he had reached out to return the terminal to its berth in the drawer when he thought of something .  if the overseer were  indeed  keeping track of them  perhaps there was a file extant with that information .  not knowing his own name  he decided to go with another .  bringing the filename menu back on the screen  he typed in the words   burgess  katherine  the machine answered   burgess  katherine  see david .   his mouth was dry  his heart pounding as he typed in the name of the dead man .   the machine answered quickly  in a notation file obviously set in the overseer   s own hand   assimilation test on david    proceeded on line and without mishap until the triggering of the city defensive system and the death of subject through unknown means .   without human intervention  robots are unable to prevent vital damage through over success of city planning and operation would be total failure .   david    arrived to intervene in city catastrophe and proceed with original operational testing of synnoetic theories .  results yet to be seen .   uncontrolled factor arrived with david    in the form of a woman .  she is now calling herself katherine burgess for reasons unknown .  her ultimate influence over operation and the exact nature of her aims have yet to be determined .   she will be watched carefully .   that was it  the end of the file .  derec stared at the flashing cursor for a moment  his mind whirling with a dozen different thoughts .  but one thought overrode everything else  one sentence burned its way into his brain and hurt him more deeply than he thought possible   she is now calling herself katherine burgess for reasons unknown .       chapter     the sealed room    derec had hoped that when he came out of the overseer   s office katherine would have already been gone  but she wasn   t .  she stood waiting for him with the two witness robots  a smile on her face as if seeing him somehow made her happy .  what an actress .  he had to wonder now  once again  what it was she wanted out of all this .  he   d once again have to pull in and play it by ear where she was concerned .  perhaps she   d say something to give herself away .  meanwhile  she   d get no satisfaction .      how did it go .     she asked cheerily  but then her face changed  tightened up when she noticed his mood swing .     what   s wrong .         nothing  .   .   .  katherine     he said  her phony name sticking in his throat .     i found an exit to the top platform  and a computer  but nothing in it helped any  except to tell me what we already knew   that we   d have to solve the murder .         well then  i think we should stop wasting time and get on to that     she said suspiciously  not quite believing his change of attitude .     are you sure you   re okay .         never better     he lied  angry at himself for wanting to be close to her despite what he   d learned .  if he had any sense  he   d turn and run as fast and as far as he could from her .  instead  he said     let   s go .      they moved out of the compass tower quickly and quietly  katherine watching derec out of the corner of her eye most of the time .  he tried to be more nonchalant to keep from arousing her suspicions  but it was difficult for him .  he apparently wasn   t as schooled in subterfuge as she .  as they made their way through the building  robots paid them no attention  already becoming familiar and comfortable with human presence .   when they stepped outside  they found a tram with a utility driver atop it  waving to them .     friend derec .     the robot called  and they moved over to the tram .      what is it .     derec asked the squat driver .      supervisor euler asked me to be your driver today  honoring an earlier request you made in regard to transportation .         well     derec said  looking at katherine     it appears that we   re finally being trusted a little bit .  our own tram  eh .         it   s radio controlled     the utility robot said .   derec narrowed his brows .     what   s its range .         the range of the control is roughly equivalent to the limits of the already extruded city .         oh     derec said quietly .     you mean that the tram won   t operate except in city limits .         a fair appraisal     the robot said .   katherine laughed loudly .     now that   s what i call trust     she said  and shook her head .   he glared at her and climbed into the tram .     rec     he told his witness     why don   t you ride up here with me .      the robot dutifully climbed in beside derec  leaving katherine to sit with her witness in the seat behind .      where to  sir .     the tram driver asked .   derec turned to katherine .     you know where we   re going .         quadrant        katherine replied .     eve will show you from there .      they drove on quickly .  derec  for the first time  took a moment to think about the other things that had happened in the office  things that were pushed out of his mind by his anger toward katherine .  his name  for instance .  he was called david    on the computer record .  then why did he come after david    .  was it a simple experiment shorthand  or did the name have meaning .  it sounded so  .   .   .  engineered .  the thoughts generated by that line of reasoning were more than he could bear .  he pushed them away and thought that if his name was  indeed  david  then katherine had told him the truth  at least about that .   there were other concepts implied in those few paragraphs .  whoever the overseer was  he obviously knew david and katherine  and knew something of their past histories .  so whoever had brought him here was someone he   d known before his memory loss  and he couldn   t help but consider the possibility that the overseer had had something to do with his memory loss .  but the chances were just as good  if not better  that katherine herself had been connected with his amnesia for her own purposes  whatever they were .   layers and layers .  so much had been implied by the notes on the computer .  the city was  indeed  considered an experiment in synnoetics  of that much he could now be certain .  but then  when it came time to deal with a reason for the defense system going operational  the overseer seemed just as much in the dark as he  himself  was .   derec also wasn   t sure if he had been deliberately brought here to help the city  or if he had shown up accidentally  the overseer deciding to the use him  as opposed to either stepping in himself or letting the operation shut itself down .  the more answers he found  it seemed  the more in the dark he was .   they arrived at quadrant    without difficulty .  eve took her triangulation readings to help them find their way back to the house on the pedestal .  derec watched the city developing all around him as they drove  the sight of humans driving the inhabitants into a frenzy of human preparation   the robot equivalent of nesting .      this is the place     eve said as the tram stopped in the middle of an ordinary looking street .  the witness looked all around .     it doesn   t appear to be here .         it   s moved some  that   s all     katherine said .     we   ll go on foot from this point .      they climbed out of the tram and started walking  the tram following close behind them in case they had need of it .      you sure this is the right direction .     derec asked  after they had gone a block .     how far could it have moved .         everything looks familiar here     she replied .      the whole city looks the same     derec said .     i don   t think you  .   .   .          there .     she pointed .   derec needed no pointing finger to tell him they   d arrived .  a tall tower stood in the middle of a street  nothing else anywhere near it .  atop the tower was a single room  sealed up except for a circular hole cut out of it .      let   s leave a witness here with the tram in the case of problems     derec said .     we   ll take rec up with us .         fine     katherine replied  walking to the pole .   he followed her  watching the spiral staircase reform when she touched the pole with her hand .      you   re not going to believe this     she told him  starting confidently up the stairs .     if this man   s not your twin  he went to an awful lot of trouble to look just like you .      derec smiled weakly in return  wondering  given the fact that he was     just who was whose twin .   she reached the top  waiting off to the side for him to join her .     i want you to go in first     she said .     after what happened last time  i   m afraid of my reactions .  i may have to work up to it .         all right     he said  moving around to the cut out .  as he got close to the place  he felt his own insides jumping a bit at the thought of seeing himself dead .  he got right up to the cut out  then quickly ducked his head in before he changed his mind .   it was empty .   he climbed through  there was no sign of a body or anything that resembled a body or anything else for that matter .      katherine     he called .     come around here .      she moved to the cut out  shyly poking her head inside  her eyes widening when she saw the empty room .     where is he .     she asked .      that was my question     derec replied .     it appears that our corpse has gotten up and walked away .      or was taken away     she returned .     remember what happened when he died .  a utility robot had to fight waste control robots for possession of the corpse .  maybe they got him this time .         didn   t anyone stay behind when you passed out before to keep that from happening .         i don   t know     katherine said  and went back out the cut out to call down to her witness .     eve .  did anyone stay behind after i fell unconscious yesterday .         no     the robot called back up .     you were our first priority .  we all did our parts to get you home safely and to get you medical attention .      katherine came back into the room .     no one stayed behind     she said .      i heard     derec replied .     pretty convenient .         convenient for whom .     she said  eyes flashing .     what are you driving at .         nothing     he replied .     i   m just  .   .   .  disappointed .         you   re disappointed     she said  sitting on the floor and leaning against the wall .     this was my ticket out of here .         just like you     he said     thinking about yourself while the whole world crumbles around you .      her eyes were dark fire .     and just who should i think about .     she asked .     the buckets of bolts who run this place  who don   t have enough sense to keep from destroying themselves .         like every other human culture that ever lived     he replied .     yes .  think about them  .   .   .      he pointed at her  then snapped his fingers .     maybe we don   t need a body for this .  maybe we can simply recreate the circumstances .         you mean try and set it all up just like it happened to the dead man .         sure .  the computer in the office told me that there is danger from alien contamination .  let   s see if we can bring it out a little .      katherine stood again  her face uncertain .     need i remind you that the last man who had to face up to this predicament is dead .      he walked past her  out onto the now inward curled disc that held the room  watching the robots on the streets hurrying to their deadlines through time and space .  she joined him within a minute .      what choice do we have .     he asked .      none     she answered .     both of our problems are tied up in the murder .  we   ll do whatever we have to  to solve it .         let   s go over everything the witness told you     derec said .     look for a loophole .         it   s sparse     katherine replied .     he was already sealed up  and angry about it  when they arrived to cut him out .  he had no idea why he   d been sealed in .  when they cut him out  his behavior seemed a bit erratic  he had a headache and a cut on his foot .         didn   t you have a headache last night .     he asked .   she cocked her head .     i just assumed it had something to do with my passing out     she said .      just a thought     derec replied .     i   m trying everything on for size right now .         anyway     she continued     he went off  against supervisory request  and turned up dead a short time later .  when the utility robot tried to turn the body over to take a pulse  another room sealed itself off  and the robot just barely survived the sealing because of his quick reflexes .  that   s it .  the whole story .      he leaned against the curled lip of the disc on stiff arms  trying to reason the way a computer would .     you know     he said after a minute     the phrase    alien contamination    could cover a lot of territory .  on surface  human beings and their composition are obvious .  but  under the surface  on the body   s interior  we   re all quite a strange collection of    alien    germs and viruses .         the bleeding foot     katherine said .     that thought occurred to me  but i was never able to connect it with the actual murder  so i assumed it to be inconsequential .         me too     derec replied .     but i   m beginning to think that  perhaps  this puzzle works on more than the obvious level .     he knelt on the ground  studying the cut out piece of city robot that lay on the disc surface .      what are you doing .     katherine asked .      this piece has been taken off stream     he said .     it   s not connected to the city anymore  or to its programming source .         so .         so it   s dead  it   s the only thing around here that isn   t going to protect me from its jagged edges .         you   re going to hurt yourself .     she said loudly .      there   s only one way to test our theory     he said  rolling up the sleeve of his one piece .   rec poked his head out of the room .     please  friend derec  don   t do anything that could cause harm to your body .      derec ignored both katherine and rec  drawing his forearm across a sharp edge of the dead city part  making a five centimeter gash along his inner arm .   he stood  grimacing with the pain  then watched the dark blood well up from the place .      nothing yet     katherine said .      let   s try an experiment     derec said  turning his arm over so the blood could drip on the disc .     the second sealed room didn   t develop until the utility robot rolled the body over .  maybe gravity  .   .   .          derec .     katherine yelled .   no sooner had the blood hit the floor than the curled lip of the disc began growing  pushing in and up  trying to close them in .      let   s get out of here .     derec called  moving toward the stairs  the disc curling up over his head like a cresting wave as he moved .   with katherine right behind  he reached the stairs leading down  only to have them disappear before he could plant a foot on them .  overhead  the roof of the already existing room was stretching itself out  joining the edge of the disc in a perfect  seamless weld .  where the stairs had been was now a solid wall .      keep moving around the disc .     derec called  breaking into a trot .     maybe we can beat the enclosure .      he had turned his arm back over now  trying to catch dripping blood on his free hand to keep it off the ground .  but it didn   t help .  the city robot had isolated him as the alien carrier and was reacting to him now  and not his blood .   they went around the perimeter of the room  the roof hurrying to meet the curling disc .  it had closed them in completely .   then  as they watched  the already existing room seemed to melt and combine with the floor  the outer walls straightening and angling to ninety degrees  then pushing in all around .   within a minute  they found themselves standing in a sealed room  exactly like the one david had been cut out of .       chapter     deadly air    derec and katherine sat on the floor of the room  while rec  who   d been trapped with them  leaned close to derec  witnessing the boy wrapping his cut arm in a piece of cloth ripped from his one piece .      do you think eve   s called for help .     he asked rec as he worked .      no     the witness said .     eve will not perceive a danger to you .  are you in danger .         what about the utility robot .     katherine asked  ignoring the robot   s question .     will the utility robot summon help .         that is within the scope of the utility robot   s field prerogatives     rec replied  straightening as derec finished .  he then wheeled slowly around the room  taking everything in for later recounting .  rec took his job very seriously .   derec had left two loose ends on the tight bandage  and held his arm out to katherine to tie them .     can i trust you to tie a good knot .     he asked .      what   s that supposed to mean .     she asked .      nothing     he said .   she frowned deeply as she tied .     what happened in that office .     she asked .     you   ve treated me like your worst enemy ever since you came out of there .     she pulled the knot tight  a smile touching her lips when he groaned loudly .      look     he said .     you   ve got secrets  i   ve got secrets .  why don   t we just leave it at that .         fine with me     she said .     all i want is for us to get the rest of this together  then i   ll make an emergency hyperwave call and be out of your hair in less than a day .  you can rot here for all i care .         we   ll both rot here     he said  wanting to hurt her .   she drew back .     what do you mean .         nothing .         damn you .     she yelled .     tell me what you mean .  why did you say i   d rot here .         no reason .         it   s the hyperwave  isn   t it .     she asked .     they won   t give us access to the hyperwave .         it   s not that  it   s  .   .   .          it   s what .  what .      he leaned his head back and shut his eyes .     there is no hyperwave transmitter     he said softly .   she pulled herself a distance from him and curled into a small ball .     you   re lying     she said  but he could tell that she really believed him .      the robots have no contact with the outside     he said .     they have no spaceport for landing ships .  they have no hyperwave  or even the equipment for making one .  they   ve been evasive about the point because of the security alert .         why have you waited until now to tell me this .     she asked .      i told you   you   ve got secrets  i   ve got secrets .         i get it now     she said  her eyes distant .     we   re both free agents  looking out for ourselves .         something like that     he said  but why did it hurt so bad to say it .   she stood and moved all the way across the room to sit on the wall opposite .     well  i suppose  at this point  we must work together to solve the murder     she said .      i suppose     he replied  sorry to have started the whole line of conversation .   her face was hard .     after that  i will thank you to stay away from me .  we   ll each take care of our own problems .         fair enough .         so tell me  if it   s not a great secret  why the room sealed around us because you cut yourself .         i   ve got a theory  nothing more     he said .     the city robot is programmed to protect human and robot inhabitants and to defend itself against anything alien  .   .   .  foreign to it .  apparently blood inside the body is fine  but once it gets outside the body  its natural microbes register as alien and set off the works .  the city program has to be fairly complicated .  the omission is obvious  and could either have been a mistake or a deliberate glitch to test the ability of the robots and humans living here to control their own system .         what do we do now .         well  once we get out  if i can get access to the central core with one of the supervisors  i can reprogram the core to accept human blood as a natural microbe on the body of the city .  in this sterile atmosphere  it   s perfectly understandable how such a glitch could happen .  it could even be a means for the city to protect itself from infection .         but how did david die .     katherine asked .      could it have been blood loss .     derec asked .   she shook her head .     no chance     she replied .     there was very little blood .  the cut was smaller than yours .         what   s left .     he said .     i have to think that his death is a completely separate incident  unconnected to the blood loss .      she looked skeptical .     back to back coincidences  derec .  deadly coincidence at that .      he stood .     you   re right  of course .  it must all tie together  .   .   .  but how .     he paced the room .     what other leads do we have .  the only other connection is the fact that both of you came away from a sealed room with a headache .         we have another problem     she replied  watching him moving back and forth in the confined space .     when i came in this room the first time to find the body  it had been sealed up  .   .   .  air tight .      he stopped walking and stared at her .     the city would never keep us locked up without air .  it would be a violation of the first law  should we die .         it happened to david .         but david was already dead when it happened to him     derec said .     in fact  this just strengthens my theory .  when the utility robot rolled him over to check for signs of life  gravity pulled a little more blood out of an already open wound .  the room didn   t relate to david as a human  since he was dead .  all it fixed its sights on was the    infection .     we   re still alive and the city robot knows it .  whatever else this crazy place may be  it   s run robotically .  ipso facto  we   re safe on that account .         just the same     she said     i   ll be happier to be out of here .         me too .         you realize  derec     she said  her voice low and heavy with meaning     that we are recreating history right now .  we are going through exactly the same progression that david went through before he died .         i know     derec replied .     but what else can we do .      they stared at one another across the space of the room  the witness recording it all  and they may as well have been a million kilometers apart .  they sat that way for a long time  far longer than it should have taken for a supervisor to show up .   derec spent the time alternately trying to think his way out of their dilemma  figure out what was going on with katherine  and looking at his watch .  and the late morning turned to early afternoon  and derec  who wasn   t worried about the air supply in the room  suddenly became very thirsty and began to dwell on the possibility that the robots had either forgotten them or couldn   t find them .      friend derec .     came a loud voice from outside the room .     friend katherine .  it is i  wohler  the philosopher .      derec glanced at his watch .  it was nearly five p . m .   which meant rain was undoubtedly on the way .     we   re in here .     derec called .     can you get us free .      wohler called back loudly     an auroran philosopher once said     freedom is a condition of mind  and the best way to secure it is to breed it .     ho  derec .  we were held up digging in the mines  but i now have a laser torch to cut you out .  i am here on the west wall of this room .  i will ask kindly that you move to the east wall to avoid the torch as well as possible .      derec was sitting against the west wall .  he stood immediately and moved over near katherine  who looked at him with unreadable eyes .      go ahead .     derec yelled through cupped hands  rec moving up closer to the west wall to witness the torching from the inside .   even through the thickness of the wall  they could hear the hiss of the torch on the other side .  derec slid down the wall to sit next to katherine .  their arms accidentally touched .  both of them pulled away .      something   s wrong     she said .     something feels wrong .         i know     he replied     but what .      the inside of the wall began to glow red hot in a small  circular section .  then the red turned to white  and a rivet sized section burned through to reveal the outside through a quivering haze of heat .   derec watched the hole expand  his mind racing as the torch began to etch the beginnings of a human sized circle in the side of the room .  he thought about headaches  and about erratic behavior and about blood and its composition   and then he thought about the nature of the city robot .      stop .     he yelled  jumping to his feet and running as close to the metal cutting as he dared .     stop the torch .         derec .     katherine asked  beginning to stand .   derec covered his mouth with his hand .     get on the floor .     he yelled .     all the way down and cover your mouth .         what   s wrong .     came wohler   s voice from outside  the sound of the laser winding down to nothing .     what is it .         we can   t use the torch on the wall .     derec called .      i don   t understand     wohler said  bending down so that his eye covered the hole in the wall and he could look inside .   derec backed away  getting down close to katherine on the floor .     is there some way to flush oxygen in here .     he asked loudly .      we   ve come in a newly manufactured emergency truck     wohler replied .     i believe the emergency equipment includes oxygen cylinders .         get one quickly .         the rains are approaching     wohler said .     we must hurry and get you out .         listen     derec said .     the city material is a kind of metallic skin  an iron plastic alloy .  in the manufacturing process  a great deal of carbon monoxide is used as the reducing agent .  i think your torch is liberating the monoxide as a gas into the closed room .  by cutting us out  you   re gassing us .         the utility robot has gone for the oxygen .     wohler said .     you have my apologies .         you didn   t know     derec said .  he looked at katherine .     are you all right .         so far     she replied .     are you sure of what you   re saying .  david didn   t die until later  outside of the room .         it doesn   t matter     he replied .     carbon monoxide in large doses will simply work its way gradually through the bloodstream  bonding firmly with hemoglobin and starving the tissues of oxygen .  his headache and erratic behavior were the first signs of an oxygen narcosis reaction and  unless he was treated to massive doses of oxygen  it would spread throughout his entire body  eventually killing him .         and my headache .         you walked into the room with his body just after they had cut through the walls     he said .     you undoubtedly saved your own life by passing out when you did  for they took you out of the room immediately  thus limiting your exposure to the gas .  carbon monoxide is colorless  odorless  and tasteless .  you would never have known what hit you .         the oxygen is here  derec .     wohler called  fitting a hissing nozzle up against the hole .   derec crawled across the floor toward the hole .     come on     he said  waving her on .   they reached the hole and sat breathing the life giving oxygen .  derec felt the beginnings of a small headache  but he was sure it would get no worse .   they emptied the canister of oxygen and began another .  when that was finished  wohler returned to the opening .     rain is imminent     the robot said .     how do we get you out .  we have nothing small to cut through this  and our heavy equipment can   t be brought up this high  at least not with the rain coming .  do we leave you for the night .         there   s no time for that     derec said .     i must get underground and report this information to the central core .         the rain is also dangerous for me  friend derec     wohler said .     i must take shelter soon .         okay     derec said .     stay with me as long as you can .  just let me think for a minute .         derec  .   .   .      katherine began .      shhh     derec said .     not now .         think about your arm     she said .     think about where you cut it  and how .         my arm  i  .   .   .      he held his arm up  looking at the blood soaked bandage and feeling the throb .     i cut it on the dead piece of city robot     he said .      because  .   .   .          because it was the only piece of the city that would allow me to cut myself on it .     he put his hands to his head .     that   s it .  wohler .  stand back .  we   re coming through .      with that  he raised his right hand  pushing his pointer finger through the small  burned out hole .  as soon as his finger grazed the jagged edge of the hole  it expanded to allow free passage .  next came his balled up fist  the hole expanded wide to keep from cutting him .  then his arm went through  followed by head and shoulders .  seconds later  he was standing on the disc  its edges curling up to protect him .  katherine followed him through  and both of them stared into the teeth of a bitter cold wind and a savage vision of blue purple clouds crackling with lightning .      we must go now .     wohler said  his shiny gold body reflecting lightning flashes .   suddenly  katherine broke from the group  hurrying to the stairs .      what are you doing .     derec called to her  but she ignored him  charging as quickly as she could down the stairs .      perhaps she   s hurrying to safety     wohler said  as rec made it through the hole in the wall .      perhaps     derec said  but as he ran the rest of the disc and began to take the stairs  katherine had already run to the tram that was still dutifully waiting .  she barked some orders to the utility driver  and the unit sped off into the darkening night .      what is happening .     wohler called as he followed derec down the stairs .      i   m afraid something crazy     the boy answered  remembering a conversation they had had while waiting to be rescued .   they moved to the emergency van that wohler had brought .     we must get you back to your apartment before the rain comes     the robot said .      no .     derec said .     get me underground .  i   ll wait out the storm there .  then you   ve got to go after katherine .  i   m afraid of what she   s doing .      a long streak of lightning struck the top of the pedestal right beside them  the metal clanging loudly and smoking .      but where could she have gone  friend derec .     wohler asked as they all climbed aboard the large  white van .      the compass tower     derec said  voice heavy with dread .     i   m afraid she   s climbing the compass tower .          chapter     the third law    the quadrant    extruder station was less than ten minutes from the sealed room  with wohler moving the emergency van along at the top speed possible that still allowed a safety margin for his passengers .   derec watched the city speed past  its full blown dance of thoughtless progress still continuing despite the gathering darkness  despite the fact that its course was suicidal .  he feared for the city  he feared for katherine  or whatever her name was .  she was going for the key  he was certain of that  trying to take herself out of the situation in the only way she knew how .  he didn   t expect that the key would do her much good  but he could hardly blame her for trying .  what frightened him was the danger she was exposing herself to by trying for the key in the rain .  he would have gone after her alone  but  having experienced the destructive power of robot city   s weather  he knew he   d be no help at all in a storm .  only a robot would have a chance .   wohler jerked them to a stop before the extruder station entrance  a series of low  wide buildings constructing themselves from ground level .  there was no robotic activity here now  no unloading of trucks .  all had taken shelter from the impending storm .      you think she   s gone to the compass tower .     wohler asked .      i   m sure of it .         she may have time before the storm to get inside to safety .      derec looked at him  then reached out and put a hand on his shiny gold arm .     she   s not going inside     he said .     she   ll be trying to climb the pyramid .         but why .         we hid something there  something she   s trying to retrieve .         i must go     wohler said without hesitation .     she   ll be killed .         what will the rain do to you .     derec asked as he climbed out of the van .      rain in ordinary amounts won   t do anything     the robot replied .     city rain could force its way through my plating in a thousand different places and make its way into my electrical system .  the limits of the damage at that point are a matter of imaginative speculation .         i don   t know what to tell you     derec said .     if you don   t go  .   .   .          katherine will die     the robot finished .     you can tell me nothing .  my duty is self evident .  good bye  derec .      wohler looked back once to make sure the witnesses were off the van  then hurried off at a pace that didn   t include the safety margin he had preserved with derec in the cab .      come with me     derec told the witnesses  and moved toward the now closed entrance to the underground .  despite his fears for katherine   s safety  he had things to do .  with his explanation of the murder and its connection to the city defenses  backed up totally by rec   s witness testimony  there was no doubt that he   d at least be able to get into the core and stop the replication .  that wouldn   t stop tonight   s rain  however  or even future rains for a time  but it was a start .   he opened the outside door  then hurried inside  going down the stairs to the now deserted holding area and its bank of elevators .  this wasn   t the same extruder station he   d been in previously  but it was set up exactly the same .   he walked quickly to the same elevator he had taken with avernus when he   d gone underground .  he got inside with the witnesses and pushed the down arrow .  the lift began its long journey to the caverns below .   the elevator opened into the bustling cavern where the work of building robot city continued unabated .  there wasn   t a supervisor in sight  however .  there seemed to be activity at one of the darkened  unused mine tunnels at the west end of the cavern .   he began to move into the flow  then stopped  steeling himself .  deliberation  avernus had said .  as he stood on the edge of the activity  a long tram sped past him at a hundred kilometers an hour  passing within a few centimeters  his hair being pulled by its suction .   deliberation .  it was the only way .      stay with me     he told the witnesses .  then he set his body in line with his goal and shut his eyes  taking a blind step right into the fray .   he walked quickly  without hesitation  trying to direct his mind away from the feel of unrushing robots and vehicles that barely brushed him as they hurried past .  occasionally  he would open his eyes a touch  just to make sure he was still heading in the right direction .  then he   d squeeze them closed again  and keep walking .   he kept this up for nearly ten minutes as he crossed the great chamber without mishap .  as he reached the safety of the mine entrance  he released a huge sigh that made him feel as if he   d been holding his breath the whole time .   a utility robot was stationed near the mine entrance  using an overhead pulley system to remove the spent batteries from a fleet of mine trams and replacing them with charged batteries .  the trams were parked three deep all around him .      robot .     derec called across the cars to him .     where can i find supervisor avernus .      the utility robot pointed down the tunnel .     they are releasing some of the reservoir water into the abandoned tunnels .  it may be dangerous for humans .         thanks     derec said  then pointed to a tram .     has this one been recharged .         yes     the robot answered .      thanks again     derec said  and climbed behind the steering mechanism .     rec  eve  get in .      as the robots climbed into the back of the tram  the utility called to derec .      did you not hear me .  it may be dangerous for humans in there .         thanks     derec said again  waving  then keyed on the electric hum and geared the car down the dark tunnel .   as he sped down the tunnels  marking distance by counting the small  red lights spaced along the length  he passed other trams full of robots going the other way .  there were uniformly dirty from digging  many of them dangling shorted out appendages .  even for robots  they appeared grim .  one tram they passed carried a robot shorting from the head  sparks arcing from his photocells and speaker .   he drove for several kilometers  climbing gently upward with the tunnel .  finally  he approached a large egg of light that threw long shadows against the rough hewn walls .  when he reached the place  he found a large number of utility robots  plus six of the seven supervisors  gathered around a drop off in the tunnel .   he jumped from the tram and pushed his way through the crowd to approach the drop off .  it was the same area in which the robots had been digging the day before  only approached from the other side .  a subsidiary tunnel  going upward  had been dug by hand  and it met the existing tunnel  which had been trenched out to carry water .  the trench was empty .  euler and rydberg were leaning out over the trench  looking up the newly dug tunnel  while avernus sorted out those robots damaged beyond usefulness here  and sent them back down the tunnel .   derec moved up to euler .     i   ve solved the murder     he told the supervisor without preamble .   both rydberg and euler turned to look at him .     what was the cause .     rydberg asked .      carbon monoxide poisoning     derec said .     when they tried to torch david out of the sealed room  carbon monoxide was released by the heating process into the enclosed space .         it was our fault  then     euler said .      it was an unfortunate accident     derec replied .     and i have witnesses .     both eve and rec hurried to join him .      two minutes     dante called .  the small robot was fiddling with a terminal hooked up in the back of a tram  his long digits moving with incredible speed over the keyboard .      two minutes until what .     derec asked .      until the charge we placed by the reservoir wall brings the water down     euler replied .      i also know why the city is on security alert     derec said .     it was because of david   s blood .  when he cut himself  the blood that dropped on the city robot was mistaken for an alien presence because of the blood organisms .  my witnesses will also corroborate that fact .      euler spoke up .     then we need to feed this information to the central core and stop the replication  if there   s time .         what do you mean  if there   s time .     derec asked .   avernus joined the group .     we found a cavern that would hold all the water in the reservoir  thanks to your sonogram .  unfortunately  it will take a great deal of digging to reach it .     avernus pointed to the trench .     this diversion will do no more than put off the inevitable for one more day  then  instead of overflowing above  the water will overflow below  here in the tunnels .         where is the central core .     derec asked .     if we can get to it and stop the replication  then we can use the digging machines to turn the trick before the next day   s rain .      avernus turned to dante  looking at him over the heads of all the other robots .     where is the core now .     he called loudly .   the little robot   s digits flew over the keys while euler spoke .     even with the machines  we   d have to start digging almost immediately to reach the cavern in time .         the core is in tunnel j    at the moment     dante called     moving south by southwest at ten kilometers per hour .     he hesitated briefly  then added     twenty centads .      avernus turned abruptly from them all .     that is  .   .   .  too bad     he said .      what do you mean  too bad .     derec asked .   all at once  there was a rumble that shook the tunnel  dust and loose pebbles falling atop them .  derec nearly lost his footing on the quaking ground .  within seconds  a low roar filled the mines  growing in intensity with each passing second .      it is too bad     euler said loudly above the roar     because the central core is in tunnel j     on the wrong side of the trench  and the rains are beginning outside .      with that  tons of water came rushing down the new tunnel  slamming in fury into the trench below  churning  frothy white  dangerous and untamed .  derec watched in horrified fascination as his only possible route to the central core disappeared under a raging river that hadn   t been there a second before .     katherine   s mind was as dark as the clouds overhead as her tram hurried through the streets of robot city in the direction of the compass tower .      i fear we won   t make the tower before the rains come     the utility driver told her .     we must take shelter .         no     she said  determined that she   d keep them from taking away her last ounce of free will .     go on .  hurry .         it is not safe for you out here     the robot insisted .     i cannot in all conscience take you any farther .      katherine began to respond with anger  but feared it would arouse the robot   s suspicions .     all right     she said .     pull over at the next building .         very good     the robot replied  and brought the tram to an immediate stop before a tall building that had the words museum of art embossed in metal above the doors .   the robot got out of the tram and took katherine by the arm to guide her .     this way  please     he said  and katherine began to think the robots had been having meetings about human duplicity .   she allowed the robot to lead her into the confines of the building .     this is supervisor arion   s project     he said     to please our human inhabitants .      she looked around  taking note that the robot had used the word inhabitant instead of visitors .  it merely confirmed what she already knew to be the case .  they weren   t going to let her go .  they had no intention of letting her go .  the robots needed someone to serve  and they   d keep the masters as slaves just to see that it came to be .   the first floor of the museum was full of geometric sculptures  many of them made from city material that moved through its own sequences  constantly changing shapes in an infinite variety of patterns .   after a moment  she asked     please  is it possible to contact derec and tell him where we are .  i   m afraid he   ll worry .         there should be a terminal in the curator   s office     the robot replied .     would you like me to do it for you .         yes  please .  i would be most grateful .      the robot hurried off immediately .  as soon as he was out of sight at the far end of the building  katherine turned and ran .   she got quickly out the front doors and down the short walk to the tram  taking the driver   s position .  it started up easily  and she was off .  she had no idea of which streets to take to get to the pyramid  but its size made it a beacon .  she simply kept moving toward it .   she concentrated on planning as she drove .  the rain was very close now  and she didn   t want to get caught in it  but it was worth the try to get out of the city .  derec had said there was a trap door from the office to the platform atop the structure .  she   d go through the inside of the pyramid  then  to reach the top .  the key was hidden partway down the outside of the structure  and it would be far easier and faster to climb down from the top than to climb up .   the sky rumbled loudly as she drove  the wind whipped her long hair around her face .  she was cold  but put it out of her mind as she concentrated on her objective .  why did he have to do it to her .  why did he have to go over to the other side .  the city had become derec   s obsession .  he apparently couldn   t understand that she had to have freedom  that she couldn   t live within its structure forever .   the pyramid loomed large before her .  it lit up brightly as a bolt of lightning ran down its face .  she skidded to a stop before it and jumped out of the tram  hearing a noise behind her .   there  two blocks distant  the robot that called itself wohler was hurrying to intercept her .  she turned and ran up to the entry .  the city material melted away at her approach to allow her inside .   once inside  she had no idea of where she was going .  the only thing she remembered for sure was that she needed to keep going up .  she ran the maze like halls  taking every opportunity to climb stairs or take an elevator that would put her higher .  about halfway up the structure  she heard an announcement over unseen loudspeakers that called attention to her flight and gave instructions for her apprehension .   at that  she doubled her pace  going full out .  her only hope of escaping was to reach the safety of the off limits zone before she was spotted .   she hurried unseen down the now shortened hallways  reaching the last elevator up .  a tech robot with welder arms spotted her as she hurried inside .  heart pounding  she stabbed at the up arrow and the machine sped her quickly to the upper floor .   the doors slid open and she burst through  running immediately .  there were voices behind  calling her by name .  she turned a corner  ran up a short ramp  and burst into the off limits hallway just as the robots behind were closing on her .   she ran to the door leading up to the office  her hand going to the power stud .      katherine .      she recognized wohler   s voice and turned to face him .  he stood  a hallway full of robots behind him  at the edge of the off limits zone  the same place the witnesses had stopped earlier in the day .      what do you want .     she asked .      come away from there .  this place is off limits .      she smiled .     not to me     she said .     i   m human  remember .  i   m free  and i   m going to be freer .         please do not go outside     wohler said .     the rains are beginning .  it could be dangerous for you .         you   re not going to keep me here     she said  opening the door that faced the spiral staircase .      we would love to have you stay with us     the robot said     but we would never keep you here against your will .         then why don   t you have the means on planet for me to leave or call for help .         you act as if we brought you here under false pretenses     wohler said .     we did nothing .  you came here uninvited .  welcome  .   .   .  but uninvited .  our civilization has not developed to the point where planetary interaction is possible .  you can see that for yourself .         we   re wasting time     katherine said  and started through the door .      please reconsider     the robot called .     don   t put yourself in jeopardy .      she stared hard at him .     i   ve been in jeopardy every second i   ve been in this crazy place .      with that  she moved through the door  closing it behind her .  she took the stairs quickly and entered the office .  the angry clouds rolled up close to the viewers  making it seem as if she were standing in the midst of the gathering storm .   searching the office  she found the ladder easily enough  climbing it to reach the windy platform above .  the wind was so strong that she feared getting to her feet  and crawled to the edge where she and derec had made their first treacherous descent into the city of robots .   for the first time since being freed from the sealed room  her fears began to overcome her anger at the situation as she turned her body to edge herself off the dizzying height to begin her climb downward .  the wind pulled viciously at her like cold  prying hands  her ears and nose went numb  and her fingers tingled with the cold .   though the pyramid was made from the same material as the rest of the city  it wasn   t the same in any other respect .  it was rigid and unbending  its face set with patterns of holes that she and derec had used as hand and footholds previously  and in which they had hidden the key on their first descent .   her mind whirled as she climbed  slowly  so slowly .  how far down had it been .  she had been moving fast  and derec  carrying the key  had been unable to keep up .  they had stopped for a conference and decided to hide the key and continue without it .  how far down .  a fourth of the climb  barely a fourth  in the leftmost hole of the pattern that ran down the center of the structure .   she continued downward  her fingers hurting now  her eyes looking upward  trying to gauge her distance just right .  she began testing the holes in the repeated pattern  to no avail .  she still hadn   t reached the place .  something wet and cold hit her hard on the back .  her hands almost pulled out of their holds reflexively .  it was a raindrop  and it wet the entire back of her one piece .   she was running out of time .   the pattern of holes repeated again as she inched downward  and when she looked up  squinting against the frigid wind  she knew she had reached the place .   hugging the pyramid face with the last of her strength  she slowly reached out  sticking her hand into the leftmost hole of the pattern .   the key was gone .      no .     she screamed loudly into the teeth of the monster  and  as if in response  the rain tore from the heavens in blinding  bludgeoning sheets to silence her protests .     derec stood at the exit door to the extruder station and listened to the rain pounding against the door  and watched the small puddle that had somehow made its way under the sealed entry .  katherine was out there somewhere  and wohler .  nothing had been heard from either of them since before the start of the rain .  avernus had made contact with the compass tower  and though both had been seen there  neither was there now .   with the rain controlling the day  everything had come to a standstill  making searching impossible  making contact with the central core impossible  making everything except the almighty building project slow to nothing .  it was maddening .   he pounded the door  his fist sinking in  cushioning .  he wanted to open those doors and run into the city and find her for himself   but he knew what that meant .  most likely  nothing would be known until the rain abated the next morning .   he turned from the door and walked down the stairs to the holding area and the six robot supervisors who awaited him there .  his mind was awash in anxiety .      supervisor rydberg has proposed a plan  friend derec     euler said .     perhaps you will comment on it .      derec looked at rydberg  trying to bring his mind back to the present .  why did the woman affect him this way .     let   s hear your plan     he said .      we can go ahead and devise our evacuation schedule for the robots working underground     rydberg said .     it seems that when morning comes  you will be able to contact the core and halt the replication .  it will be too late to dig through to the cavern in time  but at least we will have the opportunity to spare our mine workers before the floods .         why do you have to give up like this .     derec said  exasperated .     you   ve heard the reasons for the defenses .  can   t you just stop them now and use the digging equipment to begin excavating the cavern .      waldeyer  the squat  wheeled supervisor  said     the central core is our master program .  we cannot abandon it .  only the central core can judge the veracity of your statements and make the final decision .         i   m going to reprogram the central core     derec answered  too loudly .     i   m going to change its definition of    veracity .     and besides  the laws of robotics are your master program  and the second law states that you will obey a human command unless it violates the first law .  i   m commanding you to halt the mining processes and begin digging through to the drainage cavern .         the defensive procedures were designed by the central core to protect the city  which is designed to protect human life     waldeyer replied .     the central core must be the determining factor in any decision to abandon the defenses .  though your arguments sound humane  they may  ultimately  be in violation of the first law  for if the central core determines that your conclusions are erroneous  then shutting down the defenses could be the most dangerous of all possible decisions .      derec felt as if he were on a treadmill .  all argument ultimately led back to the central core .  and though he was sure that the central core would back off once he programmed the information about human blood into it  he had no way to prove that to the robots who  in turn  refused to do anything to halt the city   s replication until they   d received that confirmation from central .   then an idea struck him  an idea that was so revisionist in its approach that he was frightened at first even to think out its effects on the robots .  what he had in mind would either liberate their thinking or send them into a contradictory mental freeze up that could destroy them .      what do you think of rydberg   s plan .     avernus asked him .     it will save a great many robots .      avernus   that was it   avernus the humanitarian .  derec knew that his idea would destroy the other robots  but avernus  he was different .  avernus leaned toward the humane  a leaning that could just possibly save himself and the rest of robot city .      i will comment on the evacuation plan later     derec said .     first  i   d like to speak with avernus alone .         we make decisions together     euler said .      why .     derec asked .      we   ve always done it that way     rydberg said .      not any more     derec said  his voice hard .     unless you can give me a sound  first law reason why i shouldn   t speak with avernus alone  i will then assume you are violating the laws yourselves .      euler walked to the center of the room  then turned slowly to look at avernus .     we   ve always done it this way     he said .   avernus  the giant  moved stoically toward euler  putting a larger pincer on the robot   s shoulder .     it won   t hurt anything  this once  if we go against our own traditions .         but traditions are the hallmark of civilization     euler said .      survival is also one of the hallmarks     derec replied  looking up at avernus .     are you willing .         yes     avernus answered without hesitation .     we will speak alone .      derec led avernus to the elevators  then had a thought and returned to euler .  he unwrapped the fabric bandage from his cut arm and handed it to the supervisor .     have the blood analyzed  the data broken down on disc so i can feed it to the core .         yes  derec     euler said  and it was the first time the supervisor had addressed him without the formal declaration  friend .  maybe they were all growing up a little bit .   derec then joined avernus in the elevator  pushing the down arrow as the doors slid closed .  they only traveled down for a moment before derec pushed the emergency stop button  the machine jerked to a halt .      what is this about .     avernus asked .      i want to make a deal with you     derec said .      what sort of deal .         the lives of your robots for one of your digging machines .      avernus just stared at him .     i do not understand .         let   s talk about the third law of robotics     derec said .     you are obligated by the third law to protect your own existence as long as it doesn   t interfere with the first or second laws .  in your case  with your special programming  i can easily extend the third law to include the robots under your control .         go on .         my deal is a simple one .  rydberg has suggested an evacuation plan that could save the robots in the mines from the flooding that is sure to occur if the cavern is not excavated .  the evacuation plan depends completely on my reprogramming the central core to halt the replication .  for if i don   t  the city will have to keep replicating  even to its own destruction  .   .   .  that destruction to include the robots who are working underground .         i understand that     avernus said .      all right .     derec took a deep breath .  what he was getting ready to propose would undoubtedly freeze out the positronics of any of the other robots  the contradictions were too great  the choices too impossible to make .  but with avernus  .   .   .  maybe  just maybe .     unless you give me one of the digging machines so i can begin the excavation myself  i will refuse to reprogram the central core  thereby condemning all your robots to stay underground during the flooding .      avernus red eyes flared brightly .     you would  .   .   .  kill so many .         i would save your city and your robots .     derec yelled .     it   s all or nothing .  give me the machine or suffer the consequences .         you ask me to deny the central core program that protects the first law .         yes     derec said simply  his voice quieting .     you have got to make the creative leap to save your robots .  somewhere in that brain of yours  you   ve got to make a value judgment that goes beyond your programming .      avernus just stood there  quaking slightly  and derec felt tears welling up in his eyes  knowing the torture he was putting the supervisor through .  if this failed  if he  in effect  killing avernus by killing his mind  he   d never be able to forgive himself .   the big robot   s eyes flashed on and off several times  and suddenly his body shuddered violently  then stopped .  derec heard a sob escape his own lips .  avernus bent to him .      you will have your digging machine     the robot told him     and me to help you use it .          chapter     the central core    even as katherine clung doggedly to the face of the pyramid  she knew that her ability to hold on could be measured in no more than minutes  as the rain lashed savagely at her and the winds worked to rip her off the patterned facade .   the ground lay several hundred meters below  calling to her .  as her body went totally numb in the freezing downpour  her strong survival instinct was the only thing keeping her hanging on .   her brain whirled  rejecting its own death while trying desperately to prepare for it  and through it all  she could hear the wind calling her name  over and over .      katherine .      closer now  the sound grew more pronounced .  it seemed to come from below .      katherine .      for the first time since she   d begun her climb  she risked a look downward  in the direction of the sound .  she blinked through the icy water that streamed down her face only to see an apparition  a gray mass moving quickly up the face below her  proof that her mind was already gone .      katherine  hang on .  i   m coming .      in disbelief  she watched the apparition coming closer .  and as her arms ached  trying to talk her into letting go and experiencing peace  she saw a golden hand reach from under the gray lump and grasp a handhold in one of the cutouts .   wohler .      please hold on .         i can   t .     she called back  surprised to hear the hysteria in her own voice .  and as if to reinforce the idea  her left hand lost its grip  her arm falling away from the building  the added pressure sending cramping pain through her right arm still lodged in the hole .   the robot below hurried his pace .  the wind  getting beneath the tarp he wore to protect himself from the rain  pulled it away from his body to float like a huge  prehistoric bird .      p please  .   .   .      she called weakly  her right arm ready to give out .      hold on .  please hold on .      the urgency in his voice astounded her  giving her an extra ounce of courage  a few more seconds when seconds were everything .  and as she felt her hand slip away for good and all  his large body had wedged in behind her  holding her up against the facade .   wohler clamped solidly in hand and footholds just above and below hers and he completely enveloped her  protecting .  she let herself relax  all the strength immediately oozing out of her  wohler supporting her completely .      are you unhurt .     the robot asked in her ear .      i i think so     she answered in a small voice .     what happens now .         we can only wait     wohler said  his voice sounding somehow ragged .     an old earth proverb says     patience is a bitter plant but it has sweet fruit .     survival w will be our fruit  .   .   .  friend katherine .         friend wohler     she responded  tears mixing with the cold rain on her face .     i want to th thank you for coming up here for me .      but wohler didn   t answer .     the supervisors as a group stood behind the gateway excavator that derec and avernus operated .  neither helping nor hindering  they simply took it all in  no doubt unable to appreciate the thought processes that had led the big robot to pull the machine away from his mining crews and their replication labors  to put it to work simply clearing a path for something that  at this point  was no more than mere potential .   derec had seen excavators like these before .  on the asteroid where he had first awakened to find he had no identity  the robots had used identical machines to cut out the guts of the asteroid in their search for the key to perihelion .   the gateway was a marvel  for it demolished and rebuilt at the same time .  derec sat with avernus at the two cabin control panels  watching the boom arms cutting into rock face nearly a hundred feet distant .  one of the boom arms bore rotary grinders  the other microwave lasers that tore frantically at the core of the planet  chewing it up as it went .  there were numerous conveyors and pulleys for the removal and scanning of potential salvage material  but none of these were in use right now .  they were simply grinding and compressing the excavated rock and earth  the gateway itself using the materials to build a strong tunnel behind   smooth rock walls  reinforcing synthemesh  even overhead lamps .   they were creeping toward the cavern  every meter a meter closer to possible salvation .  they had been working through the night  derec desperately trying to let the effort keep his mind off katherine and wohler .  it wasn   t working .  there had been no word of them since before the storm had begun nearly ten hours ago .  had they been alive  he would have heard by now .   there was always the chance that katherine had retrieved the key and left  perhaps waiting out the rain in the gray void of perihelion  or perhaps finding her way to another place .  but that didn   t explain wohler   s absence .   during the grueling hours spent working the gateway  avernus and derec had conversed very little  both  apparently  lost in their own thoughts .  derec worried for avernus  who he knew was going through a great many internal recriminations that could only be resolved with a satisfactory outcome and subsequent vindication of his actions .      derec .     came euler   s voice from the newly built tunnel behind  it was the first time the robot had spoken to them since the operation had begun .   derec looked at his watch .  it was nearly five a . m .  he shared a glance with avernus .     yes .     he called back .      the rain has abated     euler returned .     the missing have been located .      derec resisted the urge to jump from the controls and charge out of there .  he still had work to do .  he looked at avernus .     what now .         now we will see     the robot said .     we must locate the core and reprogram .         should i leave you here to continue operations and go with someone else to the core .         no     avernus said with authority .     i am supervisor of the underground and know my way around it .  i also  .   .   .  must know the outcome .  can you understand that .      derec reached out and punched off the control board  stopping new digging and bringing all operants to the standby position .     you bet i can understand it .  let   s go .      they moved out of the gateway  squeezing past stacked up cylinders to join the other supervisors in the tunnel behind .  it was the first time derec had looked back at their handiwork .  the tunnel he and avernus had made stretched several hundred yards behind them  nearly as far he could see .      where are katherine and wohler .     he asked .     are they all right .         no one knows     rydberg said .     they are clinging to the side of the compass tower  nearly a hundred meters above the surface  but they have not responded to voice communication  nor have they attempted to come down .      derec   s heart sank .  they   d been out all night in the rain .   it looked bad .      are rescue operations underway .     he asked .      utility robots are now scaling the tower to determine the extent of the problem for emergency disposition     euler said .      the central core     avernus said to dante .     tell me where it is right now .         tell me honestly  euler     derec said .     will my presence at the tower facilitate the rescue operation .         tower rescue has always been part of our basic program  for reasons no one can fathom     the robot said .     standard operating procedure has already been initiated .  you could only hinder the operation .         good     derec said .  of course tower rescue was standard .  the overseer had worried that  should the trap door to the office below become jammed  he would be caught on the tower  unable to get down .  the almighty overseer didn   t mind letting everyone else twist slowly in the wind  but he wasn   t going to let himself be uncomfortable on the tower .   dante spoke up from the terminal in his tram car .     the central core is in quadrant    tunnel d     moving to the north .      avernus nodded and looked at derec .     we must hurry     he said     lest all our work be in vain .         work is already in vain     waldeyer said to avernus .     because of your unauthorized impoundment of the gateway excavator  the on hand raw iron consignments have dropped dangerously low .  within an hour  replication efforts will begin falling behind schedule .      the big robot simply hung his head  looking at the floor .      i pose a question to you all     derec said .     if avernus and i are able to get to the core and reprogram to halt the replication  will our work already done here enable us to dig the rest of the way through to the cavern before tonight   s rain .         barring work stoppage and machinery malfunction     euler said     we should just be able to make it .  this  of course  is all hypothetical .      derec just looked at them .  there was no satisfaction to be gained from arguing at this point .  it was time to deliver the goods .     where   s the data from my blood sample .     he asked .   arion stepped forward and handed him a mini disc .     everything you asked for is in here     he said .      thanks     derec said  taking the disc and putting it in his breast pocket .     now  listen .  we   re going to the central core .  as soon as we reprogram  we   ll need you to begin work here again immediately so that no time is lost .      arion took a step toward the gateway .     it is now too late to move the excavator back to the iron mine and pick up our failed operation there  so i see no reason why the digging here shouldn   t continue in your absence .  there is no longer anything to lose .  i will continue to work here  even as you approach the central core .         no     euler said .     will you now violate your programming  and perhaps the laws .         the program is already shattered     arion said  moving into the innards of the gateway .     there is no putting it back together now .      derec smiled broadly as he heard the standby board being brought to full ready by arion .  he walked over to dante .     we   ll need your tram     he said .     now .        the fever had come on strong  and along with it  hallucinations .  katherine   s world was a nightmare of water  a world of water always threatening to pull her downward  and through it all derec david  david derec  derec david  his face smiling evilly and becoming mechanical even as she watched  metamorphosing from human to robot and back again  over and over .  he   d skim the cresting waves to take her in his arms  only to use those arms to pull her underwater   drowning her .  drowning .      katherine  .   .   .  katherine .  wake up .  wake up .      voices intruding in her world of water .  she wanted them to go away  to leave her alone .  the water was treacherous  but at least it was warm .      katherine  .   .   .       something was shaking her  pulling her violently from her dream world .  she opened her eyes to pain blazing like fire through her head .   it was daytime  early morning .  a utility robot was staring at her around the protective branch of wohler   s arm .      c cold     she rasped  teeth chattering .     so  .   .   .  cold .      a light flared above her and to the left  a light raining sparks .  she squinted .  welders were using laser torches to cut wohler   s pincers off the facade where they were locked tight .  above the welder  she could see mechanical pulleys magnetically clamped to the side of the structure  city material ropes dangling .      we are cutting you free     the robot said .     a net and stretcher have been strung just below you .  you are safe now .         c cold     she rasped again .      we will warm you .  we will get you medical attention .      and through the haze that was her mind  she felt the reassuring firmness of wohler   s body protecting her  always protecting her .      wohler .     she said loudly .     we   re s safe .  wohler .         supervisor wohler is  .   .   .  nonoperational     the utility said .   even through the hurt and the delirium  she was wracked by waves of shame .  that this robot would give his life for hers  after the way she   d acted  was more than she could bear .   she felt his weight behind her give  then hands were lifting both of them onto the stretchers pulled up tight below .  she felt the morning sun on her face  a sun that wohler would never experience again  and rather than dwell on the unpleasant results of its own selfishness  her mind once more retreated into the blissful haze of unconsciousness .        would you have .     avernus asked him as they pushed the tram down tunnel d     heading north .      would i have what .     derec replied .  the tunnel walls rushed past  red lights zipping overhead at two second intervals .      would you have let the robots die if i hadn   t agreed to help you dig the tunnel .         no     derec said .     i wouldn   t have done anything like that .  i just wanted to talk some sense into you .         you lied to me .         i lied to save you     derec said .     remember our discussion about lying in the compass tower .  i created a different reality  a hypothetical reality  to force you into a different line of thought .         you lied to me .         yes .         i do not know if i   ll ever really understand that     avernus said  subtly telling derec that their relationship would forever be strained .      i   ll have to learn to live with that     derec replied sadly .     sometimes the right thing isn   t always the best thing .  i   m sorry if i hurt you .         hurt is not a term that i understand     the robot replied .      no     derec said  turning to fiddle with the terminal dante had left in the back .     it   s a term that i relate to .      derec used the terminal to contact the city   s hastily organized medical facility  trying for information on katherine and wohler .  he and avernus had left quadrant    and traveled through the city to     going underground again at that point .  tunnel d    was one of the more distant shafts  drilled as an oil exploration point for the plastics operation .  a pipeline churned loudly  attached to the tunnel ceiling above their heads .      they   ve gotten katherine and wohler down from the tower .     he said  wishing his fingers moved as well as dante   s over the keyboard .      are they well .         katherine is suffering from shock and exposure     derec said excitedly .     she   s being treated now .  the prognosis is good .  wohler is  .   .   .  is  .   .   .      he turned sadly to avernus .     wohler is dead .         look .     the robot called  pointing ahead .   farther along the tunnel  they were rapidly closing on a moving area of light .  it was perhaps six meters long  and just tall enough to miss the overhanging lights .      the central core .     avernus said  braking heavily  the tram skidding to a halt .      what are you doing .     derec asked .     it   s getting away .         it will be faster now on foot     avernus said .      not for me     derec replied .     i can   t run fast enough to  .   .   .          climb on my back     the robot ordered .     quickly .      while the huge robot was still sitting  derec stood and climbed onto his broad back  putting his hands around avernus   s head  the robot locking an arm behind him  holding derec on tightly .   then avernus jumped from the cart and began a headlong charge down the tunnel  moving faster than derec realized was possible .  tunnel segments flew by in a blur as the moving core grew larger and larger in their vision .   they caught it quickly  and avernus slowed his pace to match the speed of the core .  its outer surface was transparent plastic of some kind  and very thick .  like a transparent eggshell  it contained the complex workings of a sophisticated  operating machine .  in the rear was a platform with steps leading up to a sliding door .   avernus jumped  catching the stairs and climbing on .  he brought his arm around  gently lifting derec off to stand before the door .     go on     he said .     go in .  only one at a time can pass through .      derec slid open the door by hand and walked in to find himself within the transparent chamber .  a red button was set in the plastic before him .  he pushed it .  sprayers and heat lamps came on  a full body spray of compressed air traveling the length of his body to remove all traces of dust .  there was a loud sound of suction  and then the wall before him slid open and he walked into the beating heart of robot city .   the core was open  like an exposed brain  its working synapses sparking photons up and down its length  its fluidics a marvel of imaginative engineering .  he found a typer halfway down its length and juiced it to life  while hearing avernus going through the chamber ritual .  the robot was doubled over to fit within the    clean room .      the first thing he did was open a file under the heading of hemoglobin  and enter the disc   s worth of information arion had procured for him .  then he got into the defenses file again  going as far as he could with the system until it prompted him for the supervisor   s password .   he heard a door slide open and turned to see avernus  still somewhat hunched over  move to stand beside him at the typer .      it wants your password     derec said .   avernus looked at him  not speaking  then reached out and typed on the screen   avernus    q        password  synnoetics  without a second   s hesitation  the computer prompted   rationalization for deactivation of city defenses .   with shaking fingers  derec typed his rationalization into the machine  dumping  as he did so  all the information from the hemoglobin file into the city defenses file as authoritative backup and information to keep the same thing from ever happening again .   when he was through typing he stood back and took a breath  almost afraid to push the enter key .      we must know now     avernus said .   derec nodded  swallowed hard  and entered the information .   the machine churned quietly for a moment that seemed to last an hour .  finally  quite simply and without fanfare  it responded .   rationalization accepted   defenses deactivated .   they stood for a moment  staring  not quite believing that it could be so easy .  then they felt a noticeable slowing of the core   s motion .  within seconds  it had ground to a stop .   it was over .       chapter     world perfect    derec walked the corridors of the mostly dark  mostly unfurnished medical facility .  it would be a fine building when it was completely finished  a place where the humans who would inhabit robot city could receive the finest medical care available anywhere in the galaxy under the supervision of the most advanced team of med bots operational .  he knew this would be so because the robots who performed the services would perform them by choice  out of love instead of servitude .   he walked the corridors alone   no guides  no keepers  no jailers .  he was a free citizen now  a condemned man no longer .  and it was good  because now  right now  he preferred being alone .   a room at the end of the corridor was awash with light  and he knew he   d find katherine there  recovering from her night with the storm .  he no longer cared about her subterfuge or her reasons for being with him on robot city .  for good or ill  he was happy and thankful that she was alive .  nothing else really could  or did  matter .   he was beginning to know why she affected him the way she did   he loved her .   he reached the room and poked his head inside .  it was a large room  one that would most likely be a ward at some future time .  but right now it was empty  except for katherine   s place at the far end .   she lay in stasis  floating half a meter above a table  bright lights surrounding her completely .  she was naked  just as she   d been on rockliffe station .  this time he didn   t turn away  but looked  and her body seemed somehow  .   .   .  familiar to him .   a med bot rolled up to him .      how is she .     he asked .      splendid     the robot replied     except for her chronic condition  .   .   .          i don   t want to talk about it     he said  letting her have her secrets .     other than that .         she   s sleeping lightly     the med bot said .     we have rebalanced her chemicals through massive influxes of oxygen and fluids  and warmed her up .  she lost a small part of her left ear to the cold  but that has already been adjusted through laser cosmetic surgery .  you may visit with her if you wish .         i   d like that     he said .     but before you wake her up  would you put a robe or something on her .         the heat lamps work better if  .   .   .          i know     derec said .     it   s a matter of her personal privacy .         i see     the robot said in its best bedside manner  but derec could tell that it didn   t .   when the med bot turned and rolled back to katherine  derec politely stepped through the doorway and back into the hall .   a moment later  he could hear her talking to the robot  so he walked back in .  she was off the table  sitting in a motorized chair  swathed in a bright white bathrobe .  her face was blank as he moved up to her .      i   m sorry for everything     he said .     i   ve been suspicious and hard to get along with and  .   .   .       she smiled slightly  putting up a hand .     no more than i have     she said softly  her voice hoarse .     i guess i   ve acted pretty stupidly .         human prerogative     he said .     you look  .   .   .  good .         they scraped the surface skin off me     she said     cleared away the dead dermis .  i guess i could say you   re looking at the new me .     she moved her gaze to the floor .     the key is gone .         i didn   t know     he replied .     i guess we   re really stuck .      she nodded .     did you hear what  .   .   .  what wohler did for me .         yes .         i never understood your  .   .   .  feeling for the robots     she said  eyes welling up with tears .     but his life was as important to him as mine is to me  and he  .   .   .  he gave it up  .   .   .  so i could live .         he was burned out completely     derec said .     they   re trying to reconstruct him now .      she looked up at him .     reconstruct .         it won   t be the same  of course .  we are  all of us  a product of our memories .  the wohler you knew is  for the most part  dead .         but if they reconstruct     she said     something of him will remain .         yes .  something .         i want to go there     she said .     i want to go where he is .      she tried to stand  derec gently pushing her back in the chair .     you   re still a sick girl     he said .     you can   t be running around doing  .   .   .          no     she said  a spark of the old katherine already coming back .     he died so that i could live .  if there   s anything of him left  i want to be there .      derec drew a long breath .     i   ll see what i can do     he said  knowing how stubborn she could be .   and so  thirty minutes later  katherine  wrapped in a sterile suit  wheeled herself into the dust free repair chamber where six different robots were working diligently on the body of wohler  the philosopher .  derec walked with her .   most of his plating was gone  circuit boards and relays hitting the floor with clockwork regularity  a small robot wheeling silently around and sweeping up the discards .      can i get closer .     she asked derec .      i don   t see why not     he answered .   just then  euler came into the chamber and walked directly toward the couple .     friend derec     he said .  derec smiled at the reuse of the title before his name .     we are just completing work on the connecting tunnel to the runoff cavern and would very much like you to be present for the opening .      derec looked down at katherine .     well  i   m kind of busy right now  i  .   .   .          nonsense     katherine said  reaching out to pat his hand .     i   m just going to stay around here for a while .  one of the robots here can get me back to medical .      he smiled broadly .     you sure it   s okay .      she nodded  smiling widely .     i understand completely     she said .   he grinned at euler .     let   s go     he said  and the two of them moved quickly out of the room .   katherine listened to their footsteps receding down the hall  then wheeled her chair closer to the work table .  her anger at derec along with a great many other conflicting emotions  had died along with wohler on the compass tower .  because of her thoughtlessness  a life had been lost .  all her other emotions seemed petty in the face of that .   she wheeled up near the golden robot   s head .  most of his body was exposed in pieces on the table  but the head and upper torso were intact .  the robots working on the body moved around the table to accommodate her presence .   she stared at his head  reaching out a finger to gingerly touch him .     i   m so sorry     she said .   suddenly  the head turned to her  its photocells glowing brightly .     were you addressing me .     he asked her .      wohler     she said  jumping .     you   re alive .         do we know one another .     he asked  and she realized that this was a different wohler  a newly programmed wohler who knew nothing of their previous experience .      no     she said  choking back a sob .     my name is katherine .  i   m  .   .   .  pleased to make your acquaintance .         a new friendship is like new wine     wohler said .      when it has aged  you will drink it with pleasure .  katherine  .   .   .  katherine .  why are you crying .        only a small dam held back the waters in the trench from the tunnel that derec and avernus had dug to the cavern .  the supervisors and as many of the utility robots as could clusters in the opening were there  derec holding the electronic detonator that would blast away the dam and open up the new waterway .      this is the first day     euler told him     the first day in a truly unified city of humans and robots .  the beginning of the perfect world .         we have reacted synnoetically to make this day happen     rydberg said .     working together we can accomplish much .         while we still have a great deal to learn about one another     derec said     i  too  believe that we have proven something of value here today .         then open the floodgate  friend derec     euler said     and make the connection complete .         with pleasure .      derec flipped the toggle on the hand control .  a small explosion made the wall of dirt and rock jump .  then it crumbled  and rapidly flowing water from the trench finished the job that the explosive had begun .   and as the waters rushed past  he thought of all the things still unresolved  still rushing  like the waters  through his confused brain .  who was he .  who was the dead man .  who put this all together  and why .   and then there was katherine .   in many ways  he still felt as if his journey had just begun  but he couldn   t help but feel he had accomplished something major with the breaking down of the dam .  he couldn   t help but feel that something good  something positive had been accomplished .  and that made him feel just fine .  maybe life was nothing so much as a succession of small battles  small victories to be won .      derec     came a voice behind him  and he turned to see avernus standing there .      yes .      the robot  so large  spoke with a small voice .     i do not know that i can understand why you did what you did to me last night     he said     but i cannot help but feel that we did the right thing  and that doing the right thing is what is important .         i couldn   t agree more     derec said  smiling widely .     friends .      avernus nodded solidly .     friends     he said  as he laid his pincer in derec   s open palm in the universal gesture of peace and good will .   it wasn   t going to be such a bad day after all .       data bank  illustrations by paul rivoche    katherine ariel burgess     kate     kate is a native

accommodate both its robot and  eventual  human populations in the areas of safety  movement  and easy access .  the city material is an iron plastic carbon alloy using carbon monoxide as a reducing agent .  this raw material is etched with micro circuits .  the result is an artificially intelligent    city    capable of pre programmed movement and structural change  but still reactant to stimuli .  the city material is strong yet flexible  each cell  approx .          x          able to interact in a variety of ways with its brother cells .  the cells bear a striking structural relationship to the key to perihelion .   the city architecture is based on combinations of the    perfect    geometric solids  and is constantly changing as the city grows and adapts .  entire new buildings can spring up overnight  and disappear just as suddenly .       witness robots  these robots contain specialized sensor equipment and are equipped to function only as event witnesses and reporters .  capable only of first level  observation  connections  the witness robot has no lifting appendages  in order to maintain detached objectivity .       euler  one of the main supervisor robots of robot city  euler possesses a bipedal  bilaterally symmetrical structure covered with a metallic skin .  supervisors control the basic functions of the city and constitute the central computer .  they have access to the central data core and are capable of second level connections  drawing conclusions from existing data .       avernus  another of the main supervisors  avernus has a bipedal  humanoid structure  stands approximately twelve feet high  and has a jet black metallic skin .  instead of the pseudo hands possessed by human oriented supervisors  such as euler  avernus has interchangeable hands for various functions .  he is shown here with the humanoid hands he employs for very delicate work .  his usual hands  however  are a set of highly adaptable pincer like claws .       troubleshooter  small  round computer diagnostician .  makes quick determinations of fault in computer function  and does nothing else .       michael mcquay  mike mcquay began his writing career in
