 some time after      about the author    praise    other books by terry pratchett    copyright    about the publisher      the nine thousand year  prologue     the flotillas of the dead sailed around the world on underwater rivers .   very nearly nobody knew about them .  but the theory is easy to understand .  it runs  the sea is  after all  in many respects  only a wetter form of air .  and it is known that air is heavier the lower you go and lighter the higher you fly .  as a storm tossed ship founders and sinks  therefore  it must reach a depth where the water below it is just viscous enough to stop its fall .   in short  it stops sinking and ends up floating on an underwater surface  beyond the reach of the storms but far above the ocean floor .   it   s calm there .  dead calm .   some stricken ships have rigging  some even have sails .  many still have crew  tangled in the rigging or lashed to the wheel .   but the voyages still continue  aimlessly  with no harbor in sight  because there are currents under the ocean  and so the dead ships with their skeleton crews sail on around the world  over sunken cities and between drowned mountains  until rot and shipworms eat them away and they disintegrate .   sometimes an anchor drops  all the way to the dark  cold calmness of the abyssal plain  and disturbs the stillness of centuries by throwing up a cloud of silt .   one nearly hit anghammarad  where he sat watching the ships drift by  far overhead .   he remembered it  because it was the only really interesting thing to happen in the last nine thousand years .       the one month  prologue   there was this   disease that the clacksmen got .   it was like the illness known as    calenture     which sailors experienced when  after having been becalmed for weeks under a pitiless sun  they suddenly believed that the ship was surrounded by green fields   and stepped overboard .   sometimes the clacksmen thought they could fly .   there was about eight miles between the big semaphore towers  and when you were at the top you were maybe a hundred and fifty feet above the plains .  work up there too long without a hat on  they said  and the tower you were on got taller  and the nearest tower got closer  and maybe you thought you could jump from one to another  or ride on the invisible messages sleeting between the towers  or perhaps you thought that you were a message .  perhaps  as some said  all this was nothing more than a disturbance in the brain caused by the wind in the rigging .  no one knew for sure .  people who step onto the air one hundred and fifty feet above the ground seldom have much to discuss afterwards .   the tower shifted gently in the wind  but that was okay .  there were lots of new designs in this tower .  it stored the wind to power its mechanisms  it bent rather than broke  it acted more like a tree than a fortress .  you could build most of it on the ground and raise it into place in an hour .  it was a thing of grace and beauty .  and it could send messages up to four times faster than the old towers  thanks to the new shutter system and the colored lights .   at least  it would be able to  once they sorted out a few lingering problems     the young man climbed swiftly to the very top of the tower .  for most of the way he was in clinging  gray morning mist  and then he was rising through glorious sunlight  the mist spreading below him  all the way to the horizon  like a sea .   he paid the view no attention .  he   d never dreamed of flying .  he dreamed of mechanisms  of making things work better than they   d ever done before .   right now he wanted to find out what was making the new shutter array stick again .  he oiled the sliders  checked the tension on the wires  and then swung himself out over fresh air to check the shutters themselves .  it wasn   t what you were supposed to do  but every linesman knew it was the only way to get things done .  anyway  it was perfectly safe if you     there was a clink .  he looked back and saw the snap hook of his safety rope lying on the walkway  saw the shadow  felt the terrible pain in his fingers  heard the scream and dropped        like an anchor .       chapter     the angel      in which our hero experiences hope   the greatest gift   the bacon sandwich of regret    somber reflections on capital punishment  from the hangman   famous last words   our hero dies    angels  conversations about   inadvisability of  misplaced offers regarding broomsticks   an unexpected ride    a world free of honest men   a man on the hop    there is always a choice      they say that the prospect of being hanged in the morning concentrates a man   s mind wonderfully  unfortunately  what the mind inevitably concentrates on is that  in the morning  it will be in a body that is going to be hanged .   the man going to be hanged had been named moist von lipwig by doting if unwise parents  but he was not going to embarrass the name  insofar as that was still possible  by being hung under it .  to the world in general  and particularly on that bit of it known as the death warrant  he was alfred spangler .   and he took a more positive approach to the situation and had concentrated his mind on the prospect of not being hanged in the morning  and  most particularly  on the prospect of removing all the crumbling mortar from around a stone in his cell wall with a spoon .  so far the work had taken him five weeks and reduced the spoon to something like a nail file .  fortunately  no one ever came to change the bedding here  or else they would have discovered the world   s heaviest mattress .   it was a large and heavy stone that was currently the object of his attentions  and  at some point  a huge staple had been hammered into it as an anchor for manacles .   moist sat down facing the wall  gripped the iron ring in both hands  braced his legs against the stones on either side  and heaved .   his shoulders caught fire  and a red mist filled his vision  but the block slid out with a faint and inappropriate tinkling noise .  moist managed to ease it away from the hole and peered inside .   at the far end was another block  and the mortar around it looked suspiciously strong and fresh .   just in front of it was a new spoon .  it was shiny .   as he studied it  he heard the clapping behind him .  he turned his head  tendons twanging a little riff of agony  and saw several of the wardens watching him through the bars .      well done  mr .  spangler .     said one of them .     ron here owes me five dollars .  i told him you were a sticker .     he   s a sticker     i said .         you set this up  did you  mr .  wilkinson .     said moist weakly  watching the glint of light on the spoon .      oh  not us  sir .  lord vetinari   s orders .  he insists that all condemned prisoners should be offered the prospect of freedom .         freedom .  but there   s a damn great stone through there .         yes  there is that  sir  yes  there is that     said the warden .     it   s only the prospect  you see .  not actual free freedom as such .  hah  that   d be a bit daft  eh .         i suppose so  yes     said moist .  he didn   t say    you bastards .     the wardens had treated him quite civilly these past six weeks  and he made a point of getting on with people .  he was very  very good at it .  people skills were part of his stock in trade  they were nearly the whole of it .   besides  these people had big sticks .  so  speaking carefully  he added     some people might consider this cruel  mr .  wilkinson .         yes  sir  we asked him about that  sir  but he said no  it wasn   t .  he said it provided      his forehead wrinkled      occ you pay shun all ther rap py  healthy exercise  prevented moping  and offered that greatest of all treasures  which is hope  sir .         hope     muttered moist glumly .      not upset  are you  sir .         upset .  why should i be upset  mr .  wilkinson .         only the last bloke we had in this cell  he managed to get down that drain  sir .  very small man .  very agile .      moist looked at the little grid in the floor .  he   d dismissed it out of hand .      does it lead to the river .     he said .   the warden grinned .     you   d think so  wouldn   t you .  he was really upset when we fished him out .  nice to see you   ve entered into the spirit of the thing  sir .  you   ve been an example to all of us  sir  the way you kept going .  stuffing all the dust in your mattress .  very clever  very tidy .  very neat .  it   s really cheered us up  having you in here .  by the way  mrs .  wilkinson says thanks very much for the fruit basket .  very posh  it is .  it   s got kumquats  even .         don   t mention it  mr .  wilkinson .         the warden was a bit green about the kumquats     cos he only got dates in his  but i told him  sir  that fruit baskets is like life   until you   ve got the pineapple off of the top you never know what   s underneath .  he says thank you  too .         glad he liked it  mr .  wilkinson     said moist absent mindedly .  several of his former landladies had brought in presents for    the poor  confused boy     and moist always invested in generosity .  a career like his was all about style  after all .      on that general subject  sir     said mr .  wilkinson     me and the lads were wondering if you might like to unburden yourself  at this point in time  on the subject of the whereabouts of the place where the location of the spot is where  not to beat about the bush  you hid all that money you stole    .      the jail went silent .  even the cockroaches were listening .      no  i couldn   t do that  mr .  wilkinson     said moist loudly  after a decent pause for dramatic effect .  he tapped his jacket pocket  held up a finger  and winked .   the warders grinned back .      we understand totally  sir .  now i   d get some rest if i was you  sir     cos we   re hanging you in half an hour     said mr .  wilkinson .      hey  don   t i get breakfast .         breakfast isn   t until seven o   clock  sir     said the warder reproachfully .     but  tell you what  i   ll do you a bacon sandwich .     cos it   s you  mr .  spangler .         and now it was a few minutes before dawn and it was him being led down the short corridor and out into the little room under the scaffold .  moist realized he was looking at himself from a distance  as if part of himself was floating outside his body like a child   s balloon  ready  as it were  for him to let go of the string .   the room was lit by light coming through cracks in the scaffold floor above  and  significantly  from around the edges of the large trapdoor .  the hinges of said door were being carefully oiled by a man in a hood .   he stopped when he saw the party had arrived and said     good morning  mr .  spangler .     he raised the hood helpfully .     it   s me  sir  daniel    one drop    trooper .  i am your executioner for today  sir .  don   t you worry  sir .  i   ve hanged dozens of people .  we   ll soon have you out of here .         is it true that if a man isn   t hanged after three attempts he   s reprieved  dan .     said moist  as the executioner carefully wiped his hands on a rag .      so i   ve heard  sir  so i   ve heard .  but they don   t call me    one drop    for nothing  sir .  and will sir be having the black bag today .         will it help .         some people think it makes them look more dashing  sir .  and it stops that pop eyed look .  it   s more a crowd thing  really .  quite a big one out there this morning .  nice piece about you in the times yesterday  i thought .  all them people saying what a nice young man you were  and everything .  er   would you mind signing the rope beforehand  sir .  i mean  i won   t have a chance to ask you afterwards  eh .         signing the rope .     said moist .      yessir     said the hangman .     it   s sort of traditional .  there   s a lot of people out there who buy old rope .  specialist collectors  you could say .  a bit strange  but it takes all sorts  eh .  worth more signed  of course .     he flourished a length of stout rope .     i   ve got a special pen that signs on rope .  one signature every couple of inches .  straightforward signature  no dedication needed .  worth money to me  sir .  i   d be very grateful .         so grateful that you won   t hang me  then .     said moist  taking the pen .   this got an appreciative laugh .  mr .  trooper watched him sign along the length  nodding happily .      well done  sir  that   s my pension plan you   re signing there .  now   are we ready  everyone .         not me .     said moist quickly  to another round of general amusement .      you   re a card  mr .  spangler     said mr .  wilkinson .     it won   t be the same without you around  and that   s the truth .         not for me  at any rate     said moist .  this was  once again  treated like rapier wit .  moist sighed .      do you really think all this deters crime  mr .  trooper .     he said .      well  in the generality of things i   d say it   s hard to tell  given that it   s hard to find evidence of crimes not committed     said the hangman  giving the trapdoor a final rattle .     but in the specificality  sir  i   d say it   s very efficacious .         meaning what .     said moist .      meaning i   ve never seen someone up here more   n once  sir .  shall we go .      there was a stir when they climbed up into the chilly morning air  followed by a few boos and even some applause .  people were strange like that .  steal five dollars and you were a petty thief .  steal thousands of dollars and you were either a government or a hero .   moist stared ahead while the roll call of his crimes was read out .  he couldn   t help feeling that it was so unfair .  he   d never so much as tapped someone on the head .  he   d never even broken down a door .  he had picked locks on occasion  but he   d always locked them again behind him .  apart from all those repossessions  bankruptcies  and sudden insolvencies  what had he actually done that was bad  as such .  he   d only been moving numbers around .      nice crowd turned out today     said mr .  trooper  tossing the end of the rope over the beam and busying himself with knots .     lot of press  too .  what gallows .  covers    em all  o   course  and there   s the times and the pseudopolis herald  prob   ly because of that bank what collapsed there  and i heard there   s a man from the sto plains dealer  too .  very good financial section  i always keep an eye on used rope prices .  looks like a lot of people want to see you dead  sir .      moist was aware that a black coach had drawn up at the rear of the crowd .  there was no coat of arms on the door  unless you were in on the secret  which was that lord vetinari   s coat of arms featured a sable shield .  black on black .  you had to admit  the bastard had style        huh .  what .     he said  in response to a nudge .      i asked if you have any last words  mr .  spangler .     said the hangman .     it   s customary .  i wonder if you might have thought of any .         i wasn   t actually expecting to die     said moist .  and that was it .  he really hadn   t  until now .  he   d been certain that something would turn up .      good one  sir     said mr .  wilkinson .     we   ll go with that  shall we .      moist narrowed his eyes .  the curtain on a coach window had twitched .  the coach door had opened .  hope  that greatest of all treasures  ventured a little glitter .      no  they   re not my actual last words     he said .     er   let me think        a slight  clerklike figure was descending from the coach .      er   it   s not as bad a thing i do now   er       aha  it all made some kind of sense now .  vetinari was out to scare him  that was it .  that would be just like the man  from what moist had heard .  there was going to be a reprieve .      i   er   i        down below  the clerk was having difficulty getting through the press of people .      do you mind speeding up a bit  mr .  spangler .     said the hangman .     fair   s fair  eh .         i want to get it right     said moist haughtily  watching the clerk negotiate his way around a large troll .      yes  but there   s a limit  sir     said the hangman  annoyed at this breach of etiquette .     otherwise you could go ah  er  um for days .  short and sweet  sir  that   s the style .         right  right     said moist .     er   oh  look  see that man there .  waving at you .      the hangman glanced down at the clerk  who   d struggled to the front of the crowd .      i bring a message from lord vetinari .     the man shouted .      right .     said moist .      he says to get on with it  it   s long past dawn .     said the clerk .      oh     said moist  staring at the black coach .  that damn vetinari had a warder   s sense of humor  too .      come on  mr .  spangler  you don   t want me to get into trouble  do you .     said the hangman  patting him on the shoulder .     just a few words  and then we can all get on with our lives .  present company excepted  obviously .      so this was it .  it was  in some strange way  rather liberating .  you didn   t have to fear the worst that could happen anymore  because this was it  and it was nearly over .  the warder had been right .  what you had to do in this life was get past the pineapple  moist told himself .  it was big and sharp and knobbly  but there might be peaches underneath .  it was a myth to live by and so  right now  totally useless .      in that case     said moist von lipwig     i commend my soul to any god that can find it .         nice     said the hangman  and pulled the lever .   alfred spangler died .   it was generally agreed that they had been good last words .         ah  mr .  lipwig     said a distant voice  getting closer .     i see you are awake .  and still alive  at the present time .      there was a slight inflection to that last phrase  which told moist that the length of the present time was entirely in the gift of the speaker .   he opened his eyes .  he was sitting in a comfortable chair .  at a desk opposite him  sitting with his hands steepled reflectively in front of his pursed lips  was lord havelock vetinari  under whose idiosyncratically despotic rule ankh morpork had become the city where  for some reason  everyone wanted to live .   an ancient animal sense also told moist that other people were standing behind the comfortable chair  and that it could be extremely uncomfortable should he make any sudden movements .  but they couldn   t be as terrible as the thin  black robed man with the fussy little beard and the pianist   s hands  who was watching him .      shall i tell you about angels  mr .  lipwig .     said the patrician pleasantly .     i know two interesting facts about them .      moist grunted .  there were no obvious escape routes in front of him  and turning around was out of the question .  his neck ached horribly .      oh  yes .  you were hanged     said vetinari .     a very precise science  hanging .  mr .  trooper is a master .  the slippage and thickness of the rope  whether the knot is placed here rather than there  the relationship between weight and distance   oh  i   m sure the man could write a book .  you were hanged to within half an inch of your life  i understand .  only an expert standing right next to you would have spotted that  and in this case the expert was our friend mr .  trooper .  no  alfred spangler is dead  mr .  lipwig .  three hundred people would swear they saw him die .     he leaned forward .     and so  appropriately  it is of angels i wish to talk to you now .      moist managed a grunt .      the first interesting thing about angels  mr .  lipwig  is that sometimes  very rarely  at a point in a man   s career where he has made such a foul and tangled mess of his life that death appears to be the only sensible option  an angel appears to him  or  i should say  unto him  and offers him a chance to go back to the moment when it all went wrong  and this time do it right .  mr .  lipwig  i should like you to think of me as   an angel .      moist stared .  he   d felt the snap of the rope  the choke of the noose .  he   d seen the blackness welling up .  he   d died .      i   m offering you a job  mr .  lipwig .  alfred spangler is buried  but mr .  lipwig has a future .  it may  of course  be a very short one  if he is stupid .  i am offering you a job  mr .  lipwig .  work  for wages .  i realize the concept may be unfamiliar .      only as a form of hell  moist thought .      the job is that of postmaster general of the ankh morpork post office .     moist continued to stare .      may i just add  mr .  lipwig  that behind you there is a door .  if at any time in this interview you feel you wish to leave  you have only to step through it and you will never hear from me again .      moist filed that under    deeply suspicious .         to continue  the job  mr .  lipwig  involves the refurbishment and running of the city   s postal service  preparation of the international packets  maintenance of post office property  et cetera  et cetera           if you stick a broom up my arse i could probably sweep the floor  too     said a voice .  moist realized it was his .  his brain was a mess .  it had come as a shock to him that the afterlife was this one .   lord vetinari gave him a long  long look .      well  if you wish     he said  and turned to a hovering clerk .     drumknott  does the housekeeper have a store cupboard on this floor  do you know .         oh  yes  my lord     said the clerk .     shall i           it was a joke .     moist burst out .      oh  i   m sorry  i hadn   t realized     said lord vetinari  turning back to moist .     do tell me if you feel obliged to make another one  will you .         look     said moist     i don   t know what   s happening here  but i don   t know anything about delivering post .         mr .  lipwig  this morning you had no experience at all of being dead  and yet but for my intervention you would nevertheless have turned out to be extremely good at it     said lord vetinari sharply .     it just goes to show  you never know until you try .         but when you sentenced me        vetinari raised a pale hand .     ah .     he said .  moist   s brain  at last aware that it needed to do some work here  stepped in and replied      er   when you   sentenced   alfred spangler           well done .  do carry on .            you said he was a natural born criminal  a fraudster by vocation  a habitual liar  a perverted genius  and totally untrustworthy .         are you accepting my offer  mr .  lipwig .     said vetinari sharply .   moist looked at him .     excuse me     he said  standing up     i   d just like to check something .      there were two men dressed in black standing behind his chair .  it wasn   t a particularly neat black  more the black worn by people who just don   t want little marks to show .  they looked like clerks  until you met their eyes .   they stood aside as moist walked toward the door  which  as promised  was indeed there .  he opened it very carefully .  there was nothing beyond  and that included a floor .  in the manner of one who is going to try all possibilities  he took the remnant of the spoon out of his pocket and let it drop .  it was quite a long time before he heard the jingle .   then he went back and sat in the chair .      the prospect of freedom .     he said .      exactly     said lord vetinari .     there is always a choice .         you mean   i could choose certain death .         a choice  nevertheless     said vetinari .     or  perhaps  an alternative .  you see  i believe in freedom  mr .  lipwig .  not many people do  although they will  of course  protest otherwise .  and no practical definition of freedom would be completely without the freedom to take the consequences .  indeed  it is the freedom upon which all the others are based .  now   will you take the job .  no one will recognize you  i am sure .  no one ever recognizes you  it would appear .      moist shrugged .     oh  all right .  of course  i accept as natural born criminal  habitual liar  fraudster  and totally untrustworthy perverted genius .         capital .  welcome to government service .     said lord vetinari  extending his hand .     i pride myself on being able to pick the right man .  the wage is twenty dollars a week and  i believe  the postmaster general has the use of a small apartment in the main building .  i think there   s a hat  too .  i shall require regular reports .  good day .      he looked down at his paperwork .  he looked up .      you appear to be still here  postmaster general .         and that   s it .     said moist  aghast .     one minute i   m being hanged  next minute you   re employing me .         let me see   yes  i think so .  oh  no .  of course .  drumknott  do give mr .  lipwig his keys .      the clerk stepped forward  handed moist a huge  rusted key ring full of keys  and proffered a clipboard .      sign here  please  postmaster general     he said .   hold on a minute  moist thought  this is only one city .  it   s got gates .  it   s completely surrounded by different directions to run .  does it matter what i sign .      certainly     he said  and scribbled his name .      your correct name  if you please     said lord vetinari  not looking up from his desk .     what name did he sign  drumknott .      the clerk craned his head .     er   ethel snake  my lord  as far as i can make out .         do try to concentrate  mr .  lipwig     said vetinari wearily  still apparently reading the paperwork .   moist signed again .  after all  what would it matter in the long run .  and it would certainly be a long run  if he couldn   t find a horse .      and that only leaves the matter of your parole officer     said lord vetinari  still engrossed in the paper before him .      parole officer .         yes .  i   m not completely stupid  mr .  lipwig .  he will meet you outside the post office building in ten minutes .  good day .      when moist had left  drumknott coughed politely and said     do you think he   ll turn up there  my lord .         one must always consider the psychology of the individual     said vetinari  correcting the spelling on an official report .     that is what i do all the time and lamentably  drumknott  you do not always do .  that is why he has walked off with your pencil .         always move fast .  you never know what   s catching you up .   ten minutes later  moist von lipwig was well outside the city .  he   d bought a horse  which was a bit embarrassing  but speed had been of the essence and he   d only had time to grab one of his emergency stashes from its secret hiding place and pick up a skinny old screw from the bargain box in hobson   s livery stable .  at least it   d mean no irate citizen going to the watch .   no one had bothered him .  no one looked at him twice  no one ever did .  the city gates had indeed been wide open .  the plains lay ahead of him  full of opportunity .  and he was good at parlaying nothing into something .  for example  at the first little town he came to he   d go to work on this old nag with a few simple techniques and ingredients that   d make it worth twice the price he paid for it  at least for about twenty minutes or until it rained .  twenty minutes would be enough time to sell it and  with any luck  pick up a better horse worth slightly more than the asking price .  he   d do it again at the next town  and in three days  maybe four  he   d have a horse worth owning .   but that would be just a sideshow  something to keep his hand in .  he   d got three very nearly diamond rings sewn into the lining of his coat  a real one in a secret pocket in the sleeve  and a very nearly gold dollar sewn cunningly into the collar .  these were  to him  what his saw and hammer are to a carpenter .  they were primitive tools  but they   d put him back in the game .   there is a saying     you can   t fool an honest man     which is much quoted by people who make a profitable living by fooling honest men .  moist never tried it  knowingly anyway .  if you did fool an honest man  he tended to complain to the local watch  and these days they were harder to buy off .  fooling dishonest men was a lot safer and  somehow  more sporting .  and  of course  there were so many more of them .  you hardly had to aim .   half an hour after arriving in the town of hapley  where the big city was a tower of smoke on the horizon  he was sitting outside an inn  downcast  with nothing in the world but a genuine diamond ring worth a hundred dollars and a pressing need to get home to genua  where his poor aged mother was dying of gnats .  eleven minutes later  he was standing patiently outside a jeweler   s shop  inside which the jeweler was telling a sympathetic citizen that the ring the stranger was prepared to sell for twenty dollars was worth seventy five  even jewelers have to make a living  .  and thirty five minutes later  he was riding out on a better horse  with five dollars in his pocket  leaving behind a gloating  sympathetic citizen who  despite having been bright enough to watch moist   s hands carefully  was about to go back to the jeweler to try to sell for seventy five dollars a shiny brass ring with a glass stone that was worth fifty pence of anybody   s money .   the world was blessedly free of honest men and wonderfully full of people who believed they could tell the difference between an honest man and a crook .   he tapped his jacket pocket .  the jailers had taken the map off him  of course  probably while he was busy being a dead man .  it was a good map  and in studying it mr .  wilkinson and his chums would learn a lot about decryption  geography  and devious cartography .  they wouldn   t find in it the whereabouts of am         in mixed currencies  though  because the map was a complete and complex fiction .  however  moist entertained a wonderful warm feeling inside to think that they would  for some time  possess that greatest of all treasures  which is hope .   anyone who couldn   t simply remember where he stashed a great big fortune deserved to lose it  in moist   s opinion .  but  for now  he   d have to keep away from it  while having it to look forward to     moist didn   t even bother to note the name of the next town .  it had an inn  and that was enough .  he took a room with a view over a disused alley  checked that the window opened easily  ate an adequate meal  and had an early night .   not bad at all  he thought .  this morning he   d been on the scaffold with the actual noose around his actual neck  tonight he was back in business .  all he needed to do now was grow a beard again  and keep away from ankh morpork for six months .  or perhaps only three .   moist had a talent .  he   d also acquired a lot of skills so completely that they were second nature .  he   d learned to be personable  but something in his genetics made him unmemorable .  he had the talent for not being noticed  for being a face in the crowd .  people had difficulty describing him .  he was   he was    about .     he was about twenty  or about thirty .  on watch reports across the continent he was anywhere between  oh  about six feet two inches and five feet nine inches tall  hair all shades from mid brown to blond  and his lack of distinguishing features included his entire face .  he was about   average .  what people remembered was the furniture  things like spectacles and mustaches  so he always carried a selection of both .  they remembered names and mannerisms  too .  he had hundreds of those .   oh  and they remembered that they   d been richer before they met him .   at three in the morning  the door burst open .  it was a real burst  bits of wood clattered off the wall .  but moist was already out of bed and diving for the window before the first of them hit the floor .  it was an automatic reaction that owed nothing to thought .  besides  he   d checked before lying down  and there was a large water barrel outside that would break his fall .   it wasn   t there now .   whoever had stolen it had not stolen the ground it stood on  however  and it broke moist   s fall by twisting his ankle .   he pulled himself up  keening softly in agony  and hopped along the alley  using the wall for support .  the inn   s stables were around the back  all he had to do was pull himself up onto a horse  any horse        mr .  lipwig .     a big voice bellowed .   oh gods  it was a troll  it sounded like a troll  a big one  too  he didn   t know you got any down here  outside the cities        you can   t run and you can   t hide  mr .  lipwig .      hold on  hold on  he hadn   t given his real name to anyone in this place  had he .  but all this was background thinking .  someone was after him  therefore he would run .  or hop .   he risked a look behind him when he reached the back gate to the stables .  there was a red glow in his room .  surely they weren   t torching the place over a matter of a few dollars .  how stupid .  everyone knew that if you got lumbered with a good fake you palmed it off onto some other sucker as soon as possible  didn   t they .  there was no helping some people .   his horse was alone in the stable  and seemed unimpressed to see him .  he got the bridle on  while hopping on one foot .  there was no point in bothering with a saddle .  he knew how to ride without a saddle .  hell  once he   d ridden without pants  too  but luckily all the tar and feathers helped him stick to the horse .  he was the world champion at leaving town in a hurry .   he went to lead the horse out of the stall  and heard the clink .   he looked down and kicked some straw away .   there was a bright yellow bar  joining two short lengths of chain with a yellow shackle attached  one for each leg .  the only way this horse would go anywhere was by hopping  just like him .   they   d clamped it .  they   d bloody clamped it        oh  mr .  lipppppwig .     the voice boomed out across the stable yard .     do you want to know the rules  mr .  lipwig .      he looked around in desperation .  there was nothing in here to use as a weapon  and in any case weapons made him nervous  which was why he   d never  ever carried one .  weapons raised the ante far too high .  it was much better to rely on a gift for talking his way out of things  confusing the issue  and  if that failed  some well soled shoes and a cry of    look  what   s that over there .      but he had a definite feeling that while he could talk as much as he liked  out here no one was going to listen .  as for speeding away  he   d just have to rely on hop .   there was a yard broom and a wooden feed bucket in the corner .  he stuck the head of the broom under his armpit to make a crutch  and grabbed the bucket handle as heavy footsteps thudded toward the stable door .  when the door was pushed open  he swung the bucket as hard as he could  and felt it shatter .  splinters filled the air .  a moment later  there was the thump of a heavy body hitting the ground .   moist hopped over it and plunged unsteadily into the dark .   something as tough and hard as a shackle snapped around his good ankle .  he hung from the broom handle for a second  and then collapsed .      i have nothing but good feelings toward you  mr .  lipwig .     boomed the voice cheerfully .   moist groaned .  the broom must have been kept as an ornament  because it certainly hadn   t been used much on the accumulations in the stable yard .  on the positive side  this meant he had fallen into something soft .  on the negative side  it meant that he had fallen into something soft .   someone grabbed a handful of his coat and lifted him bodily out of the muck .      up we get  mr .  lipwig .         it   s pronounced lipvig  you moron     he moaned .     a v  not a w .         up ve get  mr .  lipvig .     said the booming voice as his broom crutch was pushed under his arm .      what the hell are you .     lipwig managed .      i am your parole officer  mr .  lipvig .      moist managed to turn around  and looked up  and then up again  into a gingerbread man   s face with two glowing red eyes in it .  when it spoke  its mouth was a glimpse into an inferno .      a golem .  you   re a damn golem .      the thing picked him up in one hand and slung him over its shoulder .  it ducked into the stables and moist  upside down with his nose pressed against the terra cotta of the creature   s body  realized that it was picking up his horse in its other hand .  there was a brief whinny .      ve must make haste  mr .  lipvig .  you are due in front of lord vetinari at eight o   clock .  and at vork by nine .      moist groaned .         ah  mr .  lipwig .  regrettably  we meet again     said lord vetinari .   it was eight o   clock in the morning .  moist was swaying .  his ankle felt better  but it was the only part of him that did .      it walked all night .     he said .     all damn night .  carrying a horse as well .         do sit down  mr .  lipwig     said vetinari  looking up from the table and gesturing wearily to the chair .     by the way     it    is a    he .     an honorific in this case  clearly  but i have great hopes of mr .  pump .      moist saw the glow on the walls as  behind him  the golem smiled .   vetinari looked down at the table again  and seemed to lose interest in moist for a moment .  a slab of stone occupied most of the table .  little carvings of dwarfs and trolls covered it .  it looked like some kind of game .      mr .  pump .     said moist .      hmm .     said vetinari  moving his head to look at the board from a slightly different viewpoint .   moist leaned toward the patrician and jerked a thumb in the direction of the golem .      that     he said     is mr .  pump .         no     said lord vetinari  leaning forward likewise and suddenly  completely and disconcertingly  focusing on moist .     he   is mr .  pump .  mr .  pump is a government official .  mr .  pump does not sleep .  mr .  pump does not eat .  and mr .  pump  postmaster general  does not stop .         and that means what  exactly .         it means that if you are thinking of  say  finding a ship headed for fourecks  on the basis that mr .  pump is big and heavy and travels only at walking pace  mr .  pump will follow you .  you have to sleep .  mr .  pump does not .  mr .  pump does not breathe .  the deep abyssal plains of the oceans present no barrier to mr .  pump .  four miles an hour is six hundred and seventy two miles a week .  it all adds up .  and when mr .  pump catches you           ah  now     said moist  holding up a finger .     let me stop you there .  i know golems are not allowed to hurt people .      lord vetinari raised his eyebrows .     good heavens  wherever did you hear that .         it   s written on   something inside their heads .  a scroll  or something .  isn   t it .     said moist  uncertainty rising .      oh  dear .     the patrician sighed .     mr .  pump  just break one of mr .  lipwig   s fingers  will you .  neatly  if you please .         yes  your lordship .     the golem lumbered forward .      hey .  no .  what .     moist waved his hands wildly and knocked game pieces tumbling .     wait .  wait .  there   s a rule .  a golem mustn   t harm a human being or allow a human being to come to harm .      lord vetinari raised a finger .     just wait one moment  please  mr .  pump .  very well  mr .  lipwig  can you remember the next bit .         the next bit .  what next bit .     said moist .     there isn   t a next bit .      lord vetinari raised an eyebrow .      mr .  pump .     he said           unless ordered to do so by duly constituted authority        said the golem .      i   ve never heard that bit before .     said moist .      haven   t you .     said lord vetinari  in apparent surprise .     i can   t imagine who would fail to include it .  a hammer can hardly be allowed to refuse to hit the nail on the head  nor a saw make moral judgments about the nature of the timber .  in any case  i employ mr .  trooper the hangman  who of course you have met  and the city watch  the regiments  and  from time to time   other specialists  who are fully entitled to kill in their own defense or in protection of the city and its interests .     vetinari started to pick up the fallen pieces and replace them delicately on the slab .     why should mr .  pump be any different just because he is made of clay .  ultimately  so are we all .  mr .  pump will accompany you to your place of work .  the fiction will be that he is your bodyguard  as befits a senior government official .  we alone will know that he has   additional instructions .  golems are highly moral creatures by nature  mr .  lipwig  but you may find their morality a shade   old fashioned .         additional instructions .     said moist .     and would you mind telling me exactly what his additional instructions are .         yes .     the patrician blew a speck of dust off a little stone troll and put it on its square .      and    .     said moist  after a pause .   vetinari sighed .     yes  i would mind telling you exactly what they are .  you have no rights in this matter .  we have impounded your horse  by the way  since it was used in the committal of a crime .         this is cruel and unusual punishment .     said moist .      indeed .     said vetinari .     i offer you a light desk job  comparative freedom of movement  working in the fresh air   no  i feel that my offer might well be unusual but   cruel .  i think not .  however  i believe down the cellars we do have some ancient punishments which are extremely cruel and in many cases quite unusual  if you would like to try them for the purposes of comparison .  and  of course  there is always the option of dancing the sisal two step .         the what .     said moist .   drumknott leaned down and whispered something in his master   s ear .      oh  i apologize     said vetinari .     i meant  of course  the hemp fandango .  it is your choice  mr .  lipwig .  there is always a choice  mr .  lipwig .  oh  and by the way   do you know the second interesting thing about angels .         what angels .     said moist  angry and bewildered .      oh dear  people just don   t pay attention     said vetinari .     remember .  the first interesting thing about angels .  i told you yesterday .  i expect you were thinking about something else .  the second interesting thing about angels  mr .  lipwig  is that you only ever get one .          chapter     the post office      in which we meet the staff     glom of nit      dissertation on rhyming slang         you should have been there .         the dead letters      a golem   s life     book of regulations      there was always an angle .  there was always a price .  there was always a way .   and look at it like this  moist thought  certain death had been replaced with uncertain death  and that   s an improvement  isn   t it .  he was free to walk around   well  hobble  at the moment .  and it was just possible that somewhere in all this was a profit .  well  it could happen .  he was good at seeing opportunities where other people saw barren ground .  so there was no harm in playing it straight for a few days  yes .  it   d give his foot a chance to get better  he could spy out the situation  he could make plans .  he might even find out how indestructible golems were .  after all  they were made of pottery  weren   t they .  things could get broken  maybe .   moist von lipwig raised his eyes and examined his future .   the ankh morpork central post office had a gaunt frontage .  it was a building designed for a purpose .  it was  therefore  more or less  a big box to employ people in  with two wings at the rear  which enclosed the big stable yard .  some cheap pillars had been sliced in half and stuck on the outside  some niches had been carved for some miscellaneous stone nymphs  some stone urns had been ranged along the parapet  and thus architecture had been created .   in appreciation of the thought that had gone into this  the good citizens  or more probably their kids  had covered the walls to a height of six feet with graffiti in many exciting colors .   in a band all along the top of the frontage  staining the stone in greens and browns  some words had been set in letters of bronze         neither rain nor snow nor glo m of ni t can stay these mes engers abo t their duty        moist read aloud .     what the hell does that mean .         the post office was once a proud institution     said mr .  pump .      and that stuff .     moist pointed .  on a board much further down the building  in peeling paint  were the less heroic words       dont arsk us about  rocks troll   s with sticks all sorts of dragons mrs .  cake huje green things with teeth any kinds of black dogs with orange eyebrows rains of spaniel   s .  fog .   mrs .  cake       i said it was a proud institution     the golem rumbled .      who   s mrs .  cake .         i regret i cannot assist you there  mr .  lipvig .         they seem pretty frightened of her .         so it appears  mr .  lipvig .      moist looked around at this busy junction in this busy city .  people weren   t paying any attention to him  although the golem was getting casual glances that didn   t appear very friendly .   this was all too strange .  he   d been   what  fourteen .    when he   d last used his real name .  and heavens knew how long since he   d gone out without some easily removable distinguishing marks .  he felt naked .  naked and unnoticed .   to the interest of no one whatsoever  he walked up the stained steps and turned the key in the lock .  to his surprise  it moved easily  and the paint spattered doors swung open without a creak .   there was a rhythmic  hollow noise behind moist .  mr .  pump was clapping his hands .      well done  mr .  lipvig .  your first step in a career of benefit both to yourself and the well being of the city .         yeah  right     muttered moist .   he stepped into the huge  dark lobby  which was lit only dimly by a big but grimy dome in the ceiling  it could never be more than twilight in here  even at noon .  the graffiti artists had been at work here  too .   in the gloom he could see a long  broken counter  with doors and pigeonholes behind it .   real pigeonholes .  pigeons were nesting in the pigeonholes .  the sour  salty smell of old guano filled the air  and  as marble tiles rang under moist   s feet  several hundred pigeons took off frantically and spiraled up toward a broken pane in the roof .      oh shit     he said .      bad language is discouraged  mr .  lipvig     said mr .  pump behind him .      why .  it   s written on the walls .  anyway  it was a description  mr .  pump .  guano .  there must be tons of the stuff .     moist heard his own voice echo back from the distant walls .     when was this place last open .         twenty years ago  postmaster .      moist looked around .      who said that .     he said .  the voice seemed to have come from everywhere .   there was the sound of shuffling and the click click of a walking stick  and a bent  elderly figure appeared in the gray  dead  dusty air .      groat  sir     it wheezed .     junior postman groat  sir .  at your service  sir .  one word from you  sir  and i will leap  sir  leap into action  sir .     the figure stopped to cough long and hard  making a noise like a wall being hit repeatedly with a bag of rocks .  moist saw that it had a beard of the short  bristled type  which suggested that its owner had been interrupted halfway through eating a hedgehog .      junior postman groat .     he said .      indeedy  sir .  the reason being  no one   s ever bin here long enough to promote me  sir .  should be senior postman groat  sir     the old man added meaningfully  and once again coughed volcanically .      ex postman groat    sounds more like it  moist thought .  aloud he said     and you work here  do you .         aye  sir  that we do  sir .  it   s just me and the boy now  sir .  he   s keen  sir .  we keeps the place clean  sir .  all according to regulations .      moist couldn   t stop staring .  mr .  groat wore a toupee .  there may actually be a man somewhere on whom a toupee works  but whoever that man might be  mr .  groat was not he .  it was chestnut brown  the wrong size  the wrong shape  the wrong style  and  all in all  wrong .      ah  i see you   re admirin    my hair  sir     said groat proudly  as the toupee spun gently .     it   s all mine  you know  not a prunes .         er   prunes .     said moist .      sorry  sir  shouldn   t have used slang .  prunes as in    syrup of prunes     sir .  dimwell slang .   syrup of prunes  wig .  not many men o    my age got all their own hair  i expect that   s what you   re thinking .  it   s clean living that does it  inside and out .      moist looked around at the fetid air and the receding mounds of guano .      well done     he muttered .     well  mr .  groat  do i have an office .  or something .      for a moment  the visible face above the ragged beard was that of a rabbit in a headlight .      oh  yes  sir  tech   n   ly     said the old man  quickly .     but we don   t go in there anymore  sir  oh no     cos of the floor .  very unsafe  sir .     cos of the floor .  could give way any minute  sir .  we uses the staff locker room  sir .  if you   d care to follow me  sir .      moist nearly burst out laughing .      fine     he said .  he turned to the golem .     er   mr .  pump .         yes  mr .  lipvig .     said the golem .      are you allowed to assist me in any way  or do you just wait around until it   s time to hit me on the head .         there is no need for hurtful remarks  sir .  i am allowed to render appropriate assistance .         so could you clean out the pigeon shit and let a bit of light in .         certainly  mr .  lipvig .         you can .         a golem does not shy away from work  mr .  lipvig .  i will locate a shovel .     pump set off toward the distant counter  and the bearded junior postman panicked .      no .     he squeaked  lurching after the golem .     it   s really not a good idea to touch them heaps .         floors liable to collapse  mr .  groat .     said moist cheerfully .   groat looked from moist to the golem  and back again .  his mouth opened and shut as his brain sought for words .  then he sighed .      you   d better come down to the locker room  then .  step this way  gentlemen .         moist became aware of the smell of mr .  groat as he followed the old man .  it wasn   t a bad smell  as such  just   odd .  it was vaguely chemical  coupled with the eye stinging aroma of every type of throat medicine you   ve ever swallowed  and with just a hint of old potatoes .   the locker room turned out to be down some steps into the basement  where  presumably  the floors couldn   t collapse because there was nothing to collapse into .  it was long and narrow .  at one end was a monstrous oven  which  moist learned later  had once been part of some kind of heating system  the post office having been a very advanced building for its time .  now a small round stove  glowing almost cherry red at the base  had been installed alongside it .  there was a huge black kettle on it .   the air indicated the presence of socks  cheap coal  and no ventilation  some battered wooden lockers were ranged along one wall  the painted names flaking off .  light got in  eventually  via grimy windows up near the ceiling .   whatever the original purpose of the room  though  it was now the place where two people lived  two people who got along but  nevertheless  had a clear sense of mine and thine .  the space was divided into two  with a narrow bed at either end .  the dividing line was painted on the floor  up the walls  and across the ceiling .  my half  your half .   so long as we remember that  the line indicated  there won   t be any more   trouble .   in the middle  so that it bestrode the boundary line  was a table .  a couple of mugs and two tin plates were carefully arranged at either end .  there was a salt pot in the middle of the table .  at the salt pot  the line turned into a little circle to encompass it in its own demilitarized zone .   one half of the narrow room contained an overlarge and untidy bench  piled with jars  bottles  and old papers  it looked like the work space of a chemist who made it up as he went along  or until it exploded .  the other had an old card table  on which small boxes and rolls of black felt had been stacked with slightly worrying precision .  there  on a stand  was also the largest magnifying glass moist had ever seen .   that side of the room had been swept clean  the other was a mess that threatened to encroach over the line .   unless one of the scraps of paper from the grubbier side was a funny shape  it seemed that somebody  with care and precision and presumably a razor blade  had cut off that corner of it that had gone too far .   a young man stood in the middle of the clean half of the floor .  he   d obviously been waiting for moist  just like groat  but he hadn   t mastered the art of standing to attention or  rather  had only partly understood it .  his right side stood considerably more to attention than his left side  and  as a result of this  he was standing like a banana .  nevertheless  with his huge  nervous grin and big  gleaming eyes he radiated keenness  quite possibly beyond the boundaries of sanity .  there was a definite sense that at any moment he would bite .  and he wore a blue cotton shirt on which someone had printed ask me about pins .      er       said moist .      apprentice postman stanley     mumbled groat .     orphan  sir .  very sad .  came to us from the siblings of offler charity home  sir .  both parents passed away of the gnats on their farm out in the wilds  sir  and he was raised by peas .         surely you mean on peas  mr .  groat .         by peas  sir .  very unusual case .  a good lad if he doesn   t get upset  but he tends to twist toward the sun  sir  if you get my meaning .         er   perhaps     said moist .  he turned hurriedly to stanley .     so you know something about pins  do you .     he said in what he hoped was a jovial voice .      nossir .     said stanley .  he all but saluted .      but your shirt says           i know everything about pins  sir     said stanley .     everything there is to know .         well  that   s  er       moist began .      every single fact about pins  sir     stanley went on .     there   s not a thing i don   t know about pins .  ask me anything about pins  sir .  anything you like at all .  go on  sir .         well       moist floundered  but years of practice came to his aid .     i wonder how many pins were made in this city last ye        he stopped .  a change had come across stanley   s face  it smoothed out  lost the vague sense that its owner was about to attempt to gnaw your ear off .      last year the combined workshops  or    pinneries     of ankh morpork turned out twenty seven million  eight hundred and eighty thousand  nine hundred and seventy eight pins     said stanley  staring into a pin filled  private universe .     that includes wax headed  steels  brassers  silver headed  and full silver   extra large  machine  and handmade  reflexed and novelty  but not lapel pins  which should not be grouped with the true pins at all  since they are technically known as    sports    or    blazons     sir           ah yes  i think i once saw a magazine or something     said moist desperately .     it was called  er   pins monthly .         oh dear     said groat behind him .  stanley   s face contorted in something that looked like a cat   s bottom with a nose .      that   s for hobbyists     he hissed .     they   re not true    pinheads    .  they don   t care about pins .  oh  they say so  but they have a whole page of needles every month now .  needles .  anyone could collect needles .  they   re only pins with holes in .  anyway  what about popular needles .  but they just don   t want to know .         stanley is editor of total pins     groat whispered behind moist .      i don   t think i saw that one       moist began .      stanley  go and help mr .  lipwig   s assistant find a shovel  will you .     said groat  raising his voice .     then go and sort your pins again until you feel better .  mr .  lipwig doesn   t want to see one of your little moments .     he gave moist a blank look .         they had an article last month about pincushions     muttered stanley  stamping out of the room .  the golem followed him .      he   s a good lad     said groat when they were gone .     just a bit cup and plate in the head .  leave him alone with his pins and he   s no trouble at all .  gets a bit   intense at times  that   s all .  oh  and on that subject  there   s the third member of our jolly little team  sir        a large black and white cat had walked into the room .  it paid no attention to moist or groat  but progressed slowly across the floor toward a battered and unraveling basket .  moist was in the way .  the cat continued until its head butted gently against moist   s leg  and stopped .      that   s mr .  tiddles  sir     said groat .      tiddles .     said moist .     you mean that really is a cat   s name .  i thought it was just a joke .         not so much a name  sir  more of a description     said groat .     you   d better move  sir  otherwise he   ll just stand there all day .  twenty years old  he is  and a bit set in his ways .      moist stepped aside .  unperturbed  the cat continued to the basket  where it curled up .      is he blind .     said moist .      no  sir .  he has his routine and he sticks to it  sir  sticks to it to the very second .  very patient  for a cat .  doesn   t like the furniture being moved .  you   ll get used to him .      not knowing what to say  but feeling that he should say something  moist nodded toward the array of bottles on groat   s desk .      you dabble in alchemy  mr .  groat .     he said .      nossir .  i practice nat   ral medicine .     said groat proudly .     don   t believe in doctors  sir .  never a day   s illness in my life  sir .     he thumped his chest  making a thlap noise not normally associated with living tissue .     flannelette  goose grease  and hot bread puddin     sir .  nothing like it for protecting your tubes against the noxious effluviences .  i puts a fresh layer on ever week  sir  and you won   t find a sneeze passing my nose  sir .  very healthful  very natural .         er   good     said moist .      worst of    em all is soap  sir     said groat  lowering his voice .     terrible stuff  sir  washes away the beneficent humors .  leave things be  i say .  keep the tubes running  put sulfur in your socks  and pay attention to your chest protector  and you can laugh at anything .  now  sir  i   m sure a young man like yourself will be worrying about the state of his           what   s this do .     said moist hurriedly  picking up a pot of greenish goo .      that  sir .  wart cure .  wonderful stuff .  very natural  not like the stuff a doctor   d give you .      moist sniffed at the pot .     what   s it made of .         arsenic  sir     said groat calmly .      arsenic .         very natural  sir     said groat .     and green .      so  moist thought  as he put the pot back with extreme care  inside the post office normality clearly does not have a one to one relationship with the outside world .  i might miss the cues .  he decided that the role of keen but bewildered manager was the one to play here .  besides  apart from the    keen    aspect  it didn   t need any effort .      can you help me  mr .  groat .     he said .     i don   t know anything about the post .         well  sir   what did you used to do .      rob .  trick .  forge .  embezzle .  but never   and this was important   using any kind of violence .  never .  moist had always been very careful about that .  he tried not to sneak  either  if he could avoid it .  being caught at one a . m .  in a bank   s deposit vault while wearing a black suit with lots of little pockets in it could be considered suspicious  so why do it .  with careful planning  the right suit  the right papers  and  above all  the right manner  you could walk into the place at midday  and the manager would hold the door open for you when you left .  palming rings and exploiting the cupidity of the rural stupid was just a way of keeping his hand in .   it was the face  that was what it was .  he had an honest face .  and he loved those people who looked him firmly in the eye to see his inner self  because he had a whole set of inner selves  one for every occasion .  as for firm handshakes  practice had given him one to which you could moor boats .  it was people skills  that was what it was .  special people skills .  before you could sell glass as diamonds you had to make people really want to see diamonds .  that was the trick  the trick of all tricks .  you changed the way people saw the world .  you let them see it the way they wanted it to be     how the hell had vetinari known his name .  the man had cracked von lipwig like an egg .  and the watch here were   demonic .  as for setting a golem on a man        i was a clerk     said moist .      what  paperwork  that sort of thing .     said groat  looking at him intently .      yes  pretty much all paperwork .     that was honest  if you included playing cards  checks  letters of accreditation  bank drafts  and deeds .      oh  another one     said groat .     well  there   s not a lot to do .  we can shove up and make room for you in here  no problem .         but i am supposed to make it work again like it used to  mr .  groat .         yeah  right     said the old man .     you just come along with me  then  mr .  lipwig .  i reckon there   s one or two thing you ain   t bin tole .      he led the way out  back into the dingy main hall  a little trail of yellow powder leaking from his boots .      my dad used to bring me here when i were a lad     he said .     a lot of families were post office families in those days .  they had them big glass drippy tinkling things up in the ceiling  right .  for lights .         chandeliers .     moist suggested .      yep  prob   ly     said groat .     two of    em .  and there was brass an    copper everywhere  polished up like gold .  there was balconies  sir  all round the big hall on every floor  made of iron  like lace .  and all the counters was of rare wood  my dad said .  and people .  this place was packed .  the doors never stopped swinging .  even at night   oh  at night  sir  out in the big backyard  you should   ve been there .  the lights .  the coaches  coming and going  the horses steamin      oh  sir  you should   ve seen it  sir .  the men running the teams out   they had this thing  sir  this device  you could get a coach in and out of the yard in one minute  sir  one minute .  the bustle  sir  the bustle and fuss .  they said you could come here from dolly sisters or even down in the shambles  and post a letter to yourself  and you   d have to run like the blazes  sir  the very blazes  sir  to beat the postman to your door .  and the uniforms  sir  royal blue with brass buttons .  you should   ve seen them .  and        moist looked over the babbling man   s shoulders to the nearest mountain of pigeon guano  where mr .  pump had paused in his digging .  the golem had been prodding at the fetid  horrible mess and  as moist watched him  he straightened up and headed toward them with something in his hand .         and when the big coaches came in  sir  all the way from the mountains  you could hear the horns miles away .  you should   ve heard them  sir .  and if any bandits tried anything  there was men we had  who   d go out and           yes  mr .  pump .     said moist  halting groat in midhistory .      a surprising discovery  postmaster .  the mounds are not  as i surmised  made of pigeon dung .  no pigeons could achieve that amount in thousands of years  sir .         well  what are they made of  then .         letters  sir     said the golem .   moist looked down at groat  who shifted uneasily .      ah  yes     said the old man .     i was coming to that .         letters        there was no end to them .  they filled every room of the building and spilled out into the corridors .  it was technically true that the postmaster   s office was unusable because of the state of the floor  it was twelve feet deep in letters .  whole corridors were blocked off with them .  cupboards had been stuffed full of them  to open a door incautiously was to be buried in an avalanche of yellowing envelopes .  floorboards bulged suspiciously upwards .  through cracks in the sagging ceiling plaster  paper protruded .   the sorting room  almost as big as the main hall  had drifts reaching to twenty feet in places .  here and there  filing cabinets rose out of the paper sea like icebergs .   after half an hour of exploration moist wanted a bath .  it was like walking through desert tombs .  he felt he was choking on the smell of old paper  he felt as though his throat was filled with yellow dust .      i was told i had an apartment here     he croaked .      yes  sir     said groat .     me and the lad had a look for it the other day .  i heard that it was the other side of your office .  so the lad went in on the end of a rope  sir .  he said he felt a door  sir  but he   d sunk six feet under the mail by then and he was suffering  sir  suffering   so i pulled him out .         the whole place is full of undelivered mail .      they were back in the locker room .  groat had topped up the black kettle from a pan of water  and it was steaming .  at the far end of the room  sitting at a neat little table by the stove  stanley was counting his pins .      pretty much  sir  except in the basements and the stables     said the old man  washing a couple of tin mugs in a bowl of not very clean water .      you mean even the postm   my office is full of old mail but they never filled the basements .  where   s the sense in that .         oh  you couldn   t use the basements  sir  oh  not the basements     said groat  looking shocked .     it   s far too damp down here .  the letters   d be destroyed in no time .         destroyed     said moist flatly .      nothing like damp for destroying things  sir     said groat  nodding sagely .      destroying mail from dead people to dead people     said moist in the same flat voice .      we don   t know that  sir     said the old man .     i mean  we   re got no actual proof .         well  no .  after all  some of those envelopes are only a hundred years old .     said moist .  he had a headache from the dust and a sore throat from the dryness  and there was something about the old man that was grating on his raw nerves .  he was keeping something back .     that   s no time at all to some people .  i bet the zombie and vampire population are still waiting by the letterbox every day  right .         no need to be like that  sir     said groat levelly .     no need to be like that .  you can   t destroy the mails .  you just can   t do it  sir .  that   s tampering with the mail  sir .  that   s not just a crime  sir .  that   s a  a           sin .     said moist .      oh  worse   n a sin     said groat  almost sneering .     for sins you   re only in trouble with a god  but in my day  if you interfered with the mail  you   d be up against chief postal inspector rumbelow .  hah .  and there   s a big difference .  gods forgive .      moist searched for sanity in the wrinkled face opposite him .  the unkempt beard was streaked with different colors  either of dirt  tea  or random celestial pigment .  like some hermit  he thought .  only a hermit could wear a wig like that .      sorry .     he said .     and you mean that shoving someone   s letter under the floorboards for a hundred years isn   t tampering with it .      groat suddenly looked wretched .  the beard quivered .  then he started to cough  great  hacking  wooden  crackling lumps of cough that made the jars shake and caused a yellow mist to rise from his trouser bottoms .        scuse me a moment  sir     he wheezed between hacks  and fumbled in his pocket for a scratched and battered tin .      you suck at all  sir .     he said  tears rolling down his cheeks .  he proffered the tin to moist .     they   re number threes  sir .  very mild .  i make    em meself  sir .  nat   ral remedies from nat   ral ingredients  that   s my style  sir .  got to keep the tubes clear  sir  otherwise they turn against you .      moist took a large  violet lozenge from the box and sniffed it .  it smelled faintly of aniseed .      thank you  mr .  groat     he said  but in case this counted as an attempt at bribery  he added sternly     the mail  mr .  groat .  sticking undelivered mail wherever there   s a space isn   t tampering with it .         that   s more   delaying the mail  sir .  just  er   slowing it down .  a bit .  it   s not like there   s any intention of never delivering it  sir .      moist stared at the worried expression .  he felt that sense of shifting ground you experience when you realize that you   re dealing with someone whose world is connected with your own only by their fingertips .  not a hermit  he thought  but more like a shipwrecked mariner  living in this dry desert island of a building while the world outside moves on and all sanity evaporates .      mr .  groat  i don   t want to  you know  upset you or anything  but there   s thousands of letters out there under a thick layer of pigeon guano       he said slowly .      actually  on that score  sir  things aren   t as bad as they seem     said groat  and paused to suck noisily on his natural cough lozenge .     it   s very dry stuff  pigeon doins  and forms quite a hard protective crust on the envelopes           why are they all here  mr .  groat .     said moist .  people skills  he remembered .  you   re not allowed to shake him .   the junior postman avoided his gaze .      well  you know how it is       he tried .      no  mr .  groat .  i don   t think i do .         well   maybe a man   s busy  got a full round  maybe it   s hogswatch  lots of cards  see .  and the inspector is after him about his timekeeping  and so maybe he just shoves half a bag of letters somewhere safe   but he will deliver    em  right .  i mean  it   s not his fault if they keeps pushing  sir  pushing him all the time .  then it   s tomorrow and he   s got an even bigger bag     cos they   re pushing all the time  so he reckons  i   ll just drop a few off today  too     cos it   s my day off on thursday and i can catch up then  but you see by thursday he   s behind by more   n a day   s work because they keeps on pushing  and he   s tired anyway  tired as a dog  so then he says to himself  got some leave coming up soon  but he gets his leave and by then   well  it all got very nasty toward the end .  there was   unpleasantness .  we   d gone too far  sir  that   s what it was  we   d tried too hard .  sometimes things smash so bad it   s better to leave it alone than try to pick up the pieces .  i mean  where would you start .         i think i get the picture     said moist .  you   re lying  mr .  groat .  you   re lying by omission .  you   re not telling me everything .  and what you   re not telling me is very important  isn   t it .  i   ve turned lying into an art  mr .  groat  and you   re just a talented amateur .   groat   s face  unaware of the internal monologue  managed a smile .      but the trouble is   what   s your first name  mr .  groat .     moist asked .      tolliver  sir .         nice name   the thing is  tolliver  that the picture i see in your description is what i might refer to for the purposes of the analogy a cameo  whereas all this      moist waved his hand to include the building and everything it contained      is a full sized triptych showing scenes from history  the creation of the world  and the disposition of the gods  with a matching chapel ceiling portraying the glorious firmament and a sketch of a lady with a weird smile thrown in for good measure .  tolliver  i think you are not being frank with me .         sorry about that  sir     said groat  eyeing him with a sort of nervous defiance .      i could have you sacked  you know     said moist  knowing that this was a stupid thing to say .      you could  sir  you could try doin    that     said groat quietly and slowly .     but i   m all you got  apart from the lad .  and you don   t know nuffin    about the post office  sir .  you don   t know nuffin    about the regulations  neither .  i   m the only one that knows what needs doing around here .  you wouldn   t last five minutes without me  sir .  you wouldn   t even see that the inkwells get filled every day .         inkwells .  filling inkwells .     said moist .     this is just an old building full of  of  of dead paper .  we have no customers .         got to keep the inkwells filled  sir .  post office regulations     said groat in a steely voice .     got to follow regulations  sir .         for what .  it appears we don   t accept any mail or deliver any mail .  we just sit here .         no  sir  we don   t just sit here     said groat patiently .     we follow the post office regulations .  fill the inkwells  polish the brass           you don   t sweep up the pigeon shit .         oddly enough  that   s not in the regulations  sir     said the old man .     truth is  sir  no one wants us anymore .  it   s all the clacks now  the damn clacks  clack  clack  clack .  everyone   s got a clacks tower now  sir .  that   s the fashion .  fast as the speed of light  they say .  ha .  it   s got no soul  sir  no heart .  i hates    em .  but we   re ready  sir .  if there was any mail  we   d deal with it  sir .  we   d spring into action  sir  spring into action .  but there ain   t .         of course there isn   t .  it   s clearly sunk into this town long ago that you might as well throw your letters away as give them to the post office .         no  sir  wrong again .  they   re all kept  sir .  that   s what we do  sir .  we keep things as they are .  we try not to disturb things  sir     said groat quietly .     we try not to disturb anything .      the way he said it made moist hesitate .      what kind of anything .     he said .      oh  nothing  sir .  we just   go carefully .      moist looked around the room .  did it appear smaller .  did the shadows deepen and lengthen .  was there a sudden cold sensation in the air .   no  there wasn   t .  but an opportunity had definitely been missed  moist felt .  the hairs on the back of his neck were rising .  moist had heard that this was because men had been made out of monkeys  and it meant that there was a tiger behind you .   in fact mr .  pump was behind him  just standing there  eyes burning more brightly than any tiger had ever managed .  this was worse .  tigers couldn   t follow you across the sea  and they had to sleep .   he gave up .  mr .  groat was in some strange  musty little world of his own .      do you call this a life .     he said .   for the first time in this conversation .  mr .  groat looked him squarely in the eye .      much better than a death  sir     he said .      mr .  pump followed moist across the main hall and out of the main doors  at which point moist turned on him .      all right  what are the rules here .     he demanded .     are you going to follow me everywhere .  you know i can   t run .         you are allowed autonomous movement within the city and environs     the golem rumbled .     but until you are settled in  i am also instructed to accompany you for your own protection .         against who .  someone annoyed that their great grandaddy   s mail didn   t turn up .         i couldn   t say  sir .         i need some fresh air .  what happened in there .  why is it so   creepy .  what happened to the post office .         i couldn   t say  sir     said mr .  pump placidly .      you don   t know .  but it   s your city     said moist sarcastically .     have you been stuck at the bottom of a hole in the ground for the last hundred years .         no  mr .  lipvig     said the golem .      well  why can   t       moist began .      it was two hundred and forty years  mr .  lipvig     said the golem .      what was .         the time i spent at the bottom of the hole in the ground  mr .  lipvig .         what are you talking about .     said moist .      why  the time i spent at the bottom of the hole in the ground  mr .  lipvig .  pump is not my name  mr .  lipvig .  it is my description .  pump .  pump     to be precise .  i stood in the bottom of a hole a hundred feet deep and pumped water .  for two hundred and forty years  mr .  lipvig .  but now i am ambulating in the sunlight .  this is better  mr .  lipvig .  this is better .         that night  moist lay staring at the ceiling .  it was three feet from him .  hanging from it  a little distance away  was a candle in a safety lantern .  stanley had been insistent about that  and no wonder .  this place would go up like a bomb .  it was the boy who   d showed him up here  groat was sulking somewhere .  he   d been right  damn him .  he needed groat .  groat practically was the post office .   it had been a long day  and moist hadn   t slept well last night  what with being upside down over mr .  pump   s shoulder and occasionally kicked by the frantic horse .   he didn   t want to sleep here  either  heavens knew  but he didn   t have lodgings he could use anymore  and they were at a premium in this hive of a city in any case .  the locker room did not appeal  no  not at all .  so he   d simply scrambled onto the pile of dead letters in what was  in theory  his office .  it was no great hardship .  a man of affairs such as he had to learn to sleep in all kinds of situations  often while mobs were looking for him a wall   s thickness away .  at least the heaps of letters were dry and warm and weren   t carrying edged weapons .   paper crackled underneath him as he tried to get comfortable .  idly  he picked up a letter at random  it was addressed to someone called antimony parker at   lobbin clout  and on the back  in capitals  it said s . w . a . l . k .  he eased it open with a fingernail  the paper inside all but crumbled at his touch .       my very dearest timony   yes .  why should a woman  sensible to the great honour that a man is doing her  play the coy minx at such a time .  .  i know you have spoken to papa  and of course i consent to becoming the wife of the kindest  most wonderful       moist glanced at the date on the letter .  it had been written forty one years ago .   he was not  as a rule  given to introspection  it being a major drawback in his line of work  but he couldn   t help wondering if   he glanced back at the letter      your loving agnathea    had ever married antimony  or whether the romance had died right here  in this graveyard of paper .   he shivered and tucked the envelope into his jacket .  he   d have to ask groat what s . w . a . l . k .  meant .      mr .  pump .     he shouted .   there was a faint rumble from the corner of the room where the golem stood  waist deep in mail .      yes  mr .  lipvig .         is there no way you can shut your eyes .  i can   t sleep with two red glowing eyes watching me .  it   s a   well  it   s a childhood thing .         sorry  mr .  lipvig .  i could turn my back .         that won   t work .  i   d still know they   re there .  anyway  the glow reflects off the wall .  look  where would i run to .      the golem gave this some thought .      i will go and stand in the corridor  mr .  lipvig     he decided  and began to wade toward the door .      you do that     said moist .     and in the morning i want you to find my bedroom  okay .  some of the offices still have space near the ceiling  you can move the letters into there .         mr .  groat does not like the mail to be moved  mr .  lipvig     the golem rumbled .      mr .  groat is not the postmaster  mr .  pump .  i am .      good gods  the madness is catching  moist thought as the glow of the golem   s eyes disappeared into darkness outside .  i   m not the postmaster  i   m some poor bastard who   s the victim of some stupid   experiment .  what a place .  what a situation .  what kind of man would put a known criminal in charge of a major branch of government .  apart from  say  the average voter .   he tried to find the angle  the way out   but all the time a conversation kept bouncing off the insides of his brain .   imagine a hole  a hundred feet deep and full of water .   imagine the darkness .  imagine  at the bottom of the hole  a figure roughly of human shape  turning in that swirling darkness a massive handle once every eight seconds .   pump   pump   pump     for two hundred and forty years .      you didn   t mind .     moist had asked .      you mean did i harbor resentment  mr .  lipvig .  but i was doing useful and necessary work .  besides  there was much for me to think about .         at the bottom of a hundred feet of dirty water .  what the hell did you find to think about .         pumping  mr .  lipvig .      and then  the golem said  had come cessation  and dim light  a lowering of levels  a locking of chains  movement upwards  emergence into a world of light and color   and other golems .   moist knew something about golems .  they used to be baked out of clay  thousands of years ago  and brought to life by some kind of scroll put inside their heads  and they never wore out and they worked  all the time .  you saw them pushing brooms  or doing heavy work in timber yards and foundries .  most of them you never saw at all .  they made the hidden wheels go round  down in the dark .  and that was more or less the limit of his interest in them .  they were  almost by definition  honest .   but now the golems were freeing themselves .  it was the quietest  most socially responsible revolution in history .  they were property  and so they saved up and bought themselves .   mr .  pump was buying his freedom by seriously limiting the freedom of moist .  a man could get quite upset about that .  surely that wasn   t how freedom was supposed to work .   ye gods  thought moist  back in the here and now  no wonder groat sucked cough sweets all the time  the dust in this place could choke you .   he rummaged in his pocket and pulled out the diamond shaped cough lozenge the old man had given him .  it looked harmless enough .   one minute later  after mr .  pump had lurched into the room and slapped him heavily on the back  the steaming lozenge was stuck to the wall on the far side of the room  where  by morning  it had dissolved quite a lot of the plaster .      mr .  groat took a measured spoonful of tincture of rhubarb and cayenne pepper  to keep the tubes open  and checked that he still had the dead mole around his neck  to ward off any sudden attack of doctors .  everyone knew doctors made you ill  it stood to reason .  nature   s remedies were the trick every time  not some hellish potion made of gods knew what .   he smacked his lips appreciatively .  he   d put fresh sulfur in his socks tonight  too  and he could feel it doing him good .   two candle lanterns glowed in the velvet  papery darkness of the main sorting office .  the light was shining through the outer glass  filled with water so that the candle would go out if it was dropped  it made the lanterns look like the lights of some abyssal fish from the squidy  iron hard depths .   there was a little glugging noise in the dark .  groat corked his bottle of elixir and got on with business .      be the inkwells filled  apprentice postman stanley .     groat intoned .      aye  junior postman groat  full to a depth of one third of one inch from the top as per post office counter regulations  daily observances  rule c       said stanley .   there was a rustle as groat turned the pages of a huge book on the lectern in front of him .      can i see the picture  mr .  groat .     said stanley eagerly .   groat smiled .  it had become part of the ceremony  and he gave the reply he gave every time .      very well  but this is the last time .  it   s not good to look too often on the face of a god     he said .     or any other part .         but you said there used to be a gold statue of him in the big hall  mr .  groat .  people must   ve looked on it all the time .      groat hesitated .  but stanley was a growing lad .  he   d have to know sooner or later .      mind you  i don   t reckon people used to look at the face much     he said .     they looked more at the   wings .         on his hat and his ankles     said stanley .     so he could fly the messages at the speed of   messages .      a little bead of sweat dripped off groat   s forehead .      mostly on his hat and ankles  yes     he said .     er   but not only there .      stanley peered at the picture .      oh yes  i never noticed them before .  he   s got wings on           the fig leaf     said groat quickly .     that   s what we call it .         why   s he got a leaf there .     said stanley .      oh  they all had    em in the olden days     cos of being classical     said groat  relieved to be shifting away from the heart of the matter .     it   s a fig leaf .  off a fig tree .         har har  the joke   s on them  there   s no fig trees round here .     said stanley in the manner of one exposing the flaw in a long held dogma .      yes  lad  very good  but it was a tin one anyway     said groat with patience .      and the wings .     said the boy .      we ell  i    spose they thought that the more wings the better     said groat .      yes  but    sposing his hat wings and his ankle wings stopped working  he   d be held up by           stanley .  it   s just a statue .  don   t get excited .  calm down .  you don   t want to upset   them .      stanley hung his head .      they   ve been   whispering to me again  mr .  groat     he confided in a low voice .      yes  stanley .  they whisper to me  too .         i remember    em last time  talking in the night  mr .  groat     said stanley  his voice trembling .     i shut my eyes and i kept seeing the writin              yes  stanley .  don   t worry about it .  try not to think about it .  it   s mr .  lipstick   s fault  stirring them up .  leave well alone  i say .  they never listen  and then what happens .  they find out the hard way .         it seems like only yesterday  those watchmen drawing that chalk outline round mr .  mutable     said stanley  beginning to tremble .     he found out the hard way .         calm down now  calm down     said groat  patting him gently on the shoulder .     you   ll set    em off .  think about pins .         but it   s a cruel shame  mr .  groat  them never being alive long enough to make you senior postman .      groat sniffed .     oh  that   s enough of that .  that   s not important  stanley     he said  his face like thunder .      yes  mr .  groat  but you   re an old  old man and you   re still only a junior postman       stanley persisted .      i said that   s enough  stanley .  now  just raise that lamp again  will you .  good .  that   s better .  i   ll read a page of the regulations  that always quietens them down .     groat cleared his throat .     i shall now read from the book of regulations  delivery times  metropolitan   sundays and octadays excepted      he announced to the air .     as follows         the hours by which letters should be put into the receiving houses in town for each delivery within the city walls of ankh morpork are as the following  overnight by eight o   clock in the evening  for the first delivery .  morning by eight o   clock  for the second delivery .  morning by ten o   clock  for the third delivery .  morning by twelve o   clock  for the fourth delivery .  afternoon by two o   clock  for the fifth delivery .  afternoon by four o   clock  for the sixth delivery .  afternoon by six o   clock  for the seventh delivery .     these are the hours  and i have read them .      groat hung his head for a moment  and then closed the book with a snap .      why are we doing this  mr .  groat .     said stanley meekly .         cos of hub riss     said mr .  groat .     that   s what it was .  hub riss killed the post office .  hub riss and greed and bloody stupid johnson and the new pie .         a pie  mr .  groat .  how could a pie           don   t ask  stanley .  it gets complicated and there   s nothing in it about pins .      they put out the candles and left .   when they were gone  a faint whispering started .       chapter     our own hand  or none      in which our hero discovers the world of pins      the greengrocer   s apos   trophe     s . w . a . l . k .       the path of fate     the golem lady     the business  of business and the nature of freedom once again discussed      clerk brian shows enthusiasm         rise and shine  mr .  lipvig .  your second day as postmaster .      moist opened one crusted eye and glared at the golem .      oh  so you   re an alarm clock  too .     he said .     aargh  my tongue .  it feels like it was caught in a mousetrap .      he half crawled  half rolled across the bed of letters and managed to stand up just outside the door .      i need new clothes     he said .     and food .  and a toothbrush .  i   m going out  mr .  pump .  you are to stay here .  do something .  tidy the place up .  get rid of the graffiti on the walls  will you .  at least we can make the place look clean .         anything you say  mr .  lipvig .         right .     said moist  and strode off  at least for one stride  and then yelped .      be careful of your ankle  mr .  lipwig     said mr .  pump .      and another thing .     said moist  hopping on one leg .     how can you follow me .  how can you possibly know where i am .         karmic signature  mr .  lipvig     said the golem .      and that means what  exactly .     moist demanded .      it means i know exactly where you are  mr .  lipvig .      the pottery face was impassive .  moist gave up .   he limped out into what  for this city  was a fresh new morning .  there had been a touch of frost overnight  just enough to put some zest into the air and give him an appetite .  the leg still hurt  but at least he didn   t need the crutch today .   here was moist von lipwig walking through the city .  he   d never done that before .  the late alfred spangler had  and so had mundo smith and edwin streep and half a dozen other personas that he   d donned and discarded .  oh  he   d been moist inside  what a name  yes  he   d heard every possible joke     but they had been on the outside  between him and the world .   edwin streep had been a work of art .  he   d been a lack of confidence trickster  and needed to be noticed .  he was so patently  obviously bad at running a bent find the lady game and other street scams that people positively queued up to trick the dumb trickster and walked away grinning   right up to the moment when they tried to spend the coins they   d scooped up so quickly .   there   s a secret art to forgery  and moist had discovered it  in a hurry  or when excited  people will complete the forgery by their own cupidity .  they   ll be so keen to snatch the money from the obvious idiot that their own eyes filled in all the little details that weren   t quite there on the coins they so quickly pocketed .  all you needed to do was hint at them .   but that was just for starters .  some customers never even discovered that they   d put fake coins in their purse  thus revealing to the incompetent streep in which pocket they kept it .  later on they learned that streep might be rubbish with a deck of cards but also that his lack was more than made up for by his exceptional skill as a pickpocket .   now moist felt like a peeled prawn .  he felt as though he   d stepped out naked .  and yet  still  no one was taking any notice .  there were no cries of    hey  you .      no shouts of    that   s him .     he was just another face in the crowd .  it was a strange new feeling .  he   d never really had to be himself before .   he celebrated by buying a street directory from the guild of merchants  and had a coffee and a bacon sandwich while he thumbed  greasily  through it for the list of bars .  he didn   t find what he was looking for there  but he did find it in the list of hairdressers  and grinned when he did so .  it was nice to be right .   he also found a mention of dave   s pin exchange  up in dolly sisters  in an alley between a house of negotiable affection and a massage parlor .  it bought and sold pins to pin fanciers .   moist finished his coffee with a look on his face that those who knew him well   a group consisting  in fact  of absolutely nobody   would have recognized as the formation of a plan .  ultimately  everything was all about people .  if he was going to be staying here for a while  he   d make himself comfortable .   he went for a walk to the self styled    home of acuphilia .  .  .  .  .      it was like lifting an unregarded stone and finding a whole new world .  dave   s pin exchange was the kind of small shop where the owner knows every single one of his customers by name .  it was a wonderful world  the world of pins .  it was a hobby that could last you a lifetime .  moist knew this because he expended one dollar on pins by j .  lanugo owlsbury  apparently the last word on the subject .  everyone had their funny little ways  moist conceded  but he wasn   t entirely at home among people who  if they saw a pinup  would pay attention to the pins .  some of the customers browsing the book racks  misdraws  double pointers  and flaws  pins of uberwald and genua  first steps in pins  adventures in acuphilia     and staring covetously at the rack of pins laid out under glass  had an intensity of expression that frightened him .  they looked a bit like stanley .  they were all male .  clearly  women weren   t natural    pinheads .      he found total pins on the bottom rack .  it had a smudgy  home produced look  and the print was small and dense and lacked such subtleties as paragraphs and  in many cases  punctuation .  the common comma had looked at stanley   s expression and decided not to disturb him .   when moist put the little magazine onto the counter  the shop   s owner  a huge bearded man with dreadlocks  a pin through his nose  a beer belly belonging to three other people  and the words death or pins tattooed on a bicep  picked it up and tossed it back down dismissively .      sure about that  sir .     he said .     we   ve got pins monthly  new pins  practical pins  modern pins  pins extra  pins international  talking pins  pins world  world pins  world of pins  pins and pinneries       moist   s attention wandered off for a while but came back in time to catch    the acuphile digest  extreme pins  stifte .   that   s from uberwald  very good if you collect foreign pins  beginning pins  that   s a part work  sir  with a new pin every week  pin times and      here the big man winked      back alley pins .         i noticed that one     said moist .     it has lots of pictures of young women in leather .         yes  sir .  but  to be fair  they   re generally holding pins .  so  then   it   s still total pins for you  is it .     he added  as if giving a fool one last chance to repent his folly .      yes     said moist .     what   s wrong with it .         oh  nothing .  nothing at all .     dave scratched his stomach thoughtfully .     it   s just that the editor is a bit   a bit           a bit what .     said moist .      well  we think he   s a bit weird about pins  to tell you the truth .      moist looked around the shop .      really .     he said .      moist went to a nearby caf   and leafed through the book .  one of the skills of his previous life was an ability to pick up just enough about anything to sound like an expert  at least to nonexperts .  then he returned to the shop .   everyone had their levers .  often it was greed .  greed was a reliable old standby .  sometimes it was pride .  that was groat   s lever .  he desperately wanted promotion  you could see it in his eyes .  find the lever  and then it was plain sailing .   stanley  now  stanley   would be easy .   big dave was examining a pin under a microscope when moist returned to the shop .  the rush hour for pin buying must have been nearly over  because there were only a few laggards ogling the pins under glass  or thumbing through the racks .   moist sidled over to the counter and coughed .      yes  sir .     said big dave  looking up from his work .     back again  eh .  they get to you  don   t they .  seen anything you like .         a packet of pre perforated pin papers and a ten penny lucky dip bag  please     said moist loudly .  the other customers looked up for a moment as dave pulled the packets off their rack  and then looked down again .   moist leaned over the counter .      i was wondering     he whispered hoarsely     if you   d got anything a bit   you know   sharper .      the big man gave him a carefully blank look .      how d   you mean  sharper .     he said .      you know     said moist .  he cleared his throat .     more   pointed .      the door clicked shut as the last of the customers  sated enough on pins for one day  stepped out .  dave watched them go and then turned his attention back to moist .      a bit of a connoisseur  are we  sir .     he said  winking .      a serious student     said moist .     most of the stuff here  well           i don   t touch nails     said dave sharply .     won   t have    em in the shop .  i   ve got a reputation to think about .  little kids come in here  you know .         oh no .  strictly pins  that   s me .     said moist hastily .      good     said dave  relaxing .     as it happens  i might have one or two items for the genuine collector .     he nodded toward a beaded curtain at the back of the shop .     can   t put everything on display  not with youngsters around  you know how it is        moist followed him through the clashing curtain and into the crowded little room behind  where dave  after looking around conspiratorially  pulled a small black box off a shelf and flipped it open under moist   s nose .      not something you find every day  eh .     said dave .   gosh  it   s a pin  thought moist  but said    wow .     in a tone of well crafted genuine surprise .   a few minutes later  he stepped out of the shop  fighting an impulse to turn his collar up .  that was the problem with certain kinds of insanity .  they could strike at any time .  after all  he   d just spent am    on a damn pin .   he stared at the little packets in his hand and sighed .  as he carefully put them in his jacket pocket  his hand touched something papery .   oh  yes .  the s . w . a . l . k .  letter .  he was about to shove it back when his eye caught sight of the ancient street sign opposite  lobbin clout .   and as his gaze moved down  it also saw  over the first shop in the narrow street      no .    a .  parker   son   s  greengrocer   s  high clas   s fruit and vegetable   s     well  why not deliver it .  hah .  he was the postmaster  wasn   t he .  what harm could it do .   he slipped into the shop .  a middle aged man was introducing fresh carrots   or possibly carrot   s   into the life of a bulky woman with a big shopping bag and hairy warts .      mr .  antimony parker .     said moist urgently .      be with you in jus   t one moment  s   ir  i   m ju   st       the man began .      i just need to know if you are mr .  antimony parker  that   s all     said moist .  the woman turned to glare at the intruder  and moist gave her a smile so winning that she blushed and wished just for a moment she   d worn makeup today .      that   s father     said the greengrocer .     he   s out the back  tackling a difficult cabbage           this is his     said moist .     postal delivery .     he put the envelope on the counter and walked quickly out of the shop .   shopkeeper and customer stared down at the pink envelope .      s .    w . a . l . k .     said mr .  parker .      ooh  that takes me back  mr .  parker     said the woman .     in my day we used to put that on our letters when we were courting .  didn   t you .  sealed with a loving kiss .  there was s . w . a . l . k .   and l . a . n . c . r . e .  and       she lowered her voice and giggled     k . l . a . t . c . h .   of course .  remember .         all that pas   sed me by  mrs .  goodbody     said the greengrocer stiffly .     and if it mean   s young men are s   ending our dad pink envelope   s with s   walk on them  i   m thankful for that .  modern time   s  eh .     he turned and raised his voice .     father .         well  that was a good deed for the day  moist thought .  or a deed  in any case .   it looked as though mr .  parker had managed to acquire some sons  one way or another .  still  it was   odd to think of all those letters heaped in that old building .  you could imagine them as little packets of history .  deliver them  and history went one way .  but if you dropped them in the gap between the floorboards  it went the other .   ha .  he shook his head .  as if one tiny choice by someone unimportant could make that much difference .  history had to be a bit tougher than that .  it all sprang back eventually  didn   t it .  he was sure he   d read something about that  somewhere .  if it wasn   t like that  no one would ever dare do anything .   he stood in the little square where eight roads met  and chose to go home via market street .  it was as good a way as any other .      when he was sure that both stanley and the golem were busy on the mail mountains  mr .  groat crept away through the labyrinth of corridors .  bundles of letters were stacked so high and tight that it was all he could do to squeeze through  but at last he reached the shaft of the old hydraulic elevator  long disused .  the shaft had been filled up with letters .   however  the engineer   s ladder was still clear  and that at least went up to the roof .   of course  there was the fire escape outside  but that was outside  and groat was not overkeen on going outside at the best of times .  he inhabited the post office like a very small snail in a very large shell .  he was used to gloom .   now  slowly and painfully  his legs shaking  he climbed up through the floors of mail and forced open the trapdoor at the top .   he blinked and shuddered in the unfamiliar sunlight  and hauled himself out onto the flat roof .   he   d never really liked doing this  but what else could he have done .  stanley ate like a bird and groat mostly got by on tea and biscuits  but it all cost money  even if you went round the markets just as they closed up  and somewhere in the past  decades ago  the pay had stopped arriving .  groat had been too frightened to go up to the palace to find out why .  he was afraid that if he asked for money he   d be sacked .   so he   d taken to renting out the old pigeon loft .  where was the harm in that .  all the pigeons had joined their feral brethren years ago  and a decent shed was not to be sneezed at in this city  even if it did whiff a bit .  there was an outside fire escape and everything .  it was a little palace  compared to most lodgings .   besides  these lads didn   t mind the smell  they said .  they were pigeon fanciers .  groat wasn   t sure what that entailed  except that they had to use a little clacks tower to fancy them properly .  but they paid up  that was the important thing .   he skirted the big rainwater tank for the defunct elevator and sidled around the rooftops to the shed  where he knocked politely .      it   s me  lads .  just come about the rent     he said .   the door was opened and he heard a snatch of conversation        the linkages won   t stand it for more than thirty seconds           oh  mr .  groat  come on in     said the man who opened the door .  this was mr .  carlton  the one with the beard a dwarf would be proud of   no  two dwarfs would be proud of .  he seemed more sensible than the other two  although this was not hard .   groat removed his hat .      come about the rent  sir     he repeated  peering around the man .     got a bit o    news  too .  just thought i   d better mention  lads  we   ve got a new postmaster     said groat .     if you could be a bit careful for a while .  a nod   s as good as a wink  eh .         how long   s this one going to last  then .     said a man who was sitting on the floor  working on a big metal drum full of what  to mr .  groat  appeared to be very complicated clockwork .     you   ll push him off the roof by saturday  right .         now  now  mr .  winton  there   s no call to make fun of me like that     said groat nervously .     once he   s been here a few weeks and got settled in  i   ll kind of   hint that you   re here  all right .  pigeons getting on okay  are they .     he peered around the loft .  only one pigeon was visible  hunched up high in a corner .      they   re out for exercise right now     said winton .      ah  right  that   d be it  then     said groat .      anyway  we   re a bit more interested in woodpeckers at the moment     said winton  pulling a bent metal bar out of the drum .     see  alex .  i told you  it   s bent .  and two gears are stripped bare           woodpeckers .     said groat .   there was a certain lowering of the temperature  as if he   d said the wrong thing .      that   s right  woodpeckers     said a third voice .      woodpeckers  mr .  emery .     the third pigeon fancier made groat nervous .  it was the way his eyes were always on the move  like he was trying to see everything all at once .  and he was always holding a tube with smoke coming out of it  or another piece of machinery .  they all seemed very interested in tubes and cogwheels  if it came to that .  oddly enough  groat had never seen them holding a pigeon .  he didn   t know how pigeons were fancied  but he   d assumed that it had to be close up .      yes  woodpeckers     said the man  while the tube in his hand changed color from red to blue .     because      and here he appeared to stop and think for a moment      we   re seeing if they can be taught to   oh  yes  tap out the message when they get there  see .  much better than messenger pigeons .         why .     said groat .   mr .  emery stared at the whole world for a moment .     because   they can deliver messages in the dark .     he said .      well done     murmured the man dismantling the drum .      ah  could be a lifesaver  i can see that     said groat .     can   t see it beating the clacks  though .         that   s what we want to find out     said winton .      but we   d be very grateful if you didn   t tell anyone about this     said carlton quickly .     here   s your three dollars  mr .  groat .  we wouldn   t want other people stealing our idea  you see .         lips are sealed  lads     said groat .     don   t you worry about it .  you can rely on groat .      carlton was holding the door open .      we know we can .  good bye  mr .  groat .      groat heard the door shut behind him as he walked back across the roof .  inside the shed  there seemed to be an argument starting  he heard someone say     what did you have to go and tell him that for .      that was a bit hurtful  someone thinking that he couldn   t be trusted .  and  as he eased his way down the long ladder  groat wondered if he ought to have pointed out that woodpeckers wouldn   t fly in the dark .  it was amazing that bright lads like them hadn   t spotted this flaw .  they were  he thought  a bit gullible .      ahundred feet down and a quarter of a mile away as the woodpecker flies during daylight  moist followed the path of destiny .   currently  it was leading him through a neighborhood that was on the downside of whatever curve you hoped you   d bought your property on the upside of .  graffiti and garbage were everywhere here .  they were everywhere in the city  if it came to that  but elsewhere the garbage was better quality  and the graffiti was close to being correctly spelled .  the whole area was waiting for something to happen  like a really bad fire .   and then he saw it .  it was one of those hopeless little shopfronts that house enterprises with a lifetime measured in days  like giant clearance sale .  .  .  of socks with two heels each  tights with three legs  and shirts with one sleeve  four feet long .  the window was boarded over  but just visible behind the graffiti above it were the words the golem trust .   moist pushed open the door .  glass crunched under his feet .   a voice said     hands where i can see them  mister .      he raised his hands cautiously  while peering into the gloom .  there was definitely a crossbow being wielded by a dim figure .  such light as had managed to get around the boards glinted off the tip of the bolt .      oh     said the voice in the dark  as if mildly annoyed that there was no excuse to shoot anybody .     all right  then .  we had visitors last night .         the window .     said moist .      it happens about once a month .  i was just sweeping it up .     there was the scratch of a match  and a lamp was lit .     they don   t generally attack the golems themselves  not now there   s free ones around .  but glass doesn   t fight back .      the lamp was turned up  revealing a tall young woman in a tight  gray woolen dress  with coal black hair plastered down and forced into a tight bun at the back so that she looked like a peg doll .  there was a slight redness to her eyes that suggested she had been crying .      you   re lucky to have caught me     she said .     i   d only come in to make sure nothing   s been taken .  are you here to sell or to hire .  you can put your hands down now     she added  placing the crossbow under the counter .      sell or hire .     said moist  lowering his hands with care .      a golem     she said in a talking to the hard of thinking voice .     we are the go lem trust .  we buy or hire go lems .  do you want to sell a go lem or hire a go lem .         nei ther     said moist .     i   ve got a go lem .  i mean  one is working for me .         really .  where .     said the woman .     and we can probably speed up a little  i think .         at the post office .         oh  pump        said the woman .     he said it was government service .         we call him mister pump     said moist primly .      really .  and do you get a wonderful  warm  charitable feeling when you do .         pardon .  what .     said moist  bewildered .  he wasn   t sure if she was managing the trick of laughing at him behind her frown .   the woman sighed .     sorry  i   m a bit snappish this morning .  a brick landing on your desk does this to you .  let   s just say they don   t see the world in the same way as we do  okay .  they   ve got feelings  in their own way  but they   re not like ours .  anyway   how can i help you  mr    .  .         von lipwig     said moist  and added     moist von lipwig     to get the worst over with .  but the woman didn   t even smile .      lipwig  small town in near uberwald     she said  picking up a brick from the broken glass and debris on her desk  regarding it critically  and then turning to the ancient filing cabinet behind her and filing it under b .     chief export  its famous dogs  of course .  second most important export  its beer  except during the two weeks of sektoberfest  when it exports   secondhand beer  probably .         i don   t know  we left when i was a kid     said moist .     as far as i   m concerned  it   s just a funny name .         try adora belle dearheart sometime     said the woman .      ah .  that   s not a funny name     said moist .      quite     said adora belle dearheart .     i now have no sense of humor whatsoever .  well  now that we   ve been appropriately human toward one another  what exactly was it you wanted .         look  vetinari has sort of lumbered me with mr .    with pump    as an   an assistant  but i don   t know how to treat      moist sought in the woman   s eyes for some clue as to the politically correct term  and plumped for      him .         huh .  just treat him normally .         you mean normally for a human being  or normally for a pottery man filled with fire .      to moist   s astonishment  adora belle dearheart took a pack of cigarettes out of a desk drawer and lit one .  she mistook his expression and proffered the pack .      no  thanks     he said  waving it away .  apart from the occasional old lady with a pipe  he   d never seen a woman smoke before .  it was   strangely attractive  especially since  as it turned out  she smoked a cigarette as if she had a grudge against it  sucking the smoke down and blowing it out almost immediately .      you   re getting hung up about it all  right .     she said .  when ms .  dearheart wasn   t smoking  she held the cigarette at shoulder height  the elbow of her left arm cupped in her right hand .  there was a definite feel about adora belle dearheart that a lid was only barely holding down an entire womanful of anger .      yes .  i mean       moist began .      hah .  it   s just like the campaign for equal heights and all that patronizing stuff they spout about dwarfs and why we shouldn   t use terms like    small talk    and    feeling small .     golems don   t have any of our baggage about    who am i  why am i here     okay .  because they know .  they were made to be tools  to be property  to work .  work is what they do .  in a way  it   s what they are .  end of existential angst .      ms .  dearheart inhaled and then blew out the smoke in one nervous movement .     and then stupid people go around calling them    persons of clay    and    mr .  spanner    and so on  which they find rather strange .  they understand about free will .  they also understand that they don   t have it .  mind you  once a golem owns himself  it   s a different matter .         own .  how does property own itself .     said moist .     you said they were           they save up and buy themselves  of course .  freehold is the only path to freedom they   ll accept .  actually  what happens is that the free golems support the trust  the trust buys golems whenever it can  and the new golems then buy themselves from the trust at cost .  it   s working well .  the free golems earn      and there   s more and more of them .  they don   t eat  sleep  wear clothes  or understand the concept of leisure .  the occasional tube of ceramic cement doesn   t cost much .  they   re buying more golems every month now  and paying my wages and the iniquitous rent the landlord of this dump is charging because he knows he   s renting to golems .  they never complain  you know .  they pay whatever   s asked .  they   re so patient it could drive you nuts .      tube of ceramic cement  thought moist .  he tried to fix that thought in case it came in useful  but some mental processes were fully occupied with the growing realization of how well some women could look in a severely plain dress .      surely they can   t be damaged  can they .     he managed .      certainly they can .  a sledgehammer on the right spot would really mess one up .  owned golems will just stand there and take it .  but the trust golems are allowed to defend themselves  and when someone weighing a ton snatches a hammer out of your hand you have to let go really quickly .         i think mr .  pump is allowed to hit people     said moist .      quite possibly .  a lot of the frees are against that  but others say a tool can   t be blamed for the use to which it   s put     said ms .  dearheart .     they debate it a lot .  for days and days .      no rings on her fingers  moist noted .  what kind of attractive girl works for a bunch of clay men .      this is all fascinating     he said .     where can i find out more .         we do a pamphlet     said almost certainly miss dearheart  pulling open a drawer and flipping a thin booklet onto the desk .     it   s five pence .      the title on the cover was common clay .   moist put down a dollar .     keep the change     he said .      no .     said miss dearheart  fumbling for coins in the drawer .     didn   t you read what it said over the door .         yes .  it said    smash the barstuds        said moist .   miss dearheart put a hand to her forehead wearily .     oh  yes .  the painter hasn   t been yet .  but underneath that   look  it   s on the back of the pamphlet          moist read  or at least looked at .      it   s one of their own languages     she said .     it   s all a bit   mystic .  said to be spoken by angels .  it translates as    by our own hand  or none .     they   re fiercely independent .  you   ve no idea .      she admires them  moist thought .  whoo ee .  and   angels .      well  thank you     said moist .     i   d better be going .  i   ll definitely   well  thank you  anyway .         what are you doing at the post office  mr .  von lipwig .     said the woman as he opened the door .      call me moist     said moist  and a bit of his inner self shuddered .     i   m the new postmaster .         no kidding .     said miss dearheart .     then i   m glad you   ve got pump    with you .  the last few postmasters didn   t last long  i gather .         i think i heard something about that     said moist cheerfully .     it sounds as though things were pretty bad in the olden days .      miss dearheart   s brow wrinkled .     olden days .     she said .     last month was olden days .         lord vetinari stood looking out of his window .  his office once had a wonderful view of the city and  technically  it still did  although now the roofline was a forest of clacks towers  winking and twinkling in the sunlight .  on the tump  the old castle mound across the river  the big tower   one end of the grand trunk that wound more than two thousand miles across the continent to genua   glittered with semaphore .   it was good to see the lifeblood of trade and commerce and diplomacy pumping so steadily  especially when you employed clerks who were exceptionally good at decryption .  white and black by day  light and dark by night  the shutters stopped only for fog and snow .   at least  until the last few months .  he sighed and went back to his desk .   there was a file open .  it contained a report from commander vimes of the city watch  with a lot of exclamation marks .  it contained a more measured report from clerk alfred  and lord vetinari had circled the section titled    the smoking gnu .      there was a gentle knock at the door and the clerk drumknott came in like a ghost .      the gentlemen from the grand trunk semaphore company are all here now  sir     he said .  he laid down several sheets of paper covered in tiny  intricate lines .  vetinari gave the shorthand a cursory glance .      idle chitchat .     he said .      yes  my lord .  one might say excessively so .  but i am certain that the mouth of the speaking tube is quite invisible in the plaster work  my lord .  it   s hidden in a gilt cherub most cunningly  sir .  clerk brian has built it into its cornucopia  which apparently collects more sounds and can be swiveled to face whoever           one does not have to see something to know that it is there  drumknott .     vetinari tapped the paper .     these are not stupid men .  well  some of them  at least .  you have the files .      drumknott   s pale face bore for a moment the pained expression of a man forced to betray the high principles of filing .      in a manner of speaking  my lord .  we really have nothing substantial about any of the allegations  we really haven   t .  we   re running a concludium in the long gallery  but it   s all hearsay  sir  it really is .  there   s   hints  here and there  but really we need something more solid           there will be an opportunity     said vetinari .  being an absolute ruler today was not as simple as people thought .  at least  it was not simple if your ambitions included being an absolute ruler tomorrow .  there were subtleties .  oh  you could order men to smash down doors and drag people off to dungeons without trial  but too much of that sort of thing was bad for business  habit forming  style lacking  and very  very dangerous for your health .  a thinking tyrant  it seemed to vetinari  had a much harder job than a ruler raised to power by some idiot vote yourself rich system like democracy .  at least he could tell the people he was their fault .         we would not normally have started individual folders at this time     drumknott was agonizing .     you see  i   d merely have referenced them on the daily           your concern is  as ever  exemplary     said vetinari .     i see  however  that you have prepared some folders .         yes  my lord .  i have bulked some of them out with copies of clerk harold   s analysis of pig production in genua  sir .     drumknott looked unhappy as he handed over the cardboard folders .  deliberate misfiling ran fingernails down the blackboard of his very soul .      very good     said vetinari .  he placed them on his desk  pulled another folder out of a desk drawer to place on top of them  and moved some other papers to cover the small pile .     now please show our visitors in .         mr .  slant is with them  my lord     said the clerk .   vetinari smiled his mirthless smile .     how surprising .         and mr .  reacher gilt     drumknott added  watching his master carefully .      of course     said vetinari .   when the directors filed in a few minutes later  the conference table at one end of the room was clear and gleaming  except for a paper pad and the pile of files .  vetinari himself was standing at the window again .      ah  gentlemen .  so kind of you to come for this little chat     he said .     i was enjoying the view .      he turned around sharply and confronted a row of puzzled faces  except for two .  one was gray and belonged to mr .  slant  who was the most renowned  expensive  and certainly the oldest lawyer in the city .  he had been a zombie for many years  although apparently the change in habits between life and death had not been marked .  the other face belonged to a man with one eye and one black eyepatch  and it smiled like a tiger .      it   s particularly refreshing to see the grand trunk back in operation     said vetinari  ignoring that face .     i believe it was shut down all day yesterday .  i was only thinking to myself that it was such a shame  the grand trunk being so vital to us all  and so regrettable that there   s only one of it .  sadly  i understand the backers of the new trunk are now in disarray  which  of course  leaves the grand trunk operating in solitary splendor and your company  gentlemen  unchallenged .  oh  what am i thinking of .  do be seated  gentlemen .      he gave mr .  slant another friendly smile as he took his seat .      i don   t believe i know all these gentlemen     he said .   mr .  slant sighed .     my lord  let me present mr .  greenyham of ankh sto associates  who is the grand trunk company   s treasurer  mr .  nutmeg of sto plains holdings  mr .  horsefry of the ankh morpork mercantile credit bank  mr .  stowley of ankh futures  financial advisers   and mr .  gilt              all by himself     said the one eyed man calmly .      ah  mr .  reacher gilt     said vetinari  looking directly at him .     i   m so   pleased to meet you at last .         you don   t come to my parties  my lord     said gilt .      do excuse me .  affairs of state take up so much of my time     said lord vetinari brusquely .      we should all make time to unwind  my lord .  all work and no play makes jack a dull boy  as they say .      several of the assembly paused in their breathing when they heard this  but vetinari merely looked blank .      interesting     he said .   he riffled through the files and opened one of them .     now  my staff have prepared some notes for me  from information publicly available down at the barbican     he said to the lawyer .     directorships  for example .  of course  the mysterious world of finance is a closed  aha  ledger to me  but it seems to me that some of your clients work  as it were  for each other .         yes  my lord .     said slant .      is that normal .         oh  it is quite common for people with particular expertise to be on the board of several companies  my lord .         even if the companies are rivals .     said vetinari .   there were smiles from around the table .  most of the financiers settled a little more easily in their chairs .  the man was clearly a fool about business matters .  what did he know about compound interest  eh .  he   d been classically educated .  and then they remembered that his education had been at the assassins    guild school  and stopped smiling .  but mr .  gilt stared intently at vetinari .      there are ways   extremely honorable ways   of assuring confidentiality and avoiding conflicts of interest  my lord     said mr .  slant .      ah  this would be   what is it now   the glass ceiling .     said lord vetinari brightly .      no  my lord .  that is something else .  i believe you may be thinking about the    agatean wall        said mr .  slant smoothly .     this carefully and successfully ensures that there will be no breach of confidentiality should  for example  one part of an organization come into possession of privileged information which could conceivably be used by another department for unethical gain .         this is fascinating .  how does it work  exactly .     said vetinari .      people agree not to do it     said mr .  slant .      i   m sorry .  i thought you said there is a wall       said vetinari .      that   s just a name  my lord .  for agreeing not to do it .         ah .  and they do .  how wonderful .  even though in this case the invisible wall must pass through the middle of their brains .         we have a code of conduct  you know .     said a voice .   all eyes except those belonging to mr .  slant turned to the speaker  who had been fidgeting in his chair .  mr .  slant was a longtime student of the patrician and knew that when he appeared to be a confused civil servant asking innocent questions  it was time to watch him closely .      i   m very glad to hear it  mr .     .     vetinari began .      crispin horsefry  my lord  and i don   t like the tone of your questioning .      for a moment it seemed that even the chairs themselves edged away from him .  mr .  horsefry was a youngish man  not simply running to fat but vaulting  leaping  and diving toward obesity .  he had acquired  at thirty  an impressive selection of chins  and now they wobbled with angry pride .       i do have a number of other tones     said lord vetinari calmly .   mr .  horsefry looked around at his colleagues  who were somehow  suddenly  on the distant horizon .      i just wanted to make it clear that we   ve done nothing wrong     he muttered .     that   s all .  there is a code of conduct .         i   m sure i   ve not suggested that you have done anything wrong     said lord vetinari .     however  i shall make a note of what you tell me .      he pulled a sheet of paper toward him and wrote  in a careful copperplate hand     code of conduct .     the shifting of the paper exposed a file marked    embezzlement .     the title was  of course  upside down to the rest of the group and  since presumably it was not intended to be read by them  they read it .  horsefry even twisted his head for a better view .      however     vetinari went on     since the question of wrongdoing had been raised by mr .  horsefry     and he gave the young man a brief smile     i am sure you are aware of talk suggesting a conspiracy among yourselves to keep rates high and competition nonexistent .     the sentence came out fast and smooth  like a snake   s tongue  and the swift flick on the end of it was     and  indeed  some rumors about the death of young mr .  dearheart last month .      a stir among the semicircle of men said that the shoe had been dropped .  it wasn   t a welcome shoe  but it was a shoe they had been expecting and it had just gone thud .      an actionable falsehood     said slant .      on the contrary  mr .  slant     said vetinari     merely mentioning to you the existence of a rumor is not actionable  as i am sure you are aware .         there is no proof that we had anything to do with the boy   s murder     snapped horsefry .      ah  so you too have heard people saying he was murdered .     said vetinari  his eyes on reacher gilt   s face .     these rumors just fly around  don   t they           my lord  people talk     said slant wearily .     but the facts are that mr .  dearheart was alone in the tower .  no one else went up or down .  his safety line was apparently not clipped to anything .  it was an accident  such as happens often .  yes  we know people say his fingers were broken  but with a fall of that distance  hitting the tower on the way  can that really be surprising .  alas  the grand trunk company is not popular at the moment and so these scurrilous and baseless accusations are made .  as mr .  horsefry pointed out  there is no evidence whatsoever that what happened was anything more than a tragic accident .  and  if i may speak frankly  what exactly is the purpose of calling us here .  my clients are busy men .      vetinari leaned back  closed his eyes  and placed his fingers together .      let us consider a situation in which some keen and highly inventive men devise a remarkable system of communication     he said .     what they have is a kind of passionate ingenuity  in large amounts .  what they don   t have is money .  they are not used to money .  so they meet some   people  who introduce them to other people  friendly people  who for  oh  a forty percent stake in the enterprise give them the much needed cash and  very important  much fatherly advice and an introduction to a really good firm of accountants .  and so they proceed  and soon money is coming in and money is going out but somehow  they learn  they   re not quite as financially stable as they think  and really do need more money .  well  this is all fine  because it   s clear to all that the basic enterprise is going to be a money tree one day  and does it matter if they sign over another fifteen percent .  it   s just money .  it   s not important in the way that shutter mechanisms are  is it .  and then they find out that yes  it is .  it is everything .  suddenly the world   s turned upside down  suddenly those nice people aren   t so friendly anymore  suddenly it turns out that those bits of paper they signed in a hurry   were advised to sign by people who smiled all the time   mean that they don   t actually own anything at all  not patents  not property  nothing .  not even the contents of their own heads  indeed .  even any ideas they have now don   t belong to them  apparently .  and somehow they   re still in trouble about money .  well  some run and some hide and some try to fight  which is foolish in the extreme  because it turns out that everything is legal  it really is .  some accept low level jobs in the enterprise  because one has to live and in any case the enterprise even owns their dreams at night .  and yet actual illegality  it would appear  has not taken place .  business is business .      lord vetinari opened his eyes .  the men around the table were staring at him .      just thinking aloud     he said .     i am sure you will point out that this is not the business of the government .  i know mr .  gilt will .  however  i note that since you acquired the grand trunk at a fraction of its value  breakdowns are increasing  the speed of messages has slowed down  and the cost to customers has risen .  last week the grand trunk was closed for almost three days .  we could not even talk to sto lat .  hardly    as fast as light     gentlemen .         that was for essential maintenance     mr .  slant began .      no  it was for repairs     snapped vetinari .     under the previous management the system shut down for an hour every day .  that was for maintenance .  now the towers run until they break down .  what do you think you are doing  gentlemen .         that  my lord  and with respect  is none of your business .      lord vetinari smiled .  for the first time that morning  it was a smile of genuine pleasure .      ah  mr .  reacher gilt  i was wondering when we   d hear from you .  you have been so uncharacteristically silent .  i read your recent article in the times with great interest .  you are passionate about freedom  i gather .  you used the word    tyranny    three times and the word    tyrant    once .         don   t patronize me  my lord     said gilt .     we own the trunk .  it is our property .  you understand that .  property is the foundation of freedom .  oh  customers complain about the service and the cost  but customers always complain about such things .  we have no shortage of customers at whatever cost .  before the semaphore  news from genua took months to get here  now it takes less than a day .  it is affordable magic .  we are answerable to our shareholders  my lord .  not  with respect  to you .  it is not your business .  it is our business  and we will run it according to the market .  i hope there are no tyrannies here .  this is  with respect  a free city .         such a lot of respect is gratifying     said the patrician .     but the only choice your customers have is between you and nothing .         exactly     said reacher gilt calmly .     there is always a choice .  they can ride a horse a few thousand miles  or they can wait patiently until we can send their message .      vetinari gave him a smile that lasted as long as a lightning flash .      or fund and build another system     he said .     although i note that every other company that has lately tried to run a clacks system in opposition has failed quite quickly  sometimes in distressing circumstances .  falls from the tops of clacks towers  and so on .         accidents do happen .  it is most unfortunate     said mr .  slant stiffly .      most unfortunate     vetinari echoed .  he pulled the paper toward him  dislodging the files slightly  so that a few names were visible  and wrote    most unfortunate .         well  i believe that covers everything     he said .     in fact  the purpose of this meeting was to tell you formally that i am  at last  reopening the post office as planned .  this is just a courtesy announcement  but i felt i should let you know  because you are  after all  in the same business .  i believe the recent string of accidents is now at an        reacher gilt chuckled .     sorry  my lord .  did i understand you correctly .  you really intend to continue with this folly  in the face of everything .  the post office .  when we all know that it was a lumbering  smug  overstaffed  overweight monster of a place .  it barely earned its keep .  it was the very essence and exemplar of public enterprise .         it never made much of a profit  it is true  but in the business areas of this city there were seven deliveries a day     said vetinari  cold as the depths of the sea .      hah .  not at the end .     said mr .  horsefry .     it was bloody useless .         indeed .  a classic example of a corroded government organization dragging on the public purse     gilt added .      too true .     said mr .  horsefry .     they used to say that if you wanted to get rid of a dead body you should take it to the post office and it   d never be seen again .         and was it .     said lord vetinari  raising an eyebrow .      was what .         was it seen again .      there was a sudden hunted look in mr .  horsefry   s eyes .     what .  how would i know .         oh  i see     said lord vetinari .     it was a joke .  ah  well .     he shuffled the papers .     unfortunately  the post office came to be seen not as a system for moving the mail efficiently  to the benefit and profit of all  but as a moneybox .  and so it collapsed  losing both mail and money .  a lesson for us all  perhaps .  anyway  i have high hopes of mr .  lipwig  a young man full of fresh ideas .  a good head for heights  too  although i imagine he will not be climbing any towers .         i do hope this resurrection will not prove to be a drain on our taxes     said mr .  slant .      i assure you  mr .  slant  that apart from the modest sum necessary to  as it were  prime the pump  the postal service will be self supporting as  indeed  it used to be .  we cannot have a drag on the public purse  can we .  and now  gentlemen  i am conscious that i am keeping you from your very important business .  i do trust that the trunk will be back in commission very shortly .      as they stood up  reacher gilt leaned across the table and said     may i congratulate you  my lord .         i am delighted that you feel inclined to congratulate me on anything  mr .  gilt     said vetinari .     to what do we owe this unique occurrence .         this  my lord     said gilt  gesturing to the little side table on which had been set the rough hewn piece of stone .     is this not an original hnaflbaflsniflwhifltafl slab .  llamedos bluestone  isn   t it .  and the pieces look like basalt  which is the very devil to carve .  a valuable antique  i think .         it was a present to me from the low king of the dwarfs     said vetinari .     it is  indeed  very old .         and you have a game in progress  i see .  you   re playing the dwarf side  yes .         yes .  i play by clacks against an old friend in uberwald     said vetinari .     happily for me  your breakdown yesterday has given me an extra day to think of my next move .      their eyes met .  reacher gilt laughed hugely .  vetinari smiled .  the other men  who badly needed to laugh  laughed  too .  see  we   re all friends  we   re like colleagues really  nothing bad is going to happen .   the laughter died away  a little uneasily .  gilt and vetinari maintained smiles  maintained eye contact .      we should play a game     said gilt .     i have a rather nice board myself .  i play the troll side  for preference .         ruthless  initially outnumbered  inevitably defeated in the hands of the careless player .     said vetinari .      indeed .  just as the dwarfs rely on guile  feint  and swift changes of position .  a man can learn all of an opponent   s weaknesses on that board     said gilt .      really .     said vetinari  raising his eyebrows .     should he not be trying to learn his own .         oh  that   s just thud .  that   s easy .     yapped a voice .   both men turned to look at horsefry  who had been made perky by sheer relief .      i used to play it when i was a kid     he burbled .     it   s boring .  the dwarfs always win .      gilt and vetinari shared a look .  it said  while i loathe you and every aspect of your personal philosophy to a depth unplummable by any line  i   ll credit you at least with not being crispin horsefry .      appearances are deceptive  crispin     said gilt jovially .     a troll player need never lose  if he puts his mind to it .         i know i once got a dwarf stuck up my nose and mummy had to get it out with a hairpin     said horsefry  as if this was a source of immense pride .   gilt put his arm around the man   s shoulders .      that   s very interesting  crispin     he said .     do you think it   s likely to happen again .      vetinari stood at the window after they had left  watching the city below .  after a few minutes  drumknott drifted in .      there was a brief exchange in the anteroom  my lord     he said .   vetinari didn   t turn around but held up a hand .     let me see   i imagine one of them started saying something like    do you think he       and slant very quickly shushed him .  mr .  horsefry  i suspect .      drumknott glanced at the paper in his hand .      almost to the word  my lord .         it takes no great leap of the imagination     sighed lord vetinari .     dear dr .  slant .  he   s so   dependable .  sometimes i really think that if he was not already a zombie it would be necessary to have him turned into one .         shall i order a no .    investigation on mr .  gilt  my lord .         good heavens  no .  he is far too clever .  order it on mr .  horsefry .         really  sir .  but you did say yesterday that you believed him to be no more than a greedy fool .         a nervous fool  which is useful .  he   s a venal coward and a glutton .  i   ve watched him sit down to a meal of pot au feu with white beans  and that was an impressive sight  drumknott  which i will not easily forget .  the sauce went everywhere .  those pink shirts he wears cost more than a hundred dollars  too .  oh  he acquires other people   s money  in a safe and secret and not very clever way .  send   yes  send clerk brian .         brian  sir .     said drumknott .     are you sure .  he   s wonderful at devices  but quite inept on the street .  he   ll be seen .         yes  drumknott .  i know .  i would like mr .  horsefry to become a little   more nervous .         ah  i see  sir .      vetinari turned around .      tell me  drumknott     he said     would you say i   m a tyrant .         most certainly not  my lord     said drumknott  tidying the desk .      but of course that   s the problem  is it not .  who will tell the tyrant he is a tyrant .         that   s a tricky one  my lord  certainly     said drumknott  squaring up the files .      in his thoughts  which i have always considered to fare badly in translation  bouffant says that intervening in order to prevent a murder is to curtail the freedom of the murderer and yet that freedom  by definition  is natural and universal  without condition     said vetinari .     you may recall his famous dictum     if any man is not free  then i  too  am a small pie made of chicken     which has led to a considerable amount of debate .  thus we might consider  for example  that taking a bottle from a man killing himself with drink is a charitable  nay  praiseworthy act  and yet freedom is curtailed once more .  mr .  gilt has studied his bouffant but  i fear  failed to understand him .  freedom may be mankind   s natural state  but so is sitting in a tree eating your dinner while it is still wriggling .  on the other hand  freidegger  in modal contextities  claims that all freedom is limited  artificial  and therefore illusory  a shared hallucination at best .  no sane mortal is truly free  because true freedom is so terrible that only the mad or the divine can face it with open eyes .  it overwhelms the soul  very much like the state he elsewhere describes as vonallesvolkommenunverstandlichdasdaskeit .  what position would you take here  drumknott .         i   ve always thought  my lord  that what the world really needs are filing boxes which are not so flimsy     said drumknott  after a moment   s pause .      hmm     said lord vetinari .     a point to think about  certainly .      he stopped .  on the carved decorations over the room   s fireplace  a small cherub began to turn with a faint squeaking noise .  vetinari raised an eyebrow at drumknott .      i shall have a word with clerk brian immediately  my lord     said the clerk .      good .  tell him it   s time he got out into the fresh air more            chapter     a sign      dark clerks and dead postmasters      a werewolf in the watch     the wonderful pin      mr .  lipwig reads letters that are not there      hugo the hairdresser is surprised      mr .  parker buys fripperies     the nature of social  untruths     princess in the tower         a man is not dead while his name is still spoken .             now then  mr .  lipwig  what good will violence do .     mr .  pump rumbled .  he rocked on his huge feet as moist struggled in his grip .   groat and stanley were huddled at the far end of the locker room .  one of mr .  groat   s natural remedies was bubbling over onto the floor  where the boards were staining purple .      they were all accidents  mr .  lipwig .  all accidents .     groat babbled .     the watch was all over the place by the fourth one .  they were all accidents  they said .         oh  yes .     screamed moist .     four in five weeks  eh .  i bet that happens all the time around here .  ye gods  i   ve been done up good and brown .  i   m dead  right .  just not lying down yet .  vetinari .  there   s a man who knows how to save the price of a rope .  i   m done for .         you   ll feel better for a nice cup o    bismuth and brimstone tea  sir     groat quavered .     i   ve got the kettle boiling           a cup of tea is not going to be sufficient .     moist got a grip on himself  or at least began to act as if he had  and took a deep  theatrical breath .     okay  okay  mr .  pump  you can let go now .      the golem released his grip .  moist straightened up .      well  mr .  groat .     he said .      looks like you   re genuine after all  then     the old man said .     one of the dark clerks wouldn   t have gone bursar like that .  we thought you was one of his lordship   s special gentlemen  see .     groat fussed around the kettle .     no offense  but you   ve got a bit more color than the average pen pusher .         dark clerks .     said moist  and then recollection dawned .     oh   do you mean those stocky little men in black suits and bowler hats .         the very same .  scholarship boys at the assassins    guild  some of    em .  i heard that they can do some nasty things when they   ve a mind .         i thought you called them penpushers .         yeah  but i didn   t say where  heehee .     groat caught moist   s expression and coughed .     sorry  didn   t mean it  just my little joke .  we reckon the last new postmaster we had  mr .  whobblebury  he was a dark clerk .  can   t hardly blame him  with a name like that .  he was always snooping around .         and why do you think that was .     said moist .      well  mr .  mutable  he was the first  decent chap  he fell down into the big hall from the fifth floor  smack  sir  smack onto the marble .  head first .  it was a bit   splashy  sir .      moist glanced at stanley  who was starting to tremble .      then there was mr .  sideburn .  he fell down the back stairs and broke his neck  sir .  excuse me  sir  it   s       .     groat walked over to the door and opened it  tiddles walked through  groat shut the door again .     at three in the morning  it was .  right down five flights .  broke just about every bone you could break  sir .         you mean he was wandering around without a light .         dunno  sir .  but i know about the stairs .  the stairs have lamps burning all night  sir .  stanley fills them every day  regular as tiddles .         use those stairs a lot  then  do you .     said moist .      never  sir  except for the lamps .  nearly everywhere on that side is bunged up with mail .  but it   s a post office regulation  sir .         and the next man .     said moist  a little hoarsely .     another accidental fall .         oh  no  sir .  mr .  ignavia  that was his name .  they said it was his heart .  he was just lyin    dead on the fifth floor  dead as a doorknob  face all contorted like he   d seen a ghost .  natural causes  they said .  werrrl  the watch was all over the place by then  you may depend on it .  no one had been near him  they said  and there was not a mark on him .  surprised you didn   t know about all this  sir .  it was in the paper .     except you don   t get much chance to keep up with the news in a condemned cell  moist thought .      oh yes .     he said .     and how would they know no one had been near him .      groat leaned forward and lowered his voice conspiratorially .     everyone knows there   s a werewolf in the watch  and one of them could bloody nearly smell what color clothes someone was wearing .         a werewolf     said moist flatly .      yes .  anyway  the one before him           a werewolf .         that   s what i said  sir     said groat .      a damn werewolf .         takes all sorts to make a world  sir .  anyway           a werewolf .     moist awoke from the horror .     and they don   t tell visitors .         now  how   d they do that  sir .     said groat in a kindly voice .     put it on a sign outside .     welcome to ankh morpork  we have a werewolf     sir .  the watch   s got loads of dwarfs and trolls and a golem   a free golem  savin    your presence  mr .  pump   and a couple of gnomes and a zombie   even a nobbs .         nobbs .  what   s a nobbs .         corporal nobby nobbs  sir .  not met him yet .  they say he   s got an official chitty saying he   s human  and who needs one of those  eh .  fortunately there   s only one of him  so he can   t breed .  anyway  we   ve got a bit of everything  sir .  very cosmopolitan .  you don   t like werewolves .      they know who you are by your smell  thought moist .  they   re as bright as a human and can track you better than any wolf .  they can follow a trail that   s days old  even if you cover yourself with scent   especially if you cover yourself with scent .  oh  there   re ways around  if you know there is going to be a werewolf on your tail .  no wonder they caught up with me .  there should be a law .      not a lot     he said aloud  and glanced at stanley again .  it was useful to watch stanley when groat was talking .  now the boy had his eyes turned up so much that they were practically all whites .      and mr .  whobblebury .     he said .     he was investigating for vetinari  eh .  what happened to him .      stanley was shaking like a bush in a high wind .      er  you did get given the big key ring  sir .     groat inquired  his voice trembling with innocence .      yes  of course .         i bet there is one key missing     said groat .     the watch took it .  it was the only one .  some doors ought to stay closed  sir .  it   s all over and done with  sir .  mr .  whobblebury died of an industrial accident  they said .  nobody near him .  you don   t want to go there  sir .  sometimes things get so broke it   s best to walk away  sir .         i can   t     said moist .     i am the postmaster general .  and this is my building  isn   t it .  i   ll decide where i go  junior postman groat .      stanley shut his eyes .      yes  sir     said groat  as if talking to a child .     but you don   t want to go there  sir .         his head was all over the wall .     stanley quavered .      oh dear  now you   ve set him off  sir     said groat  scuttling across to the boy .     it   s all right  lad  i   ll just get you your pills           what   s the most expensive pin ever made commercially  stanley .     said moist quickly .   it was like pulling a lever .  stanley   s expression went from agonized grief to scholarly cogitation in an instant .      commercially .  leaving aside those special pins made for exhibitions and trade shows  including the great pin of       then probably it is the no .    broad headed    chicken    extra longs made for the lace making market by the noted pinner josiah doldrum  i would say .  they were hand drawn and had his trademark silver head with a microscopic engraving of a cockerel .  it   s believed that fewer than a hundred were made before his death  sir .  according to hubert spider   s pin catalogue  examples can fetch between fifty and sixty five dollars  depending on condition .  a no .    broad headed extra long would grace any true pinhead   s collection .         only   i spotted this in the street     said moist  extracting one of that morning   s purchases from his lapel .     i was walking down market street and there it was  between two cobblestones .  i thought it looked unusual .  for a pin .      stanley pushed away the fussing groat and carefully took the pin from moist   s fingers .  a very large magnifying glass appeared as if by magic in his other hand .   the room held its breath as the pin was subjected to serious scrutiny .  then stanley looked up at moist in amazement .      you knew .     he said .     and you spotted this in the street .  i thought you didn   t know anything about pins .         oh  not really  but i dabbled a bit as a boy     said moist  waving a hand deprecatingly to suggest that he had been too foolish to turn a schoolboy hobby into a lifetime   s obsession .     you know   a few of the old brass imperials  one or two oddities  like an unbroken pair or a double header  the occasional cheap packet of mixed pins on approval       thank the gods  he thought  for the skill of speed reading .      oh  there   s never anything worthwhile in those     said stanley  and slid again into the voice of the academic     while most    pinheads    do indeed begin with a casually acquired flashy novelty pin  followed by the contents of their grandmothers    pincushion  haha  the path to a truly worthwhile collection lies not in the simple disbursement of money in the nearest pin emporium  oh no .  any dilettante can become    kingpin    with enough expenditure  but for the true    pinhead    the real pleasure is in the joy of the chase  the pin fairs  the house clearances  and  who knows  a casual glint in the gutter that turns out to be a well preserved doublefast or an unbroken two pointer .  well is it said     see a pin and pick it up  and all day long you   ll have a pin .         moist nearly applauded .  it was word for word what j .  lanugo owlsbury had written in the introduction to his work .  and  much more important  he now had an unshakable friend in stanley .  that was to say  his darker regions added  stanley was friends with him .  the boy  all panic subsumed by the joy of pins  was holding the pin up to the light .      magnificent     he breathed  all terrors fled .     clean as a new pin .  i have a place ready and waiting for this in my pin folder  sir .         yes  i thought you might .      his head was all over the wall     somewhere there was a locked door  and moist didn   t have the key .  four of his predecessors had predeceased in this very building .  and there was no escape .  being postmaster general was a job for life   one way or the other .  that was why vetinari had put him here .  he needed a man who couldn   t walk away  and who was incidentally completely expendable .  it didn   t matter if moist von lipwig died .  he was already dead .   and then he tried not to think about mr .  pump .   how many other golems had worked their way to freedom in the service of the city .  had there been a mr .  saw  fresh from a hundred years in a pit of sawdust .  or mr .  shovel .  mr .  axe  maybe .   and had there been one here when the last poor guy had found the key or a good lockpick  and was about to open it when behind him someone called maybe mr .  hammer  yes  oh gods  yes  raised his first for one sudden  terminal blow .   no one had been near him .  but they weren   t people  were they   they were tools .  it   d be an industrial accident .   his head was all over the wall     i   m going to find out about this .  i have to  otherwise it   ll lie in wait for me .  and everyone will tell me lies .  but i am the fibbermeister .      hmm .     he said  aware that he   d missed something .      i said  could i go and put this in my collection  postmaster .     said stanley .      what .  oh .  yes .  fine .  yes .  give it a really good polish  too .      as the boy gangled off to his end of the locker room   and he did gangle   moist caught groat looking at him shrewdly .      well done  mr .  lipwig     he said .     well done .         thank you  mr .  groat .         good eyesight you   ve got there     the old man went on .      well  the light was shining off it           nah  i meant to see cobbles in market street  it being all brick paving up there .      moist returned his blank stare with one ever blanker .      bricks  cobbles  who cares .     he said .      yeah  right .  not important  really     said groat .      and now     said moist  feeling the need for some fresh air     there   s a little errand i have to run .  i   d like you to come with me  mr .  groat .  can you find a crowbar anywhere .  bring it  please .  and i   ll need you  too  mr .  pump .      werewolves and golems  golems and werewolves  moist thought .  i   m stuck here .  i might as well take it seriously .   i will show them a sign .         there   s a little habit i have     said moist  as he led the way through the streets .     it   s to do with signs .         signs  sir .     said groat  trying to keep close to the walls .      yes  junior postman groat  signs     said moist  noticing the way the man winced at    junior .        particularly signs with missing letters .  when i see one  i automatically read what the missing letters say .         and how can you do that  sir  when they   re missing .     said groat .   ah  so there   s a clue as to why you   re still sitting in a rundown old building making tea from rocks and weeds all day  moist thought .  aloud he said     it   s a knack .  now  i could be wrong  of course  but   ah  we turn left here        this was quite a busy street  and the shop was in front of them .  it was everything that moist had hoped .      voil       he said and  remembering his audience  he added     that is to say  there we have it .         it   s a barber   s shop     said groat uncertainly .     for ladies .         ah  you   re a man of the world  tolliver  there   s no fooling you     said moist .     and the name over the window  in those large  blue green letters  is    .         hugos     said groat .     and .         yes  hugo   s     said moist .     no apostrophe present  in fact  and the reason for this is   you could work with me a little here  perhaps    .         er       groat stared frantically at the letters  defying them to reveal their meaning .      close enough     said moist .     there is no apostrophe there because there was and is no apostrophe on the uplifting slogan that adorns our beloved post office  mr .  groat .     he waited for light to dawn .     those big metal letters were stolen from our facade  mr .  groat .  i mean  the front of the building .  they   re the reason for glom of nit  mr .  groat .      it took a little time for mr .  groat   s mental sunrise to take place  but moist was ready when it did .      no  no  no .     he said  grabbing the old man   s greasy collar as he lurched forward  and almost pulling groat off his feet .     that   s not how we deal with this  is it .         that   s post office property .  that   s worse   n stealing  that is .  that   s treason .     groat yelled .      quite so     said moist .     mr .  pump  if you would just hold on to our friend here  i will go and   discuss the matter .     moist handed over the furious junior postman and brushed himself off .  he looked a bit rumpled but it would have to do .      what are you going to do  then .     said groat .   moist smiled his sunshine smile .     something i   m good at  mr .  groat .  i   m going to talk to people .      moist crossed the road and opened the shop door .  the bell jangled .   inside the hairdresser   s shop was an array of little booths  and the air smelled sweet and cloying and  somehow  pink  right by the door was a little desk with a big  open diary .  there were lots of flowers around  and the young woman at the desk gave him a haughty look that was going to cost her employer a lot of money .  she was waiting for him to speak .   moist put on a grave expression  leaned down  and said in a voice that had all the characteristics of a whisper but also seemed to be able to carry quite a long way     can i see mr .  hugo  please .  it is very important .         on what business would that be .         well   it   s a little delicate       said moist .  he could see the tops of permed heads turning .     but you can tell him it   s good news .         well  if it   s good news           tell him i think i can persuade lord vetinari that this can be settled without charges being brought .  probably     said moist  lowering his voice just enough to increase the curiosity of the customers while not so much as to be inaudible .   the woman stared at him in horror .      you can .  er       she groped for an ornate speaking tube  but moist took it gently from her hand  whistled expertly down it  lifted it to his ear  and flashed her a smile .      thank you     he said .  for what did not matter  smile  say the right kind of words in the right kind of voice  and always  always radiate confidence like a supernova .   a voice in his ear  faint as a spider trapped in a matchbox  said     scitich wabble nabnab .         hugo .     said moist .     it   s good of you to make time for me .  it   s moist  moist von lipwig .  postmaster general .     he glanced at the speaking tube .  it disappeared into the ceiling .     so kind of you to assist us  hugo .  it   s these missing letters .  five missing letters  to be exact .         scrik .  shabadatwik .  scritch vit bottofix .         don   t really carry that kind of thing  hugo  but if you   d care to look out of your window you   ll see my personal assistant  mr .  pump .  he   s standing on the other side of the street .      and he   s eight feet tall and carrying a huge crowbar  moist added mentally .  he winked at the lady sitting at the desk  who was watching him in a kind of awe .  you had to keep people skills polished at all times .   he heard the muffled expletive through the floor .  via the speaking tube it became    vugrs nickbibble .         yes     said moist     perhaps i should come up and speak to you directly           ten minutes later moist crossed the road with care and smiled at his staff .     mr .  pump  if you would be so good as to step over there and pry out our letters  please .     he said .     try not to damage anything .  mr .  hugo has been very cooperative .  and tolliver  you   ve lived here a long time  haven   t you .  you   ll know where to hire men with ropes  steeplejacks  that sort of thing .  i want those letters back on our building by midday  okay .         that   ll cost a lot of money  mr .  lipwig     said groat  staring at him in amazement .  moist pulled a bag out of his pocket and jingled it .      one hundred dollars should more than cover it     he said .     mr .  hugo was very apologetic and very  very inclined to be helpful .  says he bought them years ago off a man in a pub and is only too happy to pay for them to be returned .  it   s amazing how nice people can be  if approached in the right way .      there was a clang from the other side of the street .  mr .  pump had already removed the h  without any apparent effort .   speak softly and employ a huge man with a crowbar  thought moist .  this might be bearable after all .      the weak sunlight glinted on the s as it was swung into position .  there was quite a crowd .  people in ankh morpork always paid attention to people on rooftops  in case there was a chance of an interesting suicide .  there was a cheer  just on general principles  when the last letter was hammered back into place .   four dead men  moist thought  looking up at the roof .  i wonder if the watch would talk to me .  do they know about me .  do they think i   m dead .  do i want to speak to policemen .  no .  damn .  the only way i can get out of this is by running forward  not going back .  bloody  bloody vetinari  he thought .  but there   s a way to win .   he could make money .   he was part of the government  wasn   t he .  governments took money off people .  that   s what they were for .   he had people skills  didn   t he .  he could persuade people that brass was gold that had got a bit tarnished  that glass was diamond  that tomorrow there was going to be free beer .   he   d outfox them all .  he wouldn   t try to escape  not yet .  if a golem could buy its freedom  then so could he .  he   d buckle down and bustle and look busy and he   d send all the bills to vetinari  because this was government work .  how could the man object .   and if moist von lipwig couldn   t cream a little somethi   a big something off the top  and the bottom  and maybe a little off the sides  then he didn   t deserve to .  and then  when it was all going well and the cash was rolling in   well  then there   d be time to make plans for the big one .  enough money bought a lot of men with sledgehammers .   the workmen pulled themselves back onto the flat roof .  there was another ragged cheer from a crowd that reckoned it hadn   t been bad entertainment even if no one had fallen off .      what do you think  mr .  groat .     he said .      looks nice  sir  looks nice     said groat  as the crowd dispersed and they walked back to the post office building .      not disturbing anything  then .     said moist .   groat patted the surprised moist on the arm .     i don   t know why his lordship sent you  sir  really i don   t     he whispered .     you mean well  i can see .  but take my advice  sir  and get out of here .      moist glanced toward the building   s doors .  mr .  pump was standing beside them .  just standing  with his arms hanging down .  the fire in his eyes was a banked glow .      i can   t do that     he said .      nice of you to say so  sir  but this place isn   t for a young man with a future     said groat .     now  stanley  he   s all right if he   s got his pins  but you  sir  you could go far .         no o  i don   t think i can     said moist .     honestly .  my place  mr .  groat  is here .         gods bless you for saying that  sir  gods bless you     said groat .  tears were beginning to roll down his face .      we used to be heroes     he said .     people wanted us .  everyone watched out for us .  everyone knew us .  this was a great place  once .  once  we were postmen .         mister .      moist turned .  three people were hurrying toward him  and he had to quell an automatic urge to turn and run  especially when one of them shouted     yes  that   s him .      he recognized the greengrocer from this morning .  an elderly couple were trailing behind him .  the older man  who had the determined face and upright bearing of one who subdued cabbages daily  stopped an inch in front of moist and bellowed     are you the po   stman  young man .         yes  sir  i suppose i am     said moist .     how can i           you delivered me this    letter from aggie here .  i   m antimony parker .     the man roared .     now  there   s s   ome people   d say it wa   s a little bit on the late side .         oh     said moist .     well  i           that took a bit of nerve  young man .         i   m very sorry that       moist began .  people skills weren   t much good in the face of mr .  parker .  he was one of the impervious people  whose grasp of volume control was about as good as his understanding of personal space .      s   orry .     parker shouted .     what   ve you got to be s   orry about .  not your fault  lad .  you weren   t even born .  more fool me for thinking she didn   t care  eh .  hah  i wa   s so downhearted  lad  i went right out and joined the       his red face wrinkled .     you know   camel   s  funny hat   s  sand  where you go to forget           the klatchian foreign legion .     said moist .      that wa   s it .  and when i came back i met sadie  and aggie had met her frederick  and we both got    settled and forgot the other one was alive and then blow me down if this letter didn   t arrive from aggie .  me and my lad have s   pent half the morning tracking her down .  and to cut a long s   tory short  lad  we   re getting married sat   day .     co   s of you  boy .      mr .  parker was one of those men who turned into teak with age .  when he slapped moist on the back it was like being hit with a chair .      won   t frederick and sadie object       moist wheezed .      i doubt it .  frederick pas   sed away ten years ago and sadie   s been buried up in s   mall god   s for the last five .     mr .  parker bellowed cheerfully .     and we were s   orry to see them go but  as aggie say   s  it was all meant to be and you wa   s sent by a higher power .  and i say it took a man with real backbone to come and deliver that letter after all thi   s time .  there   s many that would have tos   sed it aside like it was of no account .  you   d do me and the future second mrs .  parker a great favor if you wa   s to be a guest of honor at our wedding  and i for one won   t take no for an ans   wer .  i   m grandma   ster of the guild of merchant   s this year  too .  we might not be pos   h like the assassins of the alchemists but there   s a lot of u   s and i shall put in a word on your behalf  you can depend on that .  my lad george here will be down later on with the invitation   s for you to deliver  now you   re back in busines   s .  it will be a great honor for me  my boy  if you would s   hake me by the hand        he thrust out a huge hand .  moist took it  and old habits died hard .  firm grip  steady gaze        ah  you   re an honest man  all right     said parker .     i   m never mis   taken .     he clapped his hand on moist   s shoulder  causing a knee joint to crunch .     what   s your name  lad .         lipwig  sir .  moist von lipwig     moist said .  he was afraid he   d gone deaf in one ear .      a von  eh     said parker .     well  you   re doing damn well for a foreigner  and i don   t care who know   s it .  got to be going now  aggie want   s to buy fripperie   s .      the woman came up to moist  stood on tiptoe  and kissed him on the cheek .      and i know a good man when i see one     she said .     do you have a young lady .         what .  no .  not at all .  er   no .     said moist .      i   m sure you shall     she said  smiling sweetly .     and while we   re very grateful to you  i would advise you to propose in person .  we do so much look forward to seeing you on saturday .      moist watched her scurry away after her long lost swain .      you delivered a letter .     said groat  horrified .      yes  mr .  groat .  i didn   t mean to  but i just happened to be           you took one of the old letters and you delivered it .     said groat  as if the concept was something he could not fit into his head     his head was all over the wall     moist blinked .      we are supposed to deliver the mail  man .  that   s our job .  remember .         you delivered a letter       breathed groat .     what was the date on it .         i can   t remember .  more than forty years ago .         what was it like .  was it in good condition .     groat insisted .   moist glared at the little postman .  a small crowd was forming around them  as was the ankh morpork way .      it was a forty year old letter in a cheap envelope .     he snarled .     and that   s what it looked like .  it never got delivered and it upset the lives of two people .  i delivered it and it   s made two people very happy .  what is the problem  mr .  groat    yes  what is it .      this was to a woman who was tugging at this sleeve .      i said is it true you   re opening the old place again .     she repeated .     my grandad used to work there .         well done him     said moist .      he said there was a curse .     said the woman  as if the idea was rather pleasing .      really .     said moist .     well  i could do with a good curse right now  as a matter of fact .         it lives under the floor and drives you maaad .     she went on  enjoying the syllable so much that she seemed loath to let it go .     maaad .         really     said moist .     well  we do not believe in going crazy in the postal service  do we  mr .  gro       he stopped .  mr .  groat had the expression of one who did believe in going crazy .      you daft old woman .     groat yelled .     what did you have to tell him that for .         mr .  groat .     snapped moist .     i wish to speak to you inside .      he grabbed the old man by the shoulder and very nearly carried him through the amused crowd  dragged him into the building and slammed the door .      i   ve had enough of this .     he said .     enough of dark comments and mutterings  do you understand .  what   s going on here .  what went on here .  you tell me right now or        the little man   s eyes were full of fear .  this is not me  moist thought .  this is not the way .  people skills  eh .      you tell me right now  senior postman groat .     he snapped .   the old man   s eyes widened .     senior postman .         i am the postmaster in this vicinity  yes .     said moist .     that means i can promote  yes .  senior postman  indeed .  on probation  of course .  now  will you tell me what           don   t you hurt mr .  groat  sir .     said a ringing voice behind moist .   groat looked past moist into the gloom and said     it   s all right  stanley  there   s no need for that  we don   t want a little moment .     to moist he whispered     best you put me down gently  sir        moist did so  with exaggerated care  and turned around .   the boy was standing behind him with a glazed look on his face and the big kettle raised .      you mustn   t hurt mr .  groat  sir     he said hoarsely .   moist pulled a pin out of his lapel .     of course not  stanley .  by the way  is this a genuine clayfeather medium sharp .      stanley dropped the kettle  suddenly oblivious to everything but the inch of silvery steel between moist   s fingers .  one hand was already pulling out his magnifying glass .      let me see  let me see     he said in a level  thoughtful voice .     oh  yes .  ha .  no  sorry .  it   s an easy mistake to make .  look at the marks on the shoulder  here .  see .  and the head was never coiled .  this is machine made .  probably by one of the happily brothers .  short run  i imagine .  hasn   t got their sigil  though .  could have been done by a creative apprentice .  not worth much  i   m afraid  unless you find someone who specializes in the minutia of the happily pinnery .         i   ll  er  just make a cup of tea  shall i .     said groat  picking up the kettle as it rolled backwards and forwards on the floor .     well done again  mr .  moist .  er   senior postman groat  right .         off you go with  yes  probationary senior postman groat  stanley     said moist as kindly as he could manage .  he looked up and added sharply     i just want to talk to mr .  pump here .      stanley looked around at the golem  who was right behind him .  it was astonishing how quietly a golem could move  he   d crossed the floor like a shadow and now stood with one still fist raised like the wrath of gods .      oh  i didn   t see you standing there  mr .  pump     said stanley cheerfully .     why is your hand up .      the holes in the golem   s face bathed the boy in red light .      i   wanted to ask the postmaster a question .     said the golem slowly .      oh .  all right     said stanley  as if he hadn   t been about to brain moist a moment before .     do you want your pin back  mr .  moist .     he added  and when moist waved him away he went on     all right  i   ll put it in next month   s charity pin auction .      when the door had shut behind him  moist looked up at the golem   s impassive face .      you lied to him .  are you allowed to lie  mr .  pump .     he said .     and you can lower that arm  by the way .         i have been instructed as to the nature of social untruths  yes .         you were going to smash his brains out .     said moist .      i would have endeavored not to     the golem rumbled .     however  i cannot allow you to come to inappropriate harm .  it was a heavy kettle .         you can   t do that  you idiot .     said moist  who   d noticed the use of    inappropriate .         i should have let him kill you .     said the golem .     it would not have been his fault .  his head is not right .         it   d be even less right if you walloped it .  look  i sorted it out .         yes     pump said .     you have a talent .  it is a pity you misuse it .         do you understand anything i   m saying .     shouted moist .     you can   t just go around killing people .         why not .  you do .     the golem lowered his arm .      what .     moist .     i do not .  who told you that .         i worked it out .  you have killed two point three three eight people     said the golem calmly .      i have never laid a finger on anyone in my life  mr .  pump .  i may be   all the things you know i am  but i am not a killer .  i have never so much as drawn a sword .         no  you have not .  but you have stolen  embezzled  defrauded  and swindled without discrimination  mr .  lipvig .  you have ruined businesses and destroyed jobs .  when banks fail  it is seldom bankers who starve .  your actions have taken money from those who had little enough to begin with .  in a myriad small ways you have hastened the deaths of many .  you did not know them .  you did not see them bleed .  but you snatched bread from their mouths and tore clothes from their backs .  for sport  mr .  lipvig .  for sport .  for the joy of the game .      moist   s mouth had dropped open .  it shut .  it opened again .  it shut again .  you can never find repartee when you need it .      you   re nothing but a walking flowerpot  pump        he snapped .     where did that come from .         i have read the details of your many crimes  mr .  lipvig .  and pumping water teaches one the value of rational thought .  you took from others because you were clever and they were stupid .         hold on  most of the time they thought they were swindling me .         you set out to trap them  mr .  lipvig     said mr .  pump .   moist went to prod the golem meaningfully  but decided against it just in time .  a man could break a finger that way .      well  think about this     he said .     i   m paying for all that .  i was nearly hanged  godsdamit .         yes .  but even now you harbor thoughts of escape  of somehow turning the situation to your advantage .  they say the leopard does not change his shorts .         but you have to obey my orders  yes .     snarled moist .      yes .         then screw your damn head off .      for a moment the red eyes flickered .  when pump spoke next  it was in the voice of lord vetinari     ah  lipwig .  despite everything  you do not pay attention .  mr .  pump cannot be instructed to destroy himself .  i would have thought you at least could have worked this out .  if you instruct him to do so again  punitive action will be taken .      the golem blinked again .      how did you       moist began .      i have perfect recall of legal verbal instructions     said the golem in his normal rumbling tone .     i surmise that lord vetinari  mindful of your way of thinking  left that message because           i meant the voice .         perfect recall  mr .  lipvig     pump replied .     i can speak with all the voices of men .         really .  how nice for you .     moist stared up at mr .  pump .  there was never any animation in that face .  there was a nose  of sorts  but it was just a lump in the clay .  the mouth moved when he spoke  and the gods knew how baked clay could move like that   indeed  they probably did know .  the eyes never closed  they merely dimmed .      can you really read my thoughts .     he said .      no  i merely extrapolate from past behavior .         well       moist said  once again stuck for words .  he glared up at the expressionless face that nevertheless contrived to be disapproving .  he was used to looks of anger  indignation  and hatred .  they were part of the job .  but what was a golem .  just   dirt .  fired earth .  people looking at you as though you were less than the dust beneath their feet was one thing  but it was strangely unpleasant when even the dust did that  too .         don   t     he finished lamely .     go and   work .  yes .  go on .  that   s what you do .  that   s what you   re for .         it was called the lucky clacks tower  tower     .  it was close enough to the town of bonk for a man to be able to go and get a hot bath and a good bed on his days off  but since this was uberwald there wasn   t too much local traffic and   this was important   it was way  way up in the mountains and management didn   t like to go that far .  in the good old days of last year  when the hour of the dead took place every night  it was a happy tower  because both the up line and the down line got the hour at the same time  so there was an extra pair of hands for maintenance .  now tower     did maintenance on the fly or not at all  just like all the others  but it was still  proverbially  a good tower to man .   mostly man  anyway .  back down on the plains it was a standing joke that     was staffed by vampires and werewolves .  in fact  like a lot of towers  it was often manned by kids .   everyone knew it happened .  actually  the new management probably didn   t  but wouldn   t have done anything about it if they found out  apart from carefully forgetting that they   d known .  kids didn   t need to be paid .   the   mostly   young men on the towers worked hard in all weather for just enough money .  they were loners  hard dreamers  fugitives from the law that the law had forgotten  or just from everybody else .  they had a special kind of directed madness  they said the rattle of the clacks got into your head and your thoughts beat time with it  so sooner or later you could tell what messages were going through by listening to the rattle of the shutters .  in their towers  they drank hot tea out of strange tin mugs  much wider at the bottom  so that they didn   t fall over when gales banged into the tower .  on leave  they drank alcohol out of anything .  and they talked a gibberish of their own  of donkey and nondonkey  system overhead and packet space  of drumming it and hotfooting  of a      which was good  or flock  which was bad  or totally flocked  really not good at all  and plug code and hog code and jacquard     and they liked kids  who reminded them of the ones they left behind or would never have  and kids loved the towers .  they   d come and hang around and do odd jobs and maybe pick up the craft of semaphore just by watching .   they tended to be bright  they mastered the keyboard and levers as if by magic  they usually had good eyesight  and what they were doing  most of them  was running away from home without actually leaving .   because  up on the towers  you might believe you could see to the rim of the world .  you could certainly see several other towers  on a good  clear day .  you pretended that you  too  could read messages by listening to the rattle of the shutters  while under your fingers flowed the names of faraway places you   d never see but  on the tower  were somehow connected to     she was known as princess to the men on tower      although she was really alice .  she was thirteen  could run a line for hours on end without needing help  and later on had an interesting career which   but anyway  she remembered this one conversation  on this day  because it was strange .   not all the signals were messages .  some were instructions to towers .  some  as you operated your levers to follow the distant signal  made things happen in your own tower .  princess knew all about this .  a lot of what traveled on the grand trunk was called the overhead .  it was instructions to towers  reports  messages about messages  even chatter between operators  although this was strictly forbidden these days .  it was all in code .  it was very rare you got plain in the overhead .  but now      there it goes again     she said .     it must be wrong .  it   s got no origin code and no address .  it   s overhead  but it   s in plain .      on the other side of the tower  sitting in a seat facing the opposite direction  because he was operating the upline  was roger  who was seventeen and already working for his tower master certificate .   his hand didn   t stop moving as he said     what did it say .         there was gnu  and i know that   s a code  and then just a name .  it was john dearheart .  was it a           you sent it on .     said grandad .  grandad had been hunched in the corner  repairing a shutter box in this cramped shed halfway up the tower .  grandad was the tower master and had been everywhere and knew everything .  everyone called him grandad .  he was twenty six .  he was always doing something in the tower when she was working the line  even though there was always a boy in the other chair .  she didn   t work out why until later .      yes  because it was a g code     said princess .      then you did right .  don   t worry about it .         yes  but i   ve sent that name before .  several times .  up line and down line .  just a name  no message or anything .      she had a sense that something was wrong  but she went on     i know a u at the end means it has to be turned around at the end of the line  and an n means not logged .     this was showing off  but she   d spent hours reading the cypher book .     so it   s just a name  going up and down all the time .  where   s the sense in that .      something was really wrong .  roger was still working his line  but he was staring ahead with a thunderous expression .   then grandad said     very clever  princess .  you   re dead right .         hah .     said roger .      i   m sorry if i did something wrong     said the girl meekly .     i just thought it was strange .  who   s john dearheart .         he   fell off a tower     said grandad .      hah .     said roger  working his shutters as if he suddenly hated them .      he   s dead .     said princess .      well  some people say       roger began .      roger .     snapped grandad .  it sounded like a warning .      i know about sending home     said princess .     and i know the souls of dead linesmen stay on the trunk .         who told you that .     said grandad .   princess was bright enough to know that someone would get into trouble if she was too specific .      oh  i just heard it     she said airily .     somewhere .         someone was trying to scare you     said grandad  looking at roger   s reddening ears .   it hadn   t sounded scary to princess .  if you had to be dead  it seemed a lot better to spend your time flying between the towers than lying underground .  but she was bright enough  too  to know when to drop a subject .   it was grandad who spoke next  after a long pause broken only by the squeaking of the new shutter bars .  when he did speak  it was as if something was on his mind .      we keep that name moving in the overhead     he said  and it seemed to princess that the wind in the shutter arrays above her blew more forlornly  and the everlasting clicking of the shutters grew more urgent .     he   d never have wanted to go home .  he was a real linesman .  his name is in the code  in the wind  in the rigging  and the shutters .  haven   t you ever heard the saying    man   s not dead while his name is still spoken    .          chapter     lost in the post      in which stanley experiences the joy of sacks      mr .  groat   s ancestral fears     horsefry is worried      reacher gilt  a man of society     the stairway of letters      mailslide .      mr .  lipwig sees it     hoodwinked      the postman   s walk     the hat      stanley polished his pins .  he did so with a look of beatific concentration  like a man dreaming with his eyes open .   the collection sparkled on the folded strips of brown paper and the rolls of black felt that made up the landscape of the true pinhead   s world .  beside him was his large desktop magnifying glass and  by his feet  a sack of miscellaneous pins bought last week from a retiring needlewoman .   he was putting off the moment of opening it  to savor it all the more .  of course  it   d almost certainly turn out to be full of everyday brassers  with maybe the occasional flathead or line flaw  but the thing was  you never knew .  that was the joy of sacks .  you never knew .  noncollectors were woefully unconcerned about pins  treating them as if they were no more that thin  pointy bits of metal for sticking things to other things .  many a wonderful pin of great worth had been found in a sack of brassers .   and now he had a no .    broad headed    chicken    extra long  thanks to kind mr .  lipwig .  the world shone like the pins so neatly ranged on the felt rolled out in front of him .  he might smell faintly of cheese  and have athlete   s foot extending to the knee  but just now stanley soared through glittering skies on wings of silver .   groat sat by the stove  chewing his fingernails and muttering to himself .  stanley paid no attention  since pins were not the subject .         appointed  right .  never mind what the order says .  he can promote anyone  right .  that means i get the extra gold button on m   sleeve and the pay  right .  none of the others called me senior postman .  and when all   s said and done  he delivered a letter .  had the letter  saw the address  delivered it  just like that .  maybe he has got postman   s blood .  and he got them metal letters put back .  letters again  see .  that   s a sign  sure enough .  hah  he can read words that ain   t there .     groat spat out a fragment of fingernail  and frowned .     but   then he   ll want to know about the new pie .  oh yeah .  but   it   d be like scratching at a scab .  could be bad .  very bad .  but   hah  the way he got them letters back for us   very good .  maybe it   s true that one day we   ll get a true postmaster again  just like they say .     yea  he will tread the abandoned roller skates beneath his boots  and lo .  the dogs of the world will break their teeth upon him .     and he did show us a sign  right .  okay  it was over a posh haircut shop for ladies  but it was a sign  you can   t argue with that .  i mean  if it was obvious  anyone could show it to us .     another sliver of fingernail hit the side of the glowing stove  where it sizzled .     and i ain   t getting any younger  that   s a fact .  probationary  though  that   s not good  that   s not good .  what   d happen if i popped my clogs tomorrow  eh .  i   d stand there before my forefathers  and they   d say     art thou senior postal inspector groat .     and i   d say no  and they   d say     art thou then postal inspector groat .     and i   d say not as such  and they   d say     then surely thou art senior postman groat .     and i   d say not in point of fact  and they   d say     stone the crows  tolliver  are you telling us you never got further than junior postman  what kind of groat are you .     and my face will be red and i will be knee deep in the ignominy .  dun   t matter that i   ve been runnin    this place for years  oh no .  you got to have that gold button .      he stared at the fire  and somewhere in his matted beard a smile struggled to get out .      he can try walking the walk     he said .     no one can argue if he walks the walk .  an    then i can tell him everything .  so it   ll be all right .  an    if he don   t walk to the end  then he ain   t postmaster material anyway .  stanley .  stanley .      stanley awoke from a dream of pins .      yes  mr .  groat .         got a few errands for you to run  lad .     and if he ain   t postmaster material  groat added in the privacy of his creaking brain  i   ll die a junior postman        it was hard to knock at a door while trying desperately not to make a sound  and in the end crispin horsefry gave up on the second aim and just swung on the doorknocker .   the sound echoed through the empty street  but no one came to the window .  no one in this select street would have come to the window even if a murder was going on .  at least in the poorer districts people would have come out to watch  or join in .   the door opened .      good evening  thur        horsefry pushed past the stumpy figure and into the dark hallway  waving frantically to the servant to close the door .      shut it  man  shut it .  i may have been followed   good grief  you   re an igor aren   t you .  gilt can afford an igor .         well done  thur .     said the igor .  he peered out into the early evening darkness .     all clear  thur .         shut the door  for gods    sakes .     moaned horsefry .     i must see mr .  gilt .         the marthter isth having one of hith little thoireeth  thur     said igor .     i will thee if he can be dithturbed .         are any of the others here .  have they   what   s a thwawreath .         a little get together  thur     said igor  sniffing .  the man reeked of drink .      a soiree .         exactly tho  thur     said igor impassively .     may i take your highly notitheable  long  hooded cloak  thur .  and be tho kind ath to follow me into the withdrawing room        and suddenly horsefry was alone in a big room full of shadows and candlelight and staring eyes  with the door closing behind him .   the eyes belonged to the portraits in the big  dusty frames that filled the walls  edge to edge .  rumor was that gilt had bought them outright  and not only the pictures  it was said that he bought all the rights in the long dead as well  deed polled their names  and thus equipped himself with a proud pedigree overnight .  that was slightly worrying  even for horsefry  everyone lied about their ancestors  and that was fair enough .  buying them was slightly disconcerting  but this dark  original stylishness was so very reacher gilt .   a lot of rumors had begun concerning reacher gilt  just as soon as people had noticed him and started asking     who is reacher gilt .  what kind of a name is reacher  anyway .     he threw big parties  that was certain .  they were the kind of parties that entered urban mythology  was it true about the chopped liver .  were you there .  what about the time when he brought in a troll stripper and three people jumped out of the window .  were you there .  and that story about the bowl of sweets .  were you there .  did you see it .  was is true .  were you there .   .  half of ankh morpork had been  apparently  drifting from table to buffet to dance floor to gaming tables  every guest seemingly followed by a silent and obliging waiter with a laden drinks tray .  some said he owned a gold mine  others swore that he was a pirate .  and he certainly looked like a pirate  with his long  curly black hair  pointed beard  and eyepatch .  he was even said to have a parrot .  certainly the piracy rumor might explain the apparently bottomless fortune and the fact that no one  absolutely no one  knew anything about him prior to his arrival in the city .  perhaps he   d sold his past  people joked  just like he   d bought himself a new one .   he was certainly piratical in his business dealings  horsefry knew .  some of the things        twelve and a half percent .  twelve and a half percent .      when he was sure that he hadn   t in fact had the heart attack he had been expecting all day  horsefry crossed the room  swaying just like a man who   s had a little drink or two to steady his nerves  and lifted the dark red cloth that  it turned out  concealed the parrot cage .  the bird was  in fact  a cockatoo  and it danced frantically up and down on its perch .      twelve and a half percent .  twelve and a half percent .      horsefry grinned .      ah  you   ve met alphonse     said reacher gilt .     and to what do i owe this unexpected pleasure  crispin .     the door swung slowly behind him into its felt lined frame  shutting out the sound of distant music .   horsefry turned  the brief moment of amusement evaporating instantly into the fearful turmoil of his soul .  gilt  one hand in the pocket of a beautiful smoking jacket  gave him a quizzical look .      i   m being spied on  reacher .     horsefry burst out .     vetinari sent one of           please .  sit down  crispin .  i think you require a large brandy .     he wrinkled his nose .     another large brandy  should i say .         i wouldn   t say no .  had to have a little snifter  you know  just to calm m   nerves .  what a day i   ve had .     horsefry plumped down into a leather armchair .     did you know there was a watchman on duty outside the bank almost all afternoon .         a fat man .  a sergeant .     said gilt  handing him a glass .      fat  yes .  i didn   t notice his rank .     horsefry sniffed .     i   ve never had anything to do with the watch .         i  on the other hand  have     said gilt  wincing to see very fine brandy drunk in the way horsefry was drinking it .     and i gather that sergeant colon is in the habit of loitering near large buildings in case they are stolen  but in fact simply because he enjoys a quiet smoke out of the wind .  he is a clown  and not to be feared .         yes  but this morning one of the revenue officers came to see that old fool cheeseborough           is that unusual  crispin .     said gilt soothingly .     let me top up your glass there           well  they come once or twice a month       horsefry conceded  thrusting out the empty brandy glass .     but           not unusual  then .  you   re shying at flies  my dear crispin .         vetinari is spying on me .     horsefry burst out .     there was a man in black spying on the house this evening .  i heard a noise and i looked out and i could see him standing in the corner of the garden .         a thief  perhaps .         no  i   m fully paid up with the guild .  i   m sure someone was in the house this afternoon  too .  things were moved in my study .  i   m worried  reacher .  i   m the one who stands to lose here .  if there   s an audit           you know there won   t be  crispin .     gilt   s voice was like honey .      yes  but i can   t get my hands on all the paperwork  not yet  not until old cheeseborough retires .  and vetinari   s got lots of little  you know  what are they called   clerks  you know  who do nothing but look at lil    bits of paper .  they   ll work it out  they will .  we bought the grand trunk wi    its own money .      gilt patted him on the shoulder .     calm yourself  crispin .  nothing is going to go wrong .  you think about money in the old fashioned way .  money is not a thing  it is not even a process .  it is a kind of shared dream .  we dream that a small disc of common metal is worth the price of a substantial meal .  once you wake up from that dream  you can swim in a sea of money .      the voice was almost hypnotic  but horsefry   s terror was driving him on .  his forehead glistened .      then greenyham   s pissing in it .     he snapped  his little eyes aglint with desperate malice .     you know that tower widdershins of lancre that was giving all that trouble a coupla months ago .  when we were tol    it was all due to witches flying into the towers .  hah .  it w   s only a witch the firs    time .  then greenyham bribed a couple of the new men in the tower to call in a breakdown  and one of them rode like hell for the downstream tower and sen    him the genua market figures a good two hours before everyone else got them .  that   s how he cornered dried prawns  you know .  and dried fish maw and dried ground shrimp .  it   s not the firs    time he   s done it  either .  the man is coining it .      gilt looked at the man and wondered whether killing him now would be the best option .  vetinari was clever .  you didn   t stay ruler of a fermenting mess of a city like this one by being silly .  if you saw his spy  it was a spy he wanted you to see .  the way you   d know that vetinari was keeping an eye on you would be by turning around very quickly and seeing no one at all .   godsdamn greenyham  too .  some people had no grasp  no grasp at all .  they were so   small .   using the clacks like that was stupid  but allowing a bottom feeder like horsefry to find out about it was indefensible .  it was silly .  silly small people with the arrogance of kings  running their little swindles  smiling at the people they stole from  and not understanding money at all .   and stupid  piglike horsefry had come running here .  that made it a little tricky .  the door was soundproofed  and the carpet was easily replaceable  and  of course  igors were renowned for their discretion  but almost certainly someone unseen had watched the man walk in  and therefore it was prudent to ensure that he walked out .      y   r a goo    man  reacher gilt     horsefry hiccuped  waving the brandy glass unsteadily now that it was almost empty again .  he put it down onto a small table with the exaggerated care of a drunk  but since it was the wrong one of three images of the table sliding back and forth across his vision  the glass smashed on the carpet .      sor       bout that     he slurred .     y   r a goo    man  so i   m goin    to gi    you this .  can   t keep it inna house  can   t keep it  not wi    vetininararari   s spies onto me .  can   t burn it neither     sgot everything in it .  all the little   transactions .  ver    important .  can   t trust the others  they hate me .  you take care of it  eh .      he pulled out a battered red journal and proffered it unsteadily .  gilt took it and flicked it open .   his eye ran down the entries .      you wrote everything down  crispin .     he said .     why .      crispin looked apalled .      got to keep records  reacher     he said .     can   t cover y    tracks if you don   t know where y   left    em .  then   can put it all back  see  hardly a crime at all .     he tried to tap the side of his nose  and missed .      i shall look after it with great care  crispin     said gilt .     you were very wise to bring it to me .         that means a lot t   me  reacher     said crispin  now heading for the maudlin stage .     you take me seriossoussly  not like greenyham and his pals .  i take the risks  then they treat me like drit  i mean dirt .  bloody goo    chap  you are .  s   funny  y   know  you havin    a igor  bloody goo    chap like you     cos      he belched hugely         cos i heard that igors only worked for mad chaps .  tot   ly bonkers chaps  y   know  and vampires and whatnot  people who   re a few pennies short of a picnic .  nothing against your man  mark you  he looks a bloody fine fellow  ahahaha  several bloody fine fellows        reacher gilt pulled him up gently .     you   re drunk  crispin     he said .     and too talkative .  now  what i   m going to do is call igor           yeth  thur .     said igor behind him .  it was the kind of service few could afford .         and he   ll take you home in my coach .  make sure you deliver him safely to his valet  igor .  oh  and when you done that could you locate my colleague mr .  gryle .  tell him i have a little errand for him .  good night  crispin .     gilt patted the man on a wobbly cheek .     and don   t worry .  tomorrow you   ll find all these little worries will have just   disappeared .         ver    good chap     horsefry mumbled happily     f   r a foreigner           i gor took crispin home .  by that time the man had reached the    jolly drunk    stage and was singing the kind of song that   s hilarious to rugby players and children under the age of eleven  and getting him into his house must have awoken the neighbors  especially when he kept repeating the verse about the camel .   the igor drove back home  put the coach away  saw to the horse  and went to the little pigeon loft behind the house .  these were big  plump pigeons  not the diseased roofrats of the city  and he selected a particularly fat one  expertly slipped a silver message ring around its leg  and tossed it up into the night .   ankh morpork pigeons were quite bright  for pigeons .  stupidity had a limited life in this city .  this one would soon find mr .  gryle   s rooftop lodgings  but it annoyed igor that he never got his pigeons back .      old envelopes rose up in drifts as moist strode angrily  and sometimes waded angrily  through the abandoned rooms of the post office .  he was in the mood to kick holes in walls .  he was trapped .  trapped .  he   d done his best  hadn   t he .  perhaps there really was a curse on this place .     groat    would be a good name for it     he pushed open a door and found himself in the big coach yard  around which the post office was bent like the letter u .  it was still in use .  when the postal service had collapsed  the coach part had survived  groat had said .  it was useful and established and  besides  it owned scores of horses .  you couldn   t squash horses under the floor  or bag them up in the attic .  they had to be fed .  more or less seamlessly  the coachmen had taken it over and run it as passenger service .   moist watched a laden coach roll out of the yard  and then movement up above caught his eye .   you got used to the clacks towers now .  sometimes it seemed as though every roof sprouted one .  most were the new shutter boxes installed by the grand trunk company  but old fashioned arm semaphores and even signal flags were still well in evidence .  those  though  only worked slowly and line of sight  and there was precious little space for that in the thrusting forest of towers .  if you wanted more than that  you went to one of the little clacks companies and rented a small shutter tower with resident gargoyle to spot incoming messages  and access to the bounce towers  and  if you were really rich  a trained operator as well .  and you paid .  moist had no grasp of  or interest in  technology  but as he understood it  the price was something like an arm or a leg or both .   but these observations orbited his brain  as it were  like planetary thoughts around one central  solar thought  why the hell have we got a tower .   it was definitely on the roof .  he could see it and he could hear the distant rattle of the shutters .  and he was sure he   d seen a head  before it ducked out of sight .   why have we got a tower up there  and who is using it .   he ran back inside .  he   d never spotted a staircase to the roof  but then  who knew what was hidden behind some pile of letters at the end of some blocked corridor     he squeezed his way along yet another passage lined with mail sacks  and came out into a space where big  bolted double doors led back to the yard .  there were stairs there  leading upwards .  little safety lamps bled little pools of light into the blackness above .  that was the post office for you  moist thought   the regulations said the stairs must be lit and lit they were  decades after anyone ever used them  except for stanley  the lamplighter .   there was an old freight elevator here  too  one of those dangerous ones that worked by pumping water in and out of a big rainwater tank on the roof  but he couldn   t work out how to make it go and wouldn   t have trusted it if he could .  groat had said it was broken .   at the foot of the stairs  scuffed but still recognizable  was a chalk outline .  the arms and legs were not in comfortable positions .   moist swallowed  but gripped the banister .   he climbed .   there was a door on the first floor .  it opened easily .  it burst open at the mere touch of the handle  spilling pent up mail out into the stairwell like some leaping monster .  moist swayed and whimpered as the letters slithered past him  shoal after shoal  and cascaded down the stairs .   woodenly  he climbed up another flight  and found another dimly lit door  but this time he stood to one side as he opened it .  the force of the letters still rammed it against his legs  and the noise of the dead letters was a dry whispering as they poured away into the gloom .  like bats  perhaps .  this whole building full of dead letters  whispering to one another in the dark as a man fell to his death     any more of this and he   d end up like groat  mad as a spoon .  but there was more to this place .  somewhere there had to be a door     his head was all over the wall     look  he said to his imagination  if this is how you   re going to behave  i shan   t bring you again .   but  with its usual treachery  it went on working .  he   d never  ever  laid a finger on anyone .  he   d always run rather than fight .  and murder  now  surely murder was an absolute .  you couldn   t commit   .     of a murder  could you .  but pump seemed to think you could murder with a ruler .  okay  perhaps somewhere downstream people were   inconvenienced by a crime  but   what about bankers  landlords  even barmen .     here   s your double brandy  sir  and i   ve   .      killed you    .  everything everyone did affected everyone  sooner or later .   besides  a lot of his crimes weren   t even crimes .  take the ring trick  now .  he never said it was a diamond ring .  besides  it was depressing how quickly honest citizens warmed to an opportunity to take advantage of a poor benighted traveler  it could ruin a man   s faith in human nature  if he had one .  besides     the third floor yielded another avalanche of letters  but when they subsided there was still a wall of paper plugging the corridor beyond .  one or two rustling envelopes fell out  threatening a further fall as moist advanced .   in fact it was retreat that was at the top of his mind  but the stairs were now layered with sliding envelopes and this was not the time to learn dry slope skiing .   well  the fifth floor would have to be clear  wouldn   t it .  how else could sideburn have got to the stairs in order to meet his appointment with eternity .  and yes  there was still a piece of black and yellow rope on the fourth floor landing  on a drift of letters .  the watch had been here .  nevertheless  moist opened the door with care  as a watchman must have done .   one or two letters fell out  but the main slide had already taken place .  a few feet beyond there was the familiar wall of letters  packed as tight as rock strata .  a watchman had been in here  too .  someone had tried to break through the wordface  and moist could see the hole .  they   d put in their arm  full length  just like moist was doing .  just like his  their fingertips had brushed against yet more compacted envelopes .   no one had got onto the stairs here .  they would have had to walk through a wall of envelopes at least six feet thick     there was one more flight .  moist climbed the stairs  cautiously  and was halfway up when he heard the slide begin  below him .   he must have disturbed the wall of letters on the floor below  somehow .  it was emerging from the corridor with the unstoppability of a glacier .  as the leading edge reached the stairwell  chunks of mail broke off and plunged into the depths .  far below  wood creaked and snapped .  the stairway shivered .   moist ran up the last few steps to the fifth floor  grabbed the door there  pulled it open  and hung on as another mailslide poured past him .  everything was shaking now .  there was a sudden crack as the rest of the staircase gave way and left moist swinging from the handle  letters brushing past .   he swung there  eyes shut  until the noise and movement had more or less died away  although there was still the occasional creak from below .   the stairs were gone .   with great care  moist brought his feet up until he could feel the edge of the new corridor .  without doing anything so provocative as breathing  he changed his grip on the door so that now he had a hold of the handle on both sides .  slowly  he walked his heels through the drift of letters on the corridor floor  thus pulling the door closed while at the same time getting both hands onto the inner handle .   then he took a deep breath of the stale  dry air  scrabbled madly with his feet  bent his body like a hooked salmon  and ended up with just enough of himself on the corridor floor to prevent a fall through sixty feet of letters and broken woodwork .   barely thinking  he unhooked the lamp from the doorpost and turned to survey the task ahead .   the corridor was brightly lit  richly carpeted  and completely free of mail .  moist stared .   there had been letters in there  wedged tight from floor to ceiling .  he   d seen them  and felt them fall past him into the stairwell .  they hadn   t been a hallucination  they   d been solid  musty  dusty  and real .  to believe anything else now would be madness .   he turned back to look at the wreckage of the stairs and saw no doorway  no stairs .  the carpeted floor extended all the way to the far wall .   moist realized that there had to be an explanation for this  but the only one he could think of now was  it   s strange .  he reached down gingerly to touch the carpet where the stairwell should be  and felt a chill on his fingertips as they passed through .   and he wondered  did one of the other new postmasters stand here  just where i am .  and did he walk out over what looked like solid floor and end up rolling down five flights of pain .   moist inched his way along the corridor in the opposite direction  and sound began to grow .  it was vague and generalized  the noise of a big building hard at work  shouts  conversations  the rattle of machinery  the crowded susurrus of a thousand voices and wheels and footfalls and stampings and scribblings and slammings all woven together in a huge space to become the pure  audible texture of commerce .   the corridor opened out ahead of him  where it met a t junction .  the noise was coming from the brightly lit space beyond .  moist walked toward the shining brass railing of the balcony ahead     and stopped .   all right  the brain had been carried all the way up here at great expense  now it was time for it to do some work .   the hall of the post office was a dark cavern filled with mountains of mail .  there were no balconies  no shining brasswork  no bustling staff  and  as sure as hell  there were no customers .   the only time the post office could have looked like this was in the past  yes .   there was balconies  sir  all round the big hall on every floor  made of iron  like lace .      but they weren   t in the present  not in the here and now .  yet he wasn   t in the past  not exactly .  his fingers had felt a stairwell when his eyes had seen carpeted floor .   moist decided that he was standing in the here and now but seeing in the here and then .  of course  you   d have to be mad to believe it  but this was the post office .   poor mr .  sideburn had stepped out onto a floor that wasn   t there anymore .   moist stopped before stepping out onto the balcony  reached down  and felt the chill on his fingertips once again as they went through the carpet .  who was it   oh  yes  mr .  mutable .  he   d stood here  rushed to looked down and        smack  sir  smack onto the marble     moist stood up carefully  steadied himself against the wall  and peered gingerly into the big hall .   chandeliers hung from the ceiling  but they were unlit because sunlight was pouring through the sparkling dome onto a scene innocent of pigeon droppings but alive with people  scuttling across the checkerboard floor or hard at work behind the long  polished counters made of rare wood  my dad said .  moist stood and stared .   it was a scene made up of a hundred purposeful activities that fused happily into a great anarchy .  below him  big wire baskets on wheels were being manhandled across the floor  sacks of letters were being tipped on moving belts  clerks were feverishly filling the pigeonholes .  it was a machine made of people sir  you should   ve seen it .   away to moist   s left  at the far end of the hall  was a golden statue three or four times lifesize .  it was of a golden  slim young man  obviously a god  wearing nothing more than a hat with wings on  sandals with wings on  and   moist squinted   a fig leaf with wings on .   he   d been caught by the sculptor as he was about to leap into the air  carrying an envelope and wearing an expression of noble purpose .   it dominated the hall .  it wasn   t there in the present day  the dais was unoccupied .  if the counters and the chandeliers were gone  a statue that even looked like gold must   ve stood no chance .  it had probably been the spirit of the post  or something .   meanwhile  the mail down there was moving more prosaically .   right under the dome was a clock with a face pointing in each of the four directions .  as moist watched it  the big hand clanked to the top of the hour .   a horn blew .  the frantic ballet ceased as  somewhere below moist  some doors opened and two lines of men in the uniforms  sir  royal blue with brass buttons .  you should   ve seen them .  marched in the hall in two lines and stood to attention in front of the big doors .  a large man in a rather grander version of the uniform and with a face like a toothache was waiting there for them  he wore a large hourglass hanging in a gimballed brass cage at his belt  and he looked at the waiting men as if he had seen worse sights but not often and even then only on the soles of his enormous boots .   he held up the hourglass with an air of evil satisfaction  and took a deep breath before roaring     numbahhh four delivereeee   stand .      the words reached moist   s ears slightly muffled  as though he was hearing them through cardboard .  the postmen already at attention contrived to look even more alert .   the big man glared at them and took another huge gulp of air .      numbahhh three delivereeee wait for it  wait for it .     delivaaaaaaah .      the two lines marched past him and out into the day .   once  we were postmen     i   ve got to find a real stairway  moist thought  pushing himself away from the edge .  i   m   hallucinating the past .  but i   m standing in the present .  it   s like sleepwalking .  i don   t walk out onto fresh air and end up as one more chalk outline .   he turned around and someone walked right through him .   the sensation was unpleasant  like a sudden snap of fever .  but that wasn   t the worst part .  the worst part is seeing someone   s head walk through yours .  the view is mostly gray  with traces of red and hollow hints of sinus .  you would not wish to know about the eyeballs .      face like a mask  sir  like he   d seen a ghost     moist   s stomach heaved  and  as he turned with his hand over his mouth  he saw a young postman looking in his general direction with a look of horror that probably reflected the one on the unseen moist   s face .  then the boy shivered and hurried away .   so mr .  ignavia had got this far  too .  he   d been smart enough to work out the floor  but seeing someone   s head going through your own  well  that could take you the wrong way     moist ran after the boy .  up here  he was lost  he must have toured less than a tenth of the building with groat  the way constantly being blocked by glaciers of mail .  there were other stairs  he knew  and they still existed in the present .  ground level  that was the goal  a floor you could rely on .   the boy went through a door and into what looked like a room full of parcels  but moist could see an open doorway at the far end  and a hint of banister .   he speeded up  and the floor disappeared from under his feet .   the light vanished .  he was briefly and horribly aware of dry letters all around him  falling with him .  he landed on more letters  choking as dry  ancient mail piled up .  for a moment  through the rain of paper  he caught a glimpse of a dusty window half covered with letters  and then he was submerged again .  the heap under him began to move  slipping down and sideways .  there was the crack of what could have been a door being burst off its hinges  and the sideways flow increased noticeably .  he struck out madly for the surface in time for his head to hit the top of a door jamb  and then the current dragged him under .   helpless now  tumbling in the river of paper  moist dimly felt the jolt as a floor gave way .  the mail poured through  taking him with it and slamming him into another drift of envelopes .  the light disappeared as thousands of letters thudded down on top of him  and then sound died  too .   darkness and silence squeezed him in a fist .   moist von lipwig knelt with his head resting on his arms .  there was air here but it was warm and stale and wouldn   t last long .  he couldn   t move more than a finger .   he could die here .  he would die here .  there must be tons of mail around him .      i commend my soul to any god who can find it     he mumbled in the stifling air .   a line of blue danced across his inner vision .   it was handwriting .  but it spoke .          dear mother  i have arrived safely and found good lodgings at          the voice sounded like a country boy but it had a   a scritchy quality to it .  if a letter could talk  it would sound like that .  the words rambled on  the characters curving and slanting awkwardly under the pen of a reluctant writer        and as it ran on  another line also began to write itself across the dark  crisply and neatly          dear sir  i have the honor to inform you that i am the sole executor of the estate of the late sir davie thrills  of the manor  mixed blessings  and it appears that you are the sole          the voice continued in words so clipped that you could hear the shelves full of legal books behind the desk  but a third line was beginning          dear mrs .  c .  clarke  i much regret to inform you that in an engagement with the enemy yesterday your husband  c .  clark  fought valiantly but was          and then they all wrote at once .  voices in their dozens  their hundreds  their thousands  filled his ears and squiggled across his inner vision .  they didn   t shout  they just unrolled the words until his head was full of sound  which formed new words  just as all the instruments of an orchestra tinkle and scrape and blast to produce one crescendo     moist tried to scream  but envelopes filled his mouth .   and then a hand closed on his leg and he was in the air and upside down .      ah  mr .  lipvig .     boomed the voice of mr .  pump .     you have been exploring .  welcome to your new office .      moist spat out paper and sucked air into stinging lungs .      they   re   alive .     he gasped .     they   re all alive .  and angry .  they talk .  it was not a hallucination .  i   ve had hallucinations and they don   t hurt .  i know how the others died .         i am happy for you  mr .  lipvig     said pump  turning him the right way up and wading waist deep across the room  while behind them more mail trickled through a hole in the ceiling .      you don   t understand .  they talk .  they want       moist hesitated .  he could still hear the whispering in his head .  he said  as much to himself as for the benefit of the golem     it   s as though they want to be   read .         that is the function of a letter     said pump calmly .     you will see that i have almost cleared your apartment .         listen  they   re just paper .  and they talked .         yes     rumbled the golem ponderously .     this place is a tomb of unheard words .  they strive to be heard .         oh  come on .  letters are just paper  they can   t speak .         i am just clay  and i listen     said pump  with the same infuriating calm .      yes  but you   ve got added mumbo jumbo        the red fire rose behind pump   s eyes as he turned to stare at moist .      i went   backwards in time  i think     moist mumbled  backing away .     in   my head .  that   s how sideburn died .  he fell down stairs that weren   t there in the past .  and mr .  ignavia died of fright .  i   m sure of it .  but i was inside the letters .  and there must have been a   a hole in the floor  or something  and that   i fell  and i       he stopped .     this place needs a priest  or a wizard .  someone who understands this kind of stuff .  not me .      the golem scooped up two armfuls of the mail that had so recently entombed his client .      you are the postmaster  mr .  lipvig     he said .      that   s just vetinari   s trick .  i   m no postman  i   m just a fraud           mr .  lipwig .     said a nervous voice from the doorway behind him .  he turned and saw the boy stanley  who flinched at his expression .      yes .     snapped moist .     what the hell do you   what do you want  stanley .  i   m a little busy right now .         there   s some men     said stanley  grinning uncertainly .     they   re downstairs .  some men .      moist glared at him  but stanley seemed to have finished for now .      and these men want    .     he prompted .      they want you  mr .  lipwig     said stanley .     they said they want to see the man who wants to be postmaster .         i don   t want to be       moist began  but gave up .  there was no point in taking it out on the boy .      excuse me  postmaster     said the golem behind him .     i wish to complete my assigned task .      moist stood aside as the clay man walked out into the corridor  the old boards groaning under his enormous feet .  outside  you could see how he   d managed to clean out the office .  the walls of other rooms were bowed out almost to the point of exploding .  when a golem pushes things into a room  they stay pushed .   the sight of the plodding figure calmed him down a little .  there was something intensely   well  down to earth about mr .  pump .   what he needed now was normal things  normal people to talk to  normal things to do to drive the voices out of his head .  he brushed fragments of paper off his increasingly greasy suit .      all right     he said  trying to find his tie  which had ended up hanging down his back .     i shall see what they want .         they were waiting on the half landing on the big staircase .  they were old men  thin and bowed  like slightly older copies of groat .  they wore the same ancient uniforms  but there was something odd about them .   each man had the skeleton of a pigeon wired onto the top of his peaked hat .      be you the unfranked man .     growled one of them  as he approached .      what .  who .  am i .     said moist .  suddenly  the idea of normality was ebbing again .      yes  you are  sir     whispered stanley beside him .     you have to say yes  sir .  gosh  sir  i wish it was me doing this .         doing what .         for the second time  be you the unfranked man .     said the old man  looking angry .  moist noticed that he was missing the top joints on the middle fingers of his right hand .      i suppose so .  if you insist     he said .  this didn   t meet with any approval at all .      for the last time  be you the unfranked man .     this time there was real menace in the voice .      yes  all right .  for the purposes of this conversation  yes .  i am the unfranked man .     moist shouted .     now can we        something black was dropped over his head from behind and he felt strings pulled tightly around his neck .      the unfranked man is tardy     crackled another elderly voice in his ear  and unseen but tough hands took hold of him .     no postman he .         you   ll be fine  sir     said the voice of stanley  as moist struggled .     don   t worry .  mr .  groat will guide you .  you   ll do it easily  sir .         do what .     said moist .     let go of me  you daft old devils .         the unfranked man dreads the walk     one assailant hissed .      aye  the unfranked man will be returned to sender in no short order     said another .      the unfranked man must be weighed in the balance     said a third .      stanley  fetch mr .  pump right now .     shouted moist  but the hood was thick and clinging .      mustn   t do that  sir     said stanley .     mustn   t do that at all  sir .  it will be all right  sir .  it   s just a   a test  sir .  it   s the order of the post  sir .      funny hats  moist thought  and began to relax .  hoodwinks and threats   i know this stuff .  it   s mysticism for tradesmen .  there   s not a city in the world without its loyal and ancient and justified and hermetic order of little men who think they can reap the secrets of the ancients for a couple of hours every thursday night and don   t realize what prats they look in a robe .  i should know  i must have joined a dozen of    em myself .  i bet there   s a secret handshake .  i know more secret handshakes than the gods .  i   m in about as much danger as i would be in a class of five year olds .  less  probably .  unfranked man   good grief .   he relaxed .  he let himself be led down the stairs  and turned around .  ah  yes  that   s right .  you   ve got to make the initiate fear  but everyone knows it   s just a party game .  it   ll sound bad  it might even feel bad  but it won   t be bad .  he remembered joining  what was it  oh yes  the men of the furrow  in some town out in the stalks .   he   d been blindfolded  of course  and the men had made all the horrific noises they could imagine  and then a voice in the darkness had said     shake hands with the old master .     and moist had reached out and shaken a goat   s foot .  those who got out of there with clean pants won .   next day he   d swindled three of his trusting new brothers out of eighty dollars .  that didn   t seem quite so funny now .   the old postmen were taking him into the big hall .  he could tell by the echoes .  and there were other people there  according to those little hairs on the back of his neck .  not just people  maybe  he thought he heard a muffled growl .  but that was how it went  right .  things had to sound worrying .  the key was to be bold  act brave and forthright .   his escorts left him .  moist stood in darkness for a moment  and then felt a hand grasp his elbow .      it   s me  sir .  probationary senior postman groat  sir .  don   t you worry about a thing  sir .  i   m your temporary deacon for tonight  sir .         is this necessary  mr .  groat .     sighed moist .     i was appointed postmaster  you know .         appointed  yes .  accepted  not yet  sir .  proof of posting is not proof of delivery  sir .         what are you talking about .         can   t tell secrets to an unfranked man  sir     said groat piously .     you   ve done well to get this far  sir .         oh  all right     said moist  trying to sound jovial .     what   s the worst that can happen  eh .      groat was silent .      i said       moist began .      i was just working that out  sir     said groat .     let   s see   yes  sir .  the worst that can happen is you lose all your fingers on one hand  are crippled for life  and break half the bones in your body .  oh  and then they don   t let you join .  but don   t you worry about a thing  sir  not a thing .      up head  a voice boomed     who brings the unfranked man .      beside moist  groat cleared his throat  and when he spoke  his voice actually shook .      i  probationary senior postman tolliver groat  do bring the unfranked man .         you did say that about the bones to frighten me  right .     hissed moist .      and does he stand in the gloom of night .     the voice demanded .      he does now  worshipful master .     shouted groat happily and whispered to the hooded moist     some of the old boys are really happy about you getting the sign back           good .  now  these broken bones you mentioned           then let him walk the walk .     the unseen voice commanded .      we   re just going to walk forward  sir  easy does it     groat whispered urgently .     that   s it .  stop here .         look     said moist     all that stuff   that was just to scare me  right .         you leave it to me  sir     groat whispered .      but listen  the       moist began  and had a mouthful of hood .      let him don the boots .     the voice went on .   amazing how you can hear the capital letters  moist thought  trying not to choke on the cloth .      pair of boots right in front of you  sir     came groat   s hoarse whisper .     put    em on .  no problem  sir .         pff .  yes  but listen           the boots  sir  please .      moist removed his shoes  very clumsily  and slid his feet into the invisible boots .  they turned out to be as heavy as lead .      the walk of the unfranked man is heavy     the booming voice intoned .     let him continue .      moist took another step forward  trod on something that rolled  stumbled headlong  and felt a stab of agony as his chin hit metal .      postmen     the booming voice demanded again     what is the first oath .      voices sang out from the darkness  in chorus     strewth  would you bleedin    credit it .  toys  strollers  garden tools    they don   t care what they leaves out on the path on these dark mornings .         did the unfranked man cry out .     the voice said .   i think i   ve broken my chin  moist thought as groat dragged him to his feet .  i think i   ve broken my chin .  the old man hissed     well done  sir     and then raised his voice to add for the benefit of the unseen watchers     he crydeth out not  worshipful master  but was resolute .         then give unto him the bag .     boomed the distant voice .  moist was beginning to loathe it .   unseen hands put a strap around moist   s neck .  when they let go  the weight on it bent him double .      the postman   s bag is heavy  but soon it shall be light .     echoed off the walls .  no one had said anything about pain  moist thought .  well  actually they did  but they didn   t say they meant it        on we go  sir     groat urged  invisible at his side .     this is the postman   s walk  remember .      moist edged forward  very carefully  and felt something rattle away .      he trod not upon the roller skate  worshipful master .     groat reported to the invisible watchers .   moist  aching but heartened  tried two more hesitant steps  and there was another rattle as something bounced off his boot .      the carelessly abandoned beer bottle impeded him not .     groat yelled triumphantly .   emboldened  moist essayed a further step  trod on something slippery  and his foot headed off and up without him .  he landed heavily on his back  his head thumping on the floor .  he was sure he heard his own skull crack .      postmen  what is the second oath .     the echoing voice commanded .      dogs .  i tell you  there   s no such thing as a good one .  if they don   t bite they all crap .  it   s as bad as stepping on machine oil .      moist got to his knees  head spinning .      that   s right  that   s right  you keeps goin    .     hissed groat  grabbing his elbow .     you get through  come rain or shine .     he lowered his voice even further .     remember what it says on the building .         mrs .  cake .     moist mumbled  and then thought  was it rain or snow .  or sleet .  he heard movement and hunched over the heavy bag as the water drenched him and an over enthusiastic bucket bounced off his head .   rain  then .  he straightened up just in time to feel biting coldness slither down the back of his neck  and nearly screamed .      that was ice cubes     groat whispered .     got    em from the mortuary  but don   t you worry  sir  they was hardly used   best we can do for snow  this time of year .  sorry .  don   t you worry about a thing  sir .         let the mail be tested .     bellowed the all commanding voice .   groat   s hand plunged into the bag while moist staggered in a circle  and he raised a letter triumphantly .      i  probationary senior   oh  excuse me just a tick  worshipful master       moist felt his head being bent down to the level of groat   s mouth  and the old man whispered     was that probationary or full senior postman  sir .         what .  oh  full  yes  full .     said moist  as iced water filled his shoes .     definitely .         i  senior postman groat  do declare the mail to be as dry as a bone  worshipful master .     shouted groat triumphantly .   this time the cracked voice of authority held a hint of gleeful menace .      then let him   deliver it .      in the stifling gloom of the hood  moist   s sense of danger barred the door and hid in the cellar .  this was where the unseen chanters leaned forward .  this was where it stopped being a game .      i haven   t actually written anything down  mark you     he began  swaying .      careful now  careful     hissed groat  ignoring him .     nearly there .  there   s a door right in front of you  there   s a letterbox   could he take a breather  worshipful master .  he caught his head a nasty crack           a breather  brother groat .  so   s you can give him another hint or two  maybe .     said the presiding voice  with scorn .      worshipful master  the rituals says that the unfranked man is allowed a       groat protested .      this unfranked man walketh alone .  on his tod  tolliver groat .  he doesn   t want to be a junior postman  oh no  nor even a senior postman  not him .  he wants to achieve the rank of postmaster all in one go .  we   re not playing postman   s knock here  junior postman groat .  you talked us into this .  we are not mucking about .  he   s got to show he   s worth it .         that   s senior postman groat  thank you so very much .     groat yelled .      you ain   t a proper senior postman  tolliver groat  not if he fails the test .         yeah .  and who says you   re worshipful master  george aggy .  you   re only worshipful master    cos you got first crack at the robes .      the worshipful master   s voice became a little less commanding .     you   re a decent bloke  tolliver  i   ll give you that  but all this stuff you spout about a real postmaster turning up one day and making it all better is just   silly .  look at this place  will you .  it   s had its day .  we all have .  but if you   re going to be pig headed  we   ll do it according to the book of rules .         right  then .     said groat .      right  then .     echoed the worshipful master .   a secret society of postmen  moist thought .  i mean  why .   groat sighed and leaned closer .     there   s going to be a bloody row after we   re finished     he hissed to moist .     sorry about this  sir .  just post the letter .  i believe in you  sir .      he stepped back .   in the dark night of the hood  stunned and bleeding  moist shuffled forward  arms outstretched .   his hands found the door and ran across it in a vain search for the slot .  eventually they found it a foot above the ground .   okay  okay  ram a damn letter in there and get this stupid pantomime over with .  but it wasn   t a game .  this wasn   t one of those events where everyone knew that old harry just had to mouth the right words to be the latest member of the loyal order of chair stuffers .  there were people out there taking it seriously .   well  he just had to post a letter through a slot  didn   t he .  how hard could that b   hold on  hold on   wasn   t one of the men who   d led him down here missing the tips of his fingers on one hand .   suddenly  moist was angry .  it even sheared through the pain from his chin .  he didn   t have to do this .  at least  he didn   t have to do it like this .  it would be a poor lookout if he wasn   t a better player of les buggeures risible than this bunch of old fools .   he straightened up  stifling a groan  and pulled off the hood .  there was still darkness all around him  but it was punctuated by the glow  from the doors  of a dozen or so dark lanterns .         ere     e   s taken the hood off .     someone shouted .      the unfranked man may choose to remain in darkness     said moist .     but the postman loves the light .      he pitched the voice right .  it was the key to a thousand frauds .  you had to sound right  sound like you knew what you were doing  sound like you were in charge .  and  while he   d spoken gibberish  it was authentic gibberish .   in the dark  the door of a lantern opened a little wider and a plaintive voice said        ere  i can   t find that in the book  where   s he supposed to say that .      you had to move quickly  too .  moist wrapped the hood around his hand and levered up the flap of the letterbox .  with his other hand he grabbed a random letter out of the bag  flicked it through the slot  and then pulled his makeshift glove away .  it ripped as though cut by shears .      postmen  what is the third oath .     shouted groat triumphantly .     all together  lads  strewth  what do they make these flaps out of  razor blades .      there was a resentful silence .      he never had    is    ood on     muttered a robed figure .      yes he did .  he wrapped it round his hand .  tell me where it says he can   t do that .     screamed groat .     i told you .  he   s the one we   ve been waiting for .         there   s still the final test     said the worshipful master .      what final test are you goin    on about  george aggy .  he delivered the mail .     groat protested .     lord vetinari appointed him postmaster and he   s walked the walk .         vetinari .  he   s only been around five minutes .  who   s he to say who   s postmaster .  was his father a postman .  no .  or his grandfather .  look at the men he   s been sending .  you said they were sneaky devils who didn   t have a drop of post office ink in their blood .         i think this one might be able to       groat began .      he can take the ultimate test     said the worshipful master sternly .     you know what that is .         it   ll be murder .     said groat .     you can   t           i ain   t telling you again  young tolly  you just shut your mouth .  well  mister postmaster .  will you face the postman   s greatest challenge .  will you face      the voice paused for effect and just in case there might be a few bars of portentous music      the enemy at the gate .         face it and o   ercome it  if you demand it .     said moist .  the fool had called him postmaster .  it was working .  sound as if you   re in charge and they start to believe it .  oh  and    o   er    had been a good touch  too .      we do .  oh yes  we do .     chorused the robed postmen .   groat  a bearded shadow in the gloom  took moist   s hand and  to his amazement  shook it .      sorry about this  mr .  lipwig     he said .     din   t expect this at all .  they   re cheating .  but you   ll be fine .  you just rely on senior postman groat  sir .      he drew his hand away  and moist felt something small and cold in his palm .  he closed his fist over it .  didn   t expect it at all .      right  postmaster     said the worshipful master .     this is a simple test .  all you have to do  right  is still be standing here  on your feet  in one minute   s time  all right .  run for it  lads .      there was a swishing of robes and scurrying of feet  and a distant door slammed .  moist was left standing in silent  pigeon smelling gloom .   what other test could there be .  he tried to remember all the words on the front of the building .  trolls .  dragons .  green things with teeth .  he opened his hand to see what it was that groat had slipped him .   it looked very much like a whistle .   somewhere in the darkness  a door opened and shut again .  it was followed by the distant sound of paws moving purposefully .   dogs .   moist turned and ran down to the hall to the plinth  and scrambled onto it .  it wouldn   t be much of a problem for large dogs  but at least it would put their heads at kicking height .   then there was a bark  and moist   s face broke into a smile .  you only ever needed to hear that bark once .  it wasn   t a particularly aggressive one  because it was made by a mouth capable of crushing a skull .  you didn   t need too much extra advertising when you could do that .  news got around .   this was going to be   ironic .  they   d actually got hold of lipwigzers .   moist waited until he could see the eyes in the lantern light before he said     schlat .      the dogs stopped and stared at moist .  clearly  they were thinking  something is wrong here .   he sighed and slipped down off the pedestal .      look     he said  placing a hand on each rump and exerting downward pressure .     one fact everyone knows is that no female lipwigzers have ever been let out of the country .  that keeps the breed price high   schlat .  i said .    and every puppy is trained to lipwigzian commands .  this is the old country talking  boys .  schlat .      the dogs sat down instantly .      good boys     said moist .  it was true what people like his grandfather said  once you put aside their ability to bite through a whole leg in one go  they were very nice animals .   he cupped his hands and shouted     gentlemen .  it   s safe for you to come in now .     the postmen would be listening  that was certain .  they   d be waiting for snarls and screams .   the distant door opened .      come forward .     snapped moist .  the dogs turned to look at the huddle of approaching postmen .  they growled  too  in one long  uninterrupted rumble .   now he could see the mysterious order clearly .  they were robed  of course  because you couldn   t have a secret order without robes .  they had pushed the hoods back now  and each man  was wearing a peaked cap with a bird skeleton wired to it .      now  sir  we knew tolliver   d slip you the dog whistle       one of them began  looking nervously at the lipwigzers .      this .     said moist  opening his hand .     i didn   t use it .  it only makes    em angry .      the postmen stared at the sitting dogs .      but you got    em to sit       one began .      i can get them to do other things     said moist levelly .     i just have to say the word .         er   there   s a couple of lads outside with muzzles  if it   s all the same to you  sir     said groat  as the order backed away .     we   re heridititerrilyly wary of dogs .  it   s a postman thing .         i can assure you that the control my voice has over them at the moment is stronger than steel     said moist .  this was probably garbage  but it was good garbage .   the growl from one of the dogs had taken on the edge they tended to get just before the creature became a tooth tipped projectile .      vodit .     shouted moist .     sorry about this  gentlemen     he added .     i think you make them nervous .  they can smell fear  as you probably know .         look  we   re really sorry  all right .     said the one whose voice suggested to moist that he had been the worshipful master .     we had to be sure  all right .         i   m the postmaster  then .     said moist .      absolutely  sir .  no problem at all .  welcome  o postmaster .      quick learner  moist thought .      i think i   ll just       he began  as the double doors opened at the other end of the hall .   mr .  pump entered  carrying a large box .  it should be quite hard to open a big pair of doors while carrying something in both hands  but not if you   re a golem .  they just walk at them .  the doors can choose to open or try to stay shut  it   s up to them .   the dogs took off like fireworks .  the postmen took off in the opposite direction  climbing onto the dais behind moist with commendable speed for such elderly men .   mr .  pump plodded forward  crushing underfoot the debris of the walk .  he rocked as the creatures struck him  and then patiently put down the box and picked up the dogs by the scruffs of their necks .      there are some gentlemen outside with nets and gloves and extremely thick clothing  mr .  lipvig     he said .     they say they work for a mr .  harry king .  they want to know if you have finished with these dogs .         harry king .     said moist .      he   s a big scrap merchant  sir     said groat .     i expect the dogs was borrowed off of him .  he turns    em loose in his yards at night .         no burglar gets in  eh .         i think he   s quite happy if they get in  sir .  saves having to feed the dogs .         hah .  please take them away  mr .  pump     said moist .  lipwigzers .  it had been so easy .   as they watched the golem turn around with a whimpering dog under each arm  he added     mr .  king must be doing well  then  to run lipwigzers as common guard dogs .         lipwigzers .  harry king .  bless you  sir  old harry wouldn   t buy posh foreign dogs when he can buy crossbreeds  not him .     said groat .     probably a bit of lipwigzer in    em  i daresay  probably the worst bits .  hah  a purebred lipwigzer prob   ly wouldn   t last five minutes against some of the mongrels in our alleys .  some of    em has got crocodile in    em .      there was a moment of silence and then moist said  in a faraway voice     so   definitely not imported purebreds  you think .         bet your life on it  sir     said groat cheerfully .     is there a problem  sir .         what .  um   no .  not at all .         you sounded a bit disappointed  sir .  or something .         no .  i   m fine .  no problem .     moist added thoughtfully     you know  i really have got to get some laundry done .  and perhaps some new shoes        the doors swung open to reveal not the return of the dogs but mr .  pump again .  he picked up the box he   d left and headed on toward moist .      well  we   ll be off     said the worshipful master .     nice to have met you  mr .  moist .         that   s it .     said moist .     isn   t there a ceremony or something .         oh  that   s tolliver  that is     said the worshipful master .     i like to see the old place still standing  really i do  but it   s all about the clacks these days  isn   t it .  young tolliver thinks it can all be got going again  but he was just a lad when it all broke down .  you can   t fix some things  mr .  moist .  oh  you can call yourself postmaster  but where   d you start to get this lot back working .  it   s an old fossil  sir  just like us .         your hat  sir     said pump .  they turned .      what .     said moist  and turned to where the golem was standing by the dais  patiently  with a hat in his hands .   it was a postman   s peaked hat  in gold  with golden wings .  moist took it  and saw how the gold was just paint  cracked and peeling  and the wings were real dried pigeon wings and almost crumbled to the touch .  as the golem had held it up in the light  it had gleamed like something from some ancient tomb .  in moist   s hands  it crackled and smelled of attics and shed golden flakes .  inside the brim  on a stained label  were the words boult   locke  military and ceremonial outfitters  peach pie street  a m .  size      .      there is a pair of boots with wings  too     said mr .  pump     and some sort of elasticated           don   t bother about that bit .     said groat excitedly .     where did you find that stuff .  we   ve been looking everywhere .  for years .         it was under the mail in the postmaster   s office  mr .  groat .         couldn   t have been  couldn   t have been .     groat protested .     we   ve sifted through there dozens of times .  i seen every inch o    carpet in there .         a lot of mail  er  moved about today     said moist .      that is correct     said the golem .     mr .  lipvig came through the ceiling .         ah  so he found it  eh .     said groat triumphantly .     see .  it   s all coming true .  the prophecy .         there is no prophecy  tolliver     said the worshipful master  shaking his head sadly .     i know you think there is  but wishing that someone will come along and sort this mess out one day is not the same as a prophecy .  not really .         we   ve been hearing the letters talking again .     said groat .     they whisper in the night .  we have to read them the regulations to keep    em quiet .  just like the wizard said .         yes  well  you know what we used to say  you do have to be mad to work here .     said the worshipful master .     it   s all over  tolliver .  it really is .  the city doesn   t even need us anymore .         you put that hat on  mr .  lipwig .     said groat .     it   s fate  that turning up like this .  you just put it on and see what happens .         well  if everyone   s happy about it       moist mumbled .  he held the hat above his head  but hesitated .      nothing is going to happen  is it .     he said .     only i   ve had a very strange day           no  nothing   s going to happen     said the worshipful master .     it never does .  oh  we all thought it would  once .  every time someone said they   d put the chandeliers back or deliver the mail  we thought  maybe it   s ended  maybe it really is going to work this time .  and young tolliver there  you made him happy when you put the sign back .  got him excited .  made him think it   d work this time .  it never does  though     cos this place is curs  d .         that   s cursed with an extra ed .         yes  sir .  the worst kind .  no  put your hat on  sir .  it   ll keep the rain off  at least .      moist prepared to lower the hat  but as he did so he was aware that the old postmen were drawing back .      you   re not sure .     he yelled  waving a finger .     you   re not actually sure  are you .  all of you .  you   re thinking  hmm  maybe this time it will work  right .  you   re holding your breath .  i can tell .  hope is a terrible thing  gentlemen .      he lowered the hand .      feeling anything .     said groat after a while .      it   s a bit   scratchy     said moist .      ah  that   d be some amazing mystic force leakin    out  eh .     said groat  desperately .      i don   t think so     said moist .     sorry .         most of the postmasters i served under hated wearing that thing     said the worshipful master  as everyone relaxed .     mind you  you   ve got the height to carry it off .  postmaster atkinson was only five feet one  and it made him look broody .     he patted moist on the shoulder .     never mind  lad  you did your best .      an envelope bounced off his head .  as he brushed it away  another one landed on his shoulder and slid off .   around the group  letters started to land on the floor like fish dropped by a passing tornado .   moist looked up .  the letters were falling down from the darkness  and the drizzle was turning into a torrent .      stanley .  are you   messing about up there .     groat ventured  almost invisible in the paper sleet .      i always said those attics didn   t have strong enough floors     moaned the worshipful master .     it   s just a mailstorm again .  we made too much noise  that   s all .  c   mon  let   s get out while we can  eh .         then put those lanterns out .  they ain   t safety lights .     shouted groat .      we   ll be groping around in the dark  lad .         oh  you   d rather see by the light of a burning roof  would you .      the lanterns winked out   and by the darkness they now shed moist von lipwig saw the writing on the wall or  at least  hanging in the air just in front of it .  the hidden pen swooped through the air in loops and curves  drawing its glowing blue letters behind it .   moist von lipwig .  it wrote .      er   yes .      you are the postmaster .      look  i   m not the one you   re looking for .      moist von lipwig  at a time like this any one will do .      but   but   i am not worthy .      acquire worth with speed  moist von lipwig .  bring back the light .  open the doors .  stay not the messengers about their business .   moist looked down at the golden light coming up from around his feet .  it sparkled off his fingertips and began to fill him up from inside  like fine wine .  he felt his feet leave the dais as the words lifted him up and spun him gently .   in the beginning was a word  but what is a word without its messenger  moist von lipwig .  you are the postmaster .      i am the postmaster .     moist shouted .   the mail must move  moist von lipwig .  too long have we been bound here .      i will move the mail .      you will move the mail .      i will .  i will .      moist von lipwig .      yes .      the words came like a gale  whirling the envelopes in the sparkling light  shaking the building to its foundations .   deliver us .       chapter     little pictures      the postmen unmasked     a terrible engine      the new pie     mr .  lipwig thinks about stamps      the messenger from the dawn of time         mr .  lipvig .     said mr .  pump .   moist looked up into the golem   s glowing eyes .  there had to be a better way of waking up in the morning .  some people managed with a clock  for heavens    sake .   he was lying on a bare mattress under a musty blanket in his newly excavated apartment  which smelled of ancient paper  and every bit of him ached .   in a clouded kind of way  he was aware of pump saying     the postmen are waiting  sir .  postal inspector groat said that you would probably wish to send them out properly on this day .      moist blinked at the ceiling .      postal inspector .  i promoted him all the way to postal inspector .         yes  sir .  you were very ebullient .      memories of last night flocked treacherously to tapdance their speciality acts on the famous stage of the grand old embarrassing recollection .      postmen .     he said .      the brotherhood of the order of the post .  they   re old men  sir  but wiry .  they   re pensioners now  but they all volunteered .  they   ve been here for hours  sorting the mail .      i hired a bunch of men even older than groat        did i do anything else .         you gave a very inspirational speech  sir .  i was particularly impressed when you pointed out that    angel    is just a word for messenger .  not many people know that .      on the bed  moist slowly tried to cram his fist into his mouth .      oh  and you promised to bring back the big chandeliers and the fine polished counter  sir .  they were very impressed .  no one knows where they got to .      oh gods  thought moist .      and the statue of the god  sir .  that impressed them even more  i would say  because apparently it was melted down many years ago .         did i do anything last night that suggested i was sane .         i am sorry  sir .     said the golem .   but moist remembered the light  and the whispering of the mail .  it   d filled his mind with   knowledge  or memories that he didn   t remember ever acquiring .      unfinished stories     he said .      yes  sir     said the golem calmly .     you talked about them at length  sir .         i did .         yes  sir .  you said           that every undelivered message is a piece of space time that lacks another end  a little bundle of effort and emotion floating freely .  pack millions of them together and they do what letters are meant to do .  they communicate  and change the nature of events .  when there   s enough of them  they distort the universe around them .   it had all made sense to moist .  or  at least  as much sense as anything else .      and   did i actually rise up in the air  glowing gold .     said moist .      i think i must have missed that  sir     said mr .  pump .      you mean i didn   t  then .         in a manner of speaking  you did  sir     said the golem .      but in common  everyday reality  i didn   t .         you were lit  as it were  by an inner fire  sir .  the postmen were extremely impressed .      moist   s eye lit on the winged hat  which had been thrown carelessly on the desk .      i   m never going to live up to all this  mr .  pump     he said .     they want a saint  not someone like me .         perhaps a saint is not what they need  sir     said the golem .   moist sat up  and the blanket dropped away .      what happened to my clothes .     he said .     i   m sure i hung them neatly on the floor .         i did  in fact  try to clean your suit with spot remover  sir     said mr .  pump .     but since it was effectively just one large spot  it removed the whole suit .         i liked that suit .  at least you could have saved it for dusters  or something .         i   m sorry  sir  i   d assumed that dusters had been saved for your suit .  but in any case  i obeyed your order  sir .      moist paused .     what order .     he said suspiciously .      last night you asked me to obtain a suit fit for a postmaster  sir .  you gave me very precise instructions     said the golem .     fortunately my colleague stitcher    was working at the theatrical costumers .  it is hanging on the door .      and the golem had even found a mirror .  it wasn   t very big  but it was big enough to show moist that if he was dressed any sharper he   d cut himself as he walked .      wow     he breathed .     el dorado or what .      the suit was a cloth of gold  or whatever actors used instead .  moist was about to protest  but second thoughts intervened quickly .   good suits helped .  a smooth tongue was not much help in rough trousers .  and people would notice the suit  not him .  he   d certainly be noticed in this suit  it   d light up the street  people would have to shade their eyes to look at him .  and  apparently  he   d asked for this .      it   s very       he hesitated .  the only word was        fast .  i mean  it looks as if it   s about to speed away at any moment .         yes  sir .  stitcher    has a skill .  note also the gold shirt and tie .  to match the hat  sir .         er  you couldn   t get him to knock up something a little more somber  could you .     said moist  covering his eyes to stop himself being blinded by his own lapels .     for me to wear when i don   t want to illuminate distant objects .         i shall do so immediately  sir .         well     moist said  blinking in the light of his sleeves .     let   s speed the mail  then  shall we .      the formerly retired postmen were waiting in the hall  in a space cleared from last night   s maildrop .  they all wore uniforms  although since no two uniforms were exactly alike  they were not  in fact  uniform  and therefore not technically uniforms .  the caps all had peaks  but some were high domed and some were soft  and the old men themselves had ingrown their clothes  too  so that jackets hung like drape coats and trousers looked like concertinas .  and  as is the wont of old men  they wore their medals and the determined looks of those ready for the final combat .      delivery ready for inspection  sah .     said postal inspector groat  standing at attention so hard that sheer pride had lifted his feet a full inch off the floor .      thank you .  er   right .      moist wasn   t sure what he was inspecting  but he did his best .  wrinkled face after wrinkled face stared back at him .   the medals  he realized  weren   t all for military service .  the post office had medals of its own .  one was a golden dog   s head  worn by a little man with a face like a pack of weasels .      what   s this  er       he began .      senior postman george aggy  sir .  the badge .  fifteen bites and still standin     sir .     said the man proudly .      well  that is a   a   a lot of bites  isn   t it           ah  but i foxed    em after number nine  sir  and got meself a tin leg  sir .         you lost your leg .     said moist  horrified .      no  sir .  bought a bit of ol    armor  didn   t i .     said the wizened man  grinning artfully .     does m   heart to hear their teeth squeaking  sir .         aggy  aggy       moist mused  and then memory sparked .     weren   t you           i   m the worshipful master  sir     said aggy .     i hope you won   t take last night the wrong way  sir .  we all used to be like young tolliver  sir  but we gave up hope  sir .  no hard feelings .         no  not     said moist  rubbing the back of his head .      and i   d like to add my own message of congratulations as chairman of the ankh morpork order of postal workers benevolent   friendly society     aggy went on .      er   thank you     said moist .     and who are they  exactly .         that was us last night  sir     said aggy  beaming .      but i thought you were a secret society .         not secret  sir .  not exactly secret .  more   ignored  you might say .  these days it   s just about pensions and making sure your ol    mates get a proper funeral when they   re returned to sender  really .         well done     said moist vaguely  which seemed to cover everything .  he stood back and cleared his throat .     gentlemen  this is it .  if we want the post office back in business  we must start by delivering the old mail .  it is a sacred trust .  the mail gets through .  it may take fifty years  but we get there in the end .  you know your walks .  take it steady .  remember  if you can   t deliver it  if the house has gone   well  it comes back here and we   ll put it into the dead letter office and at least we   ll have tried .  we just want people to know the post office is back again  understand .      a postman raised a hand .      yes .     moist   s skill at remembering names was better than his skill at remembering anything else about last night .     senior postman thompson  isn   t it .         yes  sir .  so what do we do when people give us letters  sir .      moist   s brow wrinkled .     sorry .  i thought you deliver the mail  don   t you .         no  bill   s right  sir     said groat .     what do we do if people give us new mail .         er   what did you used to do .     said moist .   the postmen looked at one another .      get one penny off    em for the stamping  bring it back here for it to be stamped with the official stamp     said groat promptly .     then it gets sorted and delivered .         so   people have to wait until they see a postman .  that seems rather           oh  in the old days there was dozens of smaller offices  see .     groat added .     but when it all started going bad we lost    em .         well  let   s get the mail moving again and we can work things out as we go along     said moist .     i   m sure ideas will occur .  and now  mr .  groat  you have a secret to share           groat   s key ring jingled as he led moist through the post office   s cellars and eventually to a metal door .  moist noted a length of black and yellow rope on the floor  the watch had been here  too .   the door clicked open .  there was a blue glow inside  just faint enough to be annoying  leave purple shadows on the edge of vision  and make the eyes water .      voil ah     said groat .      it   s a   is it some kind of theater organ .     said moist .  it was hard to see the outlines of the machine in the middle of the floor  but it stood there with all the charm of a torturer   s rack .  the blue glow was coming from somewhere in the middle of it .  moist   s eyes were streaming already .      good try  sir .  actually it is the sorting engine     said groat .     it   s the curse of the post office  sir .  it had imps in it for the actual reading of the envelopes  but they all evaporated years ago .  just as well  too .      moist   s gaze took in the wire racks that occupied a whole wall of the big room .  it also found the chalk outlines on the floor .  the chalk glowed in the strange light .  the outlines were quite small .  one of them had five fingers .      industrial accident     he muttered .     all right  mr .  groat .  tell me .         don   t go near the glow  sir     said groat .     that   s what i said to mr .  whobblebury .  but he snuck down here all by hisself  later on .  oh dear  sir  it was poor young stanley that went and found him  sir  after he saw poor little tiddles dragging something along the passage .  a scene of car nage met his eyes .  you just can   t imagine what it was like in here  sir .         i think i can     said moist .      i doubt if you can  sir .         i can  really .         i   m sure you can   t  sir .         i can .  all right .     shouted moist .     do you think i can   t see all those little chalk outlines .  now can we get on with it before i throw up .         er   right you are  sir .     said groat .     ever heard of bloody stupid johnson .  quite famous in this city .         didn   t he build things .  wasn   t there always something wrong with them .  i   m sure i read something about him           that   s the man  sir .  he built all kinds of things  but  sad to say  there was always some major flaw .      in moist   s brain  a memory kicked a neuron .     wasn   t he the man who specified quicksand as a building material because he wanted a house finished fast .     he said .      that   s right  sir .  usually the major flaw was that the designer was bloody stupid johnson .  flaw  you might say  was part of the whole thing .  actually  to be fair  a lot of the things he designed worked quite well  it was just that they didn   t do the job they were supposed to .  this thing  sir  did indeed begin life as an organ  but it ended up as a machine for sorting letters .  the idea was that you tipped the mail sack in that hopper  and the letters were speedily sorted into those racks .  postmaster cowerby meant well  they say .  he was a stickler for speed and efficiency  that man .  my grandad told me the post office spent a fortune on getting it to work .         and lost their money  eh .     said moist .      oh no  sir .  it worked .  oh yes  it worked very well .  well enough so people went mad  come the finish .         let me guess     said moist .     the postmen had to work too hard .         oh  postmen always work too hard  sir     said groat  without blinking .     no  what got people worried was finding letters in the sorting tray a year before they were due to be written .      there was silence .  in that silence  moist tried out a variety of responses  from    pull the other one  it has got bells on    to    that   s impossible     and decided they all sounded stupid .  groat looked deadly serious .  so instead he said     how .      the old postman pointed to the blue glow .      have a squint inside  sir .  you can just see it .  don   t get right above it  whatever you do .      moist moved a little closer to the machine and peered into the machinery .  he could just make out  at the heart of the glow  a little wheel .  it was turning slowly .      i was raised in the post office     said groat behind him .     born in the sorting room  weighed on the official scales .  learned to read from envelopes  learned figuring from old ledgers  learned jography from looking at the maps of the city and history from the old men .  better than any school .  better than any school  sir .  but never learned jommetry  sir .  bit of a hole in my understanding  all that stuff about angles and suchlike .  but this  sir  is all about pie .         like in food .     said moist  drawing back from the sinister glow .      no  no  sir .  pie like in jommetry .         oh  you mean pi  the number you get when       moist paused .  he was erratically good at math  which is to say he could calculate odds and currency very  very fast .  there had been a geometry section in his book at school  but he   d never seen the point .  he tried  anyway .      it   s all to do with   it   s the number you get when the radius of a circle   no  the length of the rim of a wheel is three and a bit times the   er           something like that  sir  probably  something like that     said groat .     three and a bit  that   s the ticket .  only bloody stupid johnson said that was untidy  so he designed a wheel where the pie was exactly three .  and that   s it  in there .         but that   s impossible .     said moist .     you can   t do that .  pi is like   built in .  you can   t change it .  you   d have to change the universe .         yes  sir .  they tell me that   s what happened     said groat calmly .     i   ll do the party trick now .  stand back  sir .      groat wandered out into the other cellars and came back with a length of wood .      stand further back  sir     he suggested  and tossed the piece of wood on top of the machine .   the noise wasn   t loud .  it was a sort of clop .  it seemed to moist that something happened to the wood when it went over the light .  there was a suggestion of curvature     several pieces of timber clattered onto the floor  along with a shower of splinters .      they had a wizard in to look at it     said groat .     he said the machine twists just a little bit of the universe so pie could be three  sir  but it plays hob with anything you put too near it .  the bits that go missing get lost in the   space time continuememememem  sir .  but it doesn   t happen to the letters  because of the way they travel through the machine  you see .  that   s the long and short of it  sir .  some letters came out of that machine fifty years before they were posted .         why didn   t you switch it off .         couldn   t  sir .  it kept on going like a siphon .  anyway  the wizard said if we did that  terrible things might happen .     cos of  er  quantum  i think .         well  then  you could just stop feeding it mail  couldn   t you .         ah  well  sir  there it is     said groat  snatching his beard .     you have positioned your digit right on the nub  or crux  sir .  we should   ve done that  sir  we should   ve  but we tried to make it work for us  you see .  oh  the management had schemes  sir .  how about delivering a letter in dolly sisters thirty seconds after it had been posted in the city center  eh .  of course  it wouldn   t be polite to deliver mail before we   d actually got it  sir  but it could be a close run thing  eh .  we were good  so we tried to be better        and  somehow  it was all familiar     moist listened glumly .  time travel was only a kind of magic  after all .  that   s why it always went wrong .   that   s why there were postmen  with real feet .  that   s why the clacks was a string of expensive towers .  come to that  it was why farmers grew crops and fishermen trawled nets .  oh  you could do it all by magic  you certainly could .  you could wave a wand and get twinkly stars and a fresh baked loaf .  you could make fish jump out of the sea already cooked .  and then  somewhere  somehow  magic would present its bill  which was always more than you could afford .   that   s why it was left to wizards  who knew how to handle it safely .  not doing any magic at all was the chief task of wizards   not    not doing magic    because they couldn   t do magic  but not doing magic when they could do and didn   t .  any ignorant fool can fail to turn someone else into a frog .  you have to be clever to refrain from doing it when you knew how easy it was .  there were places in the world commemorating those times when wizards hadn   t been quite as clever as that  and on many of them the grass would never grow again .   anyway  there was a sense of inevitability about this whole business .  people wanted to be fooled .  they really believed that you found gold nuggets lying on the ground  that this time you could find the lady  that just for once the glass ring might be real diamond .   words spilled out of mr .  groat like stashed mail from a crack in the wall .  sometimes the machine had produced a thousand copies of the same letter  or filled the room with letters from next tuesday  next month  next year .  sometimes they were letters that hadn   t been written  or might have been written  or were meant to have been written  or letters that people had once sworn that they had written and hadn   t really  but which nevertheless had a shadowy existence in some strange  invisible letter world and were made real by the machine .   if  somewhere  any possible world can exist  then somewhere there is any letter that could possibly be written .  somewhere  all those checks really were in the mail .   they poured out   letters from the present day  which turned out not to be from this present day  but ones that might have happened if only some small detail had been changed .  it didn   t matter that the machine had been switched off  the wizards said .  it existed in plenty of other presents  and so worked here owing to   a lengthy sentence  which the postmen didn   t understand but which had the words like    portal        multidimensional     and    quantum    in it     quantum    being in it twice .  they didn   t understand  but they had to do something .  no one could deliver all that mail .  and so the rooms began to fill up     the wizards from unseen university had been jolly interested in the problem  like doctors being really fascinated by some new  virulent disease  the patient appreciates all the interest but would very much prefer it if they either came up with a cure or stopped prodding .   the machine couldn   t be stopped and certainly shouldn   t be destroyed  the wizard said .  destroying the machine might well cause this universe to stop existing  instantly .   on the other hand  the post office was filling up  so one day chief postal inspector rumbelow had gone into the room with a crowbar  had ordered all the wizards out  and belted the machine until things stopped whirring .   the letters ceased  at least .  this came as a huge relief  but nevertheless  the post office had its regulations  and so the chief postal inspector was brought before postmaster cowerby and asked why he had decided to risk destroying the whole universe in one go .   according to post office legend  mr .  rumbelow had replied     firstly  sir  i reasoned that if i destroyed the universe all in one go  no one would know  secondly  when i walloped the thing the first time  the wizards ran away  so i surmised that unless they has another universe to run to they weren   t really certain  and lastly  sir  the bloody thing was getting on my nerves .  never could stand machinery  sir .         and that was the end of it  sir     said mr .  groat as they left the room .     actually  i heard where the wizards were saying that the universe was destroyed all in one go but instantly came back in one go .  they said they could tell by lookin     sir .  so that was okay and it let old rumbelow off   ve the hook  on account it   s hard to discipline a man under post office regulations for destroying the universe all in one go .  mind you  hah  there   ve been postmasters that would have given it a try .  but it knocked the stuffing out of us  sir .  it was all downhill after that .  the men had lost heart .  it broke us  to tell you the truth .         look     said moist     the letters we   ve just given the lads  they   re not from some other dimension or           don   t worry  i checked    em last night     said groat .     they   re just old .  mostly you can tell by the stamp .  i   m good at telling which ones are propl   y ours  sir .  had years to learn .  it   s a skill  sir .         could you teach other people .         i daresay  yes     said groat .      mr .  groat  the letters have spoken to me     moist burst out .   to his surprise  the old man grabbed his hand and shook it .     well done  sir .     he said  tears rising in his eyes .     i said it   s a skill  didn   t i .  listen to the whispers  that   s half the trick .  they   re alive  sir  alive .  not like people  but like   ships are alive  sir .  i   ll swear  all them letters pressed together in here  all the   the passion of    em  sir  why  i do think this place has got something like a soul  sir  indeed i do        the tears coursed down groat   s cheeks .  it   s madness  of course  thought moist .  but now i   ve got it  too .      ah  i can see it in your eyes  sir  yes i can .     said groat  grinning wetly .     the post office has found you .  it   s enfolded you  sir  yes it has .  you   ll never leave it  sir .  there   s families that   ve worked here for hundreds and hundreds of years  sir .  once the postal service puts its stamp on you  sir  there   s no turning back        moist disentangled his hand as tactfully as he could .      yes     he said .     do tell me about stamps .         thump .   moist looked down at the piece of paper .  smudgy red letters  chipped and worn  spelled out ankh morpork post office .      that   s right  sir     said groat  waving the heavy metal and wood stamper in the air .     i bang the stamp on the ink pad here  then bang it  sir  bang it on the letter .  there .  see .  done it again .  same every time .  stamped .         and this is worth a penny .     said moist .     good grief  man  a kid could forge this with half a potato .         that was always a bit of a problem  sir  yes     said groat .      why does a postman have to stamp the letters  anyway .     said moist .     why don   t we just sell people a stamp .         but they   d pay a penny and then go on stamping forever  sir     said groat reasonably .   in the machinery of the universe  the wheels of inevitability clicked into position        well  then     said moist  staring thoughtfully at the paper     how about   how about a stamp you can use only   once .         you mean  like  not much ink .     said groat .  his brow wrinkled  causing his toupee to slip sideways .      i mean   if you stamped the stamper lots of times on paper  then cut out all the stampings       moist stared at an inner vision  if only to avoid the sight of the toupee slowly crawling back .     the rate for delivery anywhere in the city is a penny  isn   t it .         except for the shades  sir  that   s five pence    cos of the armed guard     said groat .      right .  o kay .  i think i might have something here       moist looked up at mr .  pump  who was smoldering in the corner of the office .     mr .  pump  would you be so good as to go along to the goat and spirit level over at hen and chickens and ask the publican for    mr .  robinson   s box     please .  he may want a dollar .  and while you   re over there  there   s a printing shop over that way  teemer and spools .  leave a message to say that the postmaster general wishes to discuss a very large order .         teemer and spools .  they   re very expensive  sir     said groat .     they do all the posh printing for the banks .         they   re the very devil to forge  i know that     said moist .     or so i   ve been told     he added quickly .     watermarks  special weaves in the paper  all kinds of tricks .  ahem .  so   a penny stamping  and a five penny stamping   what about post to the other cities .         five pence to sto lat     said groat .     ten or fifteen to the others .  hah  three dollars for all the way to genua .  we used to have to write those out .         we   ll need a one dollar stamp  then .     moist started to scribble on the scrap of paper .      a dollar stamp .  who   d buy one of those .     said groat .      anyone who wants to send a letter to genua     said moist .     they   ll buy three  eventually .  but for now i   m dropping the price to one dollar .         one dollar .  that   s thousands of miles  sir .     groat protested .      yep .  sounds like a bargain  right .      groat looked torn between exultation and despair .     but we   ve only got a bunch of old men  sir .  they   re pretty spry  i   ll grant you  but   well  you   ve got to learn to walk before you try to run  sir .         no .     moist   s fist thumped the table .     never say that  tolliver .  never .  run before you walk .  fly before you crawl .  keep moving forward .  you think we should try to get a decent mail service in the city .  i think we should try to send letters anywhere in the world .  because if we fail  i   d rather fail really hugely .  all or nothing  mr .  groat .         wow  sir .     said groat .   moist grinned his bright  sunny smile .  it very nearly reflected off his suit .      let   s get busy .  we   re going to need more staff  postal inspector groat .  a lot more staff .  smarten up  man .  the post office is back .         yessir .     said groat  drunk on enthusiasm .     we   ll   we   ll do things that are quite new  in interestin    ways .         you   re getting the hang of it already     said moist  rolling his eyes .      ten minutes later  the post office received its first delivery .   it was senior postman bates  blood streaming down his face .  he was helped into the office by two watch officers  carrying a makeshift stretcher .      found him wandering in the street  sir     said one of them .     sergeant colon  sir  at your service .         what happened to him .     said moist  horrified .   bates opened his eyes .     sorry  sir     he murmured     i held on tight  but they belted me over the bonce with a big thing .         coupla toughs jumped him     said sergeant colon .     they threw his bag in the river  too .         does that normally happen to postmen .     said moist .     i thought   oh  no        the new  painfully slow arrival was senior postman aggy  dragging one leg because it had a bulldog attached to it .      sorry about this  sir     he said  limping forward     i think my official trousers is torn .  i stunned the bugger with my bag  sir  but they   re a devil to get to let go .     the bulldog   s eyes were shut  it appeared to be thinking of something else .      good job you   ve got your armor  eh .     said moist .      wrong leg  sir .  but not to worry .  i   m nat   rally impervious around the calfy regions .  it   s all the scar tissue  sir  you could strike matches on it .  jimmy tropes is in trouble  though .  he   s up a tree in hide park .         moist von lipwig strode up market street  face set with grim purpose .  the boards were still up on the golem trust  but they had attracted another layer of graffiti .  the paint on the door was burned and bubbled  too .   he opened the door  and instinct made him duck .  he felt the crossbow bolt zip between the wings of his hat .   miss dearheart lowered the bow .     my gods  it   s you .  i thought for a second sun had appeared in the sky .      moist rose cautiously as she laid the bow aside .      we had a fire bomb last night     she said by way of explanation for attempting to shoot him in the head .      how many golems are for hire right now  miss dearheart .     said moist .      huh .  oh   about   a dozen or so           fine .  i   ll take them .  don   t bother to wrap them up .  i want them down at the post office as soon as possible .         what .     miss dearheart   s normal expression of perpetual annoyance returned .     look  you can   t just walk in  snap your fingers  and order a dozen people like this           they think they   re property .     said moist .     that   s what you told me .      they glared at one another .  then miss dearheart fumbled distractedly in a filing tray .      i can let you ha   employ four right now     she said .     that   d be doors i  saw     campanile    and   anghammarad .  only anghammarad can talk at the moment  the frees haven   t helped the others yet           helped .      miss dearheart shrugged .     a lot of the cultures that built golems thought tools shouldn   t talk .  they have no tongues .         and the trust gives them some extra clay  eh .     said moist cheerfully .   she gave him a look .     it   s a bit more mystical than that     she said solemnly .      well  dumb is okay so long as they   re not stupid     said moist  trying to look serious .     this anghammarad   s got a name .  not just a description .         a lot of the very old ones have .  tell me  what do you want them to do .     said the woman .      be postmen     said moist .      working in public .         i don   t think you can have secret postmen     said moist  briefly seeing shadowy figures skulking from door to door .     anything wrong with that .         well   no .  certainly not .  it   s just that people get a bit nervous and set fire to the shop .  i   ll bring them down as soon as possible .     she paused .     you do understand that owned golems have to have a day off every week .  you did read the pamphlet  didn   t you .         er   time off .     said moist .     what do they need time off for .  a hammer doesn   t get time off  does it .         in order to be golems .  don   t ask what they do  i think just go and sit in a cellar somewhere .  it   s   it   s a way to show they   re not a hammer  mr .  lipwig .  the buried ones forget .  the free golems teach them .  but don   t worry  the rest of the time they won   t even sleep .         so   mr .  pump has a day off coming .     said moist .      of course     said miss dearheart  and moist filed this one under    useful to know .         good .  thank you     he said .  would you like to have dinner tonight .  moist normally had no trouble with words  but these stuck to his tongue .  there was something pineapple prickly about miss dearheart .  there was something about her expression that said  there   s no possible way you could surprise me  i know all about you .      is there anything else .     she said .     only you   re standing there with your mouth open .         er   no .  that   s fine .  thank you     mumbled moist .   she smiled at him  and bits of moist tingled .      well  off you go then  mr .  lipwig     she said .     brighten up the world like a little sunbeam .         four out of the five postmen were what mr .  groat called horse de combat  and were brewing tea in the mail stuffed cubbyhole that was laughingly called their rest room .  aggy had been sent home after the bulldog had been prised from his leg  moist had a big basket of fruit sent round .  you couldn   t go wrong with a basket of fruit .   well  it had made an impression  at least .  so had the bulldog .  but some mail had been delivered  you had to admit it .  you had to admit  too  that it was years and years late  but the post was moving .  you could sense it in the air .  the place didn   t feel so much like a tomb .  now moist had retired to his office  where he was getting creative .      cup of tea  mr .  lipwig .      he looked up from his work into the slightly strange face of stanley .      thank you  stanley     he said  laying down his pen .     and i see you got nearly all in the cup this time .  nicely done .         what   re you drawing  mr .  lipwig .     said the boy  craning his neck .     it looks like the post office .         well done .  it   s going to be on a stamp  stanley .  here  what do you think of the others .     he passed over the other sketches .      coo  you   re a good draw er  mr .  lipwig .  that looks just like lord vetinari .         that   s the penny stamp     said moist .     i copied the likeness off a penny .  city coat of arms on the two penny  morporkia with her fork of the five penny  tower of art on the big one dollar stamp .  i was thinking of a ten penny stamp  too .         they look very nice  mr .  lipwig     said stanley .     all that detail .  like little paintings .  what   s all those tiny lines called .         cross hatching .  makes them hard to forge .  and when the letter with the stamp on it comes into the post office  you see  we take one of the old rubber stamps and stamp over the new stamps so they can   t be used again  and the           yes     cos they   re like money  really     said stanley cheerfully .      pardon .     said moist  tea halfway to his lips .      like money .  these stamps   ll be like money .     cos a penny stamp is a penny  when you think about it .  are you all right  mr .  lipwig .  only you   ve gone all funny .  mr .  lipwig .         er   what .     said moist  who was staring at the wall with a strange  faraway grin .      are you all right  sir .         what .  oh .  yes .  yes  indeed .  er   do we need a bigger stamp  do you think .  five dollars  perhaps .         hah  i should think you could send a big letter all the way to fourecks for that  mr .  lipwig .     said stanley cheerfully .      worth thinking ahead  then     said moist .     i mean  since we   re designing the stamps and everything        but now stanley was admiring    mr .  robinson   s box .     it was an old friend to moist .  he never used    mr .  robinson    as an alias except to get it stored by some halfway honest merchant or publican  so that it   d be somewhere safe even if he had to leave town quickly .  to a con man and forger it was what a set of lock picks is to a burglar  but with the contents of this box you could open people   s brains .   it was a work of art in its own right  the way all the little compartments lifted up and fanned out when you opened it .  there were pens and inks  of course  but also little pots of paints and tints  stains and solvents .  and  carefully kept flat  thirty six different types of paper  some of them quite hard to obtain .  paper was important .  get the weight and translucence wrong  and no amount of skill would save you .  you could get away with bad penmanship much easier than you could with bad paper .  in fact  rough penmanship often worked better than a week of industrious midnights spent getting every little thing right  because there was something in people   s heads that spotted some little detail that wasn   t quite right but at the same time would fill in details that had merely been suggested by a few careful strokes .  attitude  expectation  and presentation were everything .   just like me  he thought .   the door was knocked on and opened in one movement .      yes .     snapped moist  not looking up .     i   m busy designing mon   stamps here  you know .         there   s a lady     panted groat .     with golems .         ah  that   ll be miss dearheart     said moist  laying down his pen .      yessir  she said     tell mr .  sunshine i   ve brought him his postmen     sir .  you   re going to use golems as postmen  sir .         yes .  why not .     said moist  giving groat a severe look .     you get on okay with mr .  pump  don   t you .         well  he   s all right  sir     the old man mumbled .     i mean  he keeps the place tidy  he   s always very respectful  i speak as i find   but people can be a bit odd about golems  sir  what with them glowing eyes and all  and the way they never stops .  the lads might not take to    em  sir  that   s all i   m saying .      moist stared at him .  golems were thorough  reliable  and  by gods  they took orders .  he   d get another chance to be smiled at by miss dearheart   think about golems .  golems  golems  golems .   he smiled and said     even if i can prove they   re real postmen .         ten minutes later  the fist of the golem called anghammarad smashed through a letterbox and several square inches of splintering wood .      mail delivered     it announced  and went still .  the eyes dulled .   moist turned to the cluster of human postmen and gestured toward the impromptu postman   s walk he   d set up in the big hall .      note the flattened roller skate  gentlemen .  note the heap of ground glass where the beer bottle was .  and mr .  anghammarad did it all with a hood on his head  i might point out .         yeah  but his eyes burned holes in it     groat pointed out .      none of us can help the way we   re made     said adora belle dearheart primly .      i   ve got to admit  it did my heart good to see him punch through that door     said senior postman bates .     that   ll teach    em to put    em low and sharp .         and no problem with dogs  i expect     said jimmy tropes .     he   d never get the arse bitten out of his trousers .         so you all agree a golem is suitable to become a postman .     said moist .   suddenly all the faces twisted up as the postmen shuffled into a chorus      well  it   s not us  you understand              people can be a bit funny about  er  clay folk              all that stuff about taking jobs away from real people           nothing against him at all but        they stopped  because the golem anghammarad was beginning to speak again .  unlike mr .  pump  it took him some time to get up to speed .  and when his voice arrived  it seemed to be coming from long ago and far away  like the sound of surf in a fossil shell .   he said     what is a postman .         a messenger  anghammarad     said miss dearheart .  moist noticed that she spoke to golems differently .  there was actual tenderness in her voice .      gentlemen     he said to the postmen     i know you feel           i was a messenger     anghammarad rumbled .   his voice was not like mr .  pump   s  and neither was his clay .  he looked like a crude jigsaw puzzle of different clays  from almost black through red to light gray .  anghammarad   s eyes  unlike the furnace glow of those of the other golems  burned a deep ruby red .  he looked old .  more than that  he felt old .  the chill of time radiated off him .   on one arm  just above the elbow  was a metal box on a corroded band that had stained the clay .      running errands  eh .     said groat nervously .      most recently i delivered the decrees of king het of thut     said anghammarad .      never heard of any king het     said jimmy tropes .      i expect that is because the land of thut slid under the sea nine thousand years ago     said the golem solemly .     so it goes .         blimey .  you   re nine thousand years old .     said groat .      no .  i am almost nineteen thousand years old  having been born in the fire by the priests of upsa in the third ning of the shaving of the goat .  they gave me a voice that i might carry messages .  of such things is the world made .         never heard of them  either     said tropes .      upsa was destroyed by the explosion of mount shiputu .  i spent two centuries under a mountain of pumice before it eroded  whereupon i became a messenger for the fishermen kings of the holy ult .  it could have been worse .         you must   ve seen lots of things  sir .     said stanley .   the glowing eyes turned to him  lighting up his face .     sea urchins .  i have seen many sea urchins .  and sea cucumbers .  and the dead ships  sailing .  once there was an anchor .  all things pass .         how long were you under the sea .     said moist .      it was almost nine thousand years .         you mean   you just sat there .     said aggy .      i was not instructed to do otherwise .  i heard the song of the whales above me .  it was dark .  then there was a net  and rising  and light .  these things happen .         didn   t you find it   well  dull .     said groat .  the postmen were staring .      dull     said anghammarad blankly  and turned to look at miss dearheart .      he has no idea what you mean     she said .     none of them have .  not even the younger ones .         so i expect you   ll be keen to deliver messages again  then .     said moist  far more jovially than he   d intended .  the golem   s head turned toward miss dearheart again .      keen .     said anghammarad .   she sighed .     another tough one  mr .  moist .  it   s as bad as    dull .     the closest i can come is     you will satisfy the imperative to perform the directed action .            yes     said the golem .     the messages must be delivered .  that is written on my chem .         that   s the scroll in their heads that gives a golem his instructions     said miss dearheart .     in anghammarad   s case  it   s a clay tablet .  they didn   t have paper in those days .         you really used to deliver messages for kings .     said groat .      many kings     said anghammarad .     many empires .  many gods .  many gods .  all gone .  all things go .     the golem   s voice got deeper  as if he was quoting from memory .     neither deluge nor ice storm nor the black silence of the netherhells shall stay these messengers about their sacred business .  do not ask us about saber toothed tigers  tar pits  big green things with teeth  or the goddess czol .         you had big green things with teeth back then .     said tropes .      bigger .  greener .  more teeth     rumbled anghammarad .      and the goddess czol .     said moist .      do not ask .      there was a thoughtful silence .  moist knew how to break it .      and you will decide if he is a postman .     he said softly .   the postmen went into a brief huddle  and then groat turned back to moist .      he   s a postman and a half  mr .  moist .  we never knew .  the lads say   well  it   d be an honor  sir  an honor to work with him .  i mean  it   s like   it   s like history  sir .  it   s like   well           i always said the order goes back a long way  didn   t i .     said jimmy tropes  aglow with pride .     there was postmen back inna dawn    o time .  when they hears we   ve got a member who goes all that way back  the other secret societies are gonna be as green as  as           something big with teeth .     moist suggested .      right .  and no problem with his chums  neither  if they can take orders     said groat generously .      thank you  gentlemen     said moist .     and now all that remains      he nodded to stanley  who held up two bit tins of royal blue paint      is their uniform .      by general agreement  anghammarad was given the unique rank of extremely senior postman .  it seemed   fair .   half an hour later  still tacky to the touch  each one accompanied by a human postman  the golems took to the streets .  moist watched heads turn .  the afternoon sunlight glinted off royal blue and stanley  gods bless him  had found a small pot of gold paint  too .  frankly  the golems were impressive .  they gleamed .   you had to give people a show .  give them a show  and you were halfway to where you wanted to be .   a voice behind him said       the postman came down like a wolf on the fold   his cohorts all gleaming in azure and gold       just for a moment  a flicker of time  moist thought  i   ve been made  she knows .  somehow  she knows .  then his brain took over .  he turned to miss dearheart .      when i was a kid  i always thought that a cohort was a piece of armor  miss dearheart     he said  giving her a smile .     i used to imagine the troops sitting up all night  polishing them .         sweet     said miss dearheart  lighting a cigarette .     look  i   ll get you the rest of the golems as soon as possible .  there may be trouble  of course .  the watch will be on your side  though .  there   s a free golem in the watch and they rather like him  although here it doesn   t much matter what you   re made of when you join the watch  because commander vimes will see to it that you become solid copper through and through .  he   s the most cynical bastard that walks under the sun .         you think he   s cynical       said moist .      yes     she said  blowing smoke .     as you suspect  that   s practically a professional opinion .  but thank you for hiring the boys .  i   m not sure they understand what    liking    something means  but they like to work .  and pump    seems to hold you in some regard .         thank you .         i personally think you are a phoney .         yes  i expect you do     said moist .  ye gods  miss dearheart was hard work .  he   d met women he couldn   t charm  but they   d been foothills compared to the icy heights of mt .  dearheart .  it was an act .  it had to be .  it was a game .  it had to be .   he pulled out his packet of stamp designs .      what do you think of these  miss d   look  what do your friends call you  miss dearheart .      and in his head moist said to himself  i don   t know  just as the woman said     i don   t know .  what   s this .  you carry your etchings with you to save time .      so it was a game  and he was invited to play .      they will be copper engraved  i hope     he said meekly .     they   re my designs for the new stamps .     he explained about the stamps idea  while she looked at the pages .      good one of vetinari     she said .     they say he dyes his hair  you know .  what   s this one .  oh  the tower of art   how like a man .  a dollar  eh .  hmm .  yes  they   re quite good .  when will you use them .         actually  i was planning to slip along to teemer and spools while the lads are out now  and discuss the engraving     said moist .      good .  they   re a decent firm     she said .     sluice    is turning the machinery for them .  they keep him clean and don   t stick notices on him .  i go and check on all the hired golems every week .  the frees are very insistent on that .         to make sure they   re not mistreated .     said moist .      to make sure they   re not forgotten .  you   d be amazed at how many businesses in the city have a golem working somewhere on the premises .  not the grand trunk  though     she added .     i won   t let them work there .      there was an edge to that statement .      er   why not .     said moist .      there   s some shit not even a golem should work in     said miss dearheart  in the same steel tone .     they are moral creatures .      o kay  thought moist  bit of a sore point there  then .   his mouth said     would you like to have dinner tonight .     for just the skin of a second  miss dearheart was surprised  but not half as surprised as moist .  then her natural cynicism reinflated .      i like to have dinner every night .  with you .  no .  i have things to do .  thank you for asking .         no problem     said moist  slightly relieved .   the woman looked around the echoing hall .     doesn   t this place give you the creeps .  you could perhaps do something with some floral wallpaper and a firebomb .         it   s all going to be sorted out     said moist quickly .     but it   s best to get things moving as soon as possible .  to show we   re in business .      they watched stanley and groat  who were patiently sorting at the edge of a pile  prospectors in the foothills of the postal mountain .  they were dwarfed by the white hillocks .      it will take you forever to deliver them  you know     said miss dearheart  turning to go .      yes  i know     said moist .      but that   s the thing about golems     added miss dearheart  standing in the doorway .  the light caught her face oddly .     they   re not frightened of    forever .     they   re not frightened of anything .          chapter     tomb of words      the invention of the hole     mr .  lipwig speaks out      the wizard in a jar     a discussion of lord vetinari   s  backside     a promise to deliver     mr .  hobson   s boris      in his ancient office smelling of oil and ink  mr .  spools was impressed by this strange young man in the golden suit and wing  d hat .      you certainly know your papers  mr .  lipwig     he said  as moist thumbed through the samples .     it   s a pleasure to meet a customer who does .  always use the right paper for the job  that   s what i say .         the important thing is to make stamps hard to forge     said moist  leafing through the samples .     on the other hand  it mustn   t cost us anything like a penny to produce a penny stamp .         watermarks are your friend there  mr .  lipwig     said mr .  spools .      not impossible to fake  though     said moist  and then added     so i   ve been told .         oh  we know all the tricks  mr .  lipwig  don   t you worry about that .     said mr .  spools .     we   re up to scratch  oh yes .  chemical voids  thaumic shadows  timed inks  everything .  we do paper and engraving and even printing for some of the leading figures in the city  although of course i am not at liberty to tell you who they are .      he sat back in his worn leather chair and scribbled in a notebook for a moment .      well  we could do you twenty thousand of the penny stamps  uncoated stock  gummed  at two dollars a thousand plus setup     said mr .  spools .     ten pence less for ungummed .  you   ll have to find someone to cut them out  of course .         can   t you do that with some kind of machine .     said moist .      no .  wouldn   t work  not with things as small as this .  sorry  mr .  lipwig .      moist pulled a scrap of brown paper out of his pocket and held it up .      do you recognize this  mr .  spools .         what  is that a pin paper .     mr .  spools beamed .     hah  that takes me back .  still got my old collection in the attic  i   ve always thought it must be worth a bob or two if only           watch this  mr .  spools     said moist  gripping the paper carefully .  stanley was almost painfully precise in placing his pins  a man with a micrometer couldn   t have done it better .   gently  the paper tore down the line of holes .  moist looked at mr .  spools and raised his eyebrows .      it   s all about holes     he said .     it ain   t nothing if it ain   t got hole        three hours went past .  foremen were sent for .  serious men in overalls turned things on lathes  other men soldered things together  tried them out  changed this  reamed that  then dismantled a small hand press and built it in a different way .  moist loitered on the periphery of all this  clearly bored  while the serious men fiddled  measured things  rebuilt things  tinkered  lowered things  raised things  and  eventually  watched by moist and mr .  spools  tried out the converted press officially     chonk     it felt to moist that everyone was holding their breath so hard that the windows were bending inwards .  he reached down  eased the sheet of little perforated squares off the board  and lifted it up .   he tore off one stamp .   the windows buckled outwards .  people breathed again .  there wasn   t a cheer .  these weren   t men to cheer and whoop at a job well done .  instead  they lit their pipes and nodded to one another .   mr .  spools and moist von lipwig shook hands over the perforated paper .      the patent is yours  mr .  spools     said moist .      you   re very kind  mr .  lipwig .  very kind indeed .  oh  here   s a little souvenir        an apprentice had bustled up with a sheet of paper .  to moist   s astonishment  it was already covered with stamps   ungummed  unperforated  but perfect miniature copies of his drawing for the one penny stamp .      iconodiabolic engraving  mr .  lipwig .     said spools  seeing his face .     no one can say we   re behind the times .  of course  there   ll be a few little flaws this time round  but by early next week we   ll           i want penny and two penny ones tomorrow  please  mr .  spools  please     said moist firmly .     i don   t need perfect  i want quick .         my word  you   re quick off the mark  mr .  lipwig .         always move fast  mr .  spools  you never know who   s catching up .         hah .  yes .  er   good motto  mr .  lipwig .  nice one     said mr .  spools  grinning uncertainly .      and i want the five pennies and one dollars the day after  please .         you   ll scorch your boots  mr .  moist .     said spools .      got to move  mr .  spools  got to fly .      moist hurried back to the post office as fast as decently possible  feeling slightly ashamed .   he liked teemer and spools .  he liked the kind of business where you could actually speak to the man whose name was over the door  it meant it probably wasn   t run by crooks .  and he liked the big  solid  unflappable workmen  recognizing in them all the things he knew he lacked  like stead fastness  solidarity  and honesty .  you couldn   t lie to a lathe or fool a hammer .  they were good people  and quite unlike him     one way in which they were quite unlike him was that none of them  right now  probably had wads of stolen notepaper stuffed into their jackets .   he really shouldn   t have done it  he really shouldn   t .  it was just that mr .  spools was a kind and enthusiastic man and the desk had been covered with examples of his wonderful work  and when the perforation press was being made people had been bustling around and not really paying moist much attention and he   d   tidied up .  he couldn   t help himself .  he was a crook .  what did vetinari expect .      the postmen were arriving back as he walked into the building .  mr .  groat was waiting for him with a worried smile on his face .      how   s it going  postal inspector .     said moist cheerfully .      pretty well  sir  pretty well .  there   s good news  sir .  people have been giving us letters to post  sir .  not many yet  and some of them are a bit  er  jokey  but we got a penny of   f them every time .  that   s seven pence  sir     he added proudly  proffering the coins .      oh boy  we eat tonight .     said moist  taking the coins and pocketing the letters .      sorry  sir .         oh  nothing  mr .  groat .  well done .  er   you said there was good news .  is there any of the other sort  perhaps    .         um   some people didn   t like getting their mail  sir .         things got posted through the wrong doors .     said moist .      oh  no  sir .  but old letters ain   t always welcome .  not when they   re  as it might be  a will .  a will .  as in last will and testament  sir     the old man added meaningfully .     as in  it turns out the wrong daughter got mum   s jewelery twenty years ago .  as it were .         oh dear     said moist .      the watch had to be called in  sir .  there was what they call in the papers a    rumpus    in weaver street  sir .  there   s a lady waiting for you in your office  sir .         oh gods  not one of the daughters .         no  sir .  she   s a writing lady from the times .  you can   t trust    em  sir  although they do a very reasonable crossword     groat added conspiratorially .      what does she want me for .         couldn   t say  sir .  i expect it   s    cos you   re postmaster .         go and   make her some tea or something  will you .     said moist  patting his jacket .     i   ll just go and   pull myself together        two minutes later  with the stolen paper tucked safely away  moist strode into his office .   mr .  pump was standing by the door  fiery eyes banked  in the stance of a golem with no current task other than to exist  and a woman was sitting in the chair by moist   s desk .   moist sized her up .  attractive  certainly  but dressing apparently to downplay the fact while artfully enhancing it .  bustles were back in fashion in the city for some inexplicable reason  but her only concession there was a bum roll  which achieved a certain perkiness in the rear without the need to wear twenty seven pounds of dangerously springloaded underwear .  she was blond but wore her hair in a bag net  another careful touch  while a small and quietly fashionable hat perched on top of her head to no particular purpose .  a large shoulder bag was by her chair  a notebook was on her knee  and she wore a wedding ring .      mr .  lipwig .     she said brightly .     i am miss cripslock .  from the times .      okay  wedding ring but nevertheless    miss     thought moist .  handle with care .  probably has views .  do not attempt to kiss hand .      and how can i assist the times .     he said  sitting down and giving her a non condescending smile .      do you intend to deliver all the backlog of mail  mr .  lipwig .         if at all possible  yes     said moist .      why .         it   s my job .  rain  snow  gloom of night  just like it says over the door .         have you heard about the fracas in weaver street .         i heard it was a rumpus .         i   m afraid it   s got worse .  there was a house on fire when i left .  doesn   t that worry you .     miss cripslock   s pencil was suddenly poised .   moist   s face remained expressionless as he thought furiously .      yes  it does  of course     he said .     people shouldn   t set fire to houses .  but i also know that mr .  parker of the merchants    guild is marrying his boyhood sweetheart on saturday .  did you know that .      miss cripslock hadn   t  but she scribbled industriously as moist told her about the greengrocer   s letter .      that   s very interesting     she said .     i will go and see him immediately .  so you   re saying that delivering the old mail is a good thing .         delivering the mail is the only thing     said moist  and hesitated again .  just on the edge of hearing was a whispering .      is there a problem .     said miss cripslock .      what .  no .  what was i   yes  it   s the right thing .  history is not to be denied  miss cripslock .  and we are a communicating species  miss cripslock .     moist raised his voice to drown out the whispering .     the mail must get through .  it must be delivered .         er   you needn   t shout  mr .  lipwig     said the reporter  leaning backwards .   moist tried to get a grip  and the whispering died down a little .      i   m sorry     he said  and cleared his throat .     yes  i intend to deliver all the mail .  if people have moved  we will try to find them .  if they have died  we   ll try to deliver to their descendants .  the post will be delivered .  we are tasked to deliver it  and deliver it we will .  what else should we do with it .  burn it .  throw it in the river .  open it to decide if it   s important .  no  the letters were entrusted to our care .  delivery is the only way .      the whispering had almost died away now  so he went on     besides  we need the space .  the post office is being reborn .     he pulled out the sheet of stamps .     with these .      she peered at them  puzzled .      little pictures of lord vetinari .     she said .      stamps  miss cripslock .  one of those stuck on a letter will ensure delivery anywhere within the city .  these are early sheets  but tomorrow we will be selling them gummed and perforated for ease of use .  i intend to make it easy to use the post .  obviously we are still finding our feet  but i intend that we soon should be capable of delivering a letter to anyone  anywhere in the world .      it was a stupid thing to say  but his tongue had taken over .      aren   t you being rather ambitious  mr .  lipwig .     she said .      i   m sorry  i don   t know any other way to be     said moist .      i was thinking that we do have the clacks now .         the clacks .     said moist .     i daresay the clacks is wonderful if you wish to know the prawn market figures from genua .  but can you write s . w . a . l . k .  on a clacks .  can you seal it with a loving kiss .  can you cry tears onto a clacks  can you smell it  can you enclose a pressed flower .  a letter is more than just a message .  and a clacks is so expensive in any case that the average man in the street can just about afford it in a time of crisis  grandads dead funeral tues .  a day   s wages to send a message as warm and human as a thrown knife .  but a letter is real .      he stopped .  miss cripslock was scribbling like mad  and it   s always worrying to see a journalist take a sudden interest in what you   re saying  especially when you half suspect it was a load of pigeon guano .  and it gets worse when they   re smiling .      people are complaining that the clacks is becoming expensive  slow  and unreliable     said miss cripslock .     how do you feel about that .         all i can tell you is that today we   ve taken on a postman who is eighteen thousand years old     said moist .     he doesn   t break down very easily .         ah  yes .  the golems .  some people say           what is your first name  miss cripslock .     said moist .   for a moment  the woman colored .  then she said     it   s sacharissa .         thank you .  i   m moist .  please don   t laugh .  the golems   you   re laughing  aren   t you           it was just a cough  honestly     said the reporter  raising a hand to her throat and coughing unconvincingly .      sorry .  it sounded a bit like a laugh .  sacharissa  i need postmen  counter clerks  sorters   i need lots of people .  the mail will move .  i need people to help me move it .  any kind of people .  ah  thanks  stanley .      the boy had come with two mismatched mugs of tea .  one had an appealing little kitten on it  except that erratic collisions in the washing up bowl had scratched it so that its expression was that of a creature in the final stages of rabies .  the other had once hilariously informed the world that clinical insanity wasn   t necessary for employment  but most of the words had faded  leaving     you don   t have to be mad  to work here but it helps    he put them down with care on moist   s desk  stanley did everything carefully .      thank you     moist repeated .     er   you can go now  stanley .  help with the sorting  eh .         there   s a vampire in the hall  mr .  lipwig     said stanley .      that will be otto     said sacharissa quickly .     you don   t have a   a thing about vampires  do you .         hey  if he   s got a pair of hands and knows how to walk  i   ll give him a job .         he   s already got one     said sacharissa  laughing .     he   s our chief iconographer .  he   s been taking pictures of your men at work .  we   d very much like to have one of you .  for the front page .         what .  no .     said moist .     please .  no .         he   s very good .         yeah  but   but   but       moist began  and in his head the sentence went on  but i don   t think that even a talent for looking like half the men you see in the street would survive a picture .   what actually came out was     i don   t want to be singled out from all the hardworking men and golems who are putting the post office back on its feet .  after all  there   s no    me    in team  eh .         actually  there is     said sacharissa .     besides  you   re the one wearing the wing  d hat and the golden suit .  come on  mr .  lipwig .         all right  all right  i really didn   t want to go into this  but it   s against my religion .     said moist  who   d had time to think .     we   re forbidden to have any image made of us .  it removes part of the soul  you know .         and you believe that .     said sacharissa .     really .         er  no .  no .  of course not .  not as such .  but   but you can   t treat religion as a sort of buffet  can you .  i mean  you can   t say     yes please  i   ll have some of the celestial paradise and a helping of the divine plan but go easy on the kneeling and none of the prohibition of images  they give me wind .     it   s table d   h  te or nothing  otherwise   well  it could get silly .      miss cripslock looked at him with her head to one side .      you work for his lordship  don   t you .     she said .      well  of course .  this is an official job .         and i expect you   ll tell me that your previous job was as a clerk  nothing special .         that   s right .         although your name probably is moist von lipwig  because i can   t believe anyone would choose that as an assumed name     she went on .      thank you very much .         it sounds to me as though you   re issuing a challenge  mr .  lipwig .  there   s all sorts of problems with the clacks right now .  there   s been a big stink about the people they   ve been sacking and how the ones that   re left are being worked to death  and up you pop  full of ideas .         i   m serious  sacharissa .  look  people are already giving us new letters to post .      he pulled them out of his pocket and fanned them out .     see  there   s one here to go to dolly sisters  another to nap hill  one for   blind lo           he   s a god     said the woman .     could be a problem .         no     said moist briskly  putting the letters back in his pocket .     we   ll deliver to the gods themselves .  he has three temples in the city .  it   ll be easy .     and you   ve forgotten about the pictures  hooray        a man of resource  i see .  tell me  mr .  moist  do you know much about the history of this place .         not too much .  i   d certainly like to find out where the chandeliers went to .         you haven   t spoken to professor pelc .         who   s he .     said moist .      i   m amazed .  he   s at the university .  he wrote a whole chapter on this place in his book on   oh  something to do with big masses of writing thinking for themselves .  i suppose you do know about the people who died .         oh  yes .         he said the place drove them mad in some way .  well  actually  we said that .  what he said was a lot more complicated .  i have to hand it to you  mr .  lipwig  taking on a job that has killed four men before you .  it takes a special kind of man to do that .      yes  thought moist .  an ignorant one .      you haven   t noticed anything strange yourself .     miss cripslock went on .      well  i think my body traveled in time but the soles of my feet didn   t  but i   m not sure how much of it was hallucination  i was nearly killed in a mailslide  and the letters keep talking to me     were the words that moist didn   t say  because it   s the kind of thing you don   t say to an open notebook .  what he did say was    oh  no .  it   s a fine old building  and i fully intend to bring it back to its former glory .         good .  how old are you  mr .  moist .         twenty six .  is that important .         we like to be thorough .     miss cripslock gave him a sweet smile .     besides  it   s important if we have to write your obituary .         moist marched through the hall  with groat sidling after him .   he pulled the new letters out of his pocket and thrust them into groat   s crabby hands .     get these delivered .  anything addressed to a god goes to his or her or its temple .  any other strange ones  put on my desk .         we picked up another fifteen just now  sir .  people think it   s funny .         got the money .         oh  yes  sir .         then we   re the ones who   re laughing     said moist firmly .     i won   t be long .  i   m off to see the wizard .         by law and tradition  the great library of unseen university is open to the public  although they aren   t allowed as far as the magical shelves .  they don   t realize this  however  since the rules of time and space are twisted inside the library  and so hundreds of miles of shelving can easily be concealed inside a space roughly the thickness of paint .   people flock in  nevertheless  in search of answers to those questions only librarians are considered to be able to answer  such as    is this the laundry .        how do you spell surreptitious .     and  on a regular basis     do you have a book i remember reading once .  it had a red cover and it turned out they were twins .      and  strictly speaking  the library will have it   somewhere .  somewhere it has every book ever written  that ever will be written  and  notably  every book that is possible to write .  these are not on the public shelves lest untrained handling cause the collapse of everything that it is possible to imagine .    like everyone else who entered the library  moist stared up at the dome .  everyone did .  they always wondered why a library that was technically infinite in size was covered by a dome a few hundred feet across  and they were allowed to go on wondering .   just below the dome  staring down from their niches  were statues of the virtues  patience  chastity  silence  charity  hope  tubso  bissonomy   and fortitude .   moist couldn   t resist removing his hat and giving a little salute to hope  to whom he owed so much .  then  as he wondered why the statue of bissonomy was carrying a kettle and what looked like a bunch of parsnips  he collided with someone who grabbed him by the arm and hurried him across the floor .      don   t say a word  don   t say a word  but you are looking for a book  yes .         well  actually       he seemed to be in the clutches of a wizard .         you are not sure what book .     said the wizard .     exactly .  it is the job of a librarian to find the right book for the right person .  if you would just sit here  we can proceed .  thank you .  please excuse the straps .  this will not take long .  it is practically painless .         practically .      moist was pushed  firmly  into a large and complex swivel chair .  his captor  or helper  or whatever he might turn out to be  gave him a reassuring smile .  other  shadowy figures helped him strap moist into the chair  which  while basically an old  horseshoe shaped one with a leather seat  was surrounded by   stuff .  some of it was clearly magical  being of the stars and skulls variety  but what about the jar of pickles  the pair of tongs  and the live mouse in a cage made of     panic gripped moist and  not at all coincidentally  so did a pair of padded paddles  which closed over his ears .  just before all sound was silenced  he heard     you may experience a taste of eggs and the sensation of being slapped in the face with some sort of a fish .  this is perfectly        and then thlabber happened .  it was a traditional magic term  although moist didn   t know this .  there was a moment in which everything  even the things that couldn   t be stretched  felt stretched .  and then there was the moment when everything suddenly went back to not being stretched  known as the moment of thlabber .   when moist opened his eyes again  the chair was facing the other way .  there was no sign of the pickles  the tongs  or the mouse  but in their place was a bucket of clockwork pastry lobsters and a boxed set of novelty glass eyes .   moist gulped and muttered     haddock .         really .  most people say cod     said someone .     no accounting for taste  i suppose .     hands unbuckled moist and helped him to his feet .  these hands belonged to an orangutan  but moist didn   t pass comment .  this was a university of wizards  after all .   the man who had shoved him into the chair was now standing by a desk staring at some wizardly device .      any moment now     he said .     any moment .  any moment now .  any second        a bundle of what appeared to be hosepipes led from the desk into the wall .  moist was certain they bulged for a moment  like a snake eating in a hurry  the machine stuttered  and a piece of paper dropped out of a slot .      ah   here we are     said the wizard  snatching it up .     yes  the book you were after was a history of hats  by f .  g .  smallfinger  am i right .         no .  i   m not after a book  in fact       moist began .      are you sure .  we have lots .      there were two striking things about this wizard .  one was   well  grandfather lipwig has always said that you could tell the honesty of a man by the size of his ears  and this was clearly a very honest wizard .  the other was that the beard he was wearing was clearly false .      i was looking for a wizard called pelc     he ventured .   the beard parted slightly to reveal the wide smile .      i knew the machine would work .     said the wizard .     you are looking  in fact  for me .         the sign on the outside of the office door said  ladislav pelc  d . m . phil  prehumous professor of morbid bibliomancy .   on the inside of the door was a hook  on which the wizard hung his beard .   it was a wizard   s study  so of course it had the skull with a candle on it and a stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling .  no one  least of all wizards  know why this is  but you have to have them .   it was also a room full of books and made of books .  there was no actual furniture  this is to say  the desk and chairs were shaped out of books .  it looked as though many of them were frequently referred to  because they lay open with other books used as bookmarks .      you want to know about your post office  i expect .     said pelc  as moist settled onto a chair carefully put together from volumes   to    of synonyms for the word    plimsoll .         yes  please     said moist .      voices .  strange events .         yes .         how can i put this       mused pelc .     words have power  you understand .  it is in the nature of our universe .  our library itself distorts time and space on quite a grand scale .  well  when the post office started accumulating letters  it was storing words .  in fact  what was being created was what we call a    gevaisa     a tomb of living words .  are you of a literary persuasion  mr .  lipwig .         not as such .     books were a closed book to moist .      would you burn a book .     said pelc .     an old book  say  battered  almost spineless  found in a box of rubbish .         well   probably not     moist admitted .      why not .  would the thought make you uncomfortable .         yes  i suppose it would .  books are   well  you just don   t do that .  er   why do you wear a false beard .  i thought wizards had real ones .         it   s not compulsory  you know  but when we go outside  the public expects beards     said pelc .     it   s like having stars on your robes .  besides  they   re far too hot in the summer .  where was i .  gevaisas .  yes .  all words have some power .  we feel it instinctively .  some  like magical spells and the true names of the gods  have a great deal .  they must be treated with respect .  in klatch  there is a mountain with many caves  and in those caves are entombed more than a hundred thousand old books  mostly religious  each one in a white linen shroud .  that is perhaps an extreme approach  but intelligent people have always known that some words at least should be disposed of with care and respect .         not just shoved in sacks in the attic     said moist .     hold on   a golem called the post office    a tomb of unheard words .            i   m not at all surprised     said professor pelc calmly .     the old gevaisas and libraries used to employ golems  because the only words that have the power to influence them are the ones in their heads .  words are important .  and when there is a critical mass of them  they change the nature of the universe .  did you have what seemed to be hallucinations .         yes .  i was back in time .  but also in the present .         ah  yes .  that   s quite common     said the wizard .     enough words crammed together can affect time and space .         and they spoke to me .         i told the watch the letters wanted to be delivered     said professor pelc .     until a letter is read  it   s not complete .  they will try anything to be delivered .  but they don   t think  as you understand it  and they   re not clever .  they just reach out into any available mind .  i see you   ve already been turned into an avatar .         i can   t fly .         avatar  the living likeness of a god     said the professor patiently .     the hat with wings .  the golden suit .         no  they happened by accident           are you sure .      the room went quiet .      um   i was until right now     said moist .      they   re not trying to hurt anyone  mr .  lipwig     said pelc .     they just want deliverance .         we   ll never be able to deliver them all     said moist .     that   d take years .         the mere fact you   re delivering any will help  i   m sure     said professor pelc  smiling like a doctor telling a man not to worry  the disease is only fatal in eighty seven percent of cases .     is there anything else i can help you with .      he stood up  to indicate that a wizard   s time is valuable .      well  i   d quite like to know where the chandeliers went     said moist .     it   ll be nice to get them back .  symbolic  you could say .         i can   t help you  but i   m sure professor goitre can .  he   s the posthumous professor of morbid bibliomancy .  we could drop in and see him on the way out  if you like .  he   s in the wizards    pantry .         why   s he    posthumous    .     moist asked  as they stepped out into the corridor .      he   s dead     said pelc .      ah   i was kind of hoping that it was going to be a little more metaphorical than that     said moist .      don   t worry  he decided to take early death .  it was a very good package .         oh     said moist .  the important thing at a time like this was to spot the right moment to run  but they   d got here through a maze of dark passages and this was not a place you   d want to get lost in .  something might find you .   they stopped outside a door  through which came the muffled sound of voices and the occasional clink of glassware .  this stopped as soon as the professor pushed open a door and it was hard to see where it could have come from .  this was  indeed  a pantry  quite empty of people  its walls lined with shelves  the shelves filled with little jars .  there was a wizard in each one .   now would be the right time to run  moist   s hindbrain thought  as pelc reached for a jar  unscrewed the lid  and rummaged around in it for the tiny wizard .      oh  this isn   t him     said the professor cheerfully  seeing moist   s expression .     the housekeeper puts these little knitted wizard dolls in just to remind the kitchen staff that the jars shouldn   t be used for anything else .  there was an incident with some peanut butter  i believe .  i just have to take it out so that he doesn   t sound muffled .         so   er  where is the professor  in fact .         oh  in the jar  for a certain value of    in        said professor pelc .     it   s very hard to explain to the layman .  he   s only dead for              a given value of dead .     said moist .      exactly .  and he can come back at a week   s notice .  a lot of the older wizards are opting for it now .  very refreshing  they say  just like a sabbatical .  only longer .         where do they go .         no one   s sure  exactly  but you can hear the sounds of cutlery     said pelc  and raised the jar to his mouth .      excuse me  professor goitre .  can you by any chance recall what happened to the chandeliers in the post office .      moist was expecting a tinny little voice to reply  but a sprightly if elderly voice a few inches away from his ear said     what .  oh .  yes indeed .  one ended up in the opera house and the other was acquired by the assassins    guild .  here comes the pudding trolley .  good bye .         thank you  professor     said pelc solemnly .     all is well here           fat lot i care .     said the disembodied voice .     be off  please  we   re eating .         there you have it  then     said pelc  putting the wizard doll back in the jar and screwing the lid on .     the opera house and the assassins    guild .  might be quite hard to get them back  i fancy .         yes  i think i shall put that off for a day or two     said moist  stepping out of the door .     dangerous people to tangle with .         indeed     said the professor  shutting the door behind them  which was the signal for the buzz of conversation to start up again .     i understand some of those sopranos can kick like a mule .         moist dreamed of bottled wizards  all shouting his name .   in the best traditions of awaking from a nightmare  the voices gradually became one voice  which turned out to be the voice of mr .  pump  who was shaking him .      some of them were covered in jam .     moist shouted  and then focused .     what .         mr .  lipvig  you have an appointment with lord vetinari .      this sunk in and sounded worse than wizards in jars .     i don   t have any appointment with vetinari .  er   do i .         he says you do  mr .  lipvig     said the golem .     therefore  you do .  we   ll leave by the coach yard .  there is a big crowd outside the front doors .      moist stopped with his trousers halfway on .     are they angry .  are any of them carrying buckets of tar .  feathers of any kind .         i do not know .  i have been given instructions .  i am carrying them out .  i advise you to do the same .      moist was hustled out into the back streets  where some shreds of mist were still floating .      what time is this  for heaven   s sake .     he complained .      a quarter to seven  mr .  lipvig .         that   s still nighttime .  doesn   t the man ever sleep .  what   s so important that i   ve got to be dragged out of my nice warm pile of letters .         the clock in lord vetinari   s anteroom didn   t tick right .  sometimes the tick was just a fraction late  sometimes the tock was early .  occasionally  one or the other didn   t happen at all .  this wasn   t really noticeable until you   d been in there for five minutes  by which time small but significant parts of the brain were going crazy .   moist was not good at early mornings in any case .  that was one of the advantages of a life of crime  you didn   t have to get up until other people had got the streets aired .   the clerk drumknott glided in on hushed feet  so soundlessly that he came as a shock .  he was one of the most silent people moist had ever encountered .      would you like some coffee  postmaster .     he said quietly .      am i in trouble  mr .  drumknott .         i wouldn   t care to say  sir .  have you read the times this morning .         the paper .  no .  oh       moist   s mind ran back furiously over yesterday   s interview .  he hadn   t said anything wrong  had he .  it had all been good  positive stuff  hadn   t it .  vetinari wanted people to use the post  didn   t he .      we always get a few copies straight off the press     said drumknott .     i shall fetch you one .      he returned with the paper .  moist unfolded it  took in the front page in one moment of agony  read a few sentences  put his hand over his eyes  and said     oh  gods .         did you notice the cartoon  postmaster .     said drumknott innocently .     it may be thought quite droll .      moist risked another glance at the terrible page .  perhaps in unconscious self defense his gaze had skipped over the cartoon  which showed two ragged street urchins .  one of them was holding a strip of penny stamps .  the text below read       first urchin  having acquired some of the newly minted    stampings            ere     ave you seen lord vetinari   s backside .          second urchin     nah  and i wouldn   t lick it for a penny  neiver .        moist   s face went waxen .      he   s seen this .     he croaked .      oh  yes  sir .      moist stood up quickly .     it   s still early     he said .     mr .  trooper is probably still on duty .  if i run he can probably fit me in .  i   ll go right away .  that will be okay  won   t it .  i   ll cut out the paperwork .  i don   t want to be a burden to anyone  i   ll even           now  now  postmaster     said drumknott  pushing him gently back into his chair     don   t distress yourself unduly .  in my experience  his lordship is a   complex man .  it is not wise to anticipate his reactions .         you mean you think i   m going to live .      drumknott screwed up his face in thought  and stared at the ceiling for a moment .      hmm  yes .  yes  i think you might     he said .      i mean  in the fresh air .  with everything attached .         quite probably  sir .  you may go in now  sir .      moist tiptoed into the patrician   s office .   only lord vetinari   s hands were visible on either side of the times .  moist reread the headlines with dull horror .      we don   t break down  postmaster vows  amazing attack on clacks  pledges  we   ll deliver anywhere  using remarkable new    stamps        that was the main story .  it was alongside a smaller story  which nevertheless drew the eye .  the headline was      grand trunk  down again   continent  cut off        and at the bottom  in a heavier typeface to show it was meant to be lighthearted  under the headline        history cannot be denied           were a dozen stories about the things that had happened when the ancient post turned up .  there was the rumpus that had turned into a fracas  mr .  parker and his bride to be  and others  too .  the post had changed unremarkable lives in small ways .  it was like cutting a window into history and seeing what might have been .   that seemed to be the entirety of the front page  except for a story about the watch hunting for the    mystery killer    who had mauled some banker to death in his house .  they were baffled  it said .  that cheered moist up a little  if their infamous werewolf officer couldn   t sniff out a bloody murderer  then maybe they wouldn   t find moist when the time came .  a brain could surely beat a nose .   lord vetinari seemed oblivious to moist   s presence  and moist wondered what effect a polite cough might have .   at which point  the newspaper rustled .      it says here in the letters column     said the voice of the patrician     that the phrase    stick it up your jumper    is based on an ancient ephebian saying that is at least two thousand years old  thus clearly predating jumpers but not  presumably  the act of sticking .     he lowered the paper and looked at moist over the top of it .     i don   t know if you happen to be following this interesting little etymological debate .         no  sir     said moist .     if you remember  i spent the past six weeks in a condemned cell .      his lordship put down the paper  steepled his fingers  and looked at moist over the top of them .      ah  yes .  so you did  mr .  lipwig .  well  well  well .         look  i   m really sor       moist began .      anywhere in the world .  even to the gods .  our postmen don   t break down so easily .  history is not to be denied .  very impressive  mr .  lipwig .  you have made quite a splash     said vetinari  smiling     as the fish said to the man with the lead weight tied to his feet .         i didn   t exactly say           in my experience  miss cripslock tends to write down exactly what one says     vetinari observed .     it   s a terrible thing when journalists do that .  it spoils the fun .  one feels instinctively that it   s cheating  somehow .  and i gather you are selling promissory notes  too .         what .         the stamps  mr .  moist .  a promise to carry a penny   s worth of mail .  a promise that must be kept .  do come and look at this .     he stood up and walked across to the window  where he beckoned .     do come  mr .  lipwig .      fearing that he might be hurled down onto the cobbles  moist nevertheless did so .      see the big clacks tower over there on the tump .     said vetinari  gesturing .     not much activity on the grand trunk this morning .  problems on a tower out on the plains  i gather .  nothing is getting to sto lat and beyond .  but now  if you look down .      it took moist a moment to understand what he was seeing  and then        that   s a queue outside the post office .     he said .      yes  mr .  lipwig     said vetinari  with dark glee .     for stamps  as advertised .  ankh morpork citizens have an instinct for  you might say  joining in the fun .  go to it  mr .  lipwig .  i   m sure you   re full of ideas .  don   t let me detain you .      lord vetinari returned to his desk and picked up the paper .   it   s right there on the front page  moist thought  he can   t have not seen it        er   about the other thing       he ventured  staring at the cartoon .      what other thing would that be .     said lord vetinari .   there was a moment   s silence .      er   nothing  really     said moist .     i   ll be off  then .         indeed you will  postmaster .  the mail must get through  must it not .      vetinari listened to distant doors shut  and then went and stood at the window until he saw a golden figure hurry across the courtyard .   drumknott came and tidied up the    out    tray .      well done  sir     he said quietly .      thank you  drumknott .         i see mr .  horsefry has passed away  sir .         so i understand  drumknott .         there was a stir in the crowd as moist crossed the street .  to his unspeakable relief he saw mr .  spools  standing with one of the serious men from his printery .  spools hurried over to him .      i  er  have several thousand of both of the  er  items     he whispered  pulling out a package from under his coat .     pennies and two pennies .  they   re not the best we can do but i thought you might be in want of them .  we heard the clacks was down again .         you   re a life saver  mr .  spools .  if you could just take them inside .  by the way  how much is a clacks message to sto lat .         even a very short message would be at least thirty pence  i think     said the engraver .      thank you .     moist stood back and cupped his hands .     ladies and gentlemen .     he shouted .     the post office will be open in five minutes for the sale of penny and two penny stamps .  in addition  we will be taking mail for sto lat .  first express delivery to sto lat leaves on the hour  ladies and gentlemen  to arrive this morning .  the cost will be ten pence per standard envelope .  i repeat  ten pence .  the mail  ladies and gentlemen .  accept no substitutes .  thank you .      there was a stir from the crowd  and several people hurried away .   moist led mr .  spools into the building  politely closing the door in the face of the crowd .  he felt the tingle he always felt when the game was afoot .  life should be made of moments like this  he decided .  with his heart singing  he erupted orders .      stanley .         yes  mr .  lipwig .     said the boy  behind him .      run along to hobson   s livery stable and ask for the fastest horse they   ve got .  tell them i want a good  fast horse  right .  something with a bit of fizz in its blood .  not some feagued up old screw  and i know the difference .  i want it here in half an hour .  off you go .  mr .  groat .         yessir .     groat actually saluted .      rig up some kind of table for a counter  will you .     said moist .     in five minutes  we open to accept mail and sell stamps .  i   m taking the mail to sto lat while the clacks is down  and you   re acting postmaster while i   m gone .  mr .  spools .         i   m right here  mr .  lipwig  you really don   t have to shout     said the engraver reproachfully .      sorry  mr .  spools .  more stamps  please .  i   ll need some to take with me  in case there   s mail to come back .  can you do that .  and i   ll need the fives and the dollar stamps as soon as   are you all right  mr .  groat .      the old man was swaying  his lips moving soundlessly .      mr .  groat .     moist repeated     acting postmaster       mumbled groat .      that   s right  mr .  groat .         no groat has ever been acting postmaster       suddenly groat dropped to his knees and gripped moist around the legs .     oh  thank you  sir .  i won   t let you down  mr .  lipwig .  you can rely on me  sir .  neither rain nor snow nor glom of           yes  yes  thank you  acting postmaster  thank you  that   s enough  thank you     said moist  trying to pull away .     please get up  mr .  groat .  mr .  groat  please .         can i wear the wing  d hat while you   re gone  sir .     groat pleaded .     it   d mean such a lot  sir           i   m sure it would  mr .  groat  but not today .  today  the hat flies to sto lat .      groat stood up .     should it really be you that takes the mail  sir .         who else .  golems can   t move fast enough  stanley is   well  stanley  and the rest of you gentlemen are ol   rich in years .     moist rubbed his hands together .     no argument  acting postmaster groat .  now   let   s sell some stamps .      the doors were open  and the crowd flocked in .  vetinari had been right .  if there was any action  the people of ankh morpork liked to be a part of it .  penny stamps flowed over makeshift counter .  after all  the reasoning went  for a penny you got something worth a penny  right .  after all  even if it was a joke  it was as safe as buying money .  and envelopes came the other way .  people were actually writing letters in the post office .  moist made a mental note  envelopes with a stamp already on  and a sheet of folded paper inside them  instant letter kit  just add ink .  that was an important rule of any game  always make it easy for people to give you money .   to his surprise  although he realized it shouldn   t have been  drumknott elbowed his way through the crowd with a small but heavy leather package  sealed with a wax seal bearing the city crest and a    v .     it was addressed to the mayor of sto lat .      government business     he announced pointedly  as he handed it over .      do you want to buy any stamps for it .     said moist  taking the packet .      what do you think  postmaster .     asked the clerk .      i definitely think government business travels free     said moist .      thank you  mr .  lipwig .  the lord likes a fast learner .      other mail for sto lat did get stamped  though .  a lot of people had friends or business there .  moist looked around .  people were scribbling everywhere  even holding the notepaper up against walls .  the stamps  penny and two penny  were shifting fast .  at the other end of the hall  the golems were sorting the endless mountains of mail     in fact  in a small way  the place was bustling .   you should   ve seen it  sir  you should   ve seen it .      lipwig  are yer .      he snapped out of a dream of chandeliers to see a thickset man in front of him .  recognition took a moment  and then said that this was the owner of hobson   s livery stable  at once the most famous and notorious such establishment in the city .  it was probably not the hive of criminal activity that popular rumor suggested  although the huge establishment often seemed to contain grubby looking men with not much to do apart from sit around and squint at people .  and he was employing an igor  everyone knew  which of course was sensible when you had such a high veterinary overhead  but you heard stories         oh  hello  mr .  hobson     said moist .      seems yer think i hire tired old horses  sir  do you .     said willie hobson .  his smile was not entirely friendly .  a nervous stanley stood behind him .  hobson was big and heavyset  but not exactly fat  he was probably what you   d get if you shaved a bear .      i have ridden some that       moist began  but hobson raised a hand .      seems yer want fizz     said hobson .  his smile widened .     well  i always give the customer what i want  you know that .  so i   ve brought yer boris .         oh yes .     said moist .     and he   ll get me to sto lat  will he .         oh  at the very least  sir     said hobson .     good horseman  are yer .         when it comes to riding out of town  mr .  hobson  there   s no one faster .         that   s good  sir  that   s good     said hobson  in the slow voice of someone carefully urging the prey toward the trap .     boris does have a few faults  but i can see a skilled horseman like you should have no trouble .  ready  then .  he   s right outside .  got a man holding him .      it turned out that there were  in fact  four men holding the huge black stallion in a network of ropes  while it danced and lunged and kicked and tried to bite .  a fifth man was lying on the ground .  boris was a killer .      like i said  sir  he   s got a few faults  but no one could call him a   now  what was it   oh  yeah  a feagued up old screw .  still want a horse with fizz .     hobson   s grin said it all  this is what i do to snooty buggers who try to mess me around .  let   s see you try to ride this one  mister i know all about horses .   moist looked at boris  who was trying to trample the fallen man  and at the watching crowd .  damn the gold suit .  if you were moist von lipwig  there was only one thing to do now  and that was raise the stakes .      take his saddle off     he said .      you what .     said hobson .      take his saddle off  mr .  hobson     said moist firmly .     this bag   s quite heavy  so let   s lose the saddle .      hobson   s smile remained  but the rest of his face tried to sidle away from it .      had all the kids you want  have yer .     he said .      just give me a blanket and a bellyband  mr .  hobson .      now hobson   s smile vanished completely .  this was going to look too much like murder .     you might want to think again  sir     he said .     boris took a couple of fingers off a man last year .  he   s a trampler  too  and a snaffler  and a scraper  and he   ll horlock if he can get away with it .  he   s got demons in him  and that   s a fact .         will he run .         not so much run as bolt  sir .  born evil  that one     said hobson .     you need a crowbar to get him round corners  too .  look  sir  fair play to yer for a game    un  but i   ve got plenty of other        hobson flinched as moist gave him a special grin .     you chose him  mr .  hobson .  i   ll ride him .  i   d be grateful if you could get your gentlemen to point him up broadway for me while i go and conclude a few items of business .      moist went into the building  ran up the stairs to his office  shut the door  crammed his handkerchief in his mouth  and whimpered gently for a few seconds  until he felt better .  he   d ridden bareback a few times  when things had been really hot  but boris had the eyes of a crazy thing .   but back off now and he   d be   just a fool in a shiny suit .  you had to give them a show  an image  something to remember .  all he had to do was stay until he left the city and then find a suitable bush to jump off into .  yes  that   d do .  and then stagger into sto lat hours later  still with the mail  having valiantly fought off bandits .  he   d be believed  because it would feel right   because people wanted to believe things  because it   d make a good tale  because if you made it glitter sufficiently glass could appear more like a diamond than a diamond did .   there was a cheer when he stepped out onto the steps again .  the sun  on cue  decided to appear from the mists  and sparkled off his wings .   boris was looking apparently docile now  chewing his bit .  this didn   t fool moist  if a horse like boris was quiet  it was because he was plotting something .      mr .  pump  i shall need you to give me a leg up     he said  slinging the post bag around his neck .      yes  mr .  lipvig     said the golem .      mr .  lipwig .      moist turned around to see sacharissa cripslock hurrying up the street  notebook in hand .      always a pleasure to see you  sacharissa     said moist     but i am a little busy right now           you are aware that the grand trunk is shut again .     she said .      yes  it was in the paper   now i must           so you are challenging the clacks company .     the pencil hung poised over her notebook .      just delivering the mail  miss cripslock  just like i said i   d do     said moist in firm  manly tones .      but it   s rather strange  is it not  that a man on horseback is more reliable than a           please  miss cripslock .  we are the post office .     said moist  in his best high minded voice .     we don   t go in for petty rivalry .  we   re sorry to hear that our colleagues in the clacks company are experiencing temporary difficulties with their machinery  we fully sympathize with their plight  and if they would like us to deliver their messages for them we would of course be happy to sell them some stamps   soon to be available in penny  two penny  five penny  ten penny  and one dollar values   here at your post office  ready gummed .  incidentally  we intend eventually to flavor the gum in licorice  orange  cinnamon  and banana flavors  but not strawberry  because i hate strawberries .      he could see her smile as she wrote this down .  then she said     i did hear you correctly  did i .  you are offering to carry clacks messages .         certainly .  ongoing messages can be put on the trunk in sto lat .  helpfulness is our middle name .         are you sure it   s not    cheekiness    .     said sacharissa  to laughter from the crowd .      i don   t understand you  i   m sure     said moist .     now  if you will           you   re cocking a snook at the clacks people again  aren   t you .     said the journalist .      ah  that must be a journalistic term     said moist .     i   ve never owned a snook  and even if i did  i wouldn   t know how to cock it .  and now  if you will excuse me  i have the mail to deliver and ought to leave before boris eats somebody .  again .         can i ask you just one last thing .  will your soul be unduly diminished if otto takes a picture of you departing .         i suppose i can   t stop you out here  provided my face isn   t very clear     said moist  as mr .  pump cupped his pottery hands to make a step .     the priest is very hot on that  you know .         yes  i expect    the priest    is     said miss cripslock  making sure the inverted commas clanged with irony .     besides  by the look of that creature  it may be the last chance we get .  it looks like death on four legs  mr .  lipwig .      the crowd fell silent as moist mounted .  boris merely shifted his weight a little .   look at it like this  moist thought  what have you got to lose .  your life .  you   ve already been hanged .  you   re into angel time .  and you   re impressing the hell out of everybody .  why are they buying stamps .  because you   re giving them a show        just say the word  mister     said one of hobson   s men  hauling on the end of a rope .     when we let him go  we ain   t hanging around .         wait a moment       said moist quickly .   he   d seen a figure at the front of the crowd .  it was wearing a figure hugging gray dress  and as he watched  it blew a neurotic cloud of smoke at the sky  gave him a look  and shrugged .      dinner tonight  miss dearheart .     he shouted .   heads turned .  there was a ripple of laughter  and a few cheers .  for a moment she flashed him a look that should have left his shadow on the smoking remains of the wall opposite  and then she gave a curt nod .   who knows  it could be peaches underneath        let him go  boys .     said moist  his heart soaring .   the men dived away .  the world was still for a breath  and then boris sprang from docility into a mad rearing dance  back legs clattering across the flagstones  hooves pawing at the air .      vunderful .  hold it .      the world went white .  boris went mad .       chapter  a   post haste      the nature of boris the horse     foreboding tower      mr .  lipwig cools off     the lady with buns on her ears      invitation accepted     mr .  robinson   s box      a mysterious stranger      hobson had tried boris as a racehorse  and he would have been a very good one were it not for his unbreakable habit  at the off  of attacking the horse next to him and jumping the railings at the first bend .  moist clapped his hand onto his hat  wedged his toes into the bellyband  and hung onto the reins as broadway came at him all at once  carts and people blurring past  his eyeballs pressing into his head .   there was a cart across the street but there was no possibility of steering boris .  huge muscles bunched  and there was a long  slow  silent moment as he drifted over the cart .   hooves slid over the cobbles ahead of a trail of sparks when he landed again  but he recovered by sheer momentum and accelerated .   the usual crowd around the hubwards gate scattered  and then  filling the horizon  there were the plains .  they did something to boris   s mad horse brain .  all that space  nice and flat  with only a few easily jumped obstacles  like trees .   he found extra muscle and speeded up again  bushes and trees and carts flying toward him .   moist cursed the bravado with which he   d ordered the saddle taken away .  every part of his body already hated him .  but  in truth  boris   once you got past the pineapple   wasn   t too bad a ride .  he   d hit his rhythm  a natural  single footed gait  and his burning eyes were focused on the blueness .  his hatred of everything was for the moment subsumed by the sheer joy of space .  hobson was right  you couldn   t steer him with a mallet  but at least he was headed in the right direction  which was away from his stable .  boris didn   t want to spend the days kicking the bricks out of his wall while waiting to throw the next bumptious idiot .  he wanted to bite the horizon .  he wanted to run .   moist carefully removed his hat and gripped it in his mouth .  he didn   t dare imagine what   d happen if he lost it  and he   d need to have it on his head at the end of the journey .  it was important .  it was all about style .   one of the towers of the grand trunk was ahead and slightly to the left .  there were two in the twenty miles between ankh morpork and sto lat  because they were taking almost all the traffic of lines that stretched right across the continent .  beyond sto lat  the trunk began to split into tributaries  but here  flashing overhead  the words of the world were flowing        should be flowing .  but the shutters were still .  as he drew level  moist saw men working high up on the open wooden tower  by the look of it  a whole section had broken off .   ha .  so long  suckers .  that   d take some repairing .  worth an overnight attempt at a delivery to pseudopolis  maybe .  he   d talk to the coachmen  it was not as if they   d ever paid the post office for their damn coaches .  and if wouldn   t matter if the clacks got repaired in time  either  because the post office would have made the effort .  the clacks company was a big bully  sacking people  racking up the charges  demanding lots of money for bad service .  the post office was the underdog  and an underdog can always find somewhere soft to bite .   carefully  he eased more of the blanket under him .  various organs were going numb .   the towering fumes of ankh morpork were falling far behind .  sto lat was visible between boris   s ears  a plume of lesser smokes .  the tower disappeared astern  and already moist could see the next one .  he   d ridden more than a third of the way in twenty minutes  and boris was still eating up the ground .   about halfway between the cities was an old stone tower  all that remained of a heap of ruins surrounded by woodland .  it was almost as high as a clacks tower  and moist wondered why they hadn   t simply used it as one .  it was probably too derelict to survive in a gale under the weight of the shutters  he thought .  the area looked bleak  a piece of weedy wilderness in the endless fields .   if he   d had spurs  moist would have spurred boris on at this point  and would probably have been thrown  trampled  and eaten for his pains .   instead  he lay low over the horse   s back and tried not to think about what this ride was doing to his kidneys .   time passed .   the second tower went by  and boris dropped into a canter .  sto lat was clearly visible now  moist could make out the city walls and the turrets of the castle .   he   d have to jump off  there was no other way .  moist had tried out half a dozen scenarios as the walls loomed  but nearly all of them involved haystacks .  the one that didn   t was the one where he broke his neck .   but it didn   t seem to occur to boris to turn aside .  he was on a road  the road was straight  it went through this gateway  and boris had no problem with that .  besides  he wanted a drink .   the city streets were crowded with things that couldn   t be jumped or trampled  but there was a horse trough .  he was only vaguely aware of something falling off his back .   sto lat wasn   t a big city .  moist had once spent a happy week there  passing a few dud bills  pulling off the indigent heir trick twice  and selling a glass ring on the way out  not so much for the money as out of a permanent fascination with human deviousness and gullibility .   now he staggered up the steps of the town hall  watched by a crowd .  he pushed open the doors and slammed the mailbag on the desk of the first clerk he saw .      mail from ankh morpork     he growled .     started out at nine  so it   s fresh  okay .         but it   s only just struck a quarter past ten .  what mail .      moist tried not to get angry .  he was sore enough as it was .      see this hat .     he said  pointing .     you see it .  that means i   m the postmaster general of ankh morpork .  this is your mail .  in an hour  i   m going back again  understand .  if you want mail de livered to the big city by two p . m .    ouch   make that three p . m .   then put it in this bag .  these      he waved a wad of stamps under the young man   s nose      are stamps .  red ones two pence  black ones a penny .  it   ll cost ten   ow   eleven pence per letter  got it .  you sell the stamps  you give me the money  you lick the stamps and put them on the letters .  express delivery guaranteed .  i   m making you acting postmaster for an hour .  there   s an inn next door .  i   m going to find a bath .  i want a cold bath .  really cold .  got an ice house here .  as cold as that .  colder .  ooooh  colder .  and a drink  and a sandwich  and  by the way  there   s a big black horse outside .  if your people can catch him  please put a saddle on him  and a cushion  and drag him around to face ankh morpork .  do it .         it was only a hip bath  but at least there was an ice house in the city .  moist sat in a state of bliss among the floating ice  drinking a brandy  and listened to the commotion outside .   after a while  there was a knock at the door  and a male voice inquired     are you decent  mr .  postmaster .         thoroughly decent  but not dressed     said moist .  he reached down beside him and put his wing  d hat on again .     do come in .      the mayor of sto lat was a short  birdlike man  who   d either become mayor very recently and immediately after the post had been held by a big fat man  or thought that a robe that trailed several feet behind you and a chain that reached to the waist was the look for civic dignitaries this year .      er   joe camels  sir     he said nervously .     i   m the mayor here           really .  good to meet you  joe     said moist  raising his glass .     excuse me if i don   t get up .         your horse  er  has run way after kicking three men  i   m sorry to say .         really .  he never usually does that     said moist .      don   t worry  sir  we   ll catch him  and anyway  we can let you have a horse to get back on .  not as fast  though  i daresay .         oh dear     said moist  easing himself into a new position among the floating ice .     that   s a shame .         oh  i know all about you  mr .  lipwig     said the mayor  winking conspiratorially .     there were some copies of the times in the mailbag .  a man who wants to be up and doing  you are .  a man full of vim  you are .  a man after my own heart  you are .  you aim for the moon  you do .  you see your target and you go for it hell for leather  you do .  that   s how i does business  too .  you   re a go getter  just like me .  i   d like you to put it here  sir .         what where .     said moist  stirring uneasily in his rapidly becoming lukewarm tub .     oh .     he shook the proffered hand .     what is your business  mr .  camels .         i make parasols     said the mayor .     and it   s about time that clacks company was told what   s what .  it was all fine up until a few months ago   i mean  they made you pay through the nose but at least stuff got where it was fast as a arrow  but now it   s all these breakdowns and repairs and they charge even more  mark you .  and they never tell you how long we   re going to be waiting  it   s always    very shortly .     they   re always    sorry for the inconvenience     they even got that written on a sign they hang up on the office .  as warm and human as a thrown knife  just like you said .  so you know what we just done .  we went around to the clacks tower in the city and had a serious word with young davey  who   s a decent lad  and he gave us back all the overnight clacks for the big city that never got sent .  how about that  eh .         won   t he get into trouble .         he says he   s quitting anyway .  none of the boys like the way the company   s run now .  they   ve all been stamped for you  just like you said .  well  i   ll let you get dressed  mr .  lipwig .  your horse is ready .     he stopped at the door .     oh  just one thing  sir  about them stamps           yes .  is there a problem  mr .  camels .     said moist .      not as such  sir .  i wouldn   t say anything against lord vetinari  sir  or ankh morpork      said a man living within twenty miles of a proud and touchy citizenry      but  er  it doesn   t seem right  licking   well  licking ankh morpork stamps .  couldn   t you print up a few for us .  we   ve got a queen .  she   d look good on a stamp .  we   re an important city  you know .         i   ll see what i can do  mr .  camels .  got a picture of her  by any chance .      they   ll all want one  he thought  as he got dressed .  having your own stamps could be like having your own flag  your own crest .  it could be big .  and i bet i could do a deal with my friend mr .  spools  oh yes .  doesn   t matter if you haven   t got your own post office  you   ve got to have your own stamp     an enthusiastic crowd saw him off on a horse which  while no boris  did his best and seemed to know what reins were for .  moist gratefully accepted the cushion on the saddle  too .  that added more glitter to the glass  he   d ridden so hard he needed a cushion .   he set off with a full mailbag .  amazingly  once again  people had bought stamps just to own them .  the times had got around .  here was something new  so people wanted to be part of it .   once he was cantering over the fields  though  he felt the fizz die away .  he was employing stanley  a bunch of game but creaky old men  and some golems .  he couldn   t keep this up .   but the thing was  you added sparkle .  you told people what you intended to do and they believed you could do it .  anyone could have done this ride .  no one had .  they kept waiting for the clacks to be repaired .   he took things gently along the road  speeding up when he passed the clacks tower that had been under repair .  it was still under repair  in fact  but he could see more men around it and high up on the tower .  there was a definite suggestion that repair work was suddenly going a lot faster .   as he watched  he was sure he saw someone fall off .  it probably wouldn   t be a good idea to go over there and see if he could help  though  not if he wanted to continue to go through life with his own teeth .  besides  it was a long  long drop all the way down to the cabbage fields  handily combining death and burial at the same time .   he speeded up again when he reached the city .  somehow trotting up to the post office steps was not an option .  the queue   still a queue   cheered when he cantered up .   mr .  groat came running out  insofar as a crab can run .      can you make another delivery to sto lat  sir .     he shouted .     got a full bag already .  and everyone   s asking when you   ll be taking    em to pseudopolis and quirm .  got one here for lancre  too .         what .  that   s five hundred damn miles  man .      moist dismounted  although the state of his legs turned the action into more of a drop .      it   s all got a bit busy since you were away     said groat  steadying him .     oh  yes indeed .  ain   t got enough people .  but there   s people wanting jobs  too  sir  since the paper came out .  people from the old postal families  just like me .  even some more workers out of retirement .  i took the liberty of taking them on pro tem for the time being  seeing as i   m acting postmaster .  i hope that   s all right with you  sir .  and mr .  spools is running off more stamps .  i   ve twice had to send stanley up for more .  i hear we   ll have the early five pennies and the dollars out tonight .  great times  eh  sir .         er   yes     said moist .  suddenly the whole world had turned into a kind of boris   moving fast  inclined to bite  and impossible to steer .  the only way not to be ground down was to stay on top .   inside the hall  extra makeshift tables had been set up .  they were crowded with people .      we   re selling them the envelopes and paper     said groat .     the ink is free gratis .         did you think that up yourself .     said moist .      no  it   s what we used to do     said groat .     miss maccalariat got a load of cheap paper from spools .         miss maccalariat .     said moist .     who is miss maccalariat .         very old post office family  sir     said groat .     she   s decided to work for you .     he looked a little nervous .      sorry .     said moist .     she has decided to work for me .         well  you know what it   s like with post office people  sir     said groat .     we don   t like to           are you the postmaster .     said a withering voice behind him .   the voice went into his head  bored down through his memories  riffled through his fears  found the right levers  battened onto them  and pulled .  in moist   s case  it found frau shambers .  in the second year at school  you were precipitated out of the warm  easygoing kindergarten of frau tissel  smelling of finger paint  playdough  and inadequate toilet training  and onto the cold benches governed by frau shambers  smelling of education .  it was as bad as being born  with the added disadvantage that your mother wasn   t there .   moist automatically looked down .  yes  there they were  the sensible shoes  the thick black stockings that were slightly hairy  the baggy cardigan   oh  yes  arrgh  the cardigan  frau shambers used to stuff the sleeves with handkerchiefs  arrgh  arrgh   and the glasses and the expression like an early frost .  and her hair was plaited and coiled up on either side of her head in those discs that back home in uberwald had been called    snails     but in ankh morpork put people in mind of a woman with a curly iced bun clamped to each ear .      now look here  miss maccalariat     he said firmly .     i am the postmaster here  and i am in charge  and i do not intend to be browbeaten by a member of the counter staff just because their ancestors worked here .  i do not fear your clumpy shoes  miss maccalariat  i smile happily in the teeth of your icy stare .  fie on you .  now that i am a grown man  frau shambers  i will quake not at your sharp voice and will control my bladder perfectly however hard you look at me  oh yes indeed .  for i am the postmaster and my word here is law .      that was what his brain said .  unfortunately  the words got routed through his trembling backbone on the way to his mouth and issued from his lips as    er  yes .     which came out as a squeak .      mr .  lipwig  i ask you  i have nothing against them  but are these golems you are employing in my post office gentlemen or ladies .     the terrible woman demanded .   this was sufficiently unexpected to jolt moist back into something like reality .     what .     he said .     i don   t know .  what   s the difference .  a bit more clay   less clay .  why .      miss maccalariat folded her arms  causing both moist and mr .  groat to shy backwards .      i hope you   re not funning with me  mr .  lipwig .     she demanded .      what .  funning .  i never fun .     moist tried to pull himself together .  whatever happened next  he could not be made to stand in the corner .     i do not fun  miss maccalariat  and have no history of funning  and even if i was inclined to fun  miss maccalariat  i would not dream of funning with you .  what is the problem .         one of them was in the ladies      restroom  mr .  moist     said miss maccalariat .      doing what .  i mean  they don   t eat  so           cleaning it  apparently     said miss maccalariat  contriving to suggest that she had dark suspicions on this point .     but i have heard them referred to as    mister .            well  they do odd jobs all the time  because they don   t like to stop working     said moist .     and we prefer to give them mister as an honorific  because  er     it    seems wrong  and there are some people  yes  some people for whom the word    miss    is not appropriate  miss maccalariat .         it is the principle of the thing  mr .  lipwig     said the woman firmly .     anyone called mister is not allowed in the ladies    .  that sort of thing can only lead to hanky panky .  i will not stand for it  mr .  lipwig .      moist stared at her .  then he looked up at mr .  pump  who was never far away .      mr .  pump  is there any reason why one of the golems can   t have a new name .     he asked .     in the interest of hanky panky avoidance .         no  mr .  lipvig     the golem rumbled .   moist turned back to miss maccalariat .     would    gladys    do  miss maccalariat .            gladys    will be sufficient  mr .  lipwig     said miss maccalariat  more than a hint of triumph in her voice .     she must be properly clothed  of course .         clothed .     said moist weakly .     but a golem isn   t   it doesn   t   they don   t have       he quailed under the glare  and gave up .     yes  miss maccalariat .  something gingham  i think  mr .  pump .         i shall arrange it  postmaster     said the golem .      will that be all right  miss maccalariat .     said moist meekly .      for the present     said miss maccalariat  as if she regretted that there were currently no further things to complain of .     mr .  groat knows my particulars  postmaster .  i will now return to the proper execution of my duties  otherwise people will try to steal the pens again .  you have to watch them like hawks  you know .         a good woman  that     said groat  as she strode away .     fifth generation of miss maccalariats .  maiden name kept for professional purposes  o   course .         they get married .     from the mob around the makeshift counter came the ringing command     put that pen back this minute .  do you think i   m made of pens .         yessir     said groat .      do they bite their husbands    heads off on their wedding night .     said moist .      i wouldn   t know about that sort of thing  sir     said groat  blushing .      but she   s even got a bit of a mustache .         yessir .  there   s someone for everyone in this wonderful world  sir .         and we   ve got other people looking for work  you say .      groat beamed .     that   s right  sir .     cos of the bit in the paper  sir .         you mean this morning .         i expect that helped  sir     said groat .     but i reckon it was the lunchtime edition that did it .         what lunchtime edition .         we   re all over the front page .     said groat proudly .     i put a copy on your desk upstairs        moist pushed the sto lat mailbag into the man   s arms .     get this   sorted     he said .     if there   s enough mail for another delivery to go  find some kid who   s mad for a job and put him on a horse and get him to take it .  doesn   t have to be fast  we   ll call it the overnight delivery .  tell him to see the mayor and come back in the morning with any fresh mail .         right you are  sir     said groat .     we could do an overnight to quirm and pseudopolis  too  sir  if we could change horses like the mail coaches do           hang on   why can   t the mail coaches take it .     said moist .     hell  they   re still called mail coaches  right .  we know they take stuff from anyone  on the quiet .  well  the post office is back in business .  they take out mail .  go and find whoever runs it and tell him so .         yessir     said groat  beaming .     thought about how we   re going to send post to the moon yet  sir .         one thing at a time  mr .  groat .         that   s not like you  sir     said groat cheerfully .     all at once is more your style  sir .      i wish it wasn   t  moist thought  as he eased his way upstairs .  but you had to move fast .  he always moved fast .  his whole life had been movement .  move fast  because you never know what   s trying to catch you up     he paused on the stairs .   not mr .  pump .   the golem hadn   t left the post office .  he hadn   t tried to catch him up .  was it that he   d been on postal business .  how long could he be away on postal business .  could he fake his death  maybe .  the old pile of clothes on the seashore trick .  worth remembering .  all he needed was a long enough start .  how did a golem   s mind actually work .  he   d have to ask miss     miss dearheart .  he   d been flying so high that he   d asked her out .  that might be a problem now  because most of the lower part of his body was on fire  not especially for miss dearheart .  oh  well  he thought  as he entered the office  perhaps he could find a restaurant with really soft seats        faster than the     speed of light        old fashioned    mail beats clacks  amazing scenes as postmaster delivers   says  snook not cocked  post office     the headlines screamed at him as soon as he saw the paper .  he almost screamed back .   of course  he   d said all that .  but he   d said it to the innocent  smiling face of miss sacharissa cripslock  not to the whole world .  and then she   d written it down all truthfully  and suddenly   you got this .   moist had never much bothered with newspapers .  he was an artist .  he wasn   t interested in big schemes .  you swindled the man in front of you  looking him sincerely in the eyes .   the picture was good  though  he had to admit .  the rearing horse  the wing  d hat  and  above all  the slight blurring with speed .  it was impressive .   he relaxed a little .  the place was operating  after all .  mail was being posted .  mail was being delivered .  okay  so a major part of it all was that the clacks wasn   t working properly  but maybe in time people would see that a letter to your sister in sto lat didn   t need to cost thirty pence to maybe get there in an hour but might as well cost a mere five pence to be there in the morning .   stanley knocked at the door and then pushed it open .      cup of tea  mr .  lipwig .     he said .     and a bun  sir .         you   re an angel in heavy disguise  stanley     said moist  sitting back with care  and wincing .      yes  thank you  sir     said stanley solemnly .     got some messages for you  sir .         thank you  stanley     said moist .  there was a lengthy pause until he remembered that this was stanley he was talking to  and added     please tell me what they are  stanley .         er   the golem lady came in and said       stanley closed his eyes .        tell the streak of lightning he   ll have another eight golems in the morning and if he   s not too busy working miracles i   ll accept his invitation to dine at eight at le foie heureux  meet at the mended drum at seven .            the happy liver .  are you sure .     but of course it would be correct .  this was stanley .     ha  even the damn soup there is fifteen dollars .     said moist .     and you have to wait three weeks for an appointment to be considered for a booking .  they weigh your wallet .  how does she think i        his eye rested on    mr .  robinson   s box     sitting innocently in the corner of the office .  he liked miss dearheart .  most people were   accessible .  sooner or later you could find the springs that worked them  even miss maccalariat would have a lever somewhere  although it was a horrible thought .  but adora belle fought back  and to make sure fought back even before she was attacked .  she was a challenge  and therefore fascinating .  she was so cynical  so defensive  so spikey .  and he had a feeling she could read him much  much better than he read her .  all in all  she was intriguing .  and looked good in a severely plain dress  don   t forget that bit .      okay .  thank you  stanley     he said .     anything else .      the boy put a sheet of slightly damp  greeny gray stamps on the desk .      the first dollar stamps  sir .     he announced .      my word  mr .  spools has done a good job here .     said moist  staring at the hundreds of little green pictures of the university   s tower of art .     it even looks worth a dollar .         yes  sir .  you hardly notice the little man jumping from the top     said stanley .   moist snatched the sheet from the boy   s hand .     where .  where .         you need a magnifying glass  sir .  and it   s only on a few of them .  in some of them he   s in the water .  mr .  spools is very sorry  sir  he says it may be some kind of induced magic .  you know  sir .  like  even a picture of a wizards    tower might be a bit magical itself .  there   s a few faults on some of the others  too .  the printing went wrong on some of the black penny ones  and lord vetinari   s got gray hair  sir .  some haven   t got gum on  but they   re all right  because some people have asked for them that way .         why .         they say they   re as good as real pennies and a whole lot lighter  sir .         do you like stamps  stanley .     said moist kindly .  he was feeling a lot better in a seat that didn   t go up and down .   stanley   s face lit up .     oh  yes  sir .  really  sir .  they   re wonderful  sir .  amazing  sir .      moist raised his eyebrows .     as good as that  eh .         it   s like   well  it   s like being there when they invented the first pin  sir .     stanley   s face glowed .      really .  the first pin  eh .     said moist .     outstanding .  well  in that case  stanley  you are head of stamps .  the whole department .  which is  in fact  you .  how do you like that .  i imagine you already know more about them than anyone else .         oh  i do  sir .  for example  on the very first run of the penny stamps they used a different type of           good .     said moist hurriedly .     well done .  can i keep this first sheet .  as a souvenir .         of course  sir     said stanley .     head of stamps  sir .  wow .  er   is there a hat .         if you like     said moist generously  folding up the sheet of stamps and putting them in his inside pocket .  so much more convenient than dollars .  wow  indeed .     or perhaps a shirt .     he added .     you know      ask me about stamps    .         good idea  sir .  can i go and tell mr .  groat  sir .  he   d be so proud of me .         off you go  stanley     said moist .     but come back in ten minutes  will you .  i   ll have a letter for you to deliver   personally .      stanley ran off .   moist opened the wooden box  which fanned out its trays obediently  and flexed his fingers .   hmm .  it seemed that anyone who was  well  anyone in the city had their paper printed by teemer and spools .  moist thumbed through his recently acquired paper samples  and spotted      the grand trunk company     as fast as light     from the office of the chairman     it was tempting .  very tempting .  they were rich  very rich .  even with the current trouble  they were still very big .  and moist had never met a head waiter who hated money .   he found a copy of yesterday   s times .  there   d been a picture   yes  here .  there was a picture of reacher guilt  chairman of the grand trunk  at some function .  he looked like a better class of pirate  a buccaneer maybe  but one who took the time to polish his plank .   that flowing black hair  that beard  that eyepatch  and  oh gods  that cockatoo   that was a look  wasn   t it .   moist hadn   t paid much attention to the grand trunk company .  it was too big  and from what he   d heard it practically employed its own army .  things could be tough in the mountains  where you were often a long way from anything that resembled a watchman .  it wasn   t a good idea to steal things from people who did their own law enforcement .  they tended to be very definite .   but what he was intending wouldn   t be stealing .  it might not even be breaking the law .  fooling a ma  tre d    was practically a public service .   he looked at the picture again .  now  how would a man like that sign his name .   hmm   flowing yet small  that would be the handwriting of reacher gilt .  he was so florid  so sociable  so huge a personality that one who was good at this sort of thing might wonder if another shard of glass was trying to sparkle like a diamond .  and the essence of forgery is to make  by misdirection and careful timing  the glass look so much more like a diamond than a diamond does .   well  it was worth a try .  it was not as though he was going to swindle anyone  as such .   hmm .  small yet flowing  yes   but someone who   d never seen the man   s writing would expect it to be extravagantly big  curly  just like him     moist poised the pen over the headed paper  and then wrote       ma  tre d      le foie heureux  i would be most grateful if you could find a table for my good friend mr .  lipwig and his lady at eight o   clock tonight .   reacher gilt    most grateful  that was good .  the reacher gilt persona probably tipped like a drunken sailor .   he folded the letter  and was addressing the envelope when stanley and groat came in .      you   ve got a letter  mr .  lipwig     said stanley proudly .      yes  here it is     said moist .      no  i mean here   s one for you     said the boy .  they exchanged envelopes .  moist glanced cursorily at the envelope and opened it with a thumb .      i   ve got bad news  sir     said groat  as stanley left .      hmm .     said moist  looking at the letter .      postmaster   the pseudopolis clacks line will break down at  am tomorrow .   the smoking gnu        yessir .  i went round to the coach office     groat went on  oblivious to this     and told them what you said  and they said you stick to your business  thank you very much  and they   ll stick to theirs .         hmm     said moist  still staring at the letter .  well  well .     have you heard of someone called    the smoking gnu     mr .  groat .         what   s a gernue  sir .         a bit like a dangerous cow  i think     said moist .     er   what were you saying about the coach people .         they give me lip  sir  that   s what they give me     said groat .     i told    em  i told    em  i was the assistant postmaster and they said     so what .     sir .  then i said i   d tell you  sir  and they said   you want to know what they said  sir .         hmm .  oh  yes .  i   m all agog  tolliver .     moist   s eyes were scanning the strange letter over and over again .      they said     yeah  right        said groat  a beacon of righteous indignation .      i wonder if mr .  trooper can still fit me in       mused moist  staring at the ceiling .      sorry  sir .         oh  nothing .  i suppose i   d better go and talk to them .  go and find mr .  pump  will you .  and tell him to bring a couple of other golems .  i want to   impress people .         i gor opened the front door in answer to the knock .   there was no one there .  he stepped outside and looked up and down the street .   there was no one there .   he stepped back inside  closing the door behind him   and no one was standing in the hall  his black cloak dripping rain  removing his wide  flat brimmed hat .      ah  mither gryle  thur     igor said to the tall figure     i thhould have known it wath you .         reacher gilt asked for me     said gryle .  it was more a breath than a voice .   the clan of the igors had any tendency to shuddering bred out of it generations ago .   this was just as well .  igor felt uneasy in the presence of gryle and his kind .      the marthter ith expecting       he began .   but there was no one there .   it wasn   t magic  and gryle wasn   t a vampire .  igors could spot these things .  it was just that there was nothing spare about him   spare flesh  spare time  or spare words .  it was impossible to imagine gryle collecting pins  or savoring wine  or even throwing up after a bad pork pie .  the picture of him cleaning his teeth or sleeping completely failed to form in the mind .  he gave the impression of restraining himself  with difficulty  from killing you .   thoughtfully  igor went down to his little room off the kitchen and checked that his little leather bag was packed  just in case .   in his study  reacher gilt poured a small brandy .  gryle looked around him with eyes that seemed not at home with the limited vistas of a room .      and for yourself .     said gilt .      water     said gryle .      i expect you know what this is about .         no .     gryle was not a man for small talk or  if it came to it  any talk at all .      you   ve read the newspapers .         do not read .         you know about the post office .         yes .         how  may i ask .         there is talk .      gilt accepted that .  mr .  gryle had a special talent  and if that came as a package with funny little ways  then so be it .  besides  he was trustworthy  a man without middle grounds .  he   d never blackmail you  because such an attempt would be the first move in a game that would almost certainly end in death for somebody  if mr .  gryle found himself in such a game he   d kill right now  without further thought  in order to save time  and assumed that anyone else would  too .  presumably he was insane  by the usual human standards  but it was hard to tell  the phrase    differently normal    might do instead .  after all  gryle could probably defeat a vampire within ten seconds  and had none of a vampire   s vulnerabilities  except perhaps an inordinate fondness for pigeons .  he   d been a real find .      and you have found out nothing about mr .  lipwig .     gilt said .      no .  father dead .  mother dead .  raised by grandfather .  sent away to school .  bullied .  ran away .  vanished     said the tall figure .      hmm .  i wonder where he   s been all this time .  or who he has been .      gryle didn   t waste breath on rhetorical questions .      he is   a nuisance .         understood .     and that was the charm .  gryle did understand .  he seldom needed an order  you just had to state the problem .  the fact that it was gryle that you were stating it to went a long way toward ensuring what the solution was likely to be .      the post office building is old and full of paper .  very dry paper     said gilt .     it would be regrettable if the fine old place caught fire .         understood .      and that was another thing about gryle .  he really did not talk much .  he especially did not talk about old times  and all the other little solutions he had provided for reacher gilt .  and he never said things like    what do you mean .     he understood .      require one thousand  three hundred dollars     he said .      of course     gilt said .     i will clacks it to your account in           will take cash     said gryle .      gold .  i don   t keep that much around .     said gilt .     i can get in a few days  of course  but i thought you preferred           i do not trust the semaphore now .         but our ciphers are very well           i do not trust the semaphore now     gryle repeated .      very well .         description     said gryle      no one seems to remember what he looks like     said gilt .     but he always wears a big golden hat  with wings  and he has an apartment in the building .      for a moment  something flickered around gryle   s thin lips .  it was a smile  panicking at finding itself in such an unfamiliar place .      can he fly .     he said .      alas  he doesn   t seem inclined to venture into high places     said gilt .   gryle stood up .      i will do this tonight .         good man .  or  rather           understood     said gryle .       chapter     bonfire         slugger    and    leadpipe        gladys pulls it off      the hour of the dead     irrational fear of dental  spinach        a proper brawl doesn   t just happen         how the trunk was stolen     the etiquette of knives      stanley   s little moment     face to face     fire      the mail coaches had survived the decline and fall of the post office because they had to .  horses needed to be fed .  but in any case  the coaches had always carried passengers .  the halls went silent  the chandeliers disappeared along with everything else  even things that were nailed down  but out back in the big yard the coach service flourished .  the coaches weren   t exactly stolen  and weren   t exactly inherited   they just drifted into the possession of the coach people .   then  according to groat  who regarded himself as the custodian of all post office knowledge  the other coach drivers had been bought out by big jim    still standing    upwright with the money he won betting on himself in a bare knuckle contest against harold    the hog    boots  and was now run by his sons harry    slugger    upwright and little jim    leadpipe    upwright .   moist could see that a careful approach was going to be required .   the hub  or nerve center  of the coach business was a big shed next to the stable .  it smelled   no  it stank of   no  it fugged of   horses  leather  veterinary medicine  bad coal  brandy  and cheap cigars .  that   s what a fug was .  you could have cut cubes out of the air and sold it for cheap building material .   when moist entered  a huge man  made practically hemispherical by multiple layers of waistcoats and overcoats  was warming his backside in front of the roaring stove .  another man of very much the same shape was leaning over the shoulder of a clerk  both of them concentrating on some paper .   some staffing debate had obviously been in progress  because the man by the fire was saying     well  then  if he   s sick put young alfred on the evening run and        he stopped when he saw moist  and then said     yes  sir .  what can we do for you .         carry my mailbags     said moist .   they stared at him  and then the man who   d been toasting his bottom broke into a grin .  jim and harry upwright might have been twins .  they were big men  who looked as though they   d been built out of pork and fat bacon .      are you this shiny new postmaster we   ve been hearing about .         that   s right .         yeah  well  your man was already here     said the toaster .     went on and on about how we should do this and do that  never said anything about the price .         a price .     said moist  spreading out his hands and beaming .     is that all this is about .  easily done .  easily done .      he turned  opened the door  and shouted     okay  gladys .      there was some shouting in the darkness of the yard  and then the creak of timber .      what the hell did you do .     said the spherical man .      my price is this     said moist .     you agree to carry my mail  and you won   t have another wheel dragged off that mail coach out there .  i can   t say fairer than that  okay .      the man lumbered forward  growling  but the other coachman grabbed his coat .      steady there  jim     he said .     he   s gov   ment and he   s got golems working for    im .      on cue  mr .  pump stepped into the room  bending to get through the doorway .  jim scowled at him .      that don   t frighten me .     said jim .     they ain   t allowed to hurt folks .         wrong     said moist .     probably dead wrong .         then we   ll call the watch on yer     said harry upwright  still holding back his brother .     all proper and official .  how d   you like that .         good  call the watch     said moist .     and i shall tell them i   m recovering stolen property .     he raised his voice .     gladys .      there was another crash from outside .      stolen .  those coaches are ours .     said harry upwright .      wrong again  i   m afraid     said moist .     mr .  pump .         the mail coaches were never sold off     the golem rumbled .     they are the property of the post office .  no rent has been paid for the use of post office property .         right  that   s it .     jim roared  shaking his brother away .  mr .  pump   s fists raised instantly .   the world paused .      hold on  jim  hold on just one minute     said harry upwright carefully .     what   s your game  mr .  postman .  our dad used to run the coaches in the old days  right .  he always took passengers  too  right .  and then there was no mail to take but people still wanted to travel  and the coaches were just standing around and the horses were needing to be fed  so he paid for the fodder  and the vet   s bills  and no one           just take my mail     said moist .     that   s all .  every coach takes the mailbags and drops them off where i say .  that   s all .  tell me where you   ll get a better deal tonight  eh .  you could try your luck pleading finders keepers to vetinari  but that   d take a while to sort out and in the meantime you   d lose all that lovely revenue   no .  okay .  glady    .         no .  no .  wait a minute     said harry .     just the mailbags .  that   s all .         what .     said jim .     you want to negotiate .  why .  they say possession   s nine points of the law  right .         and i possess a lot of golems  mr .  upwright     said moist .     and you don   t possess any deeds  mortgages  or bills of sale .         yeah .  and you won   t possess any teeth  mister .     said jim  rolling forward .      now  now     said moist  stepping quickly in front of mr .  pump and raising a hand .     don   t kill me again  mr .  upwright .      both brothers looked puzzled .      i   ll swear jim never laid a finger on you  and that   s the truth     said harry .     what   s your game .         oh  he did  harry     said moist .     lost his temper  took a swing  i went over  hit my head on that old bench there  i got up not knowing where the hell i was  you tried to hold jim back  he hit me with that chair  the one just there  and down i went for keeps  the golems got you  harry  but jim went on the run  only to be tracked down by the watch in sto lat  oh  what scenes  what chases  and you both ended up in the tanty  the charge against the pair of you being murder           here  i didn   t hit you with the chair .     said harry  eyes wide .     it was jim   here  hang on a minute              and this morning mr .  trooper measured you up for the last necktie and there you were  standing in that room under the gallows  knowing that you   d lost your business  you   d lost your coaches  you   d lost your fine horses  and in two minutes        moist let the sentence hang in the air .      and .     said harry .  both brothers were watching him with expressions of horrified confusion which would coalesce into violence inside five seconds if this didn   t work .  keep them off balance  was the ticket .   moist counted to four in his head  while smiling beatifically .      and then an angel appeared     he said .      ten minutes can change a lot .  it was enough to brew two cups of tea thick enough to spread on bread .   the brothers upwright probably didn   t believe in angels .  but they believed in bullshit  and were the type to admire it when it was delivered with panache .  there   s a kind of big  outdoors sort of man who   s got no patience at all with prevaricators and fibbers  but will applaud any man who can tell an outrageous whopper with a gleam in his eye .      funny you should turn up tonight     said harry .      oh .  why .            cos a man from the grand trunk came round this afternoon and offered us big money for the business .  too much money  you could say .      oh  thought moist   something   s starting        but you  mr .  lipwig  is giving us nothing but attitude and threats     said jim .     care to raise your offer .         okay .  bigger threats     said moist .     but i   ll throw in a new paint job on every coach  gratis .  be sensible  gentlemen .  you   ve had an easy ride  but now we   re back in business .  all you have to do is what you   ve always done  but you   ll carry my mail .  come on  there   s a lady waiting for me and you know you shouldn   t keep a lady waiting .  what do you say .         is she an angel .     said harry .      he probably hopes not  hur  hur .     jim had a laugh like a bull clearing its throat .      hur  hur     said moist solemnly .     just carry the bags  gents .  the post office is going places and you could be in the driving seat .      the brothers exchanged a glance .  then they grinned .  it was as if one grin spread across two glistening  red faces .      our dad would   ve liked you     said jim .      he sure as hell wouldn   t like the grand trunk devils     said harry .     they need cutting down to size  mr .  lipwig  and people are saying you   re the man to do it .         people die on them towers     said jim .     we see  you know .  damn right .  the towers follows the coach roads .  we used to have the contract to haul lads out to the towers and we heard    em talking .  they used to have an hour a day when they shut the whole trunk down for mait   nance .         the hour of the dead  they called it     said harry .     just before dawn .  that   s when people die .         across a continent  the line of light beads on the pre dawn darkness .  and then  the hour of the dead begins  at either end of the grand trunk  as the upline and down line shutters clear their messages and stop moving  one after the other .   the men of the towers had prided themselves on the speed with which they could switch their towers from black and white daylight transmission to the light and dark mode of the night .  on a good day  they could do it with barely a break in transmission  clinging to swaying ladders high above the ground  while around them the shutters rattled and chattered .  there were heroes who   d lit all sixteen lamps on a big tower in less than a minute  sliding down ladders  swinging on ropes  keeping their tower alive .     alive    was the word they used .  no one wanted a dark tower  not even for a minute .   the hour of the dead was different .  that was one hour for repairs  replacements  maybe even some paperwork .  it was mostly replacements .  it was fiddly to repair a shutter high up on the tower  with the wind making it tremble and freezing the blood in your fingers  and always better to swing it out and down to the ground and slot another one in place .  but when you were running out of time  it was tempting to brave the wind and try to free the bloody shutters by hand .   sometimes the wind won .  the hour of the dead was when men died .   and when a man died  they sent him home by clacks .      moist   s mouth dropped open .      that   s what they call it     said harry .     not lit   rally  o   course .  but they send his name from one end of the trunk to the other  ending up at the tower nearest his home .         yeah  but sometimes they say the person stays on in the towers  somehow     said jim .        living in the overhead     they call it .         but they   re mostly drunk when they say that     said harry .      oh  yes  mostly drunk  i   ll grant you     said his brother .     they get worked too hard .  there   s no hour of the dead now  they only get twenty minutes .  they cut the staff  too .      they used to run a slow service on octedays  now it   s high speed all the time  except towers keep breaking down .  we seen lads come down from them towers with their eyes spinning and their hands shaking and no idea what day it is .  it drives    em mad .  eh .  damn right .         except that they   re already mad     said harry .     you   d have to be mad to work up in them things .         they get so mad even ordinary mad people think they   re mad .         that   s right .  but they still go back up there .  the clacks drives them back .  the clacks owns them  gets into their souls     said harry .     they get paid practically nothing but i   ll swear they   d go up those towers for free .         the grand trunk runs on blood now  since the new gang took over .  it   s killin    men for money     said jim .   harry drained his mug .     we won   t have none of it     he said .     we   ll run your mail for you  mr .  lipwig  for all that you wear a damn silly hat .         tell me     said moist     have you ever hear of something called the smoking gnu .         dunno much     said jim .     a couple of the boys mentioned them once .  some kind of outlaw signalers or something .  something to do with the overhead .         what is the overhead .  er   dead people live in it .         look  mr .  lipwig  we just listen  okay .     said jim .     we chat to    em nice and easy     cos when they come down from the towers they   re so dozy they   ll walk under your coach wheels           it   s the rocking in the wind     said harry .     they walk like sailors .         right .  the overhead .  well  they said a lot of the messages the clacks carries is about the clacks  okay .  orders from the company  housekeeping messages  messages about messages              dead men   s names       said moist .      yeah  them  too .  well  the smoking gnu is in there somewhere     jim went on .     that   s all i know .  i drive coaches  mr .  lipwig .  i ain   t a clever man like them up on the towers .  hah  i   m stupid enough to keep my feet on the ground .         tell mr .  lipwig about tower     jim     said harry .     make    is flesh creep .         yeah  heard about that one .     said jim  looking slyly at moist .      no .  what happened .         only two lads were up there  where there should   ve been three .  one of them went out in a gale to budge a stuck shutter  which he shouldn   t   ve done  and fell off and got his safety rope tangled around his neck .  so the other bloke rushed out to get him  without his safety rope   which he shouldn   t   ve done   and they reckon he got blown right off the tower .         that   s horrible     said moist .     not creepy  though .  as such .         oh  you want the creepy bit .  ten minutes after they was both dead the tower sent a message for help .  sent by a dead man   s hand .     jim stood up and put his tricorn hat on .     got to take a coach out in twenty minutes .  nice to meet you  mr .  lipwig .     he pulled open a drawer in the battered desk and pulled out a length of lead pipe .     that   s for highwaymen     he said  and then took out a big  silver brandy flask .     and this is for me     he added with rather more satisfaction .     eh .  damn right .      and i thought the post office was full of crazy people  moist thought .      thank you     he said  standing .  then he remembered the strange letter in his pocket  for whatever use it was  and added     have you got a coach stopping at pseudopolis tomorrow .         yeah  at ten o   clock     said harry .      we   ll have a bag for it     said moist .      is it worth it .     said jim .     it   s more   n fifty miles  and i heard they   ve got the trunk repaired .  it   s a stoppin    coach  won   t get there    til nearly dark .         got to make the effort  jim     said moist .   the coachman gave him a look with the little glint that indicated he thought moist was up to something  but said     well  you   re game  i   ll say that for you .  we   ll wait for your bag  mr .  lipwig  and the best of luck to you .  must rush  sir .         what coach are you taking out .     said moist .      i   ll take the first two stages of the overnight flyer to quirm  leaving at seven     said jim .     if it   s still got all its wheels .         it   s nearly seven .         twenty to  sir .         i   ll be late .      the coachmen watch him run back across the yard  with mr .  pump trailing slowly behind .   jim thoughtfully pulled on his thick leather gauntlets and then said to his brother     you know how you get them funny feelings .         i reckon i do  jim .         and would you reckon there   ll be a clacks failure between here and pseudopolis tomorrow .         funny you should mention that .  mind you  it   d be a two to one bet anyway  the way things have been going .  maybe he   s just a betting man  jim .         yeah     said jim .     yeah .  eh .  damn right .         moist struggled out of the golden suit .  it was good advertising  no doubt about it  and when he wore it he felt he had style coming out of his ears  but wearing something like that to the mended drum meant that he wanted to be hit over the head with a stool and what would come out of his ears wouldn   t bear thinking about .   he threw the wing  d hat on the bed and struggled into his second golem made suit .  somber  he   d said .  you had to hand it to golem tailoring .  the suit was so black that if it had been sprinkled with stars the owls would have collided with it .  he needed more time  but somehow adora belle dearheart was not someone you should keep waiting .      you look fine  sir     said groat .      thanks  thanks     said moist  struggling with his tie .     you   re in charge  mr .  groat .  should all be quiet this evening .  remember  first thing tomorrow  all mail for pseudopolis ten pence a go  okay .         right you are  sir .  can i wear the hat now .     groat pleaded .      what .  what .     said moist  staring into the mirror .     look  have i got spinach between my teeth .         have you eaten spinach today  sir .     said mr .  pump .      i haven   t eaten spinach since i was old enough to spit     said moist .     but people always worry about that at a time like this  don   t they .  i thought it just turned up somehow .  you know   like moss .  what was it you asked me  tolliver .         can i wear the hat  sir .     said groat patiently .     bein    as i   m your deputy and you   re going out  sir .         but we   re closed .         yes  but   it   s  well   i   d just like to wear the hat .  for a while  sir .  just for a while  sir .  if it   s all right with you .     groat shifted from one foot to the other .     i mean  i will be in charge .      moist sighed .     yes  of course  mr .  groat .  you may wear the hat .  mr .  pump .         yes  sir .         mr .  groat is in charge for the evening .  you will not follow me  please .         no  i will not .  my day off begins now .  for all of us .  we will return at sunset tomorrow .         oh   yes .     one day off every week  miss dearheart said .  it was part of what distinguished golems from hammers .     i wish you   d given me more warning  you know .  we   re going to be a bit short staffed .         you were told  mr .  lipvig .         yes  yes .  it is a rule .  it   s just that tomorrow is going to be           don   t you worry about a thing  sir     said groat .     some of the lads i hired today  sir  they   re postmen   s sons  sir  and grandsons .  no problem  sir .  they   ll be out delivering tomorrow .         oh .  good .  that   s fine  then .     moist adjusted his tie again .  a black tie on a black shirt under a black jacket isn   t easy even to find .     all right  mr .  pump .  still no attack of spinach .  i   m going to see a lady .         yes  mr .  lipvig .  miss dearheart     said the golem calmly .      how did you know that .     said moist .      you shouted it out in front of approximately a hundred people  mr .  lipvig     said mr .  pump .     we   that is to say  mr .  lipvig  all the golems   we wish miss dearheart was a happier lady .  she has had much trouble .  she is looking for someone with              a cigarette lighter .     said moist quickly .     stop right there  mr .  pump  please .  cupids are these   little overweight kids in nappies  all right .  not big clay people .         anghammarad said she reminded him of lela the volcano goddess  who smokes all the time because the god of rain has rained on her lava     the golem went on .      yes  but women always complain about that sort of thing     said moist .     i look all right  mr .  groat  do i .         oh  sir     said groat     i shouldn   t think mr .  moist von lipwig ever has to worry when he   s off to meet a young lady  eh .      come to think of it  moist came to think as he hurried through the crowded streets  he never has been off to meet a young lady .  not in all these years .  oh  albert and all the rest of them had met hundreds  and had all kinds of fun  including once getting his jaw dislocated  which was only fun in a no fun at all kind of way .  but moist  never .  he   d always been behind the false mustache or glasses or  really  just the false person .  he had that naked feeling again  and began to wish he hadn   t left his golden suit behind .   when he reached the mended drum  he remembered why he had .   people kept telling him that ankh morpork was a lot more civilized these days  that  between them  the watch and the guilds had settled things down enough that actually being attacked while going about your lawful business in ankh morpork was now merely a possibility instead of  as it once was  a matter of course .  and the streets were so clean now that you could sometimes even see the street .   but the mended drum could be depended upon .  if someone didn   t come out of the door backwards and fall down in the street just as you passed  then there was something wrong with the world .   and there was a fight going on .  more or less .  but in some ways  at least  time had moved on .  you couldn   t just haul off and belt someone with an ax these days .  people expected things of a bar brawl .  as he went in  moist passed a large group of men of the broken nosed  one eared persuasion  bent in anxious conclave      look  bob  what part of this don   t you understand  eh .  it   s a matter of style  okay .  a proper brawl doesn   t just happen .  you don   t just pile in  not anymore .  now  oyster dave here   put your helmet back on  dave   will be the enemy in front  and basalt  who  as we know  don   t need a helmet  he   ll be the enemy coming up behind you .  okay  it   s well past knuckles time  let   s say gravy there has done his thing with the bench swipe  there   s a bit of knife play  we   ve done the whole chandelier swing number  blah blah blah  then second chair   that   s you  bob   you step smartly between their number five man and a bottler  swing the chair back over your head  like this   sorry  pointy   and then swing it right back onto number five  bang  crash  and there   s a cushy six points in your pocket .  if they   re playing a dwarf at number five  then a chair won   t even slow him down  but don   t fret  hang on to the bits that stay in your hand  pause one moment as he comes at you  and then belt him across both ears .  they hate that  as stronginthearm here will tell you .  another three points .  it   s probably going to be freestyle after that but i want all of you  including mucky mick and crispo  to try for a double andrew when it gets down to the fist fighting again .  remember .  you back into each other  turn around to give the other guy a thumping  cue moment of humorous recognition  then link left arms  swing round and see to the other fellow   s attacker  foot or fist  it   s your choice .  fifteen points right there if you get it to flow just right .  oh  and remember we   ll have an igor standing by  so if your arm gets taken off do pick it up and hit the other bugger with it  it gets a laugh and twenty points .  on that subject  do remember what i said about getting everything tattooed with your name  all right .  igors do their best  but you   ll be on your feet much quicker if you make life easier for him and  what   s more  it   s your feet you   ll be on .  okay  positions  everyone  let   s run through it again        moist sidled past the group and scanned the huge room .  the important thing was not to slow down .  slowing down attracted people .   he saw a thin plume of blue smoke rise above the crowd  and forced his way through .   miss dearheart was sitting alone at a very small table with a very small drink in front of her .  she couldn   t have been there long  the only other stool was unoccupied .      do you come in here often .     said moist  slipping onto it quickly .   miss dearheart raised her eyebrows at him .      yes .  why not .         well  i   i imagine it   s not very safe for a woman on her own .         what  with all these big strong men here to protect me .  why don   t you go and get your drink .      moist got to the bar eventually  by dropping a handful of small change on the floor .  that usually cleared the crush a little .   when he returned  his seat was occupied by a currently friendly drunk .  moist recognized the type  and the operative word was    currently .     miss dearheart was leaning back to avoid his attentions and  more probably  his breath .   moist heard the familiar cry of the generously sloshed .      what   right .  what i   m saying is  right  what i   m saying  narhmean  why won   t you  right  gimme a kiss  right .  all i   m saying is        oh gods  i   m going to have to do something  moist thought .  he   s big and he   s got a sword like a butcher   s cleaver and the moment i say anything he   s going to go right into stage four  violent undirected madman  and they can be surprisingly accurate before they fall over .   he put down his drink .   miss dearheart gave him a very brief look  and shook her head .  there was movement under the table  a small  fleshy kind of noise  and the drunk suddenly bent forward  color draining from his face .  probably only the man and moist heard miss dearheart purr     what is sticking in your foot is a mitzy    pretty lucretia    four inch heel  the most dangerous footwear in the world .  considered as pounds per square inch  it   s like being trodden by a very pointy elephant .  now  i know what you   re thinking  you   re thinking     could she press it all the way through to the floor .     and  you know  i   m not sure about that myself .  the sole of your boot might give me a bit of trouble  but nothing else will .  but that   s not the worrying part .  the worrying part is that i was forced practically at knifepoint to take ballet lessons as a child  which means i can kick like a mule  you are sitting in front of me  and i have another shoe .  good  i can see you have worked that out .  i   m going to withdraw the heel now .      there was a small pop from under the table .  with great care  the man stood up  turned  and lurched unsteadily away  without so much as a backward glance .      can i bother you .     said moist .  miss dearheart nodded  and he sat down  with his legs crossed .      he was only a drunk     moist ventured .      yes  men say that sort of thing     said miss dearheart .     anyway  tell me that if i hadn   t done that you wouldn   t be now trying to collect all your teeth in your hat .  which you are not wearing  i notice .  this must be your secret identity .  sorry  was that the wrong thing to say .  you spilled your drink .      moist wiped beer off his lapel .      no  this is me     he said .     pure and unadorned .         you hardly know me and yet you invited me out on a date     said miss dearheart .     why .      because you called me a phony  moist thought .  you saw through me straight away .  because you didn   t nail my head to the door with your crossbow .  because you have no small talk .  because i   d like to get to know you better  even though it would be like smooching an ashtray .  because i wonder if you could put into the rest of your life the passion you put into smoking a cigarette .  in defiance of miss maccalariat i   d like to commit hanky panky with you  miss adora belle dearheart   well  certainly hanky  and possibly panky when we get to know each other better .  i   d like to know as much about your soul as you know about mine     he said     because i hardly know you .         if it comes to that  i hardly know you  either     said miss dearheart .      i   m rather banking on that     said moist .  this got a smile .      smooth answer  slick .  where are we really eating tonight .         le foie heureux  of course     said moist .   she looked genuinely surprised .     you got a reservation .         oh  yes .         you   ve got a relative that works there  then .  you   re blackmailing the ma  tre d    .         no .  but i   ve got a table for tonight     said moist .      then it   s some sort of trick     said miss dearheart .     i   m impressed .  but i   d better warn you  enjoy the meal .  it may be your last .         what .         the grand trunk company kills people  mr .  lipwig .  in all kinds of ways .  you must be getting on reacher gilt   s nerves .         oh  come on .  i   m barely a wasp at their picnic .         and what do people do to wasps  do you think .     said miss dearheart .     the trunk is in trouble  mr .  lipwig .  the company has been running it as a machine for making money .  they thought repair would be cheaper than maintenance .  they   ve cut everything to the bone  to the bone .  they   re people who can   t take a joke .  do you think reacher gilt will hesitate for one minute to swat you .         but i   m being very       moist tried .      do you think you   re playing a game with them .  ringing doorbells and running away .  gilt   s aiming to become patrician one day  everyone says so .  and suddenly there   s this   this idiot in a big gold hat reminding everyone what a mess the clacks is  poking fun at it  getting the post office working again           hang on  hang on     moist managed .     this is a city  not some cow town somewhere .  people don   t kill business rivals just like that  do they .         in ankh morpork .  you really think so .  oh  he won   t kill you .  he won   t even bother with the formality of going through the guild of assassins .  you   ll just die .  just like my brother .  and he   ll be behind it .         your brother .     said moist .  on the far side of the huge room  the evening   s fight began with a well executed looking at me in a funny way  earning two points and a broken tooth .      he and some of the people who used to work on the trunk before it was pirated   pirated  mr .  lipwig   were going to start up a new trunk     said miss dearheart  leaning forward .     they   d scraped up funding somehow for a few demonstration towers .  it was going to be more than four times as fast as the old system  they were going to do all kinds of clever things with the coding  it was going to be wonderful .  a lot of people gave them their savings  people who   d worked for my father .  most of the good engineers left when my father lost the trunk  you see .  they couldn   t stand gilt and his bunch of looters .  my brother was going to get all our money back .         you   ve lost me there     said moist .  an ax landed in the table  and vibrated .   miss dearheart stared at moist and blew a stream of smoke past his ear .      my father is robert dearheart     she said distantly .     he was chairman of the original grand trunk company .  the clacks was his vision .  hell  he designed half of the mechanisms in the towers .  and he got together with a group of other engineers  all serious men with slide rules  and they borrowed money and mortgaged their houses and built a local system and poured the money back in and started building the trunk .  there was a lot of money coming in  every city wanted to be in on it  everyone was going to be rich .  we had stables .  i had a horse .  admittedly  i didn   t like it much .  but i used to feed it and watch it run about or whatever it is they do .  everything was going fine  and suddenly he got this letter and there were meetings and they said he was lucky not to go to prison for  oh  i don   t know  something complicated and legal .  but the clacks was still making huge amounts .  can you understand that .  reacher gilt and his gang acted  oh yes  friendly  but were buying up the mortgages and controlling banks and moving numbers around and they pulled the grand trunk out from under us like thieves .  all they want to do is make money .  they don   t care about the trunk .  they   ll run it into the ground and make more money by selling it .  when dad was in charge  people were proud of what they did .  and because they were engineers  they made sure that the towers worked properly  all the time .  they even had what they called    walking towers     prefabricated ones that packed onto a couple of big carts so that if a tower was having serious trouble they could set this one up alongside and start it up and take over the traffic without dropping a single code .  they were proud of it  everyone was  they were proud to be a part of it .         you should   ve been there .  you should   ve seen it .     moist said to himself .  he hadn   t meant to say it out loud .   across the room  a man hit another man with his own leg and picked up seven points .      yes     said miss dearheart .     you should have .  and three months ago my brother john raised enough to start a rival to the trunk .  that took some doing .  gilt has got tentacles everywhere .  well  john ended up dead in a field .  they said he hadn   t clipped his safety rope on .  he always did .  and now my father just sits and stares at the wall .  he even lost his workshop when everything got taken away .  we lost our house  of course .  now we live with my aunt in dolly sisters .  that   s what we   ve come to .  when reacher gilt talks about freedom he means his  not anyone else   s .  and now you pop up  mr .  moist von lipwig  all shiny and new  running around doing everything at once .  why .         vetinari offered me the job  that   s all     said moist .      why did you take it .         it was a job for life .      she stared at moist so hard that he began to feel uncomfortable .      well  you   ve managed to get a table at le foie heureux at a few hours    notice     she conceded  as a knife struck a beam behind her .     are you still going to lie if i ask you how .         yes  i think so .         good .  shall we go .         a little pressure lamp burned in the stuffy snugness of the locker room  its glow a globe of unusual brilliance .  in the center of it  magnifying glass in hand  stanley examined his stamps .   this was   heaven .  peas are known for their thoroughness  and stanley was conscientious in the extreme .  mr .  spools  slightly unnerved by his smile  had given him all the test sheets and faulty pages  and stanley was carefully cataloguing them   how many of each  what the errors were  everything .   a little tendril of guilt was curling through his mind  this was better than pins  it really was .  there could be no end to stamps .  you could put anything on them .  they were amazing .  they could move letters around and then you could stick them in a book  all neat .  you wouldn   t get    pinhead   s thumb     either .   he   d read about this feeling in the pin magazines .  they said you could come unpinned .  girls and marriage were sometimes mentioned in this context .  sometimes an ex head would sell off his whole collection  just like that .  or at some pin meet someone would suddenly throw all their pins in the air and run out  shouting     aargh  they   re just pins .     up until now  such a thing had been unthinkable to stanley .   he picked up his little sack of unsorted pins  and stared at it .  a few days ago  the mere thought of an evening with his pins would have given him a lovely  warm  comfortable feeling inside .  but now it was time to put away childish pins .   something screamed .   it was harsh  guttural  it was malice and hunger given a voice .  small  huddling  shrewlike creatures had once heard sounds like that  circling over the swamps .   after a moment of ancient terror had subsided  stanley crept over and opened the door .      h hello .     he called in the cavernous darkness of the hall .     is there anyone there .      there was  fortunately  no reply  but there was some scrabbling up near the roof .      we   re closed  you know     he quavered .     but we   re open again at seven in the morning for a range of stamps and a wonderful deal on mail to pseudopolis .     his voice slowed and his brow creased as he tried to remember everything mr .  lipwig had told them earlier .     remember  we may not be the fastest but we always get there .  why not write to your old granny .         i ate my grandmother     growled a voice from high in the darkness .     i gnawed her bones .      stanley coughed .  he had not been trained in the art of salesmanship .      ah     he said .     er   perhaps an aunt  then .      he wrinkled his nose .  why was there the stink of lamp oil in the air .      hello .     he said again .   something dropped out of the dark  bounced off his shoulder  and landed on the floor with a wet thud .  stanley reached down  felt around  and found a pigeon .  at least  he found about half a pigeon .  it was still warm  and very sticky .      mr .  gryle sat on a beam high above the hall .  his stomach was on fire .   it was no good  old habits died too hard .  they were bred in the bone .  something warm and feathery fluttered up in front of you and of course you snapped at it .  ankh morpork had pigeons roosting on every gutter  cornice  and statue .  not even the resident gargoyles could keep them down .  he   d had six before he sailed in through the broken dome  and then another huge  warm  feathery cloud had risen up  and a red haze had simply dropped in front of his eyes .   they were so tasty .  you couldn   t stop at one .  and  five minutes later  you remembered why you should have .   these were feral  urban birds that lived on what they could find on the streets   ankh morpork streets  at that .  they were bobbing  cooing plague pits .  you might as well eat a dog turd burger and wash it down with a jumbo cup of septic tank .   mr .  gryle groaned .  best to finish the job  get out of here  and go and throw up over a busy street .  he dropped his oil bottle into the dark and fumbled for his matches .  his species had come to fire late  because nests burned too easily  but it did have its uses        flame blossomed  high up at the far end of the hall .  it dropped from the beams and landed on the stacks of letters .  there was a whoomph as the oil caught fire  blue runnels of flame began to climb the walls .   stanley looked down .  a few feet away  lit by the fire crawling across the letters  was a figure curled up on the floor .  the golden hat with wings lay next to it .   stanley looked up  eyes glowing red in the firelight  as a figure swooped from the rafters and sped toward him  mouth open .   and that   s when it all went wrong for mr .  gryle  because stanley had one of his little moments .      attitude was everything .  moist had studied attitude .  some of the old nobility had it .  it was the total lack of any doubt that things would go the way they expected them to go .   the ma  tre d    ushered them to their table without a moment   s hesitation .      can you really afford this on a government salary  mr .  lipwig .     said miss dearheart as they sat down .     or are we going to exit via the kitchens .         i believe i have adequate funds     said moist .   he probably hadn   t  he knew .  a restaurant that has a waiter even for the mustard stacks up the prices .  but right now moist wasn   t worrying about the bill .  there were ways to deal with bills  and it was best to deal with them on a full stomach .   they ordered appetizers that probably cost more than the weekly food bill for an average man .  there was no point in looking for the cheapest thing on the menu .  the cheapest thing theoretically existed but somehow  no matter how hard you stared  didn   t quite manage to be there .  on the other hand  there were a lot of most expensive things .      are the boys settling in okay .     said miss dearheart .   the boys  moist thought .     oh  yes .  anghammarad has really taken to it .  a natural postman     he said .      well  he   s had practice .         what   s that box he   s got riveted to his arm .         that .  a message he   s got to deliver .  not the original baked clay tablet  i gather .  he   s had to make copies two or three times and the bronze lasts hardly any time at all  to a golem .  it   s a message to king het of thut from his astrologers on their holy mountain  telling him that the goddess of the sea was angry and what ceremonies he   d have to do to placate her .         didn   t that slide into the sea anyway .  i thought he said           yeah  yeah  anghammarad got there too late and was swept away by the ferocious tidal wave  and the island sank .         so    .     said moist .      so what .     said miss dearheart .      so   he doesn   t think that delivering it now might be a bit on the tardy side .         no .  he doesn   t .  you   re not seeing it like a golem .  they believe the universe is doughnut shaped .         would that be a ring doughnut or a jam doughnut .     said moist .      ring  definitely  but don   t push for further culinary details  because i can see you   ll try to make a joke of it .  they think it has no start or finish .  we just keep going round and round  but we don   t have to make the same decisions every time .         like getting an angel the hard way     said moist .      what do you mean .     said miss dearheart .      er   he   s waiting until the whole tidal wave business comes around again and this time he   ll get there earlier and do it right .         yes .  don   t point out all the flaws in the idea .  it works for him .         he   s going to wait for millions and millions of years .     said moist .      that   s not a flaw  not to a golem .  that   s only a matter of time .  they don   t get bored .  they repair themselves and they   re very hard to shatter .  they survive under the sea or in red hot lava .  he might be able to do it  who knows .  in the meantime  he keeps himself busy .  just like you  mr .  lipwig .  you   ve been very busy        she froze  staring over his shoulder .  he saw her right hand scrabble frantically among the cutlery and grab a knife .      that bastard has just walked into the place .     she hissed .     reacher gilt .  i   ll just kill him and join you for the pudding           you can   t do that .     hissed moist .      oh .  why not .         you   re using the wrong knife .  that   s for the fish .  you   ll get into trouble .      she glared at him  but her hand relaxed  and something like a smile appeared on her face .      they don   t have a knife for stabbing rich  murdering bastards .     she said .      they bring it to the table when you order one     said moist urgently .     look  this isn   t the drum  they don   t just throw the body into the river .  they   ll call the watch .  get a grip .  not on the knife .  and get ready to run .         why .         because i forged his signature on grand trunk notepaper to get us in here  that   s why .      moist turned to look around at the great man in the flesh for the first time .  he was great  a bear shaped man  in a frock coat big enough for two  and a gold braid waistcoat .  and he had a cockatoo on his shoulder  although a waiter was hurrying forward with a shiny brass perch and  presumably  the seed and nut menu .   there was a party of well dressed people with gilt  and as they progressed across the room the whole place began to revolve around the big man  gold being very dense and having a gravity all of its own .  waiters bustled and groveled and did unimportant things with an air of great importance  and it was probably only a matter of minutes before one of them told gilt that his other guests had been seated .  but moist was scanning the rest of the room for the   ah  there they were  two of them .  what was it about hired muscle that made it impossible to get a suit to fit .   one was watching the door  one was watching the room  and without a shadow of a doubt there was at least one in the kitchen .      and  yes  the ma  tre d    was earning his tip by assuring the great man that his friends had been duly looked after        the big head  with its leonine mane  turned to stare at moist   s table        miss dearheart murmured     oh gods  he   s coming over .            and moist stood up .  the hired fists had shifted position .  they wouldn   t actually do anything in here  but nor would anyone else be worried if he was escorted out with speed and firmness for a little discussion in some alley somewhere .  gilt was advancing between the tables  leaving his puzzled guests behind .   this was a job for people skills  or diving through the window .  but gilt would have to be at least marginally polite .  people were listening .      mr .  reacher gilt .     said moist .      indeed  sir     said gilt  grinning without a trace of humor .     but you appear to have me at a disadvantage .         i do hope not  sir     said moist .      it appears that i asked the restaurant to retain a table for you  mr .    lipwig .         did you  mr .  gilt .     said moist  with what he knew was remarkably persuasive innocence .     we arrived in the hope that there might be a spare table and were astonished to find there was .         then at least one of us has been made a fool of  mr .  lipwig     said gilt .     but tell me   are you truly mr .  moist von lipwig  the postmaster .         yes  i am .         without your hat .      moist coughed .     it   s not actually compulsory     he said .   the big face observed him in silence  and then a hand like a steelworker   s glove was thrust forward .      i am very pleased to meet you at last  mr .  lipwig .  i trust your good luck will continue .      moist took the hand and  instead of the bone crushing grip he was expecting  felt the firm handshake of an honorable man and looked into the steady  honest  one eyed gaze of reacher gilt .   moist had worked hard at his profession and considered himself pretty good at it  but if he had been wearing his hat  he would have taken it off right now .  he was in the presence of a master .  he could feel it in the hand  see it in that one commanding eye .  were things otherwise  he would have humbly begged to be taken on as an apprentice  scrub the man   s floors  cook his food  just to sit at the feet of greatness and learn how to do the three card trick using whole banks .  if moist was any judge  any judge at all  the man in front of him was the biggest fraud he   d ever met .  and he advertised it .  that was   style .  the pirate curls  the eyepatch  even the damn parrot .  twelve and a half percent  for heaven   s sake  didn   t anyone spot that .  he told them what he was  and they laughed and loved him for it .  it was breathtaking .  if moist von lipwig had been a career killer  it would have been like meeting a man who   d devised a way to destroy civilizations .   all this came in an instant  in one bolt of understanding  in the glint of an eye .  but something ran in front of it as fast as a little fish ahead of a shark .   gilt was shocked  not surprised .  that tiny moment was barely measurable on any clock  but just for an instant the world had gone wrong for reacher gilt .  that moment had been wiped out so competently that all that remained of it was moist   s certainty that it had happened  but the certainty was rigid .   he was loath to let go of the hand in case there was a flash that might broil him alive .  after all  he had recognized the nature of gilt  so the man must certainly have spotted him .      thank you  mr .  gilt     he said .      i gather you were kind enough to carry some of our messages today     gilt rumbled .      it was a pleasure  sir .  if ever you need our help  you only have to ask .         hmm     said gilt .     but the least i can do is buy you dinner  postmaster .  the bill will come to my table .  choose whatever you wish .  and now  if you will excuse me  i must attend to my   other guests .      he bowed to the simmering miss dearheart and walked back .      the management would like to thank you for not killing the guests     said moist  sitting down .     now we should        he stopped and stared .   miss dearheart  who had been saving up to hiss at him  took one look at his face and hesitated .      are you ill .     she said .      they   re   burning     said moist  his eyes widening .      ye gods  you   ve gone white .         the writing   they   re screaming   i can smell burning .         someone over there is having crepes     said miss dearheart .     it   s just       she stopped  and sniffed .     it smells like paper  though        people looked around as moist   s chair crashed backwards .      the post office is on fire .  i know it is .     he shouted  and turned and ran .   miss dearheart caught up just as he was in the hall  where one of gilt   s bodyguards had grabbed him .  she tapped the man on the shoulder and  as he turned to push her away  stamped down heavily .  as he screamed  she dragged the bewildered moist away .      water   we   ve got to get water       he groaned .     they   re burning .  they   re all burning .          chapter      the burning of words      in which stanley remains calm     moist the hero      searching for a cat  never a good idea     something in  the dark     mr .  gryle is encountered     fire and water      mr .  lipwig helps the watch     dancing on the edge      mr .  lipwig gets religion     opportunity time      miss maccalariat   s hair grip     the miracle      the letters burned  part of the ceiling fell down  showering more letters onto the flames .  the fire was already reaching for the upper floors .  as stanley dragged mr .  groat across the floor  another slab of plaster smashed on the tiles  and the old mail that poured down after it was already burning .  smoke  thick as soup  rolled across the distant ceiling .   stanley pulled the old man into the locker room and laid him on his bed .  he rescued the golden hat  too  because mr .  lipwig would be bound to be angry if he didn   t .  then he shut the door and took down  from the shelf over groat   s desk  the book of regulations .  he turned the pages methodically until he came to the page what to do in case of fire .   stanley always followed the rules .  all sorts of things could go wrong if you didn   t .   so far he   d done   .  upon discovery of the fire  remain calm .   now he came to   .  shout    fire .     in a loud  clear voice .      fire .     he shouted  and then ticked off   .  with his pencil .   next was   .  endeavor to extinguish fire if possible .   stanley went to the door and opened it .  flames and smoke billowed in .  he stared at them for a moment  shook his head  and shut the door .   paragraph   said  if trapped by fire  endeavor to escape .  do not open doors if warm .  do not use stairs if burning .  if no exit presents itself  remain calm and await  a  rescue or  b  death .   this seemed to cover it .  the world of pins was simple  and stanley knew his way around it like a goldfish knows its tank  but everything else was very complicated and only worked if you followed the rules .   he glanced up at the grubby little windows .  they were far too small to climb through and had been welded shut by many applications of official paint  so he broke one pane as neatly as possible to allow some fresh air in .  he made a note of this in the breakages book .   mr .  groat was still breathing  although with an unpleasant bubbling sound .  there was a first aid kit in the locker room  because regulations demanded it  but it contained only a small length of bandage  a bottle of something black and sticky  and mr .  groat   s spare teeth .  mr .  groat had told him never to touch his homemade medicines  and since it was not unusual for bottles to explode during the night  stanley had always observed this rule very carefully .   it did not say in the regulations  if attacked by huge swooping screaming creature hit hard in the mouth with sack of pins  and stanley wondered if he should pencil this in .  but that would be defacing post office property  and he could get into trouble for that .   all avenues of further activity being therefore closed  stanley remained calm .      it was a gentle snow of letters .  some landed still burning  fountaining out of the column of crackling fire that had already broken through the post office roof .  some were blackened ashes on which sparks traveled in mockery of the dying ink .  some  many  had sailed up and over the city unscathed  zig zagging down gently like communications from an excessively formal sort of god .   moist tore off his jacket as he pushed through the crowd .      the people probably got out     said miss dearheart  clattering along beside him .      do you really think so .     said moist .      really .  no .  not if gilt set this up .  sorry  i   m not very good at being comforting anymore .      moist paused  and tried to think .  the flames were coming out of the roof at one end of the building .  the main door and the whole left side looked untouched .  but fire was sneaky stuff  he knew .  it sat there and smoldered until you opened the door to see how it was getting on  and then the fire caught its breath and your eyeballs got soldered to your skull .      i   d better go in     he said .     er   you wouldn   t care to say     no  no  don   t do it  you   re being far too brave .     would you .     he added .  some people were organizing a bucket chain from a nearby fountain  it would be as effective as spitting at the sun .   miss dearheart caught a burning letter  lit a cigarette with it  and took a drag .     no  no  don   t do it  you   re being far too brave .     she said .     how was that for you .  but if you do  the left side looks pretty clear .  watch out  though .  there are rumors gilt employs a vampire .  one of the wild ones .         ah .  fire kills them  doesn   t it .     said moist  desperate to look on the bright side .      it kills everybody  mr .  lipwig     said miss dearheart .     it kills everybody .     she grabbed him by the ears and gave him a big kiss on the mouth .  it was like being kissed by an ashtray  but in a good way .      on the whole  i   d like you to come out of there     she said quietly .     are you sure you won   t wait .  the boys will be here in a minute           the golems .  it   s their day off .         they have to obey their chem  though .  a fire means humans are in danger .  they   ll smell it and be here in minutes  believe me .      moist hesitated  looking at her face .  and people were watching him .  he couldn   t not go in there  it wouldn   t fit in with the persona .  gods damn vetinari .   he shook his head  turned  and ran toward the doors .  best not to think about it .  best not to think about being so dumb .  just feel the front door   quite cool .  open it gently   a rush of air  but no explosion .  the big hall  lit with flame   but it was all above him  and if he weaved and dodged he could make it to the door that led down to the locker room .   he kicked it open .   stanley looked up from his stamps .      hello  mr .  lipwig     he said .     i kept calm .  but i think mr .  groat is ill .      the old man was lying on the bed  and ill was too jolly a word .      what happened to him .     said moist  lifting him gently .  mr .  groat was no weight at all .      it was like a big bird  but i frightened it off     said stanley .     i hit it in the mouth with a sack of pins .  i   had a little moment  sir .         well  that ought to do it     said moist .     now  can you follow me .         i   ve got all the stamps     said stanley .     and the cashbox .  mr .  groat keeps them under his bed for safety .     the boy beamed .     and your hat  too .  i kept calm .         well done  well done     said moist .     now  stick right behind me  okay .         what about tiddles  mr .  lipwig .     said stanley  suddenly looking worried .  somewhere outside in the hall there was a crash  and the crackle of the fire grew distinctly louder .      who .  tidd   the cat .  to hell with       moist stopped  and readjusted his mouth .     he   ll be outside  you can bet on it  eating a toasted rat and grinning .  come on  will you .         but he   s the post office cat .     said stanley .     he   s never been outside .      i   ll bet he has now  thought moist .  but there was that edge in the boy   s voice again .      let   s get mr .  groat out of here  okay .     he said  easing his way through the door with the old man in his arms     and then i   ll came back for tidd        a burning beam dropped onto the floor halfway across the hall  and sent sparks and burning envelopes spiraling upwards into the main blaze .   it roared  a wall of flame  a fiery waterfall in reverse  up through the other floors and out through the roof .  it thundered .  it was fire let loose and making the most of it .   part of moist von lipwig was happy to let it happen .  but a new and troublesome part was thinking  i was making it work .  it was all moving forward .  the stamps were really working .  it was as good as being a criminal without the crime .  it had been fun .      come on  stanley .     moist snapped  turning away from the horrible sight and the fascinating thought .  the boy followed reluctantly  calling for the damn cat all the way to the door .   the air outside struck like a knife  but there was a round of applause from the crowd and then a flash of light that moist had come to associate with eventual trouble .      good eefning  mr .  lipvig .     said the cheery voice of otto chriek .     my vord  if ve vant news  all ve have to do is follow you .      moist ignored him and shouldered his way to miss dearheart  who  he noticed  was not beside herself with worry .      is there a hospice in this city .     he said .     a decent doctor  even .         there   s the lady sibyl free hospital     said miss dearheart .      is it any good .         some people don   t die .         that good  eh .  get him there right now .  i   ve got to go back in for the cat .         you are going to go back in there for a cat .         it   s tiddles     said stanley primly .     he was born in the post office .         best not to argue     said moist  turning to go .     see to mr .  groat  will you .      miss dearheart looked down at the old man   s bloodstained shirt .      but it looks as though some creature tried to       she began .      something fell on him     said moist shortly .      that couldn   t cause           something fell on him     said moist .     that   s what happened .      she looked at his face .      all right     she agreed .     something fell on him .  something with big claws .         no  a joist with lots of nails in it  something like that .  anyone can see that .         that   s what happened  was it .     said miss dearheart .      that   s exactly what happened     said moist  and strode away before there were any more questions .   no point in getting the watch in this  he thought  hurrying toward the doors .  they   ll clump around  and there won   t be any answers for them  and  in my experience  watchmen always like to arrest somebody .  what makes you think it was reacher gilt  mr .    lipwig  wasn   t it .  oh  you could tell  could you .  that   s a skill of yours  is it .  funny thing  we can tell sometimes  too .  you   ve got a very familiar face  mr .  lipwig .  where are you from .   no  there was no point in getting friendly with the watch .  they might get in the way .   an upper window exploded outwards  and flames licked along the edge of the roof  moist ducked into the doorway as glass rained down .  as for tiddles   well   he had to find the damn cat .  if he didn   t  it wouldn   t be fun anymore .  if he didn   t risk at least a tiny bit of life and a smidgen of limb  he just wouldn   t be able to carry on being him .   had he just thought that .   oh  gods .  he   d lost it .  he   d never been sure how he   d got it  but it was gone .  that   s what happened if you took wages .  and hadn   t his grandfather warned him to keep away from women as neurotic as a shaved monkey .  actually he hadn   t  his interest lying mainly with dogs and beer  but he should have .   the vision of mr .  groat   s chest kept bumping insistently against his imagination .  it looked as though something with claws had taken a swipe at him  and only the thick uniform coat prevented him from being opened like a clam .  but that didn   t sound like a vampire .  they weren   t messy like that .  it was a waste of good food .   nevertheless  he picked up a piece of smashed chair .  it had splintered nicely .  and the nice thing about a stake through the heart was that it also worked on non vampires .   more ceiling had come down in the hall  but he was able to dodge between the debris .  the main staircase was at this end and completely untouched  although smoke lay on the floor like a carpet  at the other end of the hall  where the mountains of old mail had been  the blaze still roared .   he couldn   t hear the letters anymore .  sorry  he thought .  i did my best .  it wasn   t my fault     what now .  at least he could get his box out of his office .  that couldn   t be allowed to burn .  some of those chemicals would be quite hard to replace .   the office was full of smoke but he dragged the box out from under his desk and then spotted the golden suit on its hanger .  he had to take it  didn   t he .  something like that couldn   t be allowed to burn .  he could come back for the box  right .  but the suit   the suit was necessary .  there was no sign of tiddles .  he must have got out  yes .  didn   t cats leave sinking ships .  or was it rats .  wouldn   t the cats follow the rats .  anyway  smoke was coming up between the floorboards and drifting down from the upper floors  and this wasn   t the time to hang around .  he   d looked everywhere sensible  there was no sense in being where a ton of burning paper could drop on your head .   it was a good plan and it was only spoiled when he spotted the cat  down in the hall .  it was watching him with interest .      tiddles .     bellowed moist .  he wished he hadn   t .  it was such a stupid name to shout in a burning building .   the cat looked at him and trotted away .  cursing  moist hurried after it and saw it disappear down into the cellars .   cats were bright  weren   t they .  there was probably another way out   bound to be     moist didn   t even look up when he heard the creaking of wood overhead  but ran forward and went down the steps five at a time .  by the sound of it  a large amount of the entire building smashed into the floor just behind him  and sparks roared down the cellar passage  burning his neck .   well  there was no going back  at least .  but cellars  now  they had trapdoors and coal shutes and things  didn   t they .  and they were cool and safe and        just the place where you   d go to lick your wounds after being smashed in the mouth with a sackful of pins  right .   an imagination is a terrible thing to bring along .   a vampire  she   d said .  and stanley had hit    a big bird    with a sackful of pins .  stanley the vampire slayer  with a bag of pins .  you wouldn   t believe it unless you   d seen him in one of what mr .  groat called his    little moments .      you probably couldn   t kill a vampire with pins     and after a thought like that is when you realize that however hard you try to look behind you  there   s a behind you  behind you  where you aren   t looking .  moist flung his back to the cold stone wall and slithered along it until he ran out of wall and acquired a doorframe .   the faint blue glow of the sorting engine was just visible .   as moist peered into the machine   s room  tiddles was visible  too .  he was crouched under the engine .      that   s a very cat thing you   re doing here  tiddles     said moist  staring at the shadows .     come to uncle moist .  please .      he sighed  and hung the suit on an old letter rack  and crouched down .  how were you supposed to pick up a cat .  he   d never done it .  cats never figured in grandfather   s lipwigzer kennels  except as an impromptu snack .   as his hand drew near tiddles  the cat flattened its ears and hissed .      do you want to cook down here .     said moist .     no claws  please        the cat began to growl  and moist realized that it wasn   t looking directly at him .      good tiddles     he said  feeling the terror begin to rise .  it was one of the prime directives of exploring in a hostile environment  do not bother about the cat .  and  suddenly  the environment was a lot more hostile .   another important rule was  don   t turn around too slowly to look .  it   s there  all right .  not the cat .  damn the cat .  it   s something else .   he stood upright and took a two handed grip on the wooden stake .  it   s right behind me  yes .  he thought .  bloody well bloody right bloody behind me .  of course it is .  how could things be otherwise .   the feeling of fear was almost the same as the feeling he got when  say  a mark was examining a glass diamond .  time slowed a little  every sense was heightened  and there was a taste of copper in his mouth .   don   t turn around slowly .  turn around fast .   he spun  screamed  and thrust .  the stake met resistance  which yielded only slightly .   a long  pale face grinned at him in the blue light .  it showed rows of pointy teeth .      missed both my hearts     said mr .  gryle  spitting blood .      moist jumped back as a thin  clawed hand sliced through the air  but kept the stake in front of him  jabbing with it  holding the thing back     banshee  he thought .  oh hell     only when he moved did gryle   s leathery black cape swing aside briefly to show the skeletal figure beneath  it helped if you knew that the black leather was a wing .  it helped if you thought of banshees as the only humanoid race that had evolved the ability to fly  in some lush jungle somewhere where they   d hunted flying squirrels .  it didn   t help much if you knew why the story went that hearing the scream of the banshee meant that you were going to die .   it meant that the banshee was tracking you .  no good looking behind you .  it was overhead .   there weren   t many of the feral ones  even in uberwald  but moist knew the advice passed on by people who   d survived them .  keep away from the mouth  those teeth were vicious .  don   t attack the chest  the flight muscles there are like armor .  they   re not strong but they   ve got sinews like steel cables  and the long reach on those arm bones   ll mean it can slap your silly head right off     tiddles yowled and backed further under the sorting engine .  gryle slashed at moist again  and came after him as he backed away .      but their necks snap easily if you can get inside their reach  and they have to shut their eyes when they scream .   gryle came toward him  head bobbing as he strutted .  there was nowhere else for moist to go  so he tossed aside the wood and held up his hands .      all right  i give in     he said .     just make it quick  okay .      the creature kept looking at the golden suit  they had a magpie   s eye for glitter .      i   m going somewhere afterwards     said moist helpfully .   gryle hesitated .  he was hurt  disoriented  and had eaten pigeons that were effluent on wings .  he wanted to get out of here and up into the cool sky .  everything was too complicated here .  there were too many targets  too many smells .   for a banshee  everything was in the pounce  when teeth  claws  and body weight all bore down at once .  now  bewildered  he strutted back and forth  trying to deal with the situation .  there was no room to fly  nowhere else to go  the prey was standing there   instinct  emotion  and some attempt at rational thought all banged together in gryle   s overheated head .   instinct won .  leaping at things with your claws out had worked for a million years  so why stop now .   he threw his head back  screamed  and sprang .   so did moist  ducking under the long arms .  that wasn   t programmed into the banshee   s responses  the prey should be huddled  or running away .  but moist   s shoulder caught him in the chest .   the creature was as light as a child .   moist felt a claw slash into his arm as he hurled the thing onto the sorting engine  and flung himself to the floor .  for one horrible moment he thought it was going to get up  that he   d missed the wheel  but as the enraged mr .  gryle shifted  there was a sound like     gloop        followed by silence .   moist lay on the cool flagstones until his heart slowed down to the point where he could make out individual beats .  he was aware  as he lay there  that something sticky was dripping down the side of the machine .   he arose slowly  on unsteady legs  and stared at what had become of the creature .  if he   d been a hero  he would have taken the opportunity to say     that   s what i call sorted .     since he wasn   t a hero  he threw up .  a body doesn   t work properly when significant bits are not sharing the same space time frame as the rest of it  but it does look more colorful .  the trade off is not to its advantage .   then  clutching at his bleeding arm  he knelt down and looked under the engine for tiddles .   he had to come back with the cat  he thought muzzily .  it was just something that had to happen .  a man who rushes into a burning building to rescue a stupid cat and comes out carrying the cat is seen as a hero  even if he is a rather dumb one .  if he comes out sans cat he   s a twit .   a muffled thunder above them suggested that part of the building had fallen down .  the air was roasting .   tiddles backed away from moist   s hand .      listen     moist growled .     the hero has to come out with the cat .  the cat doesn   t have to be alive        he lunged  grabbed tiddles  and dragged the cat out .      right     he said  and picked up the suit hanger in his other hand .  there were a few blobs of banshee on it  but  he thought light headedly  he could probably find something to remove it .   he lurched out into the corridor .  there was a wall of fire at both ends  and tiddles chose this moment to sink all four claws into his arm .      ah     said moist .     up until now it was going so well           mr .  lipvig .  are you all right  mr .  lipvig .         what golems removed from a fire was  in fact  the fire .  they took out of a burning property everything that was burning .  it was curiously surgical .  they assembled at the edge of the fire and deprived it of anything to burn  herded it  cornered it  stamped it to death .   golems could wade through lava and pour molten iron .  even if they knew what fear was  they wouldn   t find it in a mere burning building .   glowing rubble was hauled away from the steps by red hot hands .  moist stared up into a landscape of flame but also  in front of it  mr .  pump .  he was glowing orange .  specks of dust and dirt on his clay flashed and sparkled .      good to see you  mr .  lipvig .     he boomed cheerfully  tossing a crackling beam aside .     we have cleared a path to the door .  move with speed .         er   thank you .     moist shouted above the roar of the flames .  there was a path  dragged clear of debris  with the open door beckoning calmly and cooly at the end of it .  away  toward the far end of the hall  other golems  red hot in the pillars of flame  were calmly throwing burning floorboards out through a hole in the wall .   the heat was intense .  moist lowered his head  clutched the terrified cat to his chest  felt the back of his neck begin to roast  and scampered forward .   from then on  it became all one memory .  the crashing noise high above .  the metallic boom .  the golem anghammarad looking up  with his message glowing yellow on his cherry red arm .  ten thousand tons of rainwater pouring down in deceptive slow motion .  the cold hitting the glowing golem        the explosion        flames died .  sound died .  light died .   anghammarad .   anghammarad looked at his hands .  there was nothing there except heat  furnace heat  blasting heat that nevertheless made the shapes of fingers .   anghammarad  a hollow voice repeated .      i have lost my clay     said the golem .   yes  said death  that is standard .  you are dead .  smashed .  exploded into a million pieces .      then who is this doing the listening .      everything there was about you that isn   t clay .      do you have a command for me .     said the remains of anghammarad  standing up .   not now .  you have reached the place where there are no more orders .      what shall i do .      i believe you have failed to understand my last comment .   anghammarad sat down again .  apart from the fact that there was sand rather than ooze underfoot  this place reminded him of the abyssal plain .   generally people like to move on  death hinted .  they look forward to an afterlife .      i will stay here  please .      here .  there   s nothing to do here  said death .      yes  i know     said the ghost of the golem .     it is perfect .  i am free .         at two in the morning it began to rain .   things could have been worse .  it could have rained snakes .  it could have rained acid .   there was still some roof  and some walls .  that meant there was still some building .   moist and miss dearheart sat on some warm rubble outside the locker room  which was more or less the only room that could still be properly described as one .  the golems had stamped out the last of the fire  shored things up  and then  without a word  had gone back to not being a hammer until sunset .   miss dearheart held a half melted bronze band in her hand  and turned it over and over again .      eighteen thousand years     she whispered .      it was the rainwater tank     mumbled moist  staring at nothing .      fire and water     muttered miss dearheart .     but not both .         can   t you   rebake him  or something .     it sounded hopeless even as moist said it .  he   d seen the other golems scrabbling in the rubble .      not enough left .  just dust  mixed up with everything else     said miss dearheart .     all he wanted to do was be useful .      moist looked at the remains of the letters .  the flood had washed the black slurry of their ashes into every corner .   all they wanted to do was be delivered  he thought .  at a time like this  sitting on the sea bed for nine thousand years seemed quite attractive .      he was going to wait until the universe came around again .  did you know that .         you told me  yes     said moist .   there   s no stink more sorrowful than the stink of wet  burned paper  moist thought .  it means  the end .      vetinari won   t rebuild this place  you know     miss dearheart went on .     gilt will get people to make a fuss if he tries it .  waste of city funds .  he   s got friends .  people who owe him money and favors .  he   s good at that sort of people .         it was gilt who had this place torched     said moist .     he was shocked to see me back in the restaurant .  he thought i   d be here .         you   ll never be able to prove it .      probably not  moist agreed  in the sour  smoke addled hollow of his head .  the watch had turned up with more speed than moist had found usual among city policemen .  they had a werewolf with them .  oh  probably most people would have thought it was just a handsome dog  but grow up in uberwald with a grandfather who bred dogs and you learned to spot the signs .  this one had a collar  and snuffled around while the embers were still smoking  and found something extra to scent in the pall of steaming ashes .   they   d dug down  and there had been an awkward interview .  moist had handled it as well as he could manage  under the circumstances .  the key point was never to tell the truth .  coppers never believed what people told them in any case  so there was no point in giving them extra work .      a winged skeleton .     moist had said  with what surely sounded like genuine surprise .      yes  sir .  about the size of a man  but very   damaged .  i could even say mangled .  i wonder if you know anything about it .     this watchman was a captain .  moist hadn   t been able to make him out .  his face gave nothing away that he didn   t want to let go of .  something about him suggested that he already knew the answers but was asking the questions for the look of the thing .      perhaps it was an extra large pigeon .  they   re real pests in this building     he   d said .      i doubt it  sir .  we believe it to have been a banshee  mr .  lipwig     said the captain patiently .     they   re very rare .         i thought they just screamed on the rooftops of people who are going to die     said moist .      the civilized ones do  sir .  the wild ones cut out the middleman .  your young man said he hit something .         stanley did say something about  oh  something flying around     said moist .     but i thought it was simply              an extra large pigeon .  i see .  and you   ve no idea how the fire started .  i know you use safety lamps in here .         probably spontaneous combustion in the letter piles  i   m afraid     said moist  who   d had time to think about this one .      no one has been behaving oddly .         in the post office  captain  it   s very hard to tell .  believe me .         no threats made  sir .  by anyone you might have upset  perhaps .         none at all .      the captain had sighed and put away his notebook .      i   ll have a couple of men watching the building overnight  nevertheless     he said .     well done for saving the cat  sir .  that was a big cheer you got when you came out .  just one thing  though  sir           yes  captain .         why would a banshee   or possibly a giant pigeon   attack mr .  groat .      and moist thought  the hat        i have no idea     he said .      yes  sir .  i   m sure you haven   t     said the captain .     i   m sure you haven   t .  i   m captain ironfoundersson  sir  although most people call me captain carrot .  don   t hesitate to contact me  sir  if anything occurs to you .  we are here for your protection .      and what would you have done against a banshee .  moist had thought .  you suspect gilt .  well done .  but people like gilt don   t bother with the law .  they never break it  they just use people who do .  and you   ll never find anything written down  anywhere .   just before the captain turned to go  moist was sure that the werewolf winked at him .   now  with the rain drifting in and hissing where the stones were still warm  moist looked around at the fires .  there were still plenty of them  where the golems had dumped the rubble .  this being ankh morpork  people of the night had risen like the mists and gathered around them for warmth .   this place would need a fortune spent on it .  well .  he knew where to lay his hands on plenty of money  didn   t he .  he didn   t have much use for it .  it has only ever been a way of keeping score .  but then this would all end  because it had belonged to albert spangler and the rest of them  not to an innocent postmaster .   he took off his golden hat and looked at it .  an avatar  pelc had said .  the human embodiment of a god .  but he wasn   t a god  he was just a con man in a golden suit  and the con was over .  where was the angel now .  where were the gods when you needed them .   the gods could help .   the hat glinted in the firelight  and parts of moist   s brain sparkled .  he didn   t breathe as the thought emerged  in case it took flight  but it was so simple .  and something that no honest man would ever have thought of        what we need is     he said     is           is what .     said miss dearheart .      is music .     declared moist .  he stood up and cupped his hands .     hey  you people .  any banjo players out there .  a fiddle  maybe .  i   ll give a one dollar stamp  highly collectible  to anyone who can pick out a waltz tune .  you know  one two three  one two three .         have you gone completely mad .     said miss dearheart .     you   re clearly        she stopped  because a shabbily dressed man had tapped moist on the shoulder .      i can play the banjo     he said     and my friend humphrey here can blow the harmonica something cruel .  the fee will be a dollar  sir .  coin  please  if it   s all the same to you  on account of how i can   t write and don   t know anyone who can read .         my lovely miss dearheart     said moist  smiling madly at her .     do you have any other name .  some pet name or nickname  some delightful little diminutive you don   t mind being called .         are you drunk .     she demanded .      unfortunately  no     said moist .     but i   d like to be .  well  miss dearheart .  i even rescued my best suit .      she was clearly taken aback  but an answer escaped before natural cynicism could bar the door .     my brother used to call me   er           yes .         killer     said miss dearheart .     but he meant it in a nice way .  don   t you even think about using it .         how about spike .         spike .  we ell  i could live with spike     said miss dearheart .     so you will  too .  but this is not the time for dancing           on the contrary  spike     said moist  beaming in the firelight     this is just the time .  we   ll dance  and then we   ll get things cleaned up ready for opening time  get the mail delivery working again  order the rebuilding of the building  and have everything back the way it was .  just watch me .         you know  perhaps it is true that working for the post office drives people mad     said miss dearheart .     just where will you get the money to have this place rebuilt .         the gods will provide     said moist .     trust me on this .      she peered at him .      you   re serious .         deadly     said moist .      you   re going to pray for money .         not exactly  spike .  they get thousands of prayers every day .  i have other plans .  we   ll bring the post office back  miss dearheart .  i don   t have to think like a policeman  or a postman  or a clerk .  i just have to do things my way .  and then i   ll bankrupt reacher gilt by the end of the week .      her mouth became a perfect o .      how exactly will you do that .     she managed .      i   ve no idea  but anything is possible if i can dance with you and still have ten toes left .  shall we dance  miss dearheart .      she was amazed and surprised and bewildered  and moist von lipwig liked that in a person .  for some reason  he felt immensely happy .  he didn   t know why  and he didn   t know what he was going to do next  but it was going to be fun .   he could feel that old electric feeling  the one you got deep inside when you stood right there in front of a banker who was carefully examining an example of your very best work .  the universe held its breath  and then the man would smile and say     very good  mr .  assumed name  i will have my clerk bring up the money right away .     it was the thrill not of the chase but of the standing still  of remaining so calm  composed  and genuine that  for just long enough  you could fool the world and spin it on your finger .  these were the moments he lived for  when he was really alive  and his thoughts flowed like quicksilver  and the very air sparkled .  later  that feeling would present its bill .  for now  he flew .   he was back in the game .  but  for now  by the light of the burning yesterdays  he waltzed with miss dearheart while the scratch band scratched away .   then she went home to bed  puzzled but smiling oddly  and he went up to his office  which was missing the whole of one wall  and got religion as it had never been got before .      the young priest of offler the crocodile god was somewhat off balance at   a . m .   but the man in the wing  d hat and golden suit seemed to know what should be happening and so the priest went along with it .  he was not hugely bright  which was why he was on this shift .      you want to deliver this letter to offler .     he said  yawning .  an envelope had been placed in his hand .      it   s addressed to him     said moist .     and correctly stamped .  a smartly written letter always gets attention .  i   ve also brought a pound of sausages  which i believe is customary .  crocodiles love sausages .         strictly speaking  you see  it   s prayers that go up to the gods     said the priest doubtfully .  the nave of the temple was deserted  except for a little old man in a grubby robe  dreamily sweeping the floor .      as i understand it     said moist     the gift of sausages reaches offler by being fried  yes .  and the spirit of the sausages ascends unto offler by means of the smell .  and then you eat the sausages .         ah  no .  not exactly .  not at all     said the young priest  who knew this one .     it might look like that to the uninitiated  but  as you say  the true sausagidity goes straight to offler .  he  of course  eats the spirit of the sausages .  we eat the mere earthy shell  which  believe me  turns to dust and ashes in our mouths .         that would explain why the smell of sausages is always better than the actual sausage  then .     said moist .     i   ve often noticed that .      the priest was impressed .     are you a theologian  sir .     he said .      i   m in   a similar line of work     said moist .     but what i   m getting at is this  if you were to read this letter it would be as though offler himself was reading it  am i right .  through your eyeballs  the spirit of the letter would ascend to offler .  and then i could give you the sausages .      the young priest looked desperately around the temple .  it was too early in the morning .  when your god  metaphorically  doesn   t do much until the sandbanks have got nice and warm  the senior priests tend to lie in .      i suppose so     he said reluctantly .     but wouldn   t you rather wait until deacon jones gets           i   m in rather a hurry     said moist .  there was a pause .     i   ve brought some honey mustard     he added .     the perfect accompaniment to sausages .      suddenly  the priest was all attention .      what sort .     he said .      mrs .  edith leakall   s premium reserve     said moist  holding up the jar .   the young man   s face lit up .  he was low in the hierarchy and got barely more sausage than offler .      god  that   s the expensive stuff .     he breathed .      yes  it   s the hint of wild garlic that does it     said moist .     but perhaps i should wait until deacon        the priest grabbed the letter and the jar .      no  no  i can see you are in a hurry     he said .     i   ll do it right away .  it   s probably a request for help  yes .         yes  i   d like offler to let the light of his eyes and the gleam on his teeth shine on my colleague tolliver groat  who is in the lady sybil hospital     said moist .      oh  yes     said the acolyte  relieved     we often do this sort of           and i would also like one hundred and fifty thousand dollars     moist went on .     ankh morpork dollars preferred  of course  but other reasonably hard currencies would be acceptable .         there was a certain spring in his step as moist walked back to the ruin of the post office .  he   d sent letters to offler  om  and blind io  all important gods  and also to anoia  a minor goddess of things that stick in drawers .   she had no temple and was handled by a jobbing priestess in cable street  but moist had a feeling that by the end of the day anoia was destined for higher things .  he only picked her because he liked the name .   he   d leave it about an hour .  gods worked fast  didn   t they .   the post office was no better by gray daylight .  about half of the building was still standing .  even with tarpaulins  the area under cover was small and dank .  people were milling around  uncertain of what to do .   he   d tell them .   the first person he saw was george aggy  heading for him in a high speed hobble .      terrible thing  sir  terrible thing  i came as soon as       he began .      good to see you  george .  how   s the leg .         what .  oh  feels fine  sir .  glows in the dark  but on the other hand that   s a great saving in candles .  what are we           you   re my deputy while mr .  groat   s in hospital     said moist .     how many postmen can you muster .         about a dozen  sir  but what shall we           get the mail moving  mr .  aggy .  that   s what we do .  tell everyone that today   s special is pseudopolis for   p  guaranteed .  everyone else can get on with cleaning up .  there   s still some roof left .  we   re open  as usual .  more open than usual .         but       aggy   s words failed him  and he waved at the debris .     all this .         neither rain nor fire  mr .  aggy .     said moist sharply .      doesn   t say that on the motto  sir     said aggy .      it will by tomorrow .  ah  jim        the coachman bore down on moist  his enormous driving cape flapping .      it was bloody gilt  wasn   t it .     he growled .     arson around .  what can we do for you  mr .  lipwig .         can you still run a service to pseudopolis today .     said moist .      yes     said jim .     harry and the lads got all the horses out as soon as they smelled smoke  and only lost one coach .  we   ll help you  damn right about that  but the trunk is running okay .  you   ll be wasting your time .         you provide the wheels  jim  and i   ll give them something to carry     said moist .     we   ll have a bag for you at ten .         you   re very certain  mr .  lipwig     said jim  putting his head to one side .      an angel came and told me in my sleep     said moist .   jim grinned .     ah  that   d be it  then .  an angel  eh .  a very present help in times of trouble  or so i   m given to understand .         so i believe     said moist  and went up to the drafty  smoke blackened three walled cave that was the wreckage of his office .  he brushed off the ash from the chair  reached into his pocket  and put the smoking gnu   s letter on his desk .   the only people who could know when a clacks tower would break down must work for the company  right .  or used to work for it  more likely .  hah .  that   s how things happened .   that bank in sto lat  for example .  he   d never have been able to forge those bills if that bent clerk hadn   t sold him that old ledger with all the signatures in it .  that had been a good day .   the grand trunk mustn   t just make enemies  it must mass produce them .  and now this smoking gnu wanted to help him .  outlaw signalers .  think of all the secrets they   d know     he   d kept an ear open for clock chimes  and it was gone a quarter to nine now .  what would they do .  blow up a tower .  but people worked in the towers .  surely not        oh  mr .  lipwig .      it is not often that a wailing woman rushes into a room and throws herself at a man .  it had never happened to moist before .  now it happened  and it seemed such a waste that the woman was miss maccalariat .   she tottered forward and clung to the startled moist  tears streaming down her face .      oh  mr .  lipwig .     she wailed .     oh  mr .  lipwig .      moist reeled under her weight .  she was dragging at his collar so hard that he was likely to end up on the floor  and the thought of being found on the floor with miss maccalariat was   well  a thought that just couldn   t be thoughted .  the head would explode before thoughting it .   she had a pink hair grip in her gray hair .  it had little hand painted violets on it .  the sight of it  a few inches from moist   s eyes  was curiously disturbing .      now  now  steady on  miss maccalariat  steady on     he muttered  trying to keep the balance for both of them .      oh  mr .  lipwig .         yes indeed  miss maccalariat     he said desperately .     what can i do for           mr .  aggy said the post office won   t ever be rebuilt .  he says lord vetinari will never release the money .  oh  mr .  lipwig .  i dreamed all my life of working on the counter here .  my grandmother taught me everything  she even made me practice sucking lemons to get the expression right .  i   ve passed it all on to my daughter  too  she   s got a voice that   d take the skin off paint .  oh  mr .  lipwig .      moist searched wildly for somewhere to pat the woman  someplace that wasn   t soaked or out of bounds .  he settled for her shoulder .  he really  really needed mr .  groat .  mr .  groat knew how to deal with things like this .      it   s all going to be all right  miss maccalariat     he said soothingly .      and poor mr .  groat .     the woman sobbed .      i understand he   s going to be fine  miss maccalariat .  you know what they said about the lady sybil  some people come out alive .     i really  really hope he does  he added to himself .  i   m lost without him .      it   s all so dreadful  mr .  lipwig .     said miss maccalariat  determined to drain the bitter cup of despair to the very dregs .     we   re all going to be walking the streets .      moist held her by the arms and pushed her gently away  while fighting against a mental picture of miss maccalariat walking the streets .     now you listen to me  miss mac   what is your first name  by the way .         it   s iodine  mr .  lipwig     said miss maccalariat  snuffling into a handkerchief .     my father liked the sound .         well   iodine  i firmly believe that i will have the money to rebuild by the end of the day     said moist .  she   s blown her nose on it and  yes  yes  aargh  she   s going to put it back up the sleeve of her cardigan  oh gods        yes  mr .  aggy said that  and there   s talk  sir .  they say you sent the gods letters asking for money .  oh  sir .  it   s not my place to say so  sir  but gods don   t send you money .         i have faith  miss maccalariat     said moist  drawing himself up .      my family have been anoians for five generations  sir     said miss maccalariat .     we rattle the drawers every day  and we   ve never got anything solid  as you might say  excepting my granny  who got an egg beater she didn   t remember putting there and we   re sure that was an accident           mr .  lipwig .  mr .  lipwig .     someone yelled .     they say the clacks   oh  i   m so sorry        the sentence ended in syrup .   moist sighed  and turned to the grinning newcomer in the charcoal rimmed doorway .      yes  mr .  aggy .         we   ve heard the clacks has gone down again  sir .  to pseudopolis .     said aggy .      how unfortunate     said moist .     come  miss maccalariat  come  mr .  aggy   let   s move the mail .      there was a crowd in what remained of the hall .  as moist had observed  the citizens had an enthusiasm for new things .  the post was an old thing  of course  but it was so old that it had magically become new again .   a cheer greeted moist when he came down the steps .  give them a show  always give them a show .  ankh morpork would applaud a show .   moist commandeered a chair  stood on it  and cupped his hands .      special today  ladies and gentlemen .     he shouted above the din .     mail to pseudopolis  reduced to three pence only .  three pence .  coach goes at ten .  and if anyone has clacks messages lodged with our unfortunate colleagues in the grand trunk company  and would care to get them back  we will deliver them for free .      this caused an additional stir  and a number of people peeled away from the crowd and hurried off .      the post office  ladies and gentlemen .     yelled moist .     we deliver .     there was a cheer .      do you want to know something really interesting  mr .  lipwig .     said stanley  hurrying up .      and what   s that  stanley .     said moist  climbing down off the chair .      we   re selling lots of the new one dollar stamps this morning .  and do you know what .  people are sending letters to themselves .         what .     said moist  mystified .      just so the stamps have been through the post  sir .  that makes them real  you see .  it proves they   ve been used .  they   re collecting them  sir .  and it gets better  sir .         how could it get better than that  stanley .     said moist .  he looked down .  yes  the boy had a new shirt  showing a picture of the penny stamp and bearing the legend  ask me about stamps .      sto lat want teemer and spools to do them their own set .  and the other cities are asking about it  too .      moist made a mental note  we   ll change the stamps often .  and offer stamp designs to every city and country we can think of .  everyone will want to have their own stamps rather than    lick vetinari   s backside     and we   ll honor them  too  if they   ll deliver our mail  and mr .  spools will express his gratitude to us in very definite ways  i   ll see to it .      sorry about your pins  stanley .         pins .     said the boy .     oh  pins .  pins are just pointy metal things  sir .  pins are dead .      and so we progress  thought moist .  always keep moving .  there may be something behind you .   all we need now is for the gods to smile on us .   hmm .  i think they   ll smile a little broader outside .   moist stepped out into the daylight .  the difference between the inside and outside of the post office was less marked than formerly  but there were still a lot of people .  there were a couple of watchmen  too .  they   d be useful .  they were already watching him suspiciously .   well  this was it .  it was going to be a miracle .  actually  it bloody well was going to be a miracle .   moist stared up into the sky and listened to the voices of the gods .       chapter      mission statement      in which lord vetinari gives advice     mr .  lipwig   s bad memory      evil criminal geniuses  difficulty with finding property      mr .  groat   s fear of bathing  and a discussion on  explosive underwear     mr .  pony and his flimsies      the board debates  gilt decides      moist von lipwig attempts the impossible      the clocks were chiming seven o   clock .      ah  mr .  lipwig     said lord vetinari  looking up .     thank you so much for dropping in .  it has been such a busy day  has it not .  drumknott  do help mr .  lipwig to a chair .  prophecy can be very exhausting  i believe .      moist waved the clerk away and eased his aching body into a seat .      i didn   t exactly decide to drop in     he said .     a large troll watchman walked in and grabbed me by the arm .         ah  to steady you  i have no doubt     said lord vetinari  who was poring over the battle between the stone trolls and the stone dwarfs .     you accompanied him of your own free will  did you not .         i   m very attached to my arm     said moist .     i thought i   d better follow it .  what can i do for you  my lord .      vetinari got up and went and sat in the chair behind his desk  where he regarded moist with what almost looked like amusement .      commander vimes has given me some succinct reports of today   s events     he said  putting down the troll figure he was holding and turning over a few sheets of paper .     beginning with the riot at the grand trunk offices this morning  which  he says  you instigated    .         all i did was volunteer to deliver such clacks messages as had been held up by the unfortunate breakdown     said moist .     i didn   t expect the idiots in their office to refuse to hand the messages back to their customers .  people had paid in advance  after all .  i was just helping everyone in a difficult time .  and i certainly didn   t    instigate    anyone to hit a clerk with a chair .         of course not  of course not     said lord vetinari .     i am sure you acted quite innocently and from the best of intentions .  but i am agog to hear about the gold  mr .  moist .  one hundred and fifty thousand dollars  i believe .         some of it i can   t quite remember     said moist .     it   s all a bit unclear .         yes  yes  i imagine it is .  perhaps i can clarify a few details .     said lord vetinari .     around midmorning  mr .  lipwig  you were chatting to people outside your regrettably distressed building when      here the patrician glanced at his notes      you suddenly looked up  shielded your eyes  dropped to your knees  and screamed     yes  yes  thank you  i am not worthy  glory be  may your teeth be picked clean by birds  hallelujah  rattle your drawers    and similar phrases  to the general concern of people nearby  and you then stood up with your hands outstretched and shouted     one hundred and fifty thousand dollars  buried in a field .  thank you  thank you  i shall fetch it immediately .     whereupon you wrested a shovel from one of the men helping to clear the debris of the building and began to walk with some purpose out of the city .         really .     said moist .     it   s all a bit of a blank .         i   m sure it is     said vetinari  nodding .     you will probably be quite surprised to know that a number of people followed you  mr .  lipwig .  including mr .  pump and two members of the city watch .         good heavens  did they .         quite .  for several hours .  you stopped to pray on a number of occasions .  we must assume it was for the guidance  which led your footsteps  at last  to a small wood among the cabbage fields .         it did .  i   m afraid it   s all rather a blur     said moist .      i understand you dug like a demon  according to the watch .  and i note that a number of reputable witnesses were there when your shovel struck the lid of the chest .  i understand the times will be carrying a picture in the next edition .      moist said nothing .  it was the only way to be sure .      any comments  mr .  lipwig .         no  my lord  not really .         hmm .  about three hours ago  i had the senior priests of three of the major religions in this office  along with a rather bewildered freelance priestess who i gather handles the worldly affairs of anoia on an agency basis .  they all claim that it was their god or goddess who told you where the gold was .  you don   t happen to remember which one it was  do you .         i sort of felt the voice rather than heard it     said moist carefully .      quite so     said vetinari .     incidentally  they all felt that their temples should get a tithe of the money     he added .     each .         sixty thousand dollars .     said moist  sitting up .     that   s not right .         i commend the speed of your mental arithmetic in your shaken state .  no lack of clarity there  i   m glad to see     said vetinari .     i would advise you to donate fifty thousand  split four ways .  it is  after all  in a very public and very definite and incontrovertible way  a gift from the gods .  is this not a time for reverential gratitude .      there was a lengthy pause  and then moist raised a finger and managed  against all the odds  a cheerful smile .     sound advice  my lord .  besides  a man never knows when he might need a prayer .         exactly     said lord vetinari .     it is less than they demanded but more than they expect  and i did point out to them that the remainder of the money was all going to be used for the civic good .  it is going to be used for the civic good  isn   t it  mr .  lipwig .         oh  yes .  indeed .         that is just as well  since currently it   s sitting in commander vimes   s cells .     vetinari looked down at moist   s trousers .     i see you still have mud all over your lovely golden suit  postmaster .  fancy all that money being buried in a field .  and you can still remember nothing about how you got there .      vetinari   s expression was getting on moist   s nerves .  you know  he thought .  i know you know .  you know i know you know .  but i know you can   t be certain  not certain .      well   there was an angel     he said .      indeed .  any particular kind .         the kind you only get one of  i think     said moist .      ah  good .  well then  it all seems very clear to me     said vetinari  sitting back .     it is not often a mortal man achieves such a moment of glorious epiphany  but i am assured by the priests that such a thing could happen  and who should know better than they .  anyone even suggesting that the money was in some way   obtained in some wrong fashion will have to argue with some very turbulent priests and also  i assume  find their kitchen drawers quite impossible to shut .  besides  you are donating money to the city      he held up his hand when moist opened his mouth  and went on      that is  the post office  so the notion of private gain does not arise .  there appears to be no owner for the money  although so far  of course  nine hundred and thirty eight people would like me to believe it belongs to them .  such is life in ankh morpork .  so  mr .  lipwig  you are instructed to rebuild the post office as soon as possible .  the bills will be met and  since the money is effectively a gift from the gods  there will be no drain on our taxes .  well done  mr .  lipwig .  very well done .  don   t let me detain you .      moist actually had his hand on the door handle when the voice behind him said     just one minor thing  mr .  lipwig .      he turned .  lord vetinari had walked over to his game .      yes  sir .         it occurs to me that the sum which the gods so generously have seen fit to bestow upon us does  by pure happenstance  appear to equal the estimated haul of a notorious criminal  which as far as i know has never been recovered .      moist stared at the woodwork in front of him .  why is this man ruling just one city .  he thought .  why isn   t he ruling the world .  is this how he treats other people .  it   s like being a puppet .  the difference is  he arranges for you to pull your own strings .   he turned  face carefully deadpan .      really  sir .  who was that  then .     he said .      one alfred spangler  mr .  lipwig .         he   s dead  sir     said moist .      are you sure .         yes  sir .  i was there when they hanged him .         well remembered  mr .  lipwig     said vetinari  moving a dwarf all the way across the board .      damn  damn  damn .  moist shouted  but only for internal consumption .   he   d worked hard for that mon   well  the banks and merchants had worked har   well  somewhere down the line someone had worked hard for that money  and now a third of it had been   well  stolen  that was the only word for it .   moist experienced a certain amount of unrighteous indignation about this .   of course  he would have given most of it to the post office  that was the whole point  but you could build a damn good building for a lot less than a hundred thousand dollars  and moist had been hoping for a little something for himself .   still  he felt good .  perhaps this was that    warm and fuzzy wonderful warm feeling    people talked about .  and what would he have done with the money .  he   d never have time to spend it in any case .  after all  what could a master criminal buy .  there was a shortage of seaside properties with real lava flows near a reliable source of piranhas  and the world as sure as hell didn   t need another dark lord  not with gilt doing so well .  gilt didn   t need a tower with ten thousand trolls camped outside .  he just needed a ledger and a sharp mind .  it worked better  cheaper  and he could go out and party at night .   handing all that gold over to a copper had been a difficult thing to do  but there really was no choice .  he   d got them by the short and curlies  anyway .  no one was going to stand up and say the gods didn   t do this sort of thing .  true  they   d never done it so far  but you could never tell  with gods .  certainly there were queues outside the three temples  once the times had put out its afternoon edition .   this had presented the priesthoods with a philosophical problem .  they were officially against people laying up treasures on earth  but  they had to admit  it was always good to get bums on pews  feet in sacred groves  hands rattling drawers  and fingers being trailed in the baby alligator pool .  they settled  therefore  for a kind of twinkle eyed denial that it could happen again  while hinting that  well  you never know  ineffable are the ways of gods  eh .  besides  petitioners standing in line with their letter asking for a big bag of cash were open to the suggestion that those most likely to receiveth were the ones who had already givethed  and got the message once you tapped them on the head with the collecting plate a few times .   even miss extremelia mume  whose small  multipurpose temple over a bookmakers    office in cable street handled the worldly affairs of several dozen minor gods  was doing good business among those prepared to back an outside chance .  she   d hung a banner over the door .  it read  it could be you .   it couldn   t happen .  it shouldn   t happen .  but  you never knew   this time it might .   moist recognized that hope .  it was how he   d made his living .  you knew that the man running the find the lady game was going to win  you knew that people in distress didn   t sell diamond rings for a fraction of their value  you knew that life generally handed you the sticky end of the stick  and you knew that the gods didn   t pick some everyday undeserving tit out of the population and hand them a fortune .   except that  this time  you might be wrong  right .  it might just happen  yes .   and this was known as that greatest of treasures  which is hope .  it was a good way of getting poorer really very quickly  and staying poor .  it could be you .  but it wouldn   t be .   now moist von lipwig headed along attic bee street  toward the lady sybil free hospital .  heads turned as went past .  he hadn   t been off the front page for days  after all .  he just had to hope that the wing  d hat and golden suit were the ultimate in furniture  people saw the gold  not the face .   the hospital was still being built  as all hospitals are  but it had its own queue at the entrance .  moist dealt with that by ignoring it  and going straight in .  there were  in the main hallway  people who looked like the kind of people whose job it is to say    oi  you .     when other people just wander in  but moist generated his personal    i   m too important to be stopped    field  and they never quite managed to frame the words .   and  of course  once you got past the doorway demons of any organization  people just assumed you had a right to be there  and gave you directions .   mr .  groat was in a room by himself  a sign on the door said do not enter  but moist seldom bothered about that sort of thing .   the old man was sitting up in bed  looking gloomy  but he beamed as soon as he saw moist .      mr .  lipwig .  you   re a sight for sore eyes  sir .  can you find out where they   ve hid my trousers .  i told them i was fit as a flea  sir  but they went and hid my trousers .  help me out of here before they carry me away to another bath  sir .  a bath  sir .         they have to carry you .     said moist .     can   t you walk  tolliver .      yessir  but i fights    em  fights    em  sir .  a bath  sir .  from wimmin .  oggling at my trumpet and skittles .  i call that shameless .  everyone knows soap kills the natural effulgences  sir .  oh  sir .  they   re holdin    me pris   ner  sir .  they gived me a trouserectomy  sir .         please calm down  mr .  groat     said moist urgently .  the old man had gone quite red in the face .     you   re all right  then .         just a scratch  sir  look       groat unfastened the buttons of his nightshirt .     see .     he said triumphantly .   moist nearly fainted .  the banshee had tried to make a tic tac toe board out of the man   s chest .  someone else had stitched it neatly .      nice job of work  i   ll give them that     groat said grudgingly .     but i   ve got to be up and doing  sir  up and doing .         are you sure you   re all right .     said moist  staring at the mess of scabs .      right as rain  sir .  i told    em  sir  if a banshee can   t get at me through my chest protector  none of their damn invisible little biting demons are going to manage it .  i bet it   s all going wrong  sir  with aggy bossing people around .  i bet it is .  i bet you really need me  right  sir .         um  yes     said moist .     are they giving you medicine .         hah  they call it medicine  sir .  they gave me a lot of ol    mumbo pocus about it being wonderful stuff  but it   s got neither taste nor smell  if you want my opinion .  they say it   ll do me good but i told    em it   s hard work that does me good  sir  not sitting in soapy water with young wimmin lookin    at my rattle and flute .  and they took my hair away .  they called it unhygenic  sir .  what a nerve .  all right  it moves about a bit of its own accord  but that   s only natural .  i   ve had my hair a long time  sir  i   m used to its funny little ways .         hwhat is going on here .     said a voice full of offended ownership .   moist turned .   if one of the rules that should be passed on to a young man is    don   t get mixed up with crazy girls who smoke like a bellows     another one should be    run away from any woman who pronounces    what    with two hs .      this woman might have been two women .  she certainly had the cubic capacity and  since she was dressed entirely in white  looked rather like an iceberg .  but chillier .  and with sails .  and with a headdress starched to a cutting edge .   two smaller women stood behind and on either side of her  in definite danger of being crushed if she stepped backwards .      i   ve come to see mr .  groat     said moist weakly  while groat gibbered and pulled the bedclothes over his head .      quite impossible .  i am the matron here  young man  and i must insist that you leave at once .  mr .  groat is in an extremely unstable condition .         he seems fine to me     said moist .   he had to admire the look the matron gave him .  it suggested that moist had just been found adhering to the sole of her shoe .  he returned it with a chilly one of his own .      young man  his condition is extremely critical .     she snapped .     i refuse to release him .         madam  illness is not a crime .     said moist .     people are not released from hospital  they are discharged .      the matron drew herself up and out  and gave moist a smile of triumph .      that  young man  is hwhat we are afraid of .         moist was sure doctors kept skeletons around to cow patients .  nyer  nyer  we know what you look like underneath    he quite approved  though .  he felt a certain fellow feeling .  places like the lady sybil were still very rare these days  but moist felt certain he could make a profitable career out of wearing a white robe  using long  learned names for ailments like    runny nose     and looking solemnly at things in bottles .   on the other side of the desk  a dr .  lawn   he had his name on a plate on his desk  because doctors are very busy and can   t remember everything   looked up from his notes on tolliver groat .      it was quite interesting  mr .  lipwig .  it was the first time i   ve ever had to operate to remove the patient   s clothing     he said .     you don   t happen to know what the poultice was made of  do you .  he wouldn   t tell us .         i believe it   s layers of flannel  goose grease  and bread pudding     said moist  staring around at the office .      bread pudding .  really bread pudding .         apparently so     said moist .      not something alive  then .  it seemed leathery to us     said the doctor  leafing through the notes .     ah  yes  here we are .  yes  his trousers were the subject of a controlled detonation after one of his socks exploded .  we   re not sure why .         he fills them with sulfur and charcoal to keep his feet fresh  and he soaks his trousers in saltpeter to prevent gnats     said moist .     he   s a great believer in natural medicine  you see .  he doesn   t trust doctors .         really .     said dr .  lawn .     he retains some vestige of sanity  then .  incidentally  it   s best not to argue with the nursing staff .  i find the best course of action is to throw some chocolates in one direction and hurry off in the other while their attention is distracted .  mr .  groat thinks that every man is his own physician  i gather .         he makes his own medicines     moist explained .     he starts every day with a quarter of a pint of gin mixed with spirits of niter  flour of sulfur  juniper  and the juice of an onion .  he says it clears the tubes .         good heavens  i   m sure it does .  does he smoke at all .      moist considered this .     no o .  it looks more like steam     he said .      and his background in basic alchemy is    .         nonexistent  as far as i know     said moist .     he makes some interesting cough sweets  though .  after you   ve sucked them for two minutes you can feel the wax running out of your ears .  he paints his knees with some sort of compound of iodine and           enough .     said the doctor .     mr .  lipwig  there are times when we humble practitioners of the craft of medicine have to stand aside in astonishment .  quite a long way aside  in the case of mr .  groat  and preferably behind a tree .  take him away  please .  i have to say that  against all the odds  i found him amazingly healthy .  i can quite see why an attack by a banshee would be so easily shrugged off .  in fact  mr .  groat is probably unkillable by any normal means  although i advise you not to let him take up tap dancing .  oh  and do take his wig  will you .  we tried putting it in a cupboard  but it got out .  we   ll send the bill to the post office  shall we .         i thought this said    free hospital    on the sign     said moist .      broadly  yes  broadly     said dr .  lawn .     but those on whom the gods have bestowed so many favors   one hundred and fifty thousand of them  i heard   probably have had all the charity they require  hmm .      and it   s all sitting in the watch   s cells  thought moist .  he reached into his jacket and produced a crumpled wad of green ankh morpork one dollar stamps .      will you take these .     he said .      the picture of tiddles being carried out of the post office by moist von lipwig was  since it concerned an animal  considered to be full of human interest by the times and was thus displayed prominently on the front page .   reacher gilt looked at it without displaying so much as a flicker of emotion .  then he reread the story next to it  under the headlines      man saves cat     we   ll rebuild bigger .     vows  as post office blazes           gift from gods  wave of stuck drawers hits city        it occurs to me that the editor of the times must sometimes regret that he has only one front page     he observed dryly .   there was a sound from the men sitting around the big table in gilt   s office .  it was the kind of sound you get when people are not really laughing .      do you think he has got gods on his side .     said greenyham .      i hardly imagine so     said gilt .     he must have known where the money was .         you think so .  if i knew where that much money was  i wouldn   t leave it in the ground .         no  you wouldn   t     said gilt quietly  in such a way that greenyham felt slightly uneasy .      twelve and a half percent .  twelve and a half percent .     screamed alphonse  bouncing up and down on his perch .      we   re made to look fools  reacher .     said stowley .     he knew the line would go down yesterday .  he might as well have divine guidance .  we   re losing the local traffic already .  every time we have a shutdown you can bet he   ll run a coach out of sheer devilment .  there   s nothing that damn man won   t stoop to .  he   s turned the post office into a   a show .         sooner or later all circuses leave town     said gilt .      but he   s laughing at us .     stowley persisted .     if the trunk breaks down again  i wouldn   t put it past him to run a coach to genua .         that would take weeks     said gilt .      yes  but it   s cheaper and it gets there .  that   s what he   ll say .  and he   ll say it loudly  too .  we   ve got to do something  reacher .         and what do you suggest .         why don   t we just spend some money and get some proper maintenance done .         you can   t     said a new voice .     you don   t have the men .      all heads turned to the man at the far end of the table .  he had a jacket on over his overalls and a very battered top hat on the table beside him .  his name was mr .  pony  and he was the trunk   s chief engineer .  he   d come with the company  and had hung on because at the age of fifty eight  with twinges in your knuckles  a sick wife  and a bad back  you think twice about grand gestures such as storming out .  he hadn   t seen a clacks until three years ago  when the first company was founded  but he was methodical  and engineering was engineering .   currently his greatest friend in the world was his collection of pink carbon copies .  he   d done his best  but he wasn   t going to carry the can when this lot finally fell over  and his pink carbon copies would see to it that he didn   t .  white memo paper to the chairman  yellow carbon copy to the file  pink copy you kept .  no one could say he hadn   t warned them .   a two inch stack of the latest copies was attached to his clipboard .  now  feeling like an elder god leaning down through the clouds of some armaggedon and booming    didn   t i tell you .  didn   t i warn you .  did you listen .  too late to listen now .     he put on a voice of strained patience      i   ve got six maint   nance teams .  i had eight last week .  i sent you a memo about that  got the copies right here .  we ought to have eighteen teams .  half the lads are needin    to be taught as we go  and we ain   t got time for teachin    .  in the ol    days we   d set up walkin    towers to take the load an    we ain   t got men even to do that now           all right  it   ll take time  we understand     said greenyham .     how long will it take if you   hire more men and get these walking towers working and           you made me sack a lot of the craftsmen     said pony .      we didn   t sack them  we    let them go        said gilt .      we   downsized     said greenyham .      looks like you succeeded  sir     said pony .  he took a stub of pencil out of one pocket and a grubby notebook out of the other .      d   you want it fast or cheap or good  gentlemen .     he said .     the way things have gone  can only give you one out of three           how soon can we have the grand trunk running properly .     said greenyham  while gilt leaned back and shut his eyes .   pony   s lips moved as he ran eyes over his figures .      nine months     he said .      i suppose if we   re seen to be working hard  nine months of erratic running won   t seem too       mr .  stowley began .      nine months shut down     said mr .  pony .      don   t be a fool  man .         i ain   t a fool  sir  thank you     said pony sharply .     i   ll have to find and train new craftsmen     cos a lot of the old brigade won   t come back whatever i offer .  if we shut the towers down  i can use the signalers  at least they know their way around a tower .  we can get more work done if we don   t have to drag walking towers and set them up .  make a clean start .  the towers were never built that well to begin with .  dearheart never expected this sort of traffic .  nine months of dark towers  sirs .      he wanted to say  oh  how he wanted to say  craftsmen .  d   you know what that means .  it means men with some pride  who get fed up and leave when they   re told to do skimpy work in a rush  no matter what you pay them .  so i   m employing people as    craftsmen    now who   re barely fit to sweep out a workshop .  but you don   t care  because if they don   t polish a chair with their arse all day you think a man who   s done a seven year apprenticeship is the same as some twerp who can   t be trusted to hold a hammer by the right end .  he didn   t say this aloud  because although an elderly man probably has a lot less future than a man of twenty  he   s far more careful about it        you can   t do better than that .     said stowley .      mr .  stowley  i   ll be doin    well if it   s only nine months     said pony  focusing again .     if you don   t want to shut down  i can maybe get it done in a year and a half  if i can find enough men and you   re ready to spend enough money .  but you   ll have shutdowns every day .  it   ll be crippled runnin     sir .         this man von lipwig will walk all over us in nine months .     said greenyham .      sorry about that  sir .         and how much will it cost .     asked gilt dreamily  without opening his eyes .      one way or the other  sir  i reckon maybe two hundred thousand     said pony .      that   s ridiculous .  we paid less than that for the trunk .     greenyham burst out .      yes  sir .  but  you see  you got to run maint   nance all the time  sir .  the towers have been run ragged .  there was that big gale back in sektober and all that trouble in uberwald .  i haven   t got the manpower .  if you don   t do maint   nance  a little fault soon becomes a big one .  i sent you gentlemen lots of reports  sir .  and you cut my budget twice .  i may say my lads did wonders with           mr .  pony     said gilt quietly     i think what i see here is a conflict of cultures .  would you mind strolling along to my study  please .  igor will make you a cup of tea .  thank you so much .      when pony was gone  greenyham said     do you know what worries me right now .         do tell us     said gilt  folding his hands across his expensive waistcoat .      mr .  slant is not here .         he has apologized .  he says he has important business     said gilt .      we   re his biggest clients .  what   s more important than us .  no  he   s not here because he wants to be somewhere else .  the damn old revenant senses trouble and he   s never there when it all goes bad .  slant always comes out smelling of roses .         that is at least more fragrant than his usual formaldehyde     said gilt .     don   t panic  gentlemen .         somebody did     said stowley .     don   t tell me that fire was accidental .  was it .  and what happened to poor old fatty horsefry  eh .         calm down  my friends  calm down     said gilt .  they   re just merchant bankers  he thought .  they   re not hunters  they   re scavengers .  they have no vision .   he waited until they had settled down and were regarding him with that strange and rather terrifying look that rich men wear when they think they may be in danger of becoming poor men .      i expected something like this     he said .     vetinari wants to harry us  that is all .         reacher  you know we   ll be in big trouble if the trunk stops working     said nutmeg .     some of us have   debts to service .  if the trunk fails for good  then people will   ask questions .      oh  those pauses  thought gilt .  embezzlement is such a difficult word .      many of us had to work very hard to raise the cash     said stowley .   yes  keeping a straight face in front of your clients must be tricky  gilt thought .  aloud  he said     i think we have to pay  gentlemen .  i think we do .         two hundred thousand .     said greenyham .     where do you think we can get that kind of money .         you got it before     murmured gilt .      and what is that supposed to mean  pray .     said greenyham  with just a little too much indignation .      poor crispin came to see me the night before he died     said gilt  calm as six inches of snow .     babbled about  oh  all sorts of wild things .  they hardly bear repeating .  i think he believed people were after him .  he did  however  insist on pressing a small ledger on me .  needless to say  it is safely locked away .      the room fell silent  its silence made deeper and hotter by a number of desperate men thinking hard and fast .  they were  by their own standards  honest men  in that they only did what they knew or suspected that everyone else did  and there was never any visible blood  but just now they were men far out on a frozen sea  who   d just heard the ice creak .      i strongly suspect that it   ll be a bit less than two hundred thousand     said gilt .     pony would be a fool if he didn   t leave a margin .         you didn   t warn us about this  reacher     said stowley resentfully .   gilt waved his hands .      we must speculate to accumulate .     he said .     the post office .  trickery and sleight of hand .  oh  von lipwig is an ideas man  but that   s all he is .  he   s made a splash  but he   s not got the stamina for the long haul .  yet  as it turns out  he will do us a favor .  perhaps we have been   a little smug  a little lax  but we have learned our lesson .  spurred by the competition  we are investing several hundred thousand dollars           several hundred .     said greenyham .  gilt waved him into silence  and continued        several hundred thousand dollars in a challenging  relevant  and exciting systemic overhaul of our entire organization  focusing on our core competencies while maintaining full and listening cooperation with the communities we are proud to serve .  we fully realize that our energetic attempts to mobilize the flawed infrastructure we inherited have been less than totally satisfactory  and hope and trust that our valued and loyal customers will bear with us in the coming months as we interact synergistically with change management in our striving for excellence .  that is our mission .      an awed silence followed this .      and thus we bounce back     said gilt .      but you said several hundr        gilt sighed .     i said that     he said .     trust me .  it   s a game  gentlemen  and a good player is one who can turn a bad situation to their advantage .  i have brought you this far  haven   t i .  a little cash and the right attitude will take us the rest of the way .  i   m sure you can find some more money     he added     from somewhere it won   t be missed .      this wasn   t silence .  it went beyond silence .      what are you suggesting .     said nutmeg .      embezzlement  theft  breach of trust  misappropriation of funds   people can be so harsh     said gilt .  he threw open his arms again  and a big  friendly smile emerged like the sun breaking through storm clouds .     gentlemen .  i understand .  money was made to work  to move  to grow  not to be locked up in some vault .  poor mr .  horsefry  i believe  did not really understand that .  so much on his mind  poor fellow .  but we   we are businessmen .  we understand these things  my friends .      he surveyed the faces of men who now knew that they were riding a tiger .  it had been a good ride up until a week or so ago .  it wasn   t a case of not being able to get off .  they could get off .  that was not the problem .  the problem was that the tiger knew where they lived .   poor mr .  horsefry   there had been rumors .  in fact  they were completely unsubstantiated rumors  because mr .  gryle had been excessively good at his job when pigeons weren   t involved  had moved like a shadow with claws  and while he   d left a faint scent  it had been masked by the blood .  in the nose of a werewolf  blood trumps everything .  but rumor rose in the streets of ankh morpork like mists from a midden .   and then it occurred to one or two of the board that the jovial    my friends    in the mouth of reacher gilt  so generous with his invitations  his little tips  his advice  and his champagne  was beginning  in its harmonics and overtones  to sound just like the word    pal    in the mouth of a man in an alley who was offering cosmetic surgery with a broken bottle in exchange for not being given any money .  on the other hand  they   d been safe so far  maybe it was worth following the tiger to the kill .  better to follow at the beast   s heel than be its prey        and now i realize that i am inexcusably keeping you from your beds     said gilt .     good night to you  gentlemen .  you may safely leave everything to me .  igor .         yeth  marthter     said igor  behind him .      do see these gentlemen out  and ask mr .  pony to come in        gilt watched them go with a smile of satisfaction  which became a bright and happy face when pony was ushered in .   the interview with the engineer went like this      mr .  pony     said gilt     i am very pleased to tell you that the board  impressed by your dedication and the hard work you have been putting in  have voted unanimously to increase your salary by five hundred dollars a year .      pony brightened up .     thank you very much  sir .  that will certainly come in           however  mr .  pony  as part of the management of the grand trunk company   and we do think of you as part of the team   we must ask you to bear in mind our cash flow .  we cannot authorize more than         for repairs this year .         that   s only about seventy dollars a tower  sir .     the engineer protested .      tch  is it really .  i told them you wouldn   t accept that     said gilt .     mr .  pony is an engineer of integrity  i said .  he won   t accept a penny less than          i told them .      pony looked hunted .     couldn   t really do much of a job  sir  even for that .  i could get some walking tower teams out there  yes  but most of the mountain towers are living on borrowed time as it is           we   re counting on you  george     said gilt .      well  i suppose   could we have the hour of the dead back  mr .  gilt .         i really wish you wouldn   t use that fanciful term     said gilt .     it really does not present the right image .         sorry  sir     said pony .     but i still need it .      gilt drummed his fingers on the table .     you   re asking a lot  george  you really are .  that   s revenue flow we   re talking about .  the board won   t be very pleased with me if           i think i   ve got to insist  mr .  gilt     said pony  looking at his feet .      and what could you deliver .     said gilt .     that   s what the board will want to know .  they   ll say to me  reacher  we   re giving good old george everything he asks for  what will we be getting in return .      forgetting for the moment that it was a quarter of what he   d asked for  good old george said     well  we could patch up all round and get some of the really shaky towers back into some sort of order  especially    and       oh  there   s just so much to do           would it  for example  give us a year of reasonable service .      mr .  pony struggled manfully with the engineer   s permanent dread of having to commit himself to anything  and managed     well  if we don   t lose too many staff  and the winter isn   t too bad  but of course there   s always        gilt snapped his fingers .     by damn  george  you   ve talked me into it .  i   ll tell the board that i   m backing you and to hell with them .         well  that   s very kind of you  sir  of course     said pony  bewildered     but it   s only papering over the cracks  really .  if we don   t have a major rebuild  we   re only laying up even more trouble for the future           in a year or so  george  you can lay any plans you like in front of us .     said gilt jovially .     your skill and ingenuity will be the saving of the company .  now  i know you   re a busy man and i mustn   t keep you .  go and perform miracles of economy  mr .  pony .     mr .  pony staggered out  proud and bemused and full of dread .      silly old fool     said gilt  and reached down and opened the bottom drawer of his desk .  he pulled out a bear trap  which he set with some effort  and then stood in the middle of the floor with his back to it .      igor .     he called .      yeth  thur     said igor  behind him .  there was a snap .     i think thith ith yourth  thur     igor added  handing gilt the sprung trap .  gilt looked down .  the man   s legs appeared unscathed .      how did you       he began .      oh  we igorth are no thrangerth to marthterth of an inquiring mind  thur     said igor gloomily .     one of my gentlemen uthed to thtand with hith back to a pit lined with thpiketh  thur .  oh how we chuckled  thur .         and what happened .         one day he forgot and thtepped into it .  talk about laugh  thur .      gilt laughed  too  and he went back to his desk .  he liked that kind of joke .      igor  would you say that i   m insane .     he said .   igors are not supposed to lie to an employer .  it   s part of the code of the igors .  he took refuge in strict linguistic honesty .      i wouldn   t find mythelf able to thay that  thur     he said .      i must be  igor .  either that or everyone else is     said gilt .     i mean  i show them what i do  i show them how the cards are marked  i tell them what i am   and they nudge one another and grin and each one of them thinks himself no end of a fine fellow to be doing business with me .  they throw good money after bad .  they believe themselves to be sharp operators  and yet they offer themselves like little lambs .  how i love to see their expressions when they think they   re being astute .         indeed  thur     said igor .  he was wondering if that job at the new hospital was still open .  his cousin igor was already working there and had told him it was wonderful  sometimes you had to work all night .  and you got a white coat  all the rubber gloves you could eat  and  best of all  you got rethpect .      it   s so   basic     said gilt .     you make money as it runs down  you make money building it up again  you might even make a little money running it  then you sell it to yourself when it collapses .  the leases alone are worth a fortune .  give alphonse his nuts  will you .         twelve and a half percent .  twelve and a half percent .     said the cockatoo  sidling up and down the perch excitedly .      certainly  thur     said igor  taking a bag out of his pocket and advancing cautiously .  alphonse had a beak like a pair of shears .   or maybe try veterinary work like his other cousin igor .  that was a good  traditional area  certainly .  pity about all that publicity when the hamster smashed its way out of its treadmill and ate that man   s leg before flying away  but that was progrethth for you .  the important thing was to get out before the mob arrived .  and when your boss started telling thin air how good he was  that was the time .      hope is the curse of humanity  igor     said gilt  putting his hands behind his head .      could be  thur     said igor  trying to avoid the horrible  curved beak .      the tiger does not hope to catch its prey  nor does the gazelle hope to escape the claws .  they run  igor .  only the running matters .  they know that they must run .  and now i must run along to those nice people at the times  to tell everyone about our bright new future .  get the coach out  will you .         certainly  thur .  if you will excuthe me  i will go and fetch another finger .      i think i   ll head back to the mountains  he thought as he went down to the cellar .  at least the monsters there have the decency to look like ones .      flares around the ruins of the post office made the night brilliant .  the golems didn   t need them  but the surveyors did .  moist had got a good deal there .  the gods had spoken  after all .  it   d do a firm no harm at all to be associated with this phoenix of a building .   in the bit that was still standing  shored up and tarpaulined  the post office   that is  the people who were the post office   worked through the night .  in truth  there wasn   t enough for everyone to do  but they turned up anyway  to do it .  it was that kind of night .  you had to be there  so that later you could say        and i was there  that very night        moist knew he ought to get some sleep  but he had to be there  too  alive and sparkling .  it was   amazing .  they listened to him  they did things for him  they scuttled around as if he was a real leader and not some cheat and fraud .   and there were the letters .  oh  the letters hurt .  more and more were coming in  and they were addressed to him .  the news had got around the city .  it had been in the paper .  the gods listened to this man .      we will deliver to the gods themselves     he was the man with the gold suit and the hat with wings .  they   d made a crook the messenger of the gods  and piled on his charred desk the sum of all their hopes and fears   badly punctuated  true  in smudged pencil or free post office ink  which had spluttered across the paper in the urgency of writing .      they think you   re an angel     said miss dearheart  who was sitting on the other side of his desk and helping him sort through the pathetic petitions .  every half hour or so mr .  pump brought up some more .      well  i   m not     snapped moist .      you speak to the gods and the gods listen     said miss dearheart  grinning .     they told you where the treasure was .  now  that   s what i call religion .  incidentally  how did you know the money was there .         you don   t believe in any gods .         no  of course not .  not while people like reacher gilt walk under the sky .  all there is  is us .  the money    .         i can   t tell you     said moist .      have you read some of these letters .     said miss dearheart .     sick children  dying wives           some just want cash     said moist hurriedly  as if that made it better .      whose fault is that  slick .  you   re the man who can tap the gods for a wad of wonga .         so what shall i do with all these   prayers .     said moist .      deliver them  of course .  you   ve got to .  you are the messenger of the gods .  and they   ve got stamps on .  some of them are covered in stamps .  it   s your job .  take them to the temples .  you promised to do that .         i never promised to           you promised to when you sold them the stamps .      moist almost fell off his chair .  she   d wielded the sentence like a fist .      and it   ll give them hope     she added  rather more quietly .      false hope     said moist  struggling upright .      maybe not this time     said miss dearheart .     that   s the point of hope .     she picked up the battered remains of anghammarad   s message .     he was taking a message across the whole of time .  you think you   ve got it tough .         mr .  lipwig .      the voice floated up from the hall  and at the same time the background noise subsided like a bad souffl   .   moist walked over to where a wall had once been .  now  with the scorched floorboards creaking underfoot  he looked right down into the hall .  a small part of him thought  we   ll have to put in a big picture window when we rebuild .  this is just too impressive for words .   there was a buzz of whispering and a few gasps .  there were a lot of customers  too  even in the early foggy hours .  it   s never too late for a prayer .      is everything all right  mr .  groat .     he called down .   something white was waved in the air .      early copy of the times  sir .     groat shouted .     just in .  gilt   s all over the front page  sir .  where you ought to be  sir .  you won   t like it  sir .         if moist von lipwig had been raised to be a clown  he   d have visited shows and circuses and watched the kings of fooldom .  he   d have marveled at the elegant trajectory of the custard pie  memorized the new business with the ladder and the bucket of whitewash  and watched with care every carelessly juggled egg .  while the rest of the audience watched the display with the appropriate feelings of terror  anger  and exasperation  he   d make notes .   now  like an apprentice staring at the work of a master  he read reacher gilt   s words on the still damp newspaper .   it was garbage  but it had been cooked by an expert .  oh  yes .  you had to admire the way perfectly innocent words were mugged  ravished  stripped of all true meaning and decency  and then sent to walk the gutter for reacher gilt  although    synergistically    had probably been a whore from the start .  the grand trunk   s problems were clearly the result of some mysterious spasm in the universe and had nothing to do with greed  arrogance  and willful stupidity .  oh  the grand trunk management had made mistakes   oops     well intentioned judgments which  with the benefit of hindsight  might regrettably have been  in some respects  in error      but these had mostly occurred  it appeared  while correcting    fundamental systemic errors    committed by the previous management .  no one was sorry for anything  because no living creature had done anything wrong  bad things had happened by spontaneous generation in some weird  chilly  geometrical other world  and    were to be regretted .       the times reporter had made an effort  but nothing short of a stampede could have stopped reacher gilt in his crazed assault on the meaning of meaning .  the grand trunk    was about people    and the reporter had completely failed to ask what that meant  exactly .  and then there was this piece called    our mission        moist felt the acid rise in his throat until he could spit lacework in a sheet of steel .   meaningless  stupid words  from people without wisdom or intelligence or any skill beyond the ability to water the currency of expression .  oh  the grand trunk stood for everything  from life and liberty to mom   s homemade distressed pudding .  it stood for everything  except anything .   through a pink mist  his eye caught the line    safety is our foremost consideration .     why hadn   t the lead type melted  why hadn   t the paper blazed rather than be part of this obscenity .  the press should have buckled  the roller should have cleaved unto the platen     that was bad .  but then he saw gilt   s reply to a hasty question about the post office .   reacher gilt loved the post office and blessed its little cotton socks .  he was very grateful for its assistance during this difficult period and looked forward to future cooperation  although  of course  the post office  in the real modern world  would never be able to compete on anything other than a very local level .  mind you  someone has to deliver the bills  ho ho     it was masterly   the bastard .      er   are you okay .  could you stop shouting .     said miss dearheart .      what .     the mists cleared .   everyone in the hall was looking at him  their mouths open  their eyes wide .  watery ink dripped from post office pens  stamps began to dry on tongues .      you were shouting     said miss dearheart .     swearing  in fact .      miss maccalariat pushed her way through the throng  with an expression of determination .      mr .  lipwig  i hope never to hear such language in this building again .     she said .      he was using it about the chairman of the grand trunk company     said miss dearheart  in what was  for her  a conciliatory tone of voice .      oh .     miss maccalariat hesitated  and then remembered herself .     er   perhaps a teensy bit quieter  then .         certainly  miss maccalariat     said moist obediently .      and perhaps not the k word .         no  miss maccalariat .         and also not the l word  the t word  both of the s words  the v word  and the y word .         just as you say  miss maccalariat .            murdering conniving bastard of a weasel    was acceptable  however .         i shall remember that  miss maccalariat .         very good  postmaster .      miss maccalariat turned on her heel and went back to haranguing someone for not using blotting paper .   moist handed the paper to miss dearheart .      he   s going to walk away with it     he said .     he   s just throwing words around .  the trunk   s too big to fail .  too many investors .  he   ll get more money  keep the system going just this side of disaster  then let it collapse .  buy it up then via another company  maybe  at a knockdown price .         i   d suspect him of anything     said miss dearheart .     but you sound very certain .         that   s what i   d do     said moist        er   if i was that kind of person .  it   s the oldest trick in the book .  you get the punt   you get others so deeply involved that they don   t dare fold .  it   s the dream  you see .  they think if they stay in it   ll all work out .  they daren   t think it   s all a dream .  you use big words to tell them it   s going to be jam tomorrow and they hope .  but they   ll never win .  part of them knows that  but the rest of them never listens to it .  the house always wins .         why do people like gilt get away with it .         i just told you .  it   s because people hope .  they   ll believe that someone will sell them a real diamond for a dollar .  sorry .         do you know how i came to work for the trust .     said miss dearheart .   because clay people are easier to deal with .  moist thought .  they don   t cough when you talk to them .     no     he said .      i used to work in a bank in sto lat .  the cabbage growers    cooperative           oh  the one on the town square .  with the carved cabbage over the door .     said moist before he could stop himself .      you know it .     she said .      well  yes .  i went past it  once       oh no  he thought  as his mind ran ahead of the conversation  oh  please  no        it wasn   t a bad job     said miss dearheart .     in our office  we had to inspect drafts and checks .  looking for forgeries  you know .  and one day  i let four through .  four fakes .  it cost the bank two thousand dollars .  they were cash drafts  and the signatures were perfect .  i got sacked for that .  they said they had to do something  otherwise the customers would lose confidence .  it   s not fun  having people think you might be a crook .  and that   s what happens to people like us .  people like gilt always get away with it .  are you all right .         hmm .     said moist .      you look a bit   off color .      that had been a good day  moist thought .  at least  up until now it had been a good day .  he   d been quite pleased with it at the time .  you weren   t supposed ever to meet the people afterwards .  gods damn mr .  pump and his actuarial concept of murder .   he sighed .  oh well  it had come to this .  he   d known it would .  him and gilt  arm wrestling to see who was the biggest bastard .      this is the country edition of the times     he said .     they don   t go to press with the city edition for another ninety minutes  in case of late breaking news .  i think i can wipe the smile off his face  at least .         what are you going to do .     said miss dearheart .   moist adjusted the wing  d hat .      attempt the impossible     he said .       chapter      the woodpecker      the challenge     moving mountains      the many uses of cabbage     the board debates      mr .  lipwig on his knees     the smoking gnu      the way of the woodpecker      it was the next morning .   something prodded moist .   he opened his eyes and stared along the length of a shiny  black cane  past the hand holding the silver death   s head knob  and into the face of lord vetinari .  behind him  the golem smoldered in the corner .      pray  don   t get up     said the patrician .     i expect you have had a busy night .         sorry  sir     said moist  forcing himself upright .  he   d fallen asleep at his desk again  his mouth tasted as though tiddles had slept in it .  behind vetinari   s head  he could see mr .  groat and stanley  peering anxiously around the door .   lord vetinari sat down opposite him  after dusting some ash off a chair .      you have read this morning   s times .     he said .      i was there when it was printed  sir .     moist   s neck seemed to have developed extra bones .  he tried to twist his head straight .      ah  yes .  ankh morpork to genua is about two thousand miles  mr .  lipwig .  and you say you can get a message there faster than the clacks .  you have issued that as a challenge .  most intriguing .         yes  sir .         even the fastest coach takes almost two months  mr .  lipwig  and i   m given to understand that if you traveled nonstop your kidneys would be jolted out of your ears .         yes  sir .  i know that     said moist  yawning .      it would be cheating  you know  to use magic .      moist yawned again .     i know that  too  sir .         did you ask the archchancellor of unseen university before you suggested that he should devise the message for this curious race .     lord vetinari demanded  unfolding the newspaper .  moist caught sight of the headlines      the race is on .      flying postman    vs .  grand trunk        no  my lord .  i said the message should be prepared by a well respected citizen of great probity  such as the archchancellor  sir .         well  he   s hardly likely to say no now  is he .     said vetinari .      i   d like to think so  sir .  gilt won   t be able to bribe him  at least .         hmm .     vetinari tapped the floor once or twice with his cane .     would it surprise you to know that the feeling in the city this morning is that you   ll win .  the trunk has never been out of commission for longer than a week  a clacks message can get to genua in a few hours  and yet  mr .  lipwig  people think you can do this .  don   t you find that amazing .         er           but  of course  you are the man of the moment  mr .  lipwig     said vetinari  suddenly jovial .     you are the golden messenger .     his smile was reptilian .     i do hope you know what you are doing .  you do know what you are doing  don   t you  mr .  lipwig .         faith moves mountains  my lord     said moist .      there are a lot of them between here and genua  indeed     said lord vetinari .     you say in the paper that you   ll leave tomorrow night .         that   s right .  the weekly coach .  but on this run we won   t take paying passengers  to save weight .      moist looked into vetinari   s eyes .      you wouldn   t like to give me some little clue .     said the patrician .      best all round if i don   t  sir     said moist .      i suppose the gods haven   t left an extremely fast magical horse buried somewhere nearby  have they .         not that i   m aware  sir     said moist earnestly .     of course  you never know until you pray .         no oo     said vetinari .  he   s trying the penetrating gaze  moist thought .  but we know how to deal with that  don   t we .  we let it pass right through .      gilt will have to accept the challenge  of course     said vetinari .     but he is a man of   ingenious resource .      that seemed to moist to be a very careful way of saying    murderous bastard .     once again  he let it pass .   his lordship stood up .     until tomorrow night  then     he said .     no doubt there will be some little ceremony for the newspapers .         i haven   t actually planned that  sir     said moist .      no  of course you haven   t     said lord vetinari  and gave him what could only be called   a look .      moist got very much the same look from jim upwright  before the man said     well  we can put out the word and call in some favors and we   ll get good horses at the post houses  mr .  lipwig  but we only go as far as bonk  you know .  then you   ll have to change .  the genua express is pretty good  though .  we know the lads .         you   re sure you want to hire the whole coach .     said harry  as he rubbed down a horse .     it   ll be expensive     cos we   ll have to run another for the passengers .  it   s a popular run  that one .         just the mail in that coach     said moist .     and some guards .         ah  you think you   ll be attacked .     said harry  squeezing the towel bone dry with barely an effort .      what do you think .     said moist .   the brothers looked at each other .      i   ll drive it  then     said jim .     they don   t call me lead pipe for nothing .         besides  i heard there were bandits up in the mountains     said moist .      used to be     said jim .     not as many now .         that   s something less to worry about  then     said moist .      dunno     said jim .     we never found out what wiped them out .         always remember that the crowd that applauds your coronation is the same crowd that will applaud your beheading .  people like a show .   people like a show        and so mail was coming in for genua  a dollar at a time .  a lot of mail .   it was stanley who explained .  he explained several times  because moist had a bit of a blind spot on this one .      people are sending envelopes with stamps inside envelopes to the coach office in genua so that the first envelope can be sent back in the second envelope     was the shape of explanation that finally blew on some sparks in moist   s brain .      they want the envelopes back .     he said .     why .         because they   ve been used  sir .         that makes them valuable .         i   m not sure how  sir .  it   s like i told you  sir .  i think some people think that they   re not real stamps until they   ve done the job they were invented to do  sir .  remember the first printing of the one penny stamps that we had to cut out with scissors .  an envelope with one of those on it is worth two dollars to a collector .         two hundred times more than the stamp .         that   s how it   s going  sir     said stanley  his eyes sparkling .     people post letters to themselves just to get the stamp  er  stamped  sir .  so they   ve been used .         er   i   ve got a couple of rather crusty handkerchiefs in my pocket     said moist  mystified .     do you think people might want to buy them at two hundred times what they cost .         no  sir .     said stanley .      then why should           there   s a lot of interest  sir .  i thought we could do a whole set of stamps for the big guilds  sir .  all the collectors would want them .  what do you think .         that   s a very clever idea  stanley     said moist .     we   ll do that .  the one of the seamstresses    guild might have to go inside a plain brown envelope  eh .  ha ha .      this time it was stanley who looked perplexed .      sorry  sir .      moist coughed .     oh  nothing .  well  i can see you   re learning fast  stanley .  some things  anyway .         er   yes  sir .  er   i don   t want to push myself forward  sir           push away  stanley  push away     said moist cheerfully .   stanley pulled a small paper folder out of his pocket  opened it  and laid it reverentially in front of moist .      mr .  spools helped me with some of it     he said .     but i did a lot .      it was a stamp .  it was a yellowy green color .  it showed   moist peered   a field of cabbages  with some buildings on the horizon .   he sniffed .  it smelled of cabbages .  oh  yes .      printed with cabbage ink and using gum made from broccoli  sir     said stanley  full of pride .        a salute to the cabbage industry of the sto plains     sir .  i think it might do very well .  cabbages are so popular  sir .  you can make so many things out of them .         well  i can see that           there   s cabbage soup  cabbage beer  cabbage fudge  cabbage cake  cream of cabbage           yes  stanley  i think you              pickled cabbage  cabbage jelly  cabbage salad  boiled cabbage  deep fried cabbage           yes  but now can              fricassee of cabbage  cabbage chutney  cabbage surprise  sausages           sausages .         filled with cabbage  sir .  you can make practically anything with cabbage  sir .  then there   s           cabbage stamps     said moist terminally .     at fifty pence  i note .  you have hidden depths  stanley .         i owe it all to you  mr .  lipwig .     stanley burst out .     i have put the childish playground of pins right behind me  sir .  the world of stamps  which can teach a young man much about history and geography as well as being a healthy  enjoyable  engrossing  and thoroughly worthwhile hobby that will give him an interest that will last a lifetime  has opened up before me and           yes  yes  thank you .     said moist .         and i   m putting thirty dollars into the pot  sir .  all my savings .  just to show we support you .      moist heard all the words  but had to wait for them to make sense .      pot .     he said at last .     you mean like a bet .         yes  sir .  a big bet     said stanley happily .     about you racing the clacks to genua .  people think that   s funny .  a lot of the bookmakers are offering odds  sir  so mr .  groat is organizing it  sir .  he said the odds aren   t good  though .         i shouldn   t think they are     said moist weakly .     no one in their right mind would           he said we   d only win one dollar for every eight we bet  sir  but we reckoned        moist shot upright .     eight to one odds on .     he shouted .     the bookies think i   m going to win .  how much are you all betting .         er   about one thousand two hundred dollars at the last count  sir .  is that        pigeons rose from the roof at the sound of moist von lipwig   s scream .      fetch mr .  groat right now .         it was a terrible thing to see guile on the face of mr .  groat .  the old man tapped the side of his nose .      you   re the man that got money out o    a bunch of gods  sir .     he said  grinning happily .      yes     said moist desperately .     but supposing i   i just did that with a trick           damn good trick  sir     the old man cackled .     damn good .  a man who could trick money out of the gods   d be capable of anything  i should think .         mr .  groat  there is no way a coach can get to genua faster than a clacks message .  it   s two thousand miles .         yes  i realize you   ve got to say that  sir .  walls have ears  sir .  mum   s the word .  but we all had a talk  and we reckoned you   ve been very good to us  sir  you really believe in the post office  sir  so we thought it   s time to put our money in our mouth  sir .     said groat  and now there was a touch of defiance .   moist gaped once or twice .     you mean    where your mouth is    .         you   re the man who knows a trick or three  sir .  the way you just went into the newspaper and said  we   ll race you .  reacher gilt walked right into your trap  sir .      glass into diamond  thought moist .  he sighed .     all right  mr .  groat .  thank you .  eight to one on  eh .         we were lucky to get it  sir .  they went up to ten to one on  then they closed the books .  all they   re accepting now is bets on how you   ll win  sir .      moist perked up a little .      any good ideas .     he asked .      i   ve got a one dollar bet on    by dropping fire from the sky     sir .  er   you wouldn   t like to give me a hint  p   raps .         please go and get on with your work  mr .  groat     said moist severely .      yessir  of course  sir  sorry i asked  sir     said groat  and crabbed off .   moist put his head in his hands .   i wonder if it   s like this for mountain climbers  he thought .  you climb bigger and bigger mountains  and you know that one day one of them   s going to be just that bit too steep .  but you go on doing it  because it   s so oo good when you breathe the air up there .  and you know you   ll die falling .      how could people be so stupid .  they seemed to cling to ignorance because it smelled familiar .  reacher gilt sighed .   he had an office in the tump tower .  he didn   t like it much  because the whole place shook to the movement of the semaphore  but it was necessary for the look of the thing .  it did have an unrivaled view of the city  though .  and the site alone was worth what they   d paid for the trunk .      it takes the best part of two months to get to genua by coach     he said  staring across the rooftops to the palace .     he might be able to shave something off that  i suppose .  the clacks takes a few hours .  what is there about this that frightens you .         so what   s his game .     said greenyham .  the rest of the board sat around the table  looking worried .      i don   t know     said gilt .     i don   t care .         but the gods are on his side  reacher     said nutmeg .      let   s talk about that  shall we .     said gilt .     does that claim strike anyone else as odd .  the gods are not generally known for no frills gifts  are they .  especially not ones that you can bite .  no  these days they restrict themselves to things like grace  patience  fortitude  and inner strength .  things you can   t see .  things that have no value .  gods tend to be more interested in prophets  not profits  a ha .      there were some blank looks from his fellow directors .      didn   t quite get that one  old chap     said stowley .      prophets  i said  not profits     said gilt .  he waved his hand .     don   t worry yourselves  it will look better written down .  in short  mr .  lipwig   s gift from above was a big chest of coins  some of them in what looked remarkably like bank sacks and all in modern denominations .  you don   t find this strange .         yes  but even the high priests say he           lipwig is a showman     snapped gilt .     do you think the gods will carry his mail coach for him .  do you .  this is a stunt  do you understand .  it got him on page one again  that   s all .  this is not hard to follow .  he has no plan  other than to fail heroically .  no one expects him actually to win  do they .         i heard that people are betting heavily on him .         people enjoy the experience of being fooled  if it promises a certain amount of entertainment     said gilt .     do you know a good bookmaker .  i shall have a little bet .  five thousand dollars  perhaps .      this got some nervous laughter  and he followed it up .     gentlemen  be sensible .  no gods will come to the aid of our postmaster .  no wizards  either .  they   re not generous with magic  and we   ll soon find out if he uses any .  no  he   s looking for the publicity  that   s all .  which is not to say     he winked     that we shouldn   t  how shall i put it  make certainty doubly sure .      they perked up still more .  this sounded like the kind of thing they wanted to hear .      after all  accidents can happen in the mountains     said greenyham .      i believe that is the case     said gilt .     however  i was referring to the grand trunk .  therefore i have asked mr .  pony to outline our procedure .  mr .  pony .      the engineer shifted uneasily .  he   d had a bad night .      i want it recorded  sir  that i have urged a six hour shutdown before the event     he said .      indeed  and the minutes will show that i have said that is quite impossible     said gilt .     firstly  because it would be an unpardonable loss of revenue  and secondly  because sending no messages would send quite the wrong message .         we   ll shut down for an hour before the event  then  and clear down     said mr .  pony .     every tower will send a statement of readiness to the tump and then lock all doors and wait .  no one will be allowed in or out .  we   ll configure the towers to run duplex   that is     he translated for management     we   ll turn the down line into a second up line  so the message will get to genua twice as fast .  we won   t have any other messages on the trunk while the  er  race is on .  no overhead  nothing .  and from now on  sir  from the moment i walk out of this room  we take no more messages from feeder towers .  not even from the one in the palace  not even from the one in the university .     he sniffed  and added with some satisfaction        specially not them students .  someone   s been having a go at us  sir .         that seems a bit drastic  mr .  pony     said greenyham .      i hope it is  sir .  i think someone   s found a way of sending messages that can damage a tower  sir .         that   s impossi        mr .  pony   s hand slapped the table .     how come you know so much  sir .  did you sit up half the night trying to get to the bottom of it .  have you taken a differential drum apart with a tin opener .  did you spot how the swage armature can be made to jump off the elliptical bearing if you hit the letter k and then send it to a tower with an address higher than yours but only if you hit the letter q first and the drum spring is fully wound .  did you spot that the key levers wedge together and the spring forces the arm up and you   re looking at a gearbox full of teeth .  well  i did .         are you talking about sabotage here .     said gilt .      call it what you like     said pony  drunk with nervousness .     i went to the yard this morning and dug out the old drum we took out of tower    last month .  i   ll swear the same thing happened there .  but mostly the breakdowns are in the upper tower  in the shutter boxes .  that   s where           so our mr .  lipwig has been behind a campaign to sabotage us       gilt mused .      i never said that .     said pony .      no name need be mentioned     said gilt smoothly .      it   s just sloppy design     said pony .     i daresay one of the lads found it by accident and tried it again to see what happened .  they   re like that  the tower boys .  show    em a bit of cunning machinery and they   ll spend all day trying to make it fail .  the whole trunk   s a lash up  it really is .         why do we employ people like these .     said stowley  looking bewildered .      because they   re the only people mad enough to spend their life up a tower  miles from anywhere  pressing keys     said pony .     they like it .         but somebody in a tower must press the keys that do all these   terrible things     said stowley .   pony sighed .  they never took an interest .  it was just money .  they didn   t know how anything worked .  and then suddenly they needed to know  and you had to use baby talk .      the lads follow the signal  sir  as they say     he said .     they watch the next tower and repeat the message  as fast as they can .  there   s no time to think about it .  anything for their tower comes out on the differential drum .  they just pound keys and kick pedals and pull levers  as fast as they can .  they take pride in it .  they even do all kinds of tricks to speed things up .  i don   t want any talk about sabotage  not right now .  let   s just get the message sent  as fast as possible .  the lads will enjoy that .         the image is attractive     said gilt .     the dark of night  the waiting towers  and then  one by one  they come alive as a serpent of light speeds across the world  softly and silently carrying its   whatever .  we must get some poet to write about it .     he nodded at mr .  pony .     we   re in your hands  mr .  pony .  you   re the man with the plan .            i don   t have one     said moist .      no plan .     said miss dearheart .     are you telling me you           keep it down  keep it down .     moist hissed .     i don   t want everyone to know .      they were in the little caf   near the pin exchange  which  moist had noticed  didn   t seem to be doing much business today .  he   d had to get out of the post office  in case his head exploded .      you challenged the grand trunk .  you mean you just talked big and hoped something would turn up .     said miss dearheart .      it   s always worked before .  where   s the sense in promising to achieve the achievable .  what kind of success would that be .     said moist .      haven   t you ever heard of learning to walk before you run .         it   s a theory  yes .         i just want to be absolutely clear     said miss dearheart .     tomorrow night   that   s the day after today   you are going to send via a coach   that   s a thing on wheels  pulled by horses  which might reach fourteen miles an hour on a good road   to race against the grand trunk   that   s all those semaphore towers  which can send messages at hundreds of miles an hour   all the way to genua   that   s the town which is a very long way away indeed .         yes .         and you have no wonderful plan .         no .         and why are you telling me .         because  in this city  right now  you are the only person who would possibly believe i don   t have a plan .     said moist .     i told mr .  groat and he just tapped the side of his nose  which is something you wouldn   t want to watch  by the way  and he said     of course you haven   t  sir .  not you .  ho ho ho .            and you just hoped something would turn up .  what made you think it would .         it always has .  the only way to get something to turn up when you need it is to need it to turn up .         and i   m supposed to help you how .         your father built the trunk .         yes  but i didn   t     said the woman .     i   ve been up in the towers .  i don   t know any big secrets  except that it   s always on the point of breaking down .  and everyone knows that .         people who can   t afford to lose are betting money on me .  and the more i tell them they shouldn   t  the more they bet .         don   t you think that   s a bit silly of them .     said miss dearheart sweetly .   moist drummed his fingers on the edge of the table .     all right     he said     i can think of another good reason why you might help me .  it   s a little complicated  so i can only tell you if you promise to sit still and not make any sudden movements .         why  do you believe i will .         yes .  i think that in a few seconds you   ll try to kill me .  i   d like you to promise not to .      she shrugged .     this should be interesting .         promise .     said moist .      all right .  i hope it   s going to be exciting .     miss dearheart flicked some ash off her cigarette .     go on .      moist took a couple of calm breaths .  this was it .  the end .  if you kept changing the way people see the world  you ended up changing the way you saw yourself .      i am the man who lost you that job at the bank .  i forged those cash drafts .      miss dearheart   s expression didn   t change  apart from a certain narrowing of the eyes .  then she blew out a stream of smoke .      i did promise  did i .     she said .      yes .  sorry .         did i have my fingers crossed .         no .  i was watching .         hmm .     she stared reflectively at the glowing end of her cigarette .     all right .  you   d better tell me the rest of it .      he told her the rest of it .  all of it .  she quite liked the bit where he was hanged  and made him repeat it .  around them  the city happened .  between them  the ashtray filled up with ash .   when he   d finished  she stared at him for some time  through the smoke .      i don   t understand the bit where you give all your stolen money to the post office .  why did you do that .         i   m a bit hazy on that myself .         i mean  you   re clearly a self centered bastard  with the moral fiber of a  a              rat     moist suggested .         a rat  thank you   but suddenly you   re the darling of the big religions  the savior of the post office  official snook cocker to the rich and powerful  heroic horseman  all round wonderful human being and  of course  you rescued a cat from a burning building .  two humans  too  but everyone knows the cat   s the most important bit .  who are you trying to fool  mr .  lipwig .         me  i think .  i   ve fallen into good ways .  i keep thinking i can give it up any time i like  but i don   t .  but i know if i couldn   t give it up any time i liked  i wouldn   t go on doing it .  er   there is another reason  too .         and that is    .         i   m not reacher gilt .  that   s sort of important .  some people might say there   s not a lot of difference  but i can see it from where i stand and it   s there .  it   s like a golem not being a hammer .  please .  how can i beat the grand trunk .      miss dearheart stared through him until he felt perforated .  then she said  in a faraway voice      how well do you know the post office  mr .  lipwig .  the building  i mean .         i saw most of it before it burned down .         but you never went onto the roof .         no .  i couldn   t find a way up .  the upper floors were stuffed with letters when   i   tried       moist   s voice trailed off .   miss dearheart stubbed out her cigarette .     go up there tonight  mr .  lipwig .  get yourself a little bit closer to heaven .  and then get down on your knees and pray .  you know how to pray  don   t you .  you just put your hands together   and hope .         moist got through the rest of the day somehow .  there were postmastery things to do   mr .  spools to speak to  builders to shout at  the everlasting clearing up to oversee  and new staff to hire .  in the case of the staff  though  it was more a matter of ratifying the decisions of mr .  groat and miss maccalariat  but they seemed to know what they were doing .  he just had to be there to make the occasional judgment  such as      do we embrace divertingly .     said miss maccalariat  appearing in front of his desk .   there was a pregnant pause .  it gave birth to a lot of little pauses  each one more deeply embarrassing than its parent .      not as far as i know     was the best moist could manage .     why do you ask .         a young lady wants to know .  she said that   s what they do at the grand trunk .         ah .  i suspect she means embrace diversity     said moist  recalling gilt   s speech to the times .     but we don   t do that here because we don   t know what it means .  we   ll employ anyone who can read and write and reach a letterbox  miss maccalariat .  i   ll hire vampires if they   re members of the league of temperance  trolls if they wipe their feet  and if there   re any werewolves out there  i   d love to hire postmen who can bite back .  anyone who can do the job  miss maccalariat .  our job is moving the mail .  morning  noon  and night  we deliver .  was there anything else .      now there was a glint in her eye .     i don   t have any difficulties with anyone who speaks up about what they are  mr .  lipwig  but i must protest about dwarfs .  mr .  groat is hiring them .         fine workers  miss maccalariat .  keen on the written word .  hardworking  too     said moist briskly .      but they do not tell you what their   what they   which   if they   re ladies or gentlemen dwarfs  mr .  lipwig .         ah .  this is going to be about the privies again .     said moist  his heart sinking .      i feel i am responsible for the moral welfare of the young people in my charge     said miss maccalariat sternly .     you are smiling  postmaster  but i will not be funned with .         your concern does you credit  miss maccalariat     said moist .     special attention will be paid to this in the design of the new building  and i will tell the architect that you are to be consulted at every stage .     miss maccalariat   s wellcovered bosom inflated noticeably at this sudden acquisition of power .     in the meantime  alas  we must make do with what the fire has left us .  i do hope  as part of the management team  you will reassure people on this .      the fires of dreadful pride gleamed off miss maccalariat   s glasses .  management .      of course  postmaster     she said .   but  mostly  moist   s job was just to   be .  half of the building was a blackened shell .  people were squeezed into what was left  mail was even being sorted on the stairs .  and things seemed to go better when he was around .  he didn   t have to do anything  he just had to be there .   he couldn   t help thinking of the empty plinth  where the god had been taken away .   he was ready when dusk came .  there were plenty of ladders around  and the golems had managed to shore up the floors even up here .  soot covered everything  and some rooms opened onto blackness  but he climbed ever up .   he struggled through what remained of the attics  and clambered through a hatch and onto the roof .   there wasn   t much of it .  the descent of the rainwater tank had brought down a lot of burning roof with it  and barely a third remained over the great hall .  but the fire had barely touched one of the legs of the u  and the roof there looked sound .   there was one of the old postal pigeon lofts there  and someone had been living in it .  that wasn   t too surprising .  far more people wanted to live in ankh morpork than there was ankh morpork for them to live in .  there was a whole subcivilization at rooftop level  up here among the towers and ornamental domes and cupolas and chimneys and        clacks towers .  that   s right .  he   d seen the clacks tower  and someone up here  just before his life had taken a turn for the strange .  why would a loft built for carrier pigeons have a semaphore tower .  surely the pigeons didn   t use it .   three gargoyles had colonized this one .  they liked clacks towers anyway   being up high was what being a gargoyle was all about   and they   d fitted into the system easily .  a creature that spent all its time watching and was bright enough to write down a message was a vital component .  they didn   t even want to be paid  and they never got bored .  what could possibly bore a creature that was prepared to stare at the same thing for years at a time .   around the city  the clacks towers were lighting up .  only the university  the palace  the guilds  and the seriously rich or very nervous ran their towers at night  but the big terminal tower on the tump blazed like a hogwatch tree .  patterns of yellow squares ran up and down the main tower .  silent at this distance  winking their signals above the rising mists  outlining their constellations against the evening  the towers were more magical than magic  more bewitching than witchcraft .   moist stared .   what was magic  after all  but something that happened at the snap of a finger .  where was the magic in that .  it was mumbled words and weird drawings in old books  and in the wrong hands it was as dangerous as hell  but not one half as dangerous as it could be in the right hands .  the universe was full of the stuff  it made the stars stay up and the feet stay down .   but what was happening now   this was magical .  ordinary men had dreamed it up and put it together  building towers on rafts in swamps and across the frozen spines of mountains .  they   d cursed and  worse  used logarithms .  they   d waded through rivers and dabbled in trigonometry .  they hadn   t dreamed  in the way people usually used the word  but they   d imagined a different world  and bent metal around it .  and out of all the sweat and swearing and mathematics had come this   thing  dropping words across the world as softly as starlight .   the mist was filling the streets now  leaving the building like islands in surf .   pray  she   d said .  and  in a way  the gods owed him a favor .  well  didn   t they .  they   d got a handsome offering and a lot of celestial cred for not  in fact  doing anything at all .   get down on your knees  she   d said .  it hadn   t been a joke .   he knelt  pressed his hands together  and said     i address this prayer to any god who        with a silence that was frightening  the clacks tower across the street lit up .  the big squares glowed into life one after the other .  for a moment  moist saw the shape of the lamplighter in front of one of the shutters .   as he disappeared into the dark  the tower started to flicker .  it was close enough to illuminate the roof of the post office .   there were three dark figures at the other end of the roof  watching moist .  their shadows danced as the pattern of lights changed  twice every second .  they revealed that the figures were human  or at least humanoid .  and they were walking toward him .   gods  now  gods could be humanoid .  and they didn   t like to be messed about .   moist cleared his throat .     i   m certainly glad to see you       he croaked .      are you moist .     said one of the figures .      look  i           she said you   d be kneeling down     said another member of the celestial trio .     fancy a cup of tea .      moist got up slowly .  this was not godly behavior .      who are you .     he said .  emboldened by the lack of thunderbolts  he added     and what are you doing on my building .         we pay rent     said a figure .     to mr .  groat .         he never told me about you .         can   t help you there     said the shadow in the center .     anyway  we   ve only come back to get the rest of our stuff .  sorry about your fire .  it wasn   t us .         you being    .     said moist .      i   m mad al  he   s sane alex  and that   s adrian  who says he   s not mad but can   t prove it .         why do you rent the roof .      the trio looked at one another .      pigeons .     suggested adrian .      that   s right  we   re pigeon fanciers     said the shadowy figure of sane alex .      but it   s dark     said moist .  this information was considered .      bats     said mad al .     we   re trying to breed homing bats .         i don   t believe bats have that kind of homing instinct     said moist .      yes  it   s tragic  isn   t it     said alex .      i come up here at night and see those empty little perches and it   s all i can do not to cry     said undecided adrian .   moist looked up at the little tower .  it was about five times the height of a man  with the control levers on a polished panel near the bottom .  it looked   professional  and well used .  and portable .      i don   t think you breed any kind of birds up here     he said .      bats are mammals     said sane alex .  moist shook his head .      lurking on rooftops  your own clacks   you   re the smoking gnu  aren   t you           ah  with a mind like that i can see why you   re mr .  groat   s boss     said sane alex .     how about that cup of tea .         mad al picked a pigeon feather out of his mug .  the pigeon loft was full of the flat  choking smell of old guano .      you have to like birds to like it up here     he said  flicking the feather into sane alex   s beard .      good job you do  eh .     said moist .      i didn   t say i did  did i .  and we don   t live up here .  it   s just that you   ve got a good rooftop .      it was cramped in the pigeon loft  from which pigeons had  in fact  been barred .  but there   s always one pigeon that can bite through wire netting .  it watched them from the corner with mad little eyes  its genes remembering the time it had been a giant reptile that could have taken these sons of monkeys to the cleaners in one mouthful .  bits of dismantled mechanisms were everywhere .      miss dearheart told you about me  did she .     said moist .      she said you weren   t a complete arse     said undecided adrian .      which is praise coming from her     said sane alex .      and she said you were so crooked you could walk through a corkscrew sideways     said undecided adrian .     but she was smiling when she said it .         that   s not necessarily a good thing     said moist .     how do you know her .         we used to work with her brother     said mad al .     on the mark   tower .      moist listened .  it was a whole new world .   sane alex and mad al were old men in the clacks business  they   d been in it for almost four years .  then the consortium had taken over  and they   d been fired from the grand trunk on the same day that undecided adrian had been fired from the alchemists    guild chimney  in their case because they   d spoken their mind about the new management  and in his case because he hadn   t moved fast enough when the beaker started to bubble .   they   d all ended up working on the second trunk .  they   d even put money into it .  so had others .  it had all kinds of improvements  it would be cheaper to run  it was the bee   s knees  mutt   s nuts  and various wonderful bits of half a dozen other creatures .  and then john dearheart  who always used a safety lanyard  landed in the cabbage field  and that was the end of the second trunk .   the trio had done the kind of jobs available to new square pegs in a world of old round holes  but every night  high above  the clacks flashed its messages .  it was so close  so inviting  so   accessible .  everyone knew  in some vague  half understood way  that the grand trunk had been stolen in all but name .  it belonged to the enemy .   so they   d started an informal little company of their own  which used the grand trunk without the grand trunk knowing .   it was a little like stealing .  it was exactly like stealing .  it was  in fact  stealing .  but there was no law against it  because no one knew the crime existed  so is it really stealing if what   s stolen isn   t missed .  and is it stealing if you   re stealing from thieves .  anyway  all property is theft  except mine .      so now you   re  what was it again   crackers .     moist said .      that   s right     said mad al .     because we can crack the system .         that sounds a bit overdramatic when you   re just doing it with lamps  doesn   t it .         yes  but    flashers    was already taken     said sane alex .      all right  but why    smoking gnu    .     said moist .      that   s cracker slang for a very fast message send throughout the system     said sane alex proudly .   moist pondered this .     that makes sense     he said .     if i was a team of three people who all had a first name beginning with the same letter  that   s just the kind of name i   d choose .      they   d found a way into the semaphore system  and it was this  at night  all clacks towers were invisible .  only the lights showed .  unless you had a good sense of direction  the only way you could identify who the message was coming from was by its code .  engineers knew lots of code .  ooh  lots .      you can send messages free .     said moist .     and nobody notices .      there were three smug smiles .     it   s easy     said mad al     when you know how .         how did you know that tower was going to break down .         we broke it     said sane alex .     broke the differential drum .  they take hours to sort out  because the operators have to        moist missed the rest of the sentence .  innocent words swirled in it like debris caught in a flood  occasionally bobbing to the surface and waving desperately before being pulled under again .  he caught    the    several times before it drowned  and even    disconnect    and    gear chain     but the roaring  technical polysyllables rose and engulfed them all .         and that takes at least half a day     sane alex finished .   moist looked helplessly at the other two .      and that means what  exactly .     he said .      if you send the right kind of message  you can bust the machinery     said mad al .      the whole trunk .         in theory     said sane alex     because an execute and terminate code        moist relaxed as the tide came back in .  he wasn   t interested in machinery  he thought of a spanner as something that had another person holding it .  it was best just to smile and wait .  that was the thing about artificers  they loved explaining .  you just had to wait until they reached your level of understanding  even if it meant that they had to lie down .         can   t do that anymore in any case  because we   ve heard they   re changing the        moist stared at the pigeon for a while  until silence came back .  ah .  mad al had finished  and by the looks of things it hadn   t been on a high note .      you can   t do it  then     said moist  his heart sinking .      not now .  old mr .  pony might be a bit of an old woman  but he sits and niggles at problems .  he   s been changing all the codes all day .  we   ve heard from one of our mates that every signaler will have to have a personal code now .  they   re being very careful .  i know miss adora belle thought we could help you  but that bastard gilt has locked things up tight .  he   s worried you   re going to win .         hah .     said moist .      we   ll come up with some other way in a week or two     said undecided adrian .     can   t you put it off until then .         no  i don   t think so .         sorry     said undecided adrian .  he was playing idly with a small glass tube  full of red light .  when he turned it over  it filled with yellow light .      what   s that .     moist asked .      a prototype     said undecided adrian .     it could have made the trunk almost three times faster at night .  it uses perpendicular molecules .  but the trunk   s just not open to new ideas .         probably because they explode when dropped .     said sane alex .      not always .         i think i could do with some fresh air     said moist .   they stepped out into the night .  in the middle distance  the terminal tower still winked  and one or two towers were alight in other parts of the city .      what   s that one .     he said  like a man pointing to a constellation .      thieves    guild     said undecided adrian .     general signals for the members .  i can   t read    em .         and that one .  isn   t that the first tower on the way to sto lat .         no  it   s the watch station on the hubwards gate .  general signals to pseudopolis yard .         it looks a long way off .         they use small shutter boxes  that   s all .  you can   t see tower   from here  the university   s in the way .      moist stared  hypnotized  at the lights .      i wondered why that old stone tower on the way to sto lat wasn   t used when the trunk was built .  it   s in the right place .         the old wizard tower .  robert dearheart used it for his first experiments  but it   s a bit too far  and the walls aren   t safe  and if you stay in there for more than a day at a time  you go mad .  it   s all the old spells that got into the stones .      there was silence  and then they heard moist say  in a slightly strangled voice     if you could get onto the grand trunk tomorrow  is there anything you could do to slow it down .         yes  but we can   t     said undecided adrian .      yes  but if you could .         well  there   s something we   ve been thinking about       said mad al .     it   s very crude .         will it knock out a tower .     said moist .      should we be telling him about this .     said sane alex .      have you ever met anyone else that killer had a good word for .     said undecided adrian .     in theory  it could knock out every tower  mr .  moist .         are you insane as well as mad .     said sane alex .     he   s government .         every tower on the trunk .     said moist .      yep .  in one go     said mad al .     it   s pretty crude .         really every tower .     said moist again .      maybe not every tower  if they catch on     mad al admitted  as if less than wholesale destruction was something to be mildly ashamed of .     but plenty .  even if they cheat and carry it to the next tower on horseback .  we call it   the woodpecker .         the woodpecker .         no  not like that .  you need  sort of  more of a pause for effect  like   the woodpecker .            the woodpecker     said moist  more slowly .      you   ve got it .  but we can   t get it onto the trunk .  they   re on to us .         supposing i could get it onto the trunk .     said moist  staring at the lights .  the towers themselves were quite invisible now .      you .  what do you know about clacks codes .     said undecided adrian .      i treasure my ignorance     said moist .     but i know about people .  you think about being cunning with codes .  i just think about what people see        they listened .  they argued .  they resorted to mathematics  while words sailed through the night above them .   and sane alex said     all right  all right .  technically it could work  but the trunk people would have to be stupid to let it happen .         but they   ll be thinking about codes     said moist .     and i   m good at making people stupid .  it   s my job .         i thought your job was postmaster     said undecided adrian .      oh  yes .  then it   s my vocation .      the smoking gnu looked at one another .      it   s a totally mad idea     said mad al  grinning .      i   m glad you like it     said moist .      there are times when you just have to miss a night   s sleep .  but ankh morpork never slept  the city never did more than doze  and would wake up around three a . m .  for a glass of water .   you could buy anything in the middle of the night .  timber .  no problem .  moist wondered whether there were vampire carpenters  quietly making vampire chairs .  canvas .  there was bound to be someone in a city who   d wake up in the wee small hours for a wee and think  what i could really do with right now is one thousand square yards of medium grade canvas .  and  down by the docks  there were chandlers open to deal with the rush .   there was a steady drizzle when they left for the tower .  moist drove the cart  with the others sitting on the load behind him and bickering over trigonometry .  moist tried not to listen  he got lost when math started to get silly .   killing the grand trunk   oh  the towers would be left standing  but it would take months to repair them all .  it   d bring the company down .  no one would get hurt  the gnu said .  they meant the men in the towers .   the trunk had become a monster  eating people .  bringing it down was a beguiling idea .  the gnu were full of ideas for what could replace it   faster  cheaper  easier  streamlined  using imps specially bred for the job     but something irked moist .  gilt had been right  damn him .  if you wanted to get a message five hundred miles very  very fast  the trunk was the way to do it .  if you wanted to wrap it in a ribbon  you needed the post office .   he liked the gnu .  they thought in a refreshingly different way  whatever curse hung around the stones of the old tower surely couldn   t affect minds like theirs  because they were inoculated against madness by being a little bit crazy all the time .  the clacks signalers  all along the trunk  were   a different kind of people .  they didn   t just do their job  they lived it .   but moist kept thinking of all the bad things that could happen without the semaphore .  oh  they used to happen before the semaphore  of course  but that wasn   t the same thing at all .   he   d left them sawing and hammering in the stone tower  and headed back to the city  deep in thought .       chapter      the edge of the envelope      in which we learn the theory of baize space      devious collabone     the grand trunk burns      so sharp you   ll cut yourself     finding miss dearheart      igor moveth on     a theory of disguise         let this moment never end        a brush with the trunk      the big sail unfurls     the message is received      mustrum ridcully  archchancellor of unseen university  leveled his cue and took careful aim .   the white ball hit a red ball  which rolled gently into a pocket .  this was harder than it looked  because more than half of the snooker table served as the archchancellor   s filing system   and  indeed  to get to the hole the ball had to pass through several piles of paperwork  a tankard  a skull with a dribbly candle on it  and a lot of pipe ash .  it did so .      well done  mr .  stibbons     said ridcully .      i call it baize space     said ponder stibbons proudly .   every organization needs at least one person who knows what   s going on and why it   s happening and who   s doing it  and at uu this role was filled by stibbons  who often wished it wasn   t .  right now he was present in his position as head of inadvisably applied magic  and his long term purpose was to see that his department   s budget went through on the nod .  to this end  therefore  a bundle of thick pipes led from under the heavy old billiard table  out through a hole in the wall and across the lawn  and into the high energy magic building  where   he sighed   this little trick was taking up forty percent of the rune time of hex  the university   s thinking engine .      good name     said ridcully  lining up another shot .      as in phase space .     said ponder hopefully .     when a ball is just about to encounter an obstacle that is not another ball  you see  hex moves it into a theoretical parallel dimension where there is unoccupied flat surface  and maintains speed and drag until it can be brought back to this one .  it really is a most difficult and intricate piece of unreal time spell casting           yes  yes  very good     said ridcully .     was there something else  mr .  stibbons .      ponder looked at his clipboard .     there   s a polite letter from lord vetinari asking on behalf of the city whether the university might consider including in its intake  oh  twenty five percent of less able students  sir .      ridcully potted the black through a heap of university directives .      can   t have a bunch of grocers and butchers telling a university how to run itself  stibbons .     he said firmly  lining up on a red .     thank them for their interest and tell them we   ll continue to take one hundred percent of complete and utter dullards  as usual .  take    em in dull  turn    em out sparklin     that   s always been the uu way .  anythin    else .         just this message for the big race tonight  archchancellor .         oh  yes  that thing .  what should i do  mr .  stibbons .  i hear there   s heavy betting on the post office .         yes  archchancellor .  people say the gods are on the side of mr .  lipwig .         are they betting .     said ridcully  watching with satisfaction as the ball rematerialized on the other side of a neglected ham sandwich .      i don   t think so  sir .  he can   t possibly win .         was he the fella who rescued the cat .         that was him  sir  yes     said ponder .      good chap .  what do we think of the grand trunk .  bunch of bean crushers  i heard .  been killin    people on those towers of theirs .  man in the pub told me he heard the ghosts of dead signalers haunt the trunk .  i   ll try for the pink .         yes  i   ve heard that  sir .  i think it   s an urban myth     said ponder .      they travel from one end of the trunk to the other  he said .  not a bad way to spend eternity  mark you .  there   s some splendid scenery up in the mountains .      the archchancellor paused  and his big face screwed up in thought .      haruspex   s directory of varying dimensions     he said at last .      pardon  archchancellor .         that   s the message     said ridcully .     no one said it had to be a letter  eh .     he waved a hand over the tip of the cue  which grew a powdering of fresh chalk .     give them each a copy of the new edition .  send    em to our man in genua   what   s his name  thingummy  got a funny name   show him the old alma pater is thinkin    of him .         that   s devious h .  collabone  sir .  he   s studying oyster communications in a low intensity magical field for his b .  thau .         good gods  can they communicate .     said ridcully .      apparently  archchancellor  although thus far they   re refusing to talk to him .         why   d we send him all the way out there .         devious collabone  archchancellor .     ponder prompted .     remember .  with the terrible halitosis .         oh  you mean dragonbreath collabone .     said ridcully  as realization dawned .     the one who could blow a hole in a silver plate .         yes  archchancellor     said ponder patiently .  mustrum ridcully always liked to triangulate in on new information from several positions .     you said that out in the swamps no one would notice .  if you remember  we allowed him to take a small omniscope .         did we .  far thinking of us .  call him up right now and tell him what   s going on  will you .         yes  archchancellor .  in fact  i   ll leave it a few hours  because it   s still nighttime in genua .         that   s only their opinion     said ridcully  sighting again .     do it now  man .         fire from the sky     everyone knew that the top half of the towers rocked as the messages flew along the trunk .  one day  someone was going to do something about it .  and all old signalers knew that if the connecting rod operating the shutters on the down line was pushed up to open them on the same blink as the connecting rod on the up line was pulled down to close the shutters on the other side of the tower  the tower lurched .  it was being pushed from one side and pulled from the other  which would have roughly the same effect as a column of marching soldiers could have on a bridge .  that wasn   t too much of a problem  unless it happened again and again so that the rocking would build up to a dangerous level .  but how often would that happen .   every time the woodpecker arrived at your tower  that was how often .  and it was like an illness that could only attack the weak and sick .  it wouldn   t have attacked the old trunk  because the old trunk was too full of tower captains who   d shut down instantly and strip the offending message out of the drum  secure in the knowledge that their actions would be judged by superiors who knew how a tower worked and would have done the same thing themselves .   it would work against the new trunk  because there weren   t enough of those captains now .  you did what you were told or you didn   t get paid  and if things went wrong it wasn   t your problem .  it was the fault of whatever idiot has accepted this message for sending in the first place .  no one cared about you  and everyone at headquarters was an idiot .  it wasn   t your fault  no one listened to you .  headquarters had even started an employee of the month scheme to show how much they cared .  that was how much they didn   t care .   and today you   d been told to shift code as fast as possible  and you didn   t want to be the one accused of slowing the system down  so you watched the next tower in line until your eyes watered and you hit keys like a man tap dancing on hot rocks .   one after another  the towers failed .  some burned when the shutter boxes broke free and smashed on the cabin roofs  spilling blazing oil .  there was no hope of fighting fire in a wooden box sixty feet up in the air  you slid down the suicide line and legged it to a safe distance to watch the show .   fourteen towers were burning before someone took their hands off the keys .  and then what .  you   d been given orders .  there were to be no   repeat  no   messages on the trunk while this message was being sent .  what did you do next .   moist awoke  the grand trunk burning in his head .   the smoking gnu wanted to break it down and pick up the pieces  and he could see why .  but it wouldn   t work .  somewhere on the line there was going to be one inconvenient engineer who   d risk his job to send a message ahead saying     it   s a killer  shift it slowly     and that would be that .  oh  it might take a day or two to get the thing to genua  but they had weeks to work with .  and someone else  too  would be smart enough to compare the message with what had been sent by the first tower .  gilt would wriggle out of it   no  he   d storm out of it .  the message had been tampered with  he   d say  and he   d be right .  there had to be another solution .   the gnu were on to something  though .  changing the message was the answer  if only he could do it the right way .   moist awoke .  he was at his desk  and someone had put a pillow under his head .   when was the last time he   d slept in a decent bed .  oh  yes  the night mr .  pump had caught him .  he   d spent a couple of hours in a rented bed that had a mattress that didn   t actually move and wasn   t full of rocks .  bliss .   his immediate past life scampered before his eyes .  he groaned .      good morning  mr .  lipvig     said mr .  pump from the corner .     your razor is sharp  the kettle is hot  and i am sure a cup of tea is on the way .         what time is it .         noon  mr .  lipvig .  you did not get in until dawn     the golem added reproachfully .   moist groaned again .  six hours to the race .  and then so many pigeons would come home to roost it   d be like an eclipse .      there is much excitement     said the golem  as moist shaved .     it has been agreed that the starting line will be in sator square        moist stared at his reflection  barely listening .  he always raised the stakes  automatically .  never promise to do the possible .  anyone could do the possible .  you should promise to do the impossible  because sometimes the impossible was possible  if you could find the right way  and at least you could often extend the limits of the possible .  and if you failed  well  it had been impossible .   but he   d gone too far this time .  oh  it   d be no great shame to admit that a coach and horses couldn   t travel at a thousand miles an hour  but gilt would strut about it and the post office would remain just a little  old fashioned thing  behind the times  small  unable to compete .  gilt would find some way to hold on to the grand trunk  cutting even more corners  killing people out of greed        are you all right  mr .  lipvig .     said the golem behind him .   moist stared into his own eyes  and what flickered in the depths .   oh  boy .      you have cut yourself  mr .  lipvig     said mr .  pump .     mr .  lipvig .      shame i missed my throat  moist thought .  but that was a secondary thought  edging past the big dark one now unfolding in the mirror .   look into the abyss and you   ll see something growing  reaching toward the light .  it whispered  do this .  this will work .  trust me .   oh  boy .  it   s a plan that will work  moist thought .  it   s simple and deadly  like a razor .  but it   d need an unprincipled man to even think about it .   no problem there  then .   i   ll kill you  mr .  gilt .  i   ll kill you in our special way  the way of the weasel and cheat and liar .  i   ll take away everything but your life .  i   ll take away your money  your reputation  and your friends .  i   ll spin words around you until you   re cocooned in them .  i   ll leave you nothing  not even hope     he carefully finished shaving  and wiped the remnant of the foam off his chin .  there was not  in truth  that much blood .      i think i could do with a hearty breakfast  mr .  pump     he said .     and then i have a few things to do .  in the meantime  can you please find me a broomstick .  a proper birch besom .  and then paint some stars on the handle .         the makeshift counters were crowded when moist came down  but the bustle stopped when he entered the hall .  then a cheer went up .  he nodded and waved  and was immediately surrounded by people waving envelopes .  he did his best to sign them all .      a lot o    extra mail for genua  sir .     mr .  groat exulted  pushing his way through the crowd .     never seen a day like it  never .         jolly good  well done     moist murmured .      and the mail for the gods has gone right up  too .     groat continued .      pleased to hear it .  mr .  groat     said moist .      we   ve got the first sto lat stamps  sir .     said stanley  waving a couple of sheets above his head .     the early sheets are covered in flaws  sir .         i   m very happy for you     said moist .     but i   ve got to go and prepare a few things .         aha  yes .     said mr .  groat  winking .        a few things     eh .  just as you say  sir .  stand aside  please  postmaster coming through .      groat more or less pushed customers out of the way as moist  trying to avoid the people who wanted him to kiss babies or were trying to grab a scrap of his suit for luck  made it out into the fresh air .   then he kept to the back streets  and found a place that did a very reasonable double sausage  egg  bacon  and fried slice  in the hope that food could replace sleep .   it was all getting out of hand .  people were putting out bunting and setting up stalls in sator square .  the huge floating crowd that was the street population of ankh morpork ebbed and flowed around the city  and tonight it would contract to form a mob in the square  and could be sold things .   finally he plucked up his courage and headed for the golem trust .  it was closed .  a bit more graffiti had been added to the strata that now covered the boarded up window .  it was just above knee level and said  in crayon  golms are made of poo .  it was good to see the fine old traditions of idiot bigotry being handed down in a no good at all kind of way .   dolly sisters  he thought wildly  staying with an aunt .  did she ever mention the aunt   s name .   he ran in that direction .   dolly sisters had once been a village  before the sprawl had rolled over it  its residents still considered themselves apart from the rest of the city  with their own customs   dog turd monday  up needles all   and almost their own language .  moist didn   t know it at all .  he pushed his way through the narrow lanes  looking around desperately for   what .  a column of smoke .   actually  that wasn   t a bad idea     he reached the house eight minutes later  and hammered on the door .  to his relief  she opened it  and stared at him .   she said     how .      he said     tobacconists .  not many women around here have a hundred a day habit .         well  what do you want  mister clever .         if you help me  i can take gilt for everything he   s got     said moist .     help me .  please .  on my honor as a totally untrustworthy man .      that at least got a brief smile  to be replaced almost immediately by the default expression of deep suspicion .  then some inner struggle resolved itself .      you   d better come into the parlor     she said  opening the door all the way .   that room was small  dark  and crowded with respectability .  moist sat on the edge of a chair  trying not to disturb anything  while he strained to hear women   s voices along the hallway .  then miss dearheart slipped in and shut the door behind her .      i hope this is all right with your family     said moist .     i           i told them we were courting     said miss dearheart .     that   s what parlors are for .  the tears of joy and hope in my mother   s eyes were a sight to see .  now  what do you want .         tell me about your father     said moist .     i   ve got to know how the grand trunk was taken over .  have you still got any paperwork .         it won   t do any good .  a lawyer looked at them and said it would be very hard to make a case           i intend to appeal to a higher court     said moist .      i mean  we can   t prove a lot of things  not actually prove       miss dearheart protested .      i don   t have to     said moist .      the lawyer said it would take months and months of work to       she went on  determined to find a snag .      i   ll make someone else pay for it     said moist .     have you got books .  ledgers .  anything like that .         what are you intending to do .     miss dearheart demanded .      it   s better if you don   t know .  it really is .  i know what i   m doing  spike .  but you shouldn   t .         well  there   s a big box of papers     said miss dearheart uncertainly .     i suppose i could just sort of   leave it in here while i   m tidying up           good .         but can i trust you .         on this .  my gods  no .  your father trusted gilt  and look at what happened .  i wouldn   t trust me if i was you .  but i would if i was me .         the funny thing is  mr .  lipwig  that i find myself trusting you all the more when you tell me how untrustworthy you are     said miss dearheart .   moist sighed .     yes  i know  spike .  wretched  isn   t it .  it   s a people thing .  could you fetch the box  please .      she did so  with a puzzled frown .   it took all afternoon  and even then moist wasn   t sure  but he   d filled a small notebook with scribbles .  it was like looking for piranhas in a river choked with weeds .  there were a lot of bones on the bottom .  but  although sometimes you thought you   d glimpsed a flash of silver  you could never be sure you   d seen a fish .  the only way to be sure was to jump in .      by half past four  sator square was packed .   the wonderful thing about the golden suit and the hat with wings was that  if moist took them off  he wasn   t him anymore .  he was just a nondescript person in unmemorable clothes and a face you might vaguely think you   d seen before .   he wandered through the crowd  heading toward the post office .  no one gave him a second glance .  most didn   t bother with a first glance .   in a way he   d never realized until now  he was alone .  he   d always been alone .  it was the only way to be safe .   the trouble was  he missed the golden suit .  everything was an act  really .  but the man in the golden suit was a good act .  he didn   t want to be a person you forgot  someone who was one step above a shadow .  underneath the wing  d hat  he could perform miracles or  at least  make it appear that miracles had been performed  which is nearly as good .   he   d have to perform one in an hour or two  that was certain .   oh well     he went around the back of the post office  and was about to slip inside when a figure in the shadow said     pissed .         i suspect you meant    psst    .     said moist .  sane alex stepped out of the shadows  he was wearing his old grand trunk donkey jacket and a huge helmet with horns on .      we   re running slow with the canvas       he began .      why the helmet .     said moist .      it   s a disguise     said alex .      a big horned helmet .         yes .  it makes me so noticeable that no one will suspect i   m trying not to be noticed  so they won   t bother to notice me .         only a very intelligent man would think of something like that     said moist carefully .     what   s happening .         we need more time     said alex .      what .  the race starts at six .         it won   t be dark enough .  we won   t be able to get the sails up until half past at least .  we   ll be spotted if we poke our head over the parapet before then .         oh  come on .  the other towers are too far away .         people on the road aren   t     said alex .      blast .     moist had forgotten about the road .  all it would take later was someone saying he   d seen people on the old wizarding tower        listen  we   ve got it all ready to raise     said alex  watching his face .     we can work fast when we   re up there .  we just need half an hour of darkness  maybe a few minutes more .      moist bit his lip .     okay .  i can do that  i think .  now get back there and help them .  but don   t start until i get there  understand .  trust me .      i   m saying that a lot  he thought after the man had hurried away .  i just hope they will .   he went up to his office .  the golden suit was on its hanger .  he put it on .   there was work to do .  it was dull  but it had to be done .  so he did it .   at half past five the floorboards creaked as mr .  pump walked into the room  dragging a broomstick behind him .      soon it will be time for the race  mr .  lipvig     he said .      i must finish a few things     said moist .     there   s letters here from builders and architects  oh  and someone wants me to cure their warts   i really have to deal with the paperwork  mr .  pump .         in the privacy of reacher gilt   s kitchen  igor very carefully wrote a note .  there were niceties to be observed  after all .  you didn   t just leg it like a thief in the night .  you tidied up  made sure the larder was stocked  washed the dishes  and took exactly what you were owed from the petty cash box .   shame  really .  it had been a pretty good job .  gilt hadn   t expected him to do much  and igor had enjoyed terrorizing the other servants .  most of them  anyway .      it   s so sad you   re going  mr .  igor     said mrs .  glowbury  the cook .  she dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief .     you   ve been a real breath of fresh air .         can   t be helped  mrthth glowbury     said igor .     i shall mithth your thteak and kidney pie  and no mithtake .  it doth my heart to good to thee a woman who can really make thomething out of leftoverth .         i   ve knitted you this  mr .  igor     said the cook  hesitantly proffering a small  soft package .  igor opened it with care and unfolded a red and white striped balaclava .      i thought it would help keep your bolt warm     said mrs .  glowbury  blushing .   igor agonized for a moment .  he liked and respected the cook .  he   d never seen a woman handle sharp knives so skillfully .  sometimes you had to forget the code of the igors .      mrthth glowbury  you did thay you had a thithter in quirm .     he said .      that   s right  mr .  igor .         now would be a very good time for you to go and vithit her     said igor firmly .     do not athk me why .  goodbye  dear mrthth glowbury .  i thall remember your liver with fondnethth .         now it was ten minutes to six .      if you leave now  mr .  lipvig  you will be just in time for the race     the golem rumbled from the corner .      this is work of civic importance  mr .  pump     said moist severely  reading another letter .     i am showing rectitude and attention to duty .         yes  mr .  lipvig .      he let it go on until ten minutes past the hour  because it   d take five minutes to get to the square  at a nonchalant saunter .  with the golem lumbering beside him  in something approaching the antithesis of either nonchalance or sauntering  he left the post office behind .   the crowd in the square parted at his approach  and there were cheers and some laughter when people saw the broomstick over his shoulder .  it had stars painted on it  therefore it must be a magic broomstick .  of such beliefs are fortunes made .   find the lady  find the lady   there was a science to it  in a way .  of course  it helped if you found out how to hold three cards in a loose stack  that was really the key .  moist had learned to be good at that  but he had found mere mechanical tricks a bit dull  a bit beneath him .  there were other ways  ways to mislead  to distract  to anger .  anger was always good .  angry people made mistakes .   there was a space in the center of the square  around the stagecoach on which leadpipe jim sat proudly .  the horses gleamed  the coachwork sparkled in the torchlight .  but the group standing around the coach sparkled rather less .   there were a couple of people from the trunk  several wizards  and  of course  otto chriek the iconographer .  they turned and welcomed moist with expressions ranging from relief to deep suspicion .      we were considering disqualification  mr .  lipwig     said ridcully  looking severe .   moist handed the broom to mr .  pump .     i do apologize  archchancellor     he said .     i was checking some stamp designs and completely lost track of time .  oh  good evening  professor pelc .      the professor of morbid bibliomancy gave him a big grin and held up a jar .     and professor goitre     he said .     the old chap thought he   d like to see what all the fuss is about .         and this is mr .  pony of the grand trunk     said ridcully .  moist shook hands with the engineer .     mr .  gilt not with you .     he said  winking .      he   s  er  watching from his coach     said the engineer  looking nervously at moist .      well  since you are both here  mr .  stibbons will hand you both a copy of the message     said the archchancellor .     mr .  stibbons .      two packages were handed over .  moist undid his  and burst out laughing .      but it   s a book .     said mr .  pony .     it   ll take all night to code .  and there   s diagrams .      okay  let   s dance  thought moist  and moved like a cobra .  he snatched the book from the startled pony  thumbed through it quickly  grabbed a handful of pages and ripped them out  to a gasp from the crowd .      there you are  sir     he said  handing the pages over .     there is your message .  pages seventy nine to one hundred twenty eight .  we   ll deliver the rest of the book  and the recipient can put your pages in later  if they arrive .     he was aware of professor pelc glaring at him  and added     and i   m sure it can be repaired very neatly .      it was a stupid gesture  but it was big and loud and funny and cruel  and if moist didn   t know how to get the attention of a crowd  he didn   t know anything .  mr .  pony backed away  clutching the stricken chapter .      i didn   t mean       he tried  but moist interrupted with     after all  we   ve got a big coach for such a small book .         it   s just that pictures take time to code       mr .  pony protested .  he wasn   t used to this sort of thing .  machinery didn   t answer back .   moist allowed a look of genuine concern to cross his face .     yes  that does seem unfair     he said .  he turned to ponder stibbons .     don   t you think that   s unfair  mr .  stibbons .      the wizard looked puzzled .     but once they   ve coded it it   ll only take them a couple of hours to get it to genua .     he said .      nevertheless  i must insist     said moist .     we don   t want an unfair advantage .  stand down  jim     he called up to the coachman .     we   re going to give the clacks a head start .     he turned to ponder and mr .  pony with an expression of innocent helpfulness .     would an hour be all right  gentlemen .      the crowd exploded .  gods  i   m good at this  moist thought .  i want this moment to go on forever        mr .  lipwig .     a voice called out .  moist scanned the faces  and spotted the writer .      ah  miss sacharrisa .  pencil at the ready .         are you seriously telling us you   ll wait while the grand trunk prepares their message .     she said .  she was laughing .      indeed     said moist  grasping the lapels of his gleaming jacket .     we in the post office are fair minded people .  may i take this opportunity to tell you about our new green cabbage stamp  by the way .         surely you   re going too far  mr .  lipwig .         all the way to genua  dear lady .  did i mention the gum is cabbage flavored .      moist couldn   t have stopped himself now for hard money .  this was where his soul lived  dancing on an avalanche  making the world up as he went along  reaching into people   s ears and changing their minds .  for this he offered glass as diamonds  let the find the lady cards fly under his fingers  stood smiling in front of clerks examining fake bills .  this was the feeling he craved  the raw  naked excitement of pushing the envelope     reacher gilt was moving through the crowd like a shark among minnows .  he gave moist a carefully neutral look  and turned to mr .  pony .      is there some problem  gentlemen .     he said .     it   s getting late .      in a silence punctuated by chuckles from the crowd  pony tried to explain  insofar as he now had any grip on what was going on .      i see     said gilt .     you are pleased to make fun of us  mr .  lipwig .  then allow me to say that we of the grand trunk will not take it amiss if you should leave now .  i think we can spare you a couple of hours  eh .         oh  certainly     said moist .     if it will make you feel any better .         indeed it will     said gilt gravely .     it would be best  mr .  lipwig  if you were a long way away from here .      moist heard the tone  because he was expecting it .  gilt was being reasonable and statesmanlike  but his eye was a dark metal ball and there was the harmonic of murder in his voice .  and then gilt said     is mr .  groat well  mr .  lipwig .  i was sorry to hear of the attack .         attack  mr .  gilt .  he was hit by falling timber     said moist .  and that question entitles you to no mercy at all  no matter what .      ah .  then i was misinformed     said gilt .     i shall know not to listen to rumors in future .         i shall pass on your good wishes to mr .  groat     said moist .   gilt raised his hat .     good bye  mr .  lipwig .  i wish you the best of luck in your gallant attempt .  there are some dangerous people on the road .      moist raised his own hat and said     i intend to leave them behind very soon  mr .  gilt .      there  he thought .  we   ve said it all  and the nice lady from the newspaper thinks we   re good chums or  at least  just business rivals being stiffly polite to each other .  let   s spoil the mood .      good bye  ladies and gentlemen     he said .     mr .  pump  be so good as to put the broom on the coach  would you .         broom .     said gilt  looking up sharply .     that broom .  the one with stars on it .  you   re taking a broomstick .         yes  it will come in handy if we break down     said moist .      i protest  archchancellor .     said gilt  spinning around .     this man intends to fly to genua .         i have no such intention .     said moist .     i resent the allegation .         is this why you appear so confident .     snarled gilt .  and it was a snarl  there and then  a little sign of a crack appearing .   a broomstick could travel fast enough to blow your ears off .  it wouldn   t need too many towers to break down  and heavens knew they broke down all the time  for a broomstick to beat the clacks to genua  especially since it could fly directly and wouldn   t have to follow the big dog leg the coach road and the grand trunk took .  the trunk would have to be really unlucky  and the person flying the broom would be really frozen and probably really dead  but even in a day a broomstick could fly from ankh morpork to genua .  that might just do it .   gilt   s face was a mask of glee .  now he knew what moist intended .   round and round she goes  and where she stops  nobody knows     it was the heart of any scam or fiddle .  keep the punter uncertain  or  if he is certain  make him certain of the wrong thing .      i demand that no broomstick is taken by the coach .     said gilt to the archchancellor  which was not a good move .  you didn   t demand anything from wizards .  you requested .     if mr .  lipwig is not confident in his equipment     gilt went on     i suggest he concedes right now .         we   ll be traveling alone on some dangerous roads     said moist .     a broomstick might be essential .         however  i am forced to agree with this   gentleman     said ridcully  with some distaste .     it would not look right  mr .  lipwig .      moist threw up his hands .     as you wish  sir  of course .  it is a blow .  may i request even handed treatment  though .         your meaning .     said the wizard .      there is a horse stationed at each tower to be used when the tower breaks down     said moist .      that is normal practice .     snapped gilt .      only in the mountains     said moist calmly .     and even then only in the most isolated towers .  but today  i suspect  there   s one at every tower .  it   s a pony express  archchancellor  apologies to mr .  pony .  they could easily beat our coach without sending a word of code .         you can   t possibly be suggesting that we   d take a message all the way on horseback .     said gilt .      you were suggesting i   d fly     said moist .     if mr .  gilt is not confident in his equipment  archchancellor  i suggest he concedes now .      and there it was  a shadow on gilt   s face .  he was more than just irate now  he   d passed into the calm  limpid waters of utter  visceral fury .      so let   s agree that this isn   t a test of horses against broomsticks     said moist .     it   s stagecoach against clacks tower .  if the stage breaks down  we repair the stage .  if a tower breaks down  you repair the tower .         that seems fair  i must say     said ridcully .     and i so rule .  however  i must take mr .  lipwig aside to issue a word of warning .      the archchancellor put his arm around moist   s shoulders and led him around the coach .  then he leaned down until their faces were a few inches apart .      you are aware  are you  that painting a few stars on a perfectly ordinary broomstick doesn   t mean it will get airborne .     he said .   moist looked into a pair of milky blue eyes that were as innocent as a child   s  particularly a child who is trying hard to look innocent .      my goodness  doesn   t it .     he said .   the wizard patted him on the shoulder .     best to leave things as they are  i feel     he said happily .   gilt smiled at moist as they returned .   it was just too much to resist  so moist didn   t .  raise the stakes .  always push your luck  because no one else would push it for you .      would you care for a little personal wager  mr .  gilt .     he said .     just to make it   interesting .      gilt handled it well  if you couldn   t read the tells  the little signs        dear me  mr .  lipwig  do the gods approve of gambling .     he said  and gave a short laugh .      what is life but a lottery  mr .  gilt .     said moist .     shall we say   one hundred thousand dollars .      that did it .  that was the last straw .  he saw something snap inside reacher gilt .      one hundred thousand .  where would you lay your hands on that kind of money  lipwig .         oh  i just place them together  mr .  gilt .  doesn   t everyone know that .     said moist  to general amusement .  he gave the chairman his most insolent smile .     and where will you lay your hands on one hundred thousand dollars .         hah .  i accept the wager .  we shall see who laughs tomorrow     said gilt bluntly .      i   ll look forward to it     said moist .   and now i have you in the hollow of my hand  he thought to himself .  the hollow of my hand .  you   re enraged now .  you   re making wrong decisions .  you   re walking the plank .   he climbed up onto the coach and turned to the crowd .     genua  ladies and gentlemen .  genua or bust .         someone will .     yelled a wag in the crowd .  moist bowed and  as he straightened up  looked into the face of adora belle dearheart .      will you marry me  miss dearheart .     he shouted .   there was an    oooh    from the crowd  and sacharissa turned her head like a cat seeking the next mouse .  what a shame the paper had only one front page  eh .   miss dearheart blew a smoke ring .      not yet     she said calmly .  this got a mixture of cheers and boos .   moist waved  jumped down beside the driver  and said     hit it  jim .      jim cracked his whip for the sound of the thing  and the coach moved away amid cheering .  moist looked back  and made out mr .  pony pushing determinedly through the crowd in the direction of the tump tower .   then he sat back and looked at the streets  in the light of the coach lamps .   pehaps it was the gold working its way in from outside .  he could feel something filling him  like a mist .  when he moved his hand  he was sure that it left a trail of flecks in the air .  he was still flying .      jim  do i look all right .     he said .      can   t see much of you in this light  sir     said the coachman .     can i ask a question .         go ahead  please .         why   d you give those bastards just those middle pages .         two reasons  jim .  it makes us look good and makes them look like whiny kids .  and the other is  it   s the bit with all the color illustrations .  i hear it takes ages to code one of those .         you   re so sharp you   ll cut yourself  mr .  lipwig .  eh .  damn straight .         drive like the blazes  jim .         oh  i know how to give them a show  sir  you can bank on it .  hyah .     the whip cracked again  and the sound of hooves bounced off the buildings .      six horses .     said moist  as they rattled up broad way .      aye  sir .  might as well make a name for myself  sir     said the coachman .      slow down a bit when you get to the old wizard tower  will you .  i   ll get off there .  did you get some guards .         four of them  mr .  lipwig     jim announced .     lying low inside .  men of repute and integrity  known    em since we were lads  nosher harry  skullbreaker tapp  grievous bodily harmsworth  and joe    no nose    tozer .  they   re mates  sir  don   t you worry  and they   re looking forward to a little holiday in genua .         yeah  we   ve all got our buckets and spades     growled a voice from inside .      i   d rather have them than a dozen watchmen     said jim happily .   the coach rattled on  leaving the outlying suburbs behind .  the road under the wheels became rougher  but the coach swung and danced along on its steel springs .      after you   ve dropped me off you can rein them in a bit .  no need to rush  jim     said moist after a while .   in the glow of the coach lamps moist saw jim   s red face glow with guile .      it   s your plan  eh  sir .         it   s a wonderful plan  jim .     said moist .  and i shall have to make sure it doesn   t work .      the lights of the coach disappeared  leaving moist in chilly darkness .  in the distance  the faintly glowing smokes of ankh morpork made a great  trailing mushroom of a cloud that blotted out the stars .  things rustled in the bushes  and a breeze wafted the scent of cabbages over the endless fields .   moist waited untl he got some night vision .  the tower appeared  a column of night without stars .  all he had to do was find his way through the dense  brambly  root knotted woodland     he made a noise like an owl .  since moist was no ornithologist  he did this by saying    woo woo .      the woodland exploded with owl hoots .  these were owls that roosted in an old wizarding tower  which drove you mad in a day .  it had no obvious effect on them except that the noises they made included every possible sound that could be made by a living or even dying creature .  there was definitely some elephant in there  and possibly some hyena  too  with a hint of bedspring .   when the din had died down  a voice from a few feet away whispered     all right  mr .  lipwig .  it   s me  adrian .  grab my hand and let   s go before the others start fighting again .         fighting .  what about .         they drive each other up the wall .  feel this rope .  can you feel it .  right .  you can move fast  we scouted out a trail and strung the rope        they hurried through the trees .  you had to be really close to the tower to see the glow coming through the ruined doorway at the base .  undecided adrian had fixed some of his little cold lights up the inner wall  and stones moved under moist   s feet as he scrambled to the top .  he paid them no attention  but ran up the spiral stair so fast that when he reached the top he spun .   mad al caught him by the shoulders .     no rush     he said cheerfully     we   ve got ten minutes to go .         we   d have been ready twenty minutes ago if somebody hadn   t lost the hammer     muttered sane alex  tightening a wire .      what .  i put it in the tool box  didn   t i .     said mad al .      in the spanner drawer .         so .         who in their right mind would look for a hammer in the spanner drawer .      down below  the owls started up again .      look     said moist quickly     that   s not important  is it .  right now .         this man     said sane alex  pointing an accusing wrench     this man is mad .         not as mad as someone who keeps his screws neatly by size in jam jars     said mad al .      that counts as sane .     said alex hotly .      but everyone knows rummaging is half the fun .  besides           it   s done     said undecided adrian .   moist looked up .  the gnu   s clacks machine rose up into the night  just as it had done on the post office roof .  behind it  in the direction of the city  an h shaped structure climbed even further .  it looked a little like a ship   s mast  an effect maybe caused by the wires that steadied it .  they rattled in the faint breeze .      you must have upset someone     adrian went on  while the other two settled down a bit .     a message was sent through twenty minutes ago  from gilt himself .  he said the big one will go through duplex  great care must be taken not to change it in any way  there is to be no other traffic at all until there   s a restart message from gilt  and he   ll personally sack the entire staff of any tower that does not strictly follow those instructions .         it just goes to show  the grand trunk is a people company     said moist .   undecided adrian and mad alex walked over to the big frame and began to unwind some ropes from their cleats .   oh well  thought moist  now for it        there   s just one alteration to the plan     he said  and took a breath .     we   re not sending the woodpecker .         what do you mean .     said adrian  dropping his rope .     that was the plan .         it   ll destroy the trunk     said moist .      yes  that was the plan  sure enough     said al .     gilt   s as good as painted    kick me    on his pants .  look  it   s falling down of its own accord anyway  okay .  it was an experiment in the first place .  we can rebuild it faster and better .         how .     said moist .     where will the money come from .  i know a way to destroy the company but leave the towers standing .  they were stolen from the dearhearts and their partners .  i can give them back .  but the only way to build a better line of towers is to leave the old ones standing .  the trunk   s got to earn .         that   s the sort of thing gilt would say .     snapped al .      and it   s true     said moist .     alex  you   re sane  tell the man .  keep the trunk operating  replace one tower at a time  never dropping any code .     he waved a hand toward the darkness .     the people out on the towers  they want to be proud of what they do  yes .  it   s tough work and they don   t get paid enough  but they live to shift code  right .  the company   s running them into the ground but they still shift code .      adrian tugged at his rope .     hey  the canvas is stuck     he announced to the tower in general .     it must have been caught up when we furled it           oh  i   m sure the woodpecker will work     said moist  plunging on .     it might even damage enough towers for long enough .  but gilt will twist his way out of it .  do you understand .  he   ll shout about sabotage .         so what .     said mad al .     we   ll have this lot back on the cart in an hour and no one will know we were ever here .         i   ll climb up and free it  shall i .     said undecided adrian  shaking the canvas .      i said it won   t work     said moist  waving him away .     look  mr .  al  this isn   t going to be settled by fire .  it   s going to be settled with words .  we   ll tell the world what happened to the trunk .         you   ve been talking to killer about that .     said alex .      yes     said moist .      but you can   t prove anything     said alex .     we heard it was all legal .         i doubt it     said moist .     but that doesn   t matter .  i don   t have to prove anything .  i said this is about words  and how you can twist them  and how you can spin them in people   s heads so that they think the way you want them to .  we   ll send a message of our own  and do you know what .  the boys in the towers will want to send it  and when people know what it says they   ll want to believe it  because they   ll want to live in a world where it   s true .  it   s my words against gilt   s  and i   m better at them than he is .  i can take him down with a sentence  mr .  mad  and leave every tower standing .  and no one will ever know how it was done        there was a brief exclamation behind them  and the sound of canvas unrolling quite fast .      trust me     said moist .      we   ll never get another chance like this     said mad al .      exactly .     said moist .      one man has died for every three towers standing     said mad al .     did you know that .         you know they   ll never really die while the trunk is alive     said moist .  it was a wild shot  but it hit something  he sensed it .  he rushed on     it lives while the code is shifted  and they live with it  always going home .  will you stop that .  you can   t stop it .  i won   t stop it .  but i can stop gilt .  trust me .      the canvas hung like a sail  as if someone intended to launch the tower .  it was eighty feet high and thirty feet wide and moved a little in the wind .      where   s adrian .     said moist .   they looked at the sail .  they rushed to the edge of the tower .  they looked down into darkness .      adrian .     said mad al uncertainly .   a voice from below said     yes .         what are you doing .         just  you know   hanging around .  and an owl has just landed on my head .      there was a small tearing noise beside moist .  sane alex had cut a hole in the canvas .      here it comes .     he reported .      what .     said moist .      the message .  they   re sending from tower   .  take a look       alex said  backing away .   moist peered through the slit  back toward the city .  in the distance  a tower was sparkling .   mad al strode over to the half sized clacks array and grabbed the handles .      all right  mr .  lipwig  let   s hear your plan .     he said .     alex  give me a hand .  adrian  just   hang on  all right .         it   s trying to push a dead mouse in my ear     said a reproachful voice from below .   moist shut his eyes  lined up the thoughts that had been buzzing for hours  and began to speak .   behind and above him  the huge expanse of canvas was just enough to block the line of sight between the two distant towers .  in front of him  the smoking gnu   s half sized tower was just the right size to look  to the next tower in line  like a bigger tower a long way off .  at night all you could see were the lights .   the clacks in front of him shook as the shutters rattled .  and now a new message was dropping across the sky     it was only a few hundred words .  when moist had finished  the clacks rattled out the last few letters and then fell silent .   after a while  moist said     will they pass it along .         oh  yes     said mad al  in a flat voice .     they   ll send it .  you   re sitting up in the tower in the mountains and you get a signal like that .  you   ll get it away and out of your tower as fast as you can .         i don   t know if we ought to shake your hand or throw you off the tower     said sane alex sullenly .     that was evil .  what sort of person could dream up something like that .         me .  now let   s pull adrian up  shall we .     said moist quickly .     and then i   d better get back to the city           an omniscope is one of the most powerful instruments known to magic  and therefore one of the most useless .   it can see everything  with ease .  getting it to see anything is where wonders have to be performed  because there is so much everything   which is to say  everything that can  will  has  should  or might happen in all possible universes   that anything  any previously specified thing  is very hard to find .  before hex had evolved the control thaumarhythms  completing in a day a task that would have taken five hundred wizards at least ten years  omniscopes were used purely as mirrors  because of the wonderful blackness they showed .  this  it turned out  is because    nothing to see    is what most of the universe consists of  and many a wizard has peacefully trimmed his beard while gazing into the dark heart of the cosmos .   there were very few steerable omniscopes .  they took a long time to make and cost a great deal .  and the wizards were not at all keen on making any more .  omniscopes were for them to look at the universe  not for the universe to look back at them .   besides  the wizards did not believe in making life too easy for people .  at least  for people who weren   t wizards .  an omniscope was a rare  treasured  and delicate thing .   but today was a special occasion  and they had thrown open the doors to the richer  cleaner  and more hygienic sections of ankh morpork society .  a long table had been set for second tea .  nothing too excessive   a few dozen roast fowls  a couple of cold salmon  one hundred linear feet of salad bar  a pile of loaves  one or two kegs of beer  and  of course  the chutney  pickle  and relish train  one trolley not being considered big enough .  people had filled their plates and were standing around chatting and  above all  being there .  moist slipped in unnoticed  for now  because people were watching the university   s biggest omniscope .   archchancellor ridcully thumped the side of the thing with his hand  causing it to rock .      it   s still not working  mr .  stibbons .     he bellowed .     here   s that damn enormous fiery eye again .         i   m sure we have the right       ponder began  fiddling with the rear of the big disc .      it   s me  sir  devious collabone  sir     said a voice from the omniscope .  the fiery eye pulled back and was replaced by an enormous fiery nose .     i   m here at the terminal tower  sir  in genua .  sorry about the redness  sir .  i   ve picked up an allergy to seaweed  sir .         hello  mr .  collabone .     yelled ridcully .     how are you .  how   s the              shellfish research       murmured ponder stibbons .         shellfish research comin    along .         not very well  actually  sir  i   ve developed a nasty           good  good .  lucky chap .     ridcully yelled  cupping his hands to increase the volume .     i wouldn   t mind bein    in genua myself at this time of year .  sun  sea  surf  and sand  eh .         actually it   s the wet season  sir  and i   m a bit worried about this fungus that   s growing on the omni           wonderful .     shouted ridcully .     well  i can   t stand here and chew your fat all day .  has anything arrived .  we are agog .         could you just stand back a little bit further  please  mr .  collabone .     said ponder .     and you don   t really need to speak so   loudly  archchancellor .         chap   s a long way away  man .     said ridcully .      not as such  sir     said ponder  with well honed patience .     very well  mr .  collabone  you may proceed .      the crowd behind the archchancellor pressed forward .  mr .  collabone backed away .  this was all a bit too much for a man who spent his days with no one to talk to but bivalves .      er  i   ve had a message by clacks  sir  but       he began .      nothin    from the post office .     said ridcully .      no  sir .  nothing  sir .      there were cheers and boos and general laughter from the crowd .  from his shadowy corner  moist saw lord vetinari  right by the archchancellor .  he scanned the rest of the crowd and spotted reacher gilt  standing off to one side and  surprisingly  not smiling .  and gilt saw him .   one look was enough .  the man wasn   t certain .  not totally certain .   welcome to fear  said moist to himself .  it   s hope  turned inside out .  you know it can   t go wrong  you   re sure it can   t go wrong     but it might .   i   ve got you .   devious collabone coughed .     er  but i don   t think this is the message archchancellor ridcully sent     he said  his voice gone squeaky with nervousness .      what makes you think that  man .         because it says it isn   t     collabone quavered .     it says it   s from dead people           you mean it   s an old message .     said ridcully .      er  no  sir .  er   i   d better read it  shall i .  do you want me to read it .         that   s the point  man .      in the big disc of glass  collabone cleared his throat .      who will listen to the dead .  we who died so that words could fly demand justice now .  these are the crimes of the board of the grand trunk  theft  embezzlement  breach of trust  corporate murder            chapter      deliverance      lord vetinari requests silence     mr .  lipwig comes down      mr .  pump moves on     fooling no one but yourself      the bird     the concludium     freedom of choice    the great hall was in an uproar .  most of the wizards took the opportunity to congregate at the buffet  which was now clear .  if there   s one thing a wizard hates  it   s having to wait while the person in front of them is of two minds about coleslaw .  it   s a salad bar  they say  it   s got the kind of stuff salad bars have  if it was surprising it wouldn   t be a salad bar  you   re not here to look at it .  what do you expect to find .  rhino chunks .  pickled coelacanth .   the lecturer in recent runes ladled more bacon bits into his salad bowl  having artfully constructed buttresses of celery and breastworks of cabbage to increase its depth five times .      any of you fellows know what this is all about .     he said  raising his voice above the din .     seems to be upsetting a lot of people .         it   s this clacks business     said the chair of recent runes .     i   ve never trusted it .  poor collabone .  decent young man in his way .  a good man with a whelk .  seems to be in a spot of bother        it was quite a large spot .  devious collabone was opening and shutting his mouth on the other side of the glass like a stranded fish .   in front of him  mustrum ridcully reddened with anger  his tried and tested approach to most problems .         sorry  sir  but this is what it says and you asked me to read it     collabone protested .     it goes on and on  sir           and that   s what the clacks people gave you .     the archchancellor demanded .     are you sure .         yes  sir .  they did look at me in a funny way  sir  but this is definitely it .  why should i make anything up  archchancellor .  i spend most of my time in a tank  sir .  a boring  boring  lonely tank  sir .         not one more word .     screamed greenyham .     i forbid it .     beside him  mr .  nutmeg had sprayed his drink across several dripping guests .      excuse me .  you forbid  sir .     said ridcully  turning on greenyham in sudden fury .     sir  i am the master of this college .  i will not  sir  be told what to do in my own university .  if there is anything to be forbidden here  sir  i will do the forbidding .  thank you .  go ahead  mr .  collabone .         er  er  er       collabone panted  longing for death .      i said carry on  man .         er  er   yes   there was no safety .  there was no pride .  all there was was money .  everything became money  and money became everything .  money treated us as if we were things  and we died           is there no law in this place .  that is outright slander .     shouted stowley .     it   s a trick of some sort .         by whom  sir .     roared ridcully .     do you mean to suggest that mr .  collabone  a young wizard of great integrity  who i may say is doing wonderful work with snakes              shellfish       murmured ponder stibbons .         shellfish  is playing some kind of joke .  how dare you  sir .  continue  mr .  collabone .         i  i  i           that is an order  dr .  collabone .          er   blood oils the machinery of the grand trunk as willing  loyal people pay with their lives for the board   s culpable stupidity        the hubbub rose again .  moist saw lord vetinari   s gaze traverse the room .  he didn   t duck in time .  the patrician   s stare passed right through him  carrying away who knew what .  an eyebrow raised in interrogation .  moist looked away  and sought out gilt .   he wasn   t there .   in the omniscope  mr .  collabone   s nose now glowed like a beacon .  he struggled  dropping pages  losing his place  but pressing on with the dogged  dull determination of a man who could spend all day watching one oyster .         nothing less than an attempt to blacken our good names in front of the whole city .     stowley was protesting .         unaware of the toll that is being taken .  what can we say of the men that caused this  who sat in comfort around their table and killed us by numbers .  this           i will sue the university .  i will sue the university .     screamed greenyham .  he picked up a chair and hurled it at the omniscope .  halfway to the glass it turned into a small flock of doves  who panicked and soared up to the roof .      oh  please sue the university .     ridcully bellowed .     we   ve got a pond full of people who tried to sue the university           silence     said vetinari .   it wasn   t a very loud word  but it had an effect rather like that of a drop of black ink in a glass of clear water .  the word spread out in coils and tendrils  getting everywhere .  it strangled the noise .   of course  there is always someone not paying attention .     and furthermore     stowley went on  oblivious to the unfolding hush in his own little world of righteous indignation     it   s plain that           i will have silence     vetinari stated .   stowley stopped  looked around  and deflated .  silence ruled .      very good     said vetinari quietly .  he nodded at commander vimes of the watch  who whispered to another watchman  who pushed his way through the crowd and toward the door .   vetinari turned to ridcully .     archchancellor  i would be grateful if you would instruct your student to continue  please .     he went on  in the same calm tone .      certainly .  off you go  professor collabone .  in your own time .         er  er  er  er  it says further on  the men obtained control of the trunk via a ruse known as the double lever  in the main using money entrusted to them by clients who did not suspect that           stop reading that .     greenyham shouted .     this is ridiculous .  it is just slander upon slander .         i   m certain i spoke  mr .  greenyham     said vetinari .   greenyham faltered .      good .  thank you     said vetinari .     these are very serious allegations  certainly .  embezzlement .  murder .  i   m sure that mr .   sorry  professor collabone is a trustworthy man      in the omniscope  devious collabone  unseen university   s newest professor  nodded desperately      who is only reading what has been delivered  so it would appear that they have originated from within your own company .  serious allegations  mr .  greenyham .  made in front of all these people .  are you suggesting i should treat them as some sort of prank .  the city is watching  mr .  greenyham .  oh  mr .  stowley appears to be ill .         this is not the place for       greenyham tried  aware once more of the creaking of ice .      it is the ideal place     said vetinari .     it is public .  in the circumstances  given the nature of the allegations  i   m sure everyone would require that i get to the bottom of them as soon as possible  if only to prove them totally groundless .     he looked around .  there was a chorus of agreement .  even the upper crust loved a show .      what do you say  mr .  greenyham .     said vetinari .   greenyham said nothing .  the cracks were spreading  the ice was breaking up on every side .      very well     said vetinari .  he turned to the figure beside him .      commander vimes  be so kind as to send men to the offices of the grand trunk company  ankh sto associates  sto plains holdings  ankh futures  and particularly to the premises of ankh morpork mercantile credit bank .  inform the manager  mr .  cheeseborough  that the bank is closed for audit and i wish to see him in my office at his earliest convenience .  any person in any of those premises who so much as moves a piece of paper before my clerks arrive will be arrested and held complicit in any or all of such offenses as may be uncovered .  while this is happening  moreover  no person associated with the grand trunk company or any of its employees is to leave this room .         you can   t do that .     greenyham protested weakly  but the fire had drained out of him .  mr .  stowley had collapsed on the floor  with his head in his hands .      can i not .     said vetinari .     i am a tyrant .  it   s what we do .         what is happening .  who am i .  where is this place .     moaned stowley  a man who believed in laying down some groundwork as soon as possible .      but there   s no evidence .  that wizard   s lying .  someone must have been bribed .     greenyham pleaded .  not only had the ice broken up  but he was on the ice floe with a big  hungry walrus .      mr .  greenyham     said lord vetinari     one more uninvited outburst from you and you will be imprisoned .  i hope that is clear .         on what charge .     said greenyham  still managing to find a last reserve of hauteur from somewhere .      there doesn   t have to be one .     robe swirling like the edge of darkness  vetinari swung around to the omniscope and devious collabone  for whom two thousand miles suddenly wasn   t far enough .     continue  professor .  there will be no further interruptions .      moist watched the audience as collabone stuttered and mispronounced his way through the rest of the message .  it dealt with generalities rather than particulars  but there were dates  and names  and thundering denunciations .  there was nothing new  not really new  but it was packaged in fine language and it was delivered by the dead   we who died on the dark towers demand this of you     he ought to be ashamed .   it was one thing to put words in the mouths of the gods  priests did it all the time .  but this  this was a step too far .  you had to be some kind of bastard to think of something like this .   he relaxed a bit .  a fine  upstanding citizen wouldn   t have stooped so low  but he hadn   t got this job because he was a fine  upstanding citizen .  some tasks needed a good  honest hammer .  others needed a twisty corkscrew .   with any luck  he could believe that  if he really tried .      there had been a late fall of snow  and the fir trees around tower     were crusted with white under the hard  bright starlight .   everyone was up there tonight   grandad  roger  big steve oh  wheezy halfsides  who was a dwarf and had to sit on a cushion to reach the keyboards  and princess .   there had been a few muffled exclamations as the message came through .  now there was silence  except for the sighing of the wind .  princess could see people   s breath in the air .  grandad was drumming his fingers on the woodwork .   then wheezy said     was that all real .      the breath clouds got denser .  people were relaxing  coming back to the real world .      you saw the instructions we got     said grandad  staring across the dark forests .     don   t change anything .  send it on  they said .  we sent it on .  we damn well did send it on .         who was it from .     said steve oh .      it doesn   t matter     said grandad .     message comes in  message goes out  message moves on .         yeah  but was it really from       steve oh began .      bloody hell  steve oh  you really don   t know when to shut up  do you .     said roger .      only i heard about tower     where the guys died and the tower sent a distress signal all by itself     mumbled steve oh .  he was fast on the keys  but not knowing when to shut up was only one of his social failings .  in a tower  it could get you killed .      dead man   s handle     said grandad .     you should know that .  if there   s no activity for ten minutes when a signature key is slotted  the drum drops the jacquard into the slot and the counterweight falls  and the tower sends the help sign .     he spoke the words as if reading them from a manual .      yeah  but i heard that in tower    the jacquard was wedged and           i can   t stand this     muttered grandad .     roger  let   s get this tower working again .  we   ve got local signals to send  haven   t we .         sure .  and stuff waiting on the drum     said roger .     but gilt said we weren   t to restart until           gilt can kiss my       grandad began  then remembered the company and finished        donkey .  you read what went through just now .  do you think that bas   that man is still in charge .      princess looked out from the upstream window .            s lit up     she announced .      right .  let   s light up and shift code     grandad growled .     that   s what we do .  and who   s going to stop us .  all those without something to do  get out .  we are running .      princess went out onto the little platform  to be out of the way .  underfoot the snow was like icing sugar  in her nostrils the air was like knives .   when she looked across the mountains  in the direction she   d learned to think of as downstream  she could see that tower     was sending .  at that moment  she heard the thump and click of       s own shutters opening  dislodging snow .  we shift code  she thought  it   s what we do .   up on the tower  watching the starlike twinkle of the trunk in the clear  freezing air  it was being part of the sky .   and she wondered what grandad feared more  that dead clacksmen could send messages to the living  or that they couldn   t .      collabone finished .  then he produced a handkerchief and rubbed away at whatever the green stuff was that had begun to grow on the glass .  this made a squeaking sound .   he peered nervously through the smear .     is that all right  sir .  i   m not in some sort of trouble  am i .     he asked .     only at the moment i think i   m close to translating the mating call of the giant clam           thank you  professor collabone  a good job  well done  that will be all     said archchancellor ridcully coldly .     unhinge the mechanism  mr .  stibbons .      a look of fervid relief passed across devious collabone   s face just before the omniscope went blank .      mr .  pony  you are the chief engineer of the grand trunk  are you not .     said vetinari  before the babble could rise again .   the engineer  suddenly the focus of attention  backed away  waving his hands frantically .     please  your lordship .  i   m just an engineer  i don   t know anything           calm yourself  please .  have you heard that the souls of dead men travel on the trunk .         oh  yes  your lordship .         is it true .         well  er       pony looked around  a hunted man .  he   d got his pink carbon copies  and they would show everyone that he was nothing more than a man who   d tried to make things work  but right now all he could find on his side was the truth .  he took refuge in it .     i can   t see how  but  well   sometimes  when you   re up a tower of a night  and the shutters are rattlin    and the wind   s singing in the rigging  well  you might think it   s true .         i believe there is a tradition called    sending home    .     said lord vetinari .   the engineer looked surprised .     why  yes  sir  but       pony felt he ought to wave a little flag for a rational world  in which  right now  he didn   t have a lot of faith .     the trunk was dark before we ran the message  so i don   t see how the message could have got on           unless  of course  the dead put it there .     said lord vetinari .     mr .  pony  for the good of your soul and  not least  your body  you will go now to the tump tower  escorted by one of commander vimes   s men  and send a brief message to all the towers .  you will obtain the paper tapes  which i believe are known as drum rolls  from all the towers on the grand trunk .  i understand that they show a record of all messages originating at that tower  which cannot be readily altered .         that will take weeks to do  sir .     pony protested .      an early start in the morning would seem in order  then     said lord vetinari .   mr .  pony  who had suddenly spotted that a spell a long way from ankh morpork might be a very healthy option at the moment  nodded and said     right you are  my lord .         the grand trunk will remain closed in the interim     said lord vetinari .      it   s private property .     greenyham burst out .      tyrant  remember     said vetinari almost cheerfully .     but i   m sure that the audit will serve to sort out at least some aspects of this mystery .  one of them  of course  is that mr .  reacher gilt does not seem to be in this room .      every head turned .      perhaps he remembered another engagement .     said lord vetinari .     i think he slipped out some time ago .      it dawned on the directors of the grand trunk that their chairman was absent and  which was worse  they weren   t .  they drew together .      i wonder if  uh  at this point at least we could discuss the matter with you privately  your lordship .     said greenyham .     reacher was not an easy man to deal with  i   m afraid .         not a team player     gasped nutmeg .      who .     said stowley .     what is this place .  who are these people .         left us totally in the dark most of the time       said greenyham .      i can   t remember a thing       said stowley .     i   m not fit to testify  any doctor will tell you           i think i can say on behalf of all of us that we were suspicious of him all along           mind   s a total blank .  not a blessed thing   what   s this thing with fingers on   who am i        lord vetinari stared at the board for five seconds longer than was comfortable  while tapping his chin gently with the knob of his cane .  he smiled faintly .      quite     he said .     commander vimes  i think it would be iniquitous to detain these gentlemen here any longer     he said .  as the faces in front of him relaxed into smiles full of hope  that greatest of all gifts  he added     to the cells with them  commander .  separate cells  if you please .  i shall see them in the morning .  and if mr .  slant comes to see you on their behalf  do tell him i   d like a little chat  will you .      that sounded   good .  moist strolled toward the door  while the hubbub rose  and had almost made it when lord vetinari   s voice came out of the throng like a knife .      leaving so soon  mr .  lipwig .  do wait a moment .  i shall give you a lift back to your famous post office .      for a moment  just a slice of a second  moist contemplated running .  he did not do so .  what would be the point .   the crowd parted hurriedly as lord vetinari headed toward the door  behind him  the watch closed in .   ultimately  there is the freedom to take the consequences .      the patrician leaned back in the leather upholstery as the coach drew away .      what a strange evening  mr .  lipwig     he said .     yes  indeed .      moist  like the suddenly bewildered mr .  stowley  considered that his future happiness lay in saying as little as possible .      yes  sir     he said .      i wonder if that engineer will find any evidence that the strange message was put on the clacks by human hands .     vetinari wondered aloud .      i don   t know  your lordship .         you don   t .         no  sir .         ah     said vetinari .     well  the dead are known to speak  sometimes .  ouija boards and seances and so on .  who can say they wouldn   t use the medium of the clacks .         not me  sir .         and you are clearly enjoying your new career  mr .  lipwig .         yes  sir .         good .  on monday your duties will include the administration of the grand trunk .  it is being taken over by the city .      oh well  so much for future happiness        no  my lord     said moist .   vetinari raised an eyebrow .     there is an alternative  mr .  lipwig .         it really is private property  sir .  it belongs to the dearhearts and the other people who built it .         my  my  how the worm turns     said vetinari .     but the trouble is  you see  they weren   t good at business  only at mechanisms .  otherwise they would have seen through gilt .  the freedom to succeed goes hand in hand with the freedom to fail .         it was robbery by numbers     said moist .     it was find the lady done with ledgers .  they didn   t stand a chance .      vetinari sighed .     you drive a hard bargain  mr .  lipwig .     moist  who wasn   t aware he had tried to drive a bargain at all  said nothing .     oh  very well .  the question of ownership will remain in abeyance for now  until we have plumbed the sordid depths of this affair .  but what i truly meant was that a great many people depend on the trunk for their living .  out of sheer humanitarian considerations  we must do something .  sort things out  postmaster .         but i   m going to have my hands more than full with the post office .     moist protested .      i hope you are .  but  in my experience  the best way to get something done is to give it to someone who is busy     said vetinari .      in that case  i   m going to keep the grand trunk running     said moist .      in honor of the dead  perhaps     said vetinari    yes .  as you wish .  ah  here is your stop .      as the coachman opened the door  lord vetinari leaned toward moist .      oh  and i do suggest you go before dawn and check that everyone   s left the old wizarding tower     he said .      what do you mean  sir .     said moist .  he knew his face betrayed nothing .   vetinari sat back .     well done  mr .  lipwig .         there was a crowd outside the post office  and a cheer went up as moist made his way to the doors .  it was raining now  a gray  sooty drizzle that was little more than fog with a slight weight problem .   some of the staff were waiting inside .  he realized the news hadn   t got around .  even ankh morpork   s permanent rumor mill hadn   t been able to beat him back from the university .      what   s happened  postmaster .     said groat  his hands twisting together .     have they won .         no     said moist  but they picked up the edge in his voice .      have we won .         the archchancellor will have to decide that     said moist .     i suppose we won   t know for weeks .  the clacks is being shut down  though .  i   m sorry  it   s all complicated        he left them standing and staring as he trudged up to his office  where mr .  pump was standing in the corner .      good evening  mr .  lipvig     the golem boomed .   moist sat down and put his head in his hands .  this was victory  but it didn   t feel like it .  it felt like a mess .   the bets .  well  if leadpipe got to genua  you could make a case under the rules that he   d won  but moist had a feeling that all bets were off now .  that meant people would get their money back  at least .   he   d have to keep the trunk going  gods knew how .  he   d sort of promised the gnu  hadn   t he .  and it was amazing how people had come to rely on the clacks .  he wouldn   t know how leadpipe had fared for weeks  and even then it   d only be if the wizards were still cooperative .  it was like having a finger cut off .  but it was a big  cumbersome monster of a thing  too many towers  too many people  too much effort .  there had to be a way of making it better and sleeker and cheaper   or maybe it was something so big that no one could run it at a profit .  maybe it was like the post office  maybe the profit turned up spread around the whole of society .   tomorrow he   d have to take it all seriously .  proper mail runs .  many more staff .  hundreds of things to do  and hundreds of other things to do before you could do those things .  it wasn   t going to be fun anymore  cocking a snook  whatever a snook was  at the big  slow giant .  he   d won  so he   d have to pick up the pieces and make everything work .  and come in here the next day and do it all again .   this wasn   t how it was supposed to end .  you won  and you pocketed the cash and walked away .  that was how the game was supposed to go  wasn   t it .   his eye fell on anghammarad   s message box  on its twisted  corroded strap  and he wished he was at the bottom of the sea .      mr .  lipwig .      he looked up .  drumknott the clerk was standing in the doorway  with another clerk behind him .      yes .         sorry to disturb you  sir     said the clerk .     we   re here to see mr .  pump .  just a minor adjustment  if you don   t mind .         what .  oh .  fine .  whatever .  go ahead .     moist waved a hand vaguely .   the two men walked over to the golem .  there was some muted conversation  and then it knelt down and they unscrewed the top of its head .   moist stared in horror .  he knew it was done  of course  but it was shocking to see it happening .  there was some rummaging around that he couldn   t make out  and then the cranium was replaced  with a little pottery noise .      sorry to have disturbed you  sir     said drumknott  and the clerks left .   mr .  pump stayed on his knees for a moment  and then rose slowly .  the red eyes focused on moist  and the golem stuck out his hand .      i do not know what a pleasure is  but i am sure that if i did  then working with you would have been one     he said .     now i must leave you .  i have another task .         you   re not my  er  parole officer anymore .     said moist  taken aback .      correct .         hold on     said moist  as light dawned .     is vetinari sending you after gilt .         i am not at liberty to say .         he is  isn   t he .  you   re not following me anymore .         i am not following you anymore .         so i   m free to go .         i am not at liberty to say .  good night  mr .  lipvig .     mr .  pump paused at the door .     i am not certain what happiness is  either  mr .  lipvig  but i think   yes  i think i am happy to have met you .      and  ducking to get through the doorway  the golem left .   that only leaves the werewolf  thought part of moist   s mind  faster than light .  and they   re not much good at boats and completely lost when it comes to oceans .  it   s the middle of the night  the watch are running around like madmen  everyone   s busy  i   ve got a bit of cash  and i   ve still got the diamond ring and a deck of cards   who   d notice .  who   d care .  who   d worry .   he could go anywhere .  but that wasn   t really him thinking that  was it   it was just a few old brains cells  running on automatic .  there wasn   t anywhere to go  not anymore .   he walked over to the big hole in the wall and looked down into the hall .  did anyone go home here .  but now the news had got around  and if you wanted any hope of anything delivered anywhere tomorrow  you went to the post office .  it was quite busy  even now .      cup of tea  mr .  lipwig .     said the voice of stanley  behind him .      thank you  stanley     said moist  without looking around .  down below  miss maccalariat was standing on a chair and nailing something to the wall .      everyone says we   ve won  sir     cos the clacks has been shut down     cos the directors are in prison  sir .  they say all mr .  upwright has to do is get there .  but mr .  groat says the bookies probably won   t pay up  sir .  and the king of lancre wants some stamps printed  but it   ll come a bit pricey  sir  since they only write about ten letters a year up there .  still  we   ve showed them  eh  sir .  the post office is back .         it   s some kind of a banner     said moist aloud .      sorry  mr .  lipwig .     said stanley .      er   nothing .  thank you  stanley .  have fun with the stamps .  good to see you standing up so   straight           it   s like having a new life  sir     said stanley .     i   d better go  sir  they need help with the sorting        the banner was crude .  it read  thank you mr .  lipwic .   gloom rolled around moist .  it was always bad after he   d won  but this time was the worst .  for days his mind had been flying and he   d felt alive .  now he felt numb .  they   d put up a banner like that  while he was a liar and a thief .  he   d fooled them all  and there they were  thanking them for fooling him .   a quiet voice from the doorway behind him said     mad al and the boys told me what you did .         oh     said moist  not turning around .  she   ll be lighting a cigarette  he thought .      it wasn   t a nice thing to do     adora belle dearheart went on  in the same level tone .      there wasn   t a nice thing that would work     said moist .      are you going to tell me that the ghost of my brother put the idea in your head .     she said .      no .  i dreamed it up myself     said moist .      good .  if you   d tried that  you   d be limping for the rest of your life  believe me .         thank you     said moist leadenly .     it was just a lie i knew people would want to believe .  just a lie .  it was a way to keep the post office going and get the grand trunk out of gilt   s hands .  you   ll probably get it back  if you want it .  you and all the other people gilt swindled .  i   ll help  if i can .  but i don   t want thanking .      he felt her draw nearer .      it   s not a lie     she said .     it   s what ought to have been true .  it pleased my parents .         do they think it   s true .         they don   t want to think it isn   t .      no one does .  i can   t stand this  moist thought .     look  i know what i   m like     he said .     i   m not the person everyone thinks i am .  i just wanted to prove to myself i   m not like gilt .  more than a hammer  you understand .  but i   m still a fraud by trade .  i thought you knew that .  i can fake sincerity so well that even i can   t tell .  i mess with people   s heads           you   re fooling no one but yourself     said miss dearheart  and reached for his hand .   moist shook her off  and ran out of the building  out of the city  and back to his old life  or lives  always moving on  selling glass as diamond  but somehow it just didn   t seem to work anymore  the flair wasn   t there  the fun had dropped out of it  even the cards didn   t seem to work for him  the money ran out  and one winter in some inn that was no more than a slum he turned his face to the wall     and an angel appeared .      what just happened .     said miss dearheart .   perhaps you do get two        only a passing thought     said moist .  he let the golden glow rise .  he   d fooled them all  even her .  but the good bit was that he could go on doing it  he didn   t have to stop .  all he had to do was remind himself  every few months  that he could quit anytime .  provided he knew he could  he   d never have to .  and there was miss dearheart  without a cigarette in her mouth  only a foot away .  he leaned forward     there was a loud cough behind them .  it turned out to have come from groat  who was holding a large parcel .      sorry to interrupt  sir  but this just arrived for you     he said  and sniffed disapprovingly .     messenger  not one of ours .  i thought i   d better bring it straight up     cos there   s something moving about inside it        there was .  and airholes  moist noted .  he opened the lid with care and pulled his fingers away just in time .      twelve and a half percent .  twelve and a half percent .     screamed the cockatoo  and landed on groat   s hat .   there was no note inside  and nothing on the box but the address .      why   d someone send you a parrot .     said groat  not caring to raise a hand within reach of the curved beak .      it   s gilt   s  isn   t it     said miss dearheart .     he   s given you the bird .      moist smiled .     it looks like it  yes .  pieces of eight .         twelve and a half percent .     yelled the bird .      take it away  will you  mr .  groat .     said moist .     teach it to say   to say              trust me    .     said miss dearheart .      good one .     said moist .     yes  do that  mr .  groat .      when groat was gone  with the cockatoo now balancing happily on his shoulder  moist turned back to the woman .      and tomorrow     he said     i   ll definitely get the chandeliers back .         what .  most of this place doesn   t have a ceiling     said miss dearheart  laughing .      first things first .  trust me .  and then who knows .  i might even find the fine polished counter .  there   s no end to what   s possible .      and out in the bustling cavern  white feathers began to fall from the roof .  they may have been from an angel  but were more likely to be coming from the pigeon that a hawk was just disemboweling on a beam .  still  they were feathers .  it   s all about style .      sometimes the truth is arrived at by adding all the little lies together and deducting them from the totality of what is known .   lord vetinari stood at the top of the stairs in the great hall of the place  and looked down on his clerks .  they   d taken over the whole huge floor for this concludium .   chalked markings   circles  squares  triangles   were drawn here and there on the floor .  within them  papers and ledgers were piled in dangerously neat heaps .  and there were clerks  some working inside the outlines and some moving noiselessly from one outline to another bearing pieces of paper as if they were a sacrament .  periodically  clerks and watchmen arrived with more files and ledgers  which were solemnly received  assessed  and added to the relevant pile .   abacuses clicked everywhere .  clerks padded back and forth  and sometimes they would meet in a triangle and bend their heads in quiet discussion .  this might result in them heading away in new directions or  increasingly  as the night wore on  one clerk would go and chalk a new outline  which would begin to fill with paper .  sometimes an outline would be emptied  rubbed out  and its contents distributed among nearby outlines .   no enchanter   s circle  no mystic   s mandala was ever drawn with such painfully meticulous care as the conclusions being played out on the floor .  hour after hour  it went on  with a patience that at first terrified and then bored .  it was the warfare of clerks  and it harried the enemy through many columns and files .  moist could read words that weren   t there  but the clerks found the numbers that weren   t there  or were there twice  or were there but going the wrong way .  they didn   t hurry .  peel away the lies  and the truth would emerge  naked and ashamed and with nowhere else to hide .   at three a . m .   mr .  cheeseborough arrived  in a hurry and bitter tears  to learn that his bank was a shell of paper .  he brought his own clerks  with their nightshirts tucked into hastily donned trousers  who went down on their knees alongside the other men and spread out more papers  double checking figures in the hope that if you stared at numbers long enough  they   d add up differently .   and then the watch turned up with a small red ledger  and it was given a circle of its own  and soon the whole pattern re formed around it     it wasn   t until almost dawn that the somber men arrived .  they were older and fatter and better   but not showily  never showily   dressed  and moved with the gravity of serious money .  they were financiers  too  richer than kings  who are often quite poor   but hardly anyone in the city outside their circle knew them or would notice them in the street .  they spoke quietly to cheeseborough as to one who   d suffered a bereavement  and then talked among themselves  and used little gold propelling pencils in neat little notebooks to make figures dance and jump through hoops .  then quiet agreement was reached and hands were shaken  which in this circle carried infinitely more weight than any written contract .  the first domino had been steadied .  the pillars of the world ceased to tremble .  the credit bank would open in the morning  and when it did so  bills would be honored  wages would be paid  the city would be fed .   they   d saved the city with gold more easily  at that point  than any hero could have managed with steel .  but  in truth  it had not exactly been gold  or even the promise of gold  but more like the fantasy of gold  the fairy dream that the gold is there  at the end of the rainbow  and will continue to be there forever   provided  naturally  that you don   t go and look .   this is known as finance .   on the way back home to a simple breakfast  one of them dropped by the guild of assassins to pay his respects to his old friend lord downey  during which visit current affairs were only lightly touched upon .  and reacher gilt  wherever he had gone  was now certainly the worst insurance risk in the world .  the people who guard the rainbow don   t like those who get in the way of the sun .       epilogue      some time after    the figure in the chair did not have long hair  or an eyepatch .  it didn   t have a beard or  rather  it wasn   t intending to have a beard .  it hadn   t shaved for several days .   it groaned .      ah  mr .  gilt     said lord vetinari  looking up from his playing board .     you are awake  i see .  i   m sorry for the manner in which you were brought here  but some quite expensive people wish to see you dead and i thought it would be a good idea if we had this little meeting before they did .         i don   t know who you   re talking about     said the figure .     my name is randolph stippler  and i have papers to prove it           and wonderful papers they are  mr .  gilt .  but enough of that .  no  it is about angels that i wish to talk to you now .      reacher gilt  wincing occasionally as the aches from three days of being carried by a golem made themselves felt  listened in mounting puzzlement to the angelic theories of lord vetinari .         brings me on to my point  mr .  gilt .  the royal mint needs an entirely new approach .  frankly  it   s moribund and not at all what we need in the century of the anchovy .  yes  there is a way forward .  in recent months  mr .  lipwig   s celebrated stamps have become a second currency in this city .  so light  so easy to

rhyming slang  various rhyming slangs are known  and have given the universe such terms as    apples and pears     stairs      rubbity dub     pub   and    busy bee     general theory of relativity  .  the dimwell street rhyming slang is pretty unique in that it does not  in fact  rhyme .  no one knows why  but theories so far advanced are    that it is quite complex and in fact follows hidden rules  or    dimwell is well named  or    it   s made up to annoy strangers  which is the case with most such slangs .         it is wrong to judge by appearances .  despite his expression  which was

left of two horses that had been involved in a particularly nasty accident .         which would have been agonizing .         often  but not uniquely  a ladle  but sometimes a metal spatula or  rarely  a mechanical egg whisk that nobody in the house admits to ever buying .  the desperate  mad rattling and cries of    how can it close on the damn thing but not open with it .  who bought this .  do we ever use it .     is as praise unto anoia .  she also eats corkscrews .         another bastard phrase that   d sell itself to any weasel in a tight corner .         ridcully practiced the
