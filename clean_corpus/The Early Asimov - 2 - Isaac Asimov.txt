final .   legal rites  time pussy      introduction  the summer of      was full of doubts and uncertainty for me .   in june i had graduated from columbia and obtained my bachelor of science degree .  so far  so good .  however  my second round of attempts to enter medical school had failed  as the first had .  to be sure  i hadn t really been anxious to go to medical school and i had tried only halfheartedly  but it still left me at loose ends .   what did i do now .  i did not wish to look for some nondescript job  even if these were to be found  so i had to continue with my schooling .  i had been majoring in chemistry  so  failing medical school  the natural next step was to go for my degree of doctor of philosophy in that field .   the first question was whether i would be able to swing this financially .   it would have been the first question  even more so  if i had gotten into medical school .   college itself had been touch and go all four years  and my small writing income of about      during my senior year had been a considerable help .   naturally  i would have to continue writing and  just as naturally  my depression made it very difficult to write .  i managed one story during that summer  it was called  life before birth .     live before birth  was my first attempt at anything other than science fiction .  it was in the allied field of fantasy  as imaginative as science fiction  but without the restriction of requiring scientific plausibility  .   the reason for my attempting fantasy was that at the beginning of       street   smith began the publication of a new magazine  unknown  of which campbell was editor .   unknown caught my fancy at once .  it featured stories of what are now called  adult fantasy   and the writing seemed to my nineteen year old self to be even more advanced and literate than that in astounding .  of course i wanted desperately to place a story in this new and wonderful magazine .    life before birth  was an attempt in this direction  but aside from the mere fact that it was a fantasy  i remember nothing more about it .  it was submitted to campbell on july    and was back in my hands on the nineteenth .  it never placed anywhere and no longer exists .   august was even worse .  all europe rang with the hideous possibility of war  and on september    world war ii began with the german invasion of poland .  i could do nothing during the crisis but listen to the radio .  it was not till september    that i could settle down long enough to start another story   the brothers .     the brothers  was science fiction  and all i remember is that it was about two brothers  a good one and an evil one  and a scientific invention that one or the other was constructing .  on october   i submitted it to campbell  and on october    it was rejected .  it  too  never placed and no longer exists .   so the summer had passed fruitlessly and now i had to face another problem .  columbia university was not in the least anxious to take me on as a graduate student .  they felt i was going to use the position as a mere way of marking time till i could try once more to get into medical school .   i swore that this was not so  but my position was vulnerable because as a premedical student i had not been required to take a course in physical chemistry and had therefore not done so .  physical chemistry was  however  required for graduate work in chemistry .   i persisted  and finally the admissions board made the following suggestion  i would have to take a full year s selection of graduate courses  and  at the same time  i would have to take physical chemistry and get at least a b in that .  if i failed to get the b  i was out on my ear and my tuition money would  of course  not be refunded .   one of the members of the board told me  some years later  that i was offered this in the belief that i would not accept a set of terms so loaded against me .  however  since i had never had trouble with passing courses  it never occurred to me that a set of requirements that merely asked that i achieve certain grades  was loaded against me .   i agreed  and when at the end of the first semester there were only three a s in physical chemistry out of a class of sixty  and i was one of them  the probation was lifted .   by december i had gotten deeply enough into my course work to be quite certain i would fulfill all grade requirements .   the only uncertainty remaining was financial .  i had to get back to writing .   on december    i began  homo sol  and completed it on january          the day before my twentieth birthday .  i submitted it on january    and on that day  in campbell s office  i met theodore sturgeon and l .  ron hubbard  two established members of campbell s stable of writers .   hubbard has since then become world famous  in a fashion  as the originator of the cults of dianetics and scientology .    there is no sign in my diary of any discouragement  but after a year and a half of assiduous efforts  i had failed to sell campbell more than one story out of the eighteen i had by then written .  he had rejected eight stories before buying  trends   and he had rejected seven stories since .   two stories  which i sold elsewhere  he never saw and had no chance to reject .  had he seen them he would certainly have rejected them .    one factor in the lack of discouragement was campbell s unfailing interest .  as long as he didn t get tired reading my stories and advising me about them so kindly  why should i get tired writing them .  then  too  my occasional sales to magazines other than astounding  there had been six by then  and  especially  the opening up of a new and sympathetic market in the form of pohl s magazines  helped keep my spirits up .   for  homo sol   my nineteenth story  there was no outright rejection .  again  campbell asked for revisions .  i had to revise it twice  but it was not to be another  black friar of the flame .   the second revision was satisfactory  and on april           i received my second check from campbell  and  by that time  my seventh check  all told  .  what s more  it was for seventy two dollars  the story being       words long  and was the largest check i had ever received for a story up to that time .   oddly enough  the clearest thing i remember about that check is an incident that took place that evening in my father s candy store  where i still worked every day and where i was to continue working for two more years .  a customer took offense at my neglecting to say  thank you  after his purchase   a crime i frequently committed because  very often  i was working without conscious attention but was concentrating deeply on the plot permutations that were sounding hollowly within the cavern of my skull .   the customer decided to scold me for my obvious inattention and apparent lack of industry .   my son   he said   made fifty dollars through hard work last week .  what do you do to earn a living .     i write   i said   and i got this for a story today   and i held up the check for him to see .   it was a very satisfactory moment .           homo sol     the seven thousand and fifty fourth session of the galactic congress sat in solemn conclave in the vast semicircular hall on eon  second planet of arcturus .   slowly  the president delegate rose to his feet .  his broad arcturian countenance flushed slightly with excitement as he surveyed the surrounding delegates .  his sense of the dramatic caused him to pause a moment or so before making the official announcement   for  after all  the entrance of a new planetary system into the great galactic family is not a thing likely to happen twice in any one man s lifetime .   a dead silence prevailed during that pause .  the two hundred and eighty eight delegates   one from each of the two hundred and eighty eight oxygen atmosphere  water chemistry worlds of the system   waited patiently for him to speak .   beings of every manlike type and shape were there .  some were tall and polelike  some broad and burly  some short and stumpy .  there were those with long  wiry hair  those with scanty gray fuzz covering head and face  others with thick  blond curls piled high and still others entirely bald .  some possessed long  hair covered trumpets of ears  others had tympanum membranes flush with their temples .  there were those present with large gazellelike eyes of a deep purple luminosity  others with tiny optics of a beady black .  there was a delegate with green skin  one with an eight inch proboscis and one with a vestigial tail .  internally  variation was almost infinite .   but all were alike in two things .   they were all humanoid .  they all possessed intelligence .   the president delegate s voice boomed out then   delegates .  the system of sol has discovered the secret of interstellar travel and by that act becomes eligible for entrance into the galactic federation .    a storm of approving shouts arose from those present and the arcturian raised a hand for silence .    i have here   he continued   the official report from alpha centauri  on whose fifth planet the humanoids of sol have landed .  the report is entirely satisfactory and so the ban upon travel into and communication with the solarian system is lifted .  sol is free  and open to the ships of the federation .  even now  there is in preparation an expedition to sol  under the leadership of joselin arn of alpha centauri  to tender that system the formal invitation into the federation .    he paused  and from two hundred and eighty eight throats came the stentorian shout   hail  homo sol .  hail  homo sol .  hail .    it was the traditional welcome of the federation for all new worlds .   tan porus raised himself to his full height of five feet two  he was tall for a rigellian   and his sharp  green eyes snapped with annoyance .    there it is  lo fan .  for six months that damned freak squid from beta draconis iv has stumped me .    lo fan stroked his forehead gently with one long finger  and one hairy ear twitched several times .  he had traveled eighty five light years to be here on arcturus ii with the greatest psychologist of the federation   and  more specifically  to see this strange mollusk whose reactions had stumped the great rigellian .   he was seeing it now  a puffy  dull purple mass of soft flesh that writhed its tentacular form in placid unconcern through the huge tank of water that held it .  with unruffled serenity  it fed on the green fronds of an underwater fern .    seems ordinary enough   said lo fan .    ha .   snorted tan porus .   watch this .    he drew the curtain and plunged the room into darkness .  only a dim blue light shone upon the tank  and in the murk the draconian squid could barely be discerned .    here goes the stimulus   grunted porus .  the screen above his head burst into soft green light  focused directly upon the tank .  it persisted a moment and gave way to a dull red and then almost at once to a brilliant yellow .  for half a minute it shot raggedly through the spectrum and then  with a final glare of glowing white  a clear bell like tone sounded .   and as the echoes of the note died away  a shudder passed over the squid s body .  it relaxed and sank slowly to the bottom of the tank .   porus pulled aside the curtain .   it s sound asleep   he growled .   hasn t failed yet .  every specimen we ve ever had drops as if shot the moment that note sounds .     asleep  eh .  that s strange .  have you got the figures on the stimulus .     certainly .  right here .  the exact wave lengths of the lights required are listed  plus the length of duration of each light unit  plus the exact pitch of the sounded note at the end .    the other surveyed the figures dubiously .  his forehead wrinkled and his ears rose in surprise .  from an inner pocket  he drew forth a slide rule .    what type nervous system has the animal .     two b .  plain  simple  ordinary two b .  i ve had the anatomists  physiologists and ecologists check that until they were blue in the face .  two b is all they get .  damn fools .    lo fan said nothing  but pushed the center bar of the rule back and forth carefully .  he stopped and peered closely  shrugged his shoulders and reached for one of the huge volumes on the shelf above his head .  he leafed through the pages and picked out numbers from among the close print .  again the slide rule .   finally he stopped .   it doesn t make sense   he said helplessly .    i know that .  i ve tried six times in six different ways to explain that reaction   and i failed each time .  even if i rig up a system that will explain its going to sleep  i can t get it to explain the specificity of the stimulus .     it s highly specific .   questioned lo fan  his voice reaching the higher registers .    that s the worst part of it   shouted tan porus .  he leaned forward and tapped the other on the knee .   if you shift the wave length of any of the light units by fifty angstroms either way   any one of them   it doesn t sleep .  shift the length of duration of a light unit two seconds either way   it doesn t sleep .  shift the pitch of the tone at the end an eighth of an octave either way   it doesn t sleep .  but get the right combination  and it goes straight into a coma .    lo fan s ears were two hairy trumpets  stiffly erect .   galaxy .   he whispered .   how did you ever stumble on the combination .     i didn t .  it happened at beta draconis .  some hick college was putting its freshmen through a lab period on light sound reactions of molluscoids   been doing it for years .  some student runs through his light sound combinations and his blasted specimen goes to sleep .  naturally  he s scared out of his wits and brings it to the instructor .  the instructor tries it again on another squid   it goes to sleep .  they shift the combination  nothing happens .  they go back to the original   it goes to sleep .  after they fooled around with it long enough to know they couldn t make head or tail of it  they sent it to arcturus and wished it on me .  it s six months since   had a real night s sleep .    a musical note sounded and porus turned impatiently .    what is it .     messenger from the president delegate of congress  sir   came in metallic tones from the telecaster on his desk .    send him up .    the messenger stayed only long enough to hand porus an impressively sealed envelope and to say in hearty tone   great news  sir .  the system of sol has qualified for entrance .     so what .   snorted porus beneath his breath as the other left .   we all knew it was coming .    he ripped off the outer sheath of cello fiber from the envelope and removed the sheaf of papers from within .  he glanced through them and grimaced .    oh  rigel .     what s wrong .   asked lo fan .    those politicians keep bothering me with the most inconsequential things .  you d think there wasn t another psychologist on eron .  look .  we ve been expecting the solarian system to solve the principle of the hyperatomo any century now .  they ve finally done it and an expedition of theirs landed on alpha centauri .  at once  there s a politician s holiday .  we must send an expedition of our own to ask them to join the federation .  and  of course  we must have a psychologist along to ask them in a nice way so as to be sure of getting the right reaction  because  to be sure  there isn t a man in the army that ever gets proper training in psychology .    lo fan nodded seriously .   i know  i know .  we have the same trouble out our way .  they don t need psychology until they get into trouble and then they come running .     well  it s a cinch i m not going to sol .  this sleeping squid is too important to neglect .  it s a routine job  anyway   this business of raking in new worlds  a type a reaction that any sophomore can handle .     whom will you send .     i don t know .  i ve got several good juniors under me that can do this sort of thing with their eyes closed .  i ll send one of them .  and meanwhile  i ll be seeing you at the faculty meeting tomorrow  won t i .     you will   and hearing me  too .  i m making a speech on the finger touch stimulus .     good .  i ve done work on it  so i ll be interested in hearing what you have to say .  till tomorrow  then .    left alone  porus turned once more to the official report on the solarian system which the messenger had handed him .  he leafed through it leisurely  without particular interest  and finally put it down with a sigh .    lor haridin could do it   he muttered to himself .   he s a good kid   deserves a break .    he lifted his tiny bulk out of the chair and  with the report under his arm  left his office and trotted down the long corridor outside .  as he stopped before a door at the far end  the automatic flash blazed up and a voice within called out to him to enter .   the rigellian opened the door and poked his head inside .   busy  haridin .    lor haridin looked up and sprang to his feet at once .   great space  boss  no .  i haven t had anything to do since i finished work on anger reactions .  you ve got something for me  maybe .     i have   if you think you re up to it .  you ve heard of the solarian system  haven t you .     sure .  the visors are full of it .  they ve got interstellar travel  haven t they .     that s right .  an expedition is leaving alpha centauri for sol in a month .  they ll need a psychologist to do the fine work  and i was thinking of sending you .    the young scientist reddened with delight to the very top of his hairless dome .   do you mean it  boss .     why not .  that is   if you think you can do it .     of course i can .   haridin drew himself up in offended hauteur .   type a reaction .  i can t miss .     you ll have to learn their language  you know  and administer the stimulus in the solarian tongue .  it s not always an easy job .    haridin shrugged .   i still can t miss .  in a case like this  translation need only be seventy five percent effective to get ninety nine and six tenths percent of the desired result .  that was one of the problems i had to solve on my qualifying exam .  so you can t trip me up that way .    porus laughed .   all right  haridin  i know you can do it .  clean up everything here at the university and sign up for indefinite leave .  and if you can  haridin  write some sort of paper on these solarians .  if it s any good  you might get senior status on the basis of it .    the junior psychologist frowned .   but  boss  that s old stuff .  humanoid reactions are as well known as  .  .  .  as     you can t write anything on them .     there s always something if you look hard enough  haridin .  nothing is well known  remember that .  if you ll look at sheet    of the report  for instance  you ll find an item concerning the care with which the solarians armed themselves on leaving their ship .    the other turned to the proper page .   that s reasonable   said he .   an entirely normal reaction .     certainly .  but they insisted on retaining their weapons throughout their stay  even when they were greeted and welcomed by fellow humanoids .  that s quite a perceptible deviation from the normal .  investigate it   it might be worth while .     as you say  boss .  thanks a lot for the chance you re giving me .  and say   how s the squid coming along .    porus wrinkled his nose .   my sixth try folded up and died yesterday .  it s disgusting .   and with that  he was gone .   tan porus of rigel trembled with rage as he folded the handful of papers he held in two and tore them across .  he plugged in the telecaster with a jerk .    get me santins of the math department immediately   he snapped .   his green eyes shot fire at the placid figure that appeared on the visor almost at once .  he shook his fist at the image .    what on eron s the idea of that analysis you sent me just now  you betelgeusian slime worm .    the image s eyebrows shot up in mild surprise .   don t blame me  porus .  they were your equations  not mine .  where did you get them .     never mind where i got them .  that s the business of the psychology department .     all right .  and solving them is the business of the mathematics department .  that s the seventh set of the damnedest sort of screwy equations i ve ever seen .  it was the worst yet .  you made at least seventeen assumptions which you had no right to make .  it took us two weeks to straighten you out  and finally we boiled it down       porus jumped as if stung .   i know what you boiled it down to .  i just tore up the sheets .  you take eighteen independent variables in twenty equations  representing two months of work  and solve them out at the bottom of the last  last page with that gem of oracular wisdom    a  equals  a  .  all that work   and all i get is an identity .     it s still not my fault  porus .  you argued in circles  and in mathematics that means an identity and there s nothing you can do about it .   his lips twitched in a slow smile .   what are you kicking about  anyway .   a  does equal  a   doesn t it .     shut up .   the telecaster went dead  and the psychologist closed his lips tightly and boiled inwardly .  the light signal above the telecaster flashed to life again .    what do you want now .   .   it was the calm  impersonal voice of the receptionist below that answered him .   a messenger from the government  sir .     damn the government .  tell them i m dead .     it s important  sir .  lor haridin has returned from sol and wants to see you .    porus frowned .   sol .  what sol .  oh  i remember .  send him up  but tell him to make it snappy .     come in  haridin   he said a little later  voice calmer  as the young arcturian  a bit thinner  a bit more weary than he had been six months earlier when he left the arcturian system  entered .    well  young man .  did you write the paper .    the arcturian gazed intently upon his fingernails .   no  sir .     why not .   poms  green eyes peered narrowly at the other   don t tell me you ve had trouble .     quite a bit  boss .   the words came with an effort .  the psychological board itself has sent for you after hearing my report .  the fact of the matter is that that the solarian system has  .  .  .  has refused to join the federation .    tan porus shot out of his chair like a jack in the box and landed  purely by chance  on his feet .    what .  .    haridin nodded miserably and cleared his throat .    now  by the great dark nebula   swore the rigellian  distractedly   if this isn t one sweet day .  first  they tell me that  a  equals  a   and then you come in and tell me you muffed a type a reaction   muffed it completely .    the junior psychologist fired up .   i didn t muff it .  there s something wrong with the solarians themselves .  they re not normal .  when i landed they went wild over us .  there was a fantastic celebration   entirely unrestrained .  nothing was too good for us .  i delivered the invitation before their parliament in their own language   a simple one which they call esperanto .  i ll stake my life that my translation was ninety five percent effective .     well .  and then .     i can t understand the rest  boss .  first  there was a neutral reaction and i was a little surprised  and then    he shuddered in retrospect    in seven days   only seven days  boss   the entire planet had reversed itself completely .  i couldn t follow their psychology  not by a hundred miles .  i ve brought home copies of their newspapers of the time in which they objected to joining with  alien monstrosities  and refused to be  ruled by inhumans of worlds parsecs away .   i ask you  does that make sense .    and that s only the beginning .  it was light years worse than that .  why  good galaxy  i went all the way into type g reactions  trying to figure them out  and couldn t .  in the end  we had to leave .  we were in actual physical danger from those  .  .  .  those earthmen  as they call themselves .    tan porus chewed his lip a while .   interesting .  have you your report with you .     no .  the psychological board has it .  they ve been going over it with a microscope all day .     and what do they say .    the young arcturian winced .   they don t say it openly  but they leave a strong impression of thinking the report an inaccurate one .     well  i ll decide about that after i ve read it .  meanwhile  come with me to parliamentary hall and you can answer a few questions on the way .    joselin arn of alpha centauri rubbed stubbled jaws with his huge  six fingered hand and peered from under beetling brows at the semicircle of diversified faces that stared down upon him .  the psychological board was composed of psychologists of a score of worlds  and their united gaze was not the easiest thing in the world to withstand .    we have been informed   began frian obel  head of the board and native of vega  home of the green skinned men   that those sections of the report dealing with sol s military state are your work .    joselin arn inclined his head in silent agreement .    and you are prepared to confirm what you have stated here  in spite of its inherent improbability .  you are no psychologist  you know .     no .  but i m a soldier .   the centaurian s jaws set stubbornly as his bass voice rumbled through the hall .   i don t know equations and i don t know graphs   but i do know spaceships .  i ve seen theirs and i ve seen ours  and theirs are better .  i ve seen their first interstellar ship .  give them a hundred years and they ll have a better hyperatomos than we have .  i ve seen their weapons .  they ve got almost everything we have  at a stage in their history millennia before us .  what they haven t got   they ll get  and soon .  what they have got  they ll improve .    i ve seen their munitions plants .  ours are more advanced  but theirs are more efficient .  i ve seen their soldiers   and i d rather fight with them than against them .    i ve said all that in the report .  i say it again now .    his brusque sentences came to an end and frian obel waited for the murmur from the men about him to cease .    and the rest of their science  medicine  chemistry  physics .  what of them .     i m not the best judge of those .  you have the report there of those who know  however  and to the best of my knowledge i confirm them .     and so these solarians are true humanoids .     by the circling worlds of centauri  yes .    the old scientist drew himself back in his chair with a peevish gesture and cast a rapid  frowning glance up and down the length  . of the table .    colleagues   he said   we make little progress by rehashing this mess of impossibilities .  we have a race of humanoids of a superlatively technological turn  possessing at the same time an intrinsically unscientific belief in supernatural forces  an incredibly childish predilection toward individuality  singly and in groups  and  worst of all  lack of sufficient vision to embrace a galaxy wide culture .    he glared down upon the lowering centaurian before him .   such a race must exist if we are to believe the report   and fundamental axioms of psychology must crumble .  but i  for one  refuse to believe any such   to be vulgar about it   comet gas .  this is plainly a case of mismanagement to be investigated by the proper authorities .  i hope you all agree with me when i say that this report be consigned to the scrap heap and that a second expedition led by an expert in his line  not by an inexperienced junior psychologist or a soldier       the drone of the scientist s voice was buried suddenly in the crash of an iron fist against the table .  joselin arn  his huge bulk writhing in anger  lost his temper and gave vent to martial wrath .    now  by the writhing spawn of templis  by the worms that crawl and the gnats that fly  by the cesspools and the plague spots and by the hooded death itself  i won t allow this .  are you to sit there with your theories and your long range wisdom and deny what i have seen with my eyes .  are my eyes    and they flashed fire as he spoke    to deny themselves because of a few wriggling marks your palsied hands trace on paper .    to the core of centauri with these armchair wise men  say i   and the psychologists first of all .  blast these men who bury themselves in their books and their laboratories and are blind to what goes on in the living world outside .  psychology  is it .  rotten  putrid       a tap on his belt caused him to whirl  eyes staring  fists clenched .  for a moment  he looked about vainly .  then  turning his gaze downward  he found himself looking into the enigmatic green eyes of a pygmy of a man  whose piercing stare seemed to drench his anger with ice water .    i know you  joselin arn   said tan porus slowly  picking his words carefully .   you re a brave man and a good soldier  but you don t like psychologists  i see .  that is wrong of you  for it is on psychology that the political success of the federation rests .  take it away and our union crumbles  our great federation melts away  the galactic system is shattered .   his voice descended into a soft  liquid croon .   you have sworn an oath to defend the system against all its enemies  joselin arn   and you yourself have now become its greatest .  you strike at its foundations .  you dig at its roots .  you poison it at its source .  you are dishonored .  you are disgraced .  you are a traitor .    the centaurian soldier shook his head helplessly .  as porus spoke  deep and bitter remorse filled him .  recollection of his words of a moment ago lay heavy on his conscience .  when the psychologist finislied  arn bent his head and wept .  tears ran down those lined  war scarred cheeks  to which for forty years now they had been a stranger .   porus spoke again  and this time his voice boomed like a thunder clap   away with your mewling whine  you coward .  danger is at hand .  man the guns .    joselin arn snapped to attention  the sorrow that had filled him a bare second before was gone as if it had never existed .   the room rocked with laughter and the soldier grasped the situation .  it had been porus  way of punishing him .  with his complete knowledge of the devious ins and outs of the human oid mind  he had only to push the proper button  and      the centaurian bit his lip in embarrassment  but said nothing .   but tan porus  himself  did not laugh .  to tease the soldier was one thing  to humiliate him  quite another .  with a bound  he was on a chair and laid his small hand on the other s massive shoulder .    no offense  my friend   a little lesson  that is all .  fight the subhumanoids and the hostile environments of fifty worlds .  dare space in a leaky rattletrap of a ship .  defy whatever dangers you wish .  but never  never offend a psychologist .  he might get angry in earnest the next time .    arn bent his head back and laughed   a gigantic roar of mirth that shook the room with its earthquake like lustiness .    your advice is well taken  psychologist .  bum me with an atomo  if i don t think you re right .   he strode from the room with his shoulders still heaving with suppressed laughter .   porus hopped off the chair and turned to face the board .    this is an interesting race of humanoids we have stumbled upon  colleagues .     ah   said obel  dryly   the great porus feels bound to come to his pupil s defense .  your digestion seems to have improved  since you feel yourself capable of swallowing haridin s report .    haridin  standing  head bowed  in the corner  reddened angrily  but did not move .   porus frowned  but his voice kept to its even tone .   i do  and the report  if properly analyzed  will give rise to a revolution in the science .  it is a psychological gold mine  and homo sol  the find of the millenium .     be specific  tan porus   drawled someone .   your tricks are all very well for a centaurian blockhead  but we remain unimpressed .    the fiery little rigellian emitted a gurgle of anger .  he shook one tiny fist in the direction of the last speaker .    i ll be more specific  inar tubal  you hairy space bug .   prudence and anger waged a visible battle within him .   there is more to a humanoid than you think   certainly far more than you mental cripples can understand .  just to show you what you don t know  you desiccated group of fossils  i ll undertake to show you a bit of psycho technology that ll knock the guts right out of you .  panic  morons  panic .  worldwide panic .    there was an awful silence .   did you say world wide panic .   stuttered frian obel  his green skin turning gray .   panic .     yes  you parrot .  give me six months and fifty assistants and i ll show you a world of humanoids in panic .    obel attempted vainly to answer .  his mouth worked in a heroic attempt to remain serious   and failed .  as though by signal  the entire board dropped its dignity and leaned back in a single burst of laughter .    i remember   gasped inar tubal of sirius  his round face streaked with tears of pure joy   a student of mine who once claimed to have discovered a stimulus that would induce worldwide panic .  when i checked his results  i came across an exponent with a misplaced decimal point .  he was only ten orders of magnitude out of the way .  how many decimal points have you misplaced  colleague porus .     what of kraut s law  porus  which says you can t panic more than five humanoids at a time .  shall we pass a resolution repealing it .  and maybe the atomic theory as well  while we re about it .   and semper gor of capella cackled gleefully .   porus climbed onto the table and snatched obel s gavel .   the next one who laughs is getting this over his empty head .   there was sudden silence .    i m taking fifty assistants   shouted  the green eyed rigellian   and joselin arn is taking me to sol .  i want five of you to come with me   inar tubal  semper gor and any three others so that i can watch their stupid faces when i ve done what i  said i would .   he hefted the gavel  threateningly .   well .    frian obel gazed at the ceiling placidly .   all right  porus .  tubal  gor  helvin  prat and winson can go with you .  at the end of the specified time  we ll witness world wide panic which will be very gratifying   or we ll watch you eat your words  and how much more gratifying that would be .   and with that  he chuckled very quietly to himself .   tan porus stared thoughtfully out the window .  terrapolis  capital city of earth  sprawled beneath him to the very edge of the horizon .  its muted roar reached even to the half mile height at which he stood .   there was something over that city  invisible and intangible but none the less real .  its presence was only too evident to the small psychologist .  the choking cloak of dank fear that spread over the metropolis beneath was one of his own weaving   a horrible cloak of dark uncertainty  that clutched with clammy fingers at the hearts of mankind and stopped short   just short of actual panic .   the roar of the city had voices in it  and the voices were tiny ones of fear .   the rigellian turned away in disgust .   hey  haridin   he roared .   the young arcturian turned away from the televisor .   calling me  boss .     what do you think i m doing .  talking to myself .  what s the latest from asia .     nothing new .  the stimuli just aren t strong enough .  the yellow men seem to be more stolid of disposition than the white dominants of america and europe .  i ve sent out orders not to increase the stimuli  though .     no  they mustn t   agreed porus .   we can t risk active panic .   he ruminated in silence .   listen  we re about through .  tell them to hit a few of the big cities   they re more susceptible  and quit .    he turned to the window again .   space  what a world   what a world .  an entirely new branch of psychology has opened up one we never dreamed of .  mob psychology  haridin  mob psychology .   he shook his head impressively .    there s lots of suffering  though  boss   muttered the younger man .   this passive panic has completely paralyzed trade and commerce .  the business life of the entire planet is stagnant .  the poor government is helpless   they don t know what s wrong .     they ll find out   when i m ready .  and  as for the suffering well  i don t like it  either  but it s all a means to an end  a damned important end .    there followed a short silence  and then porus  lips twitched into a nasty smile .   those five nitwits returned from europe yesterday  didn t they .    haridin smiled in turn and nodded vigorously .   and hopping sore .  your predictions have checked to the fifth decimal place .  they re fit to be tied .     good .  i m only sorry i can t see obel s face right now  after the last message i sent him .  and  incidentally    his voice dropped lower    what s the latest on them .    haridin raised two fingers .   two weeks  and they ll be here .     two weeks  .  .  .  two weeks   gurgled porus jubilantly .  he rose and made for the door .   i think i ll find my dear  dear colleagues and pass the time of day .    the five scientists of the board looked up from their notes and fell into an embarrassed silence as porus entered .   the latter smiled impishly .   notes satisfactory  gentlemen .  found some fifty or sixty fallacies in my fundamental assumptions  no doubt .    hybron prat of alpha cepheus rumpled the gray fuzz he called hair .   i don t trust the unholy tricks this crazy mathematical notation of yours plays .    the rigellian emitted a short bark of laughter .   invent a better  then .  so far  it s done a good job of handling reactions  hasn t it .    there was an unmusical chorus of throat clearings but no definite answer .    hasn t it .   thundered porus .    well  what if it has   returned kim winson  desperately .   where s your panic .  all this is well and good .  these human oids are cosmic freaks  but where s the big show you were going to put on .  until you break kraut s law  this entire exhibition of yours isn t worth a pinhead meteor .     you re beaten  gentlemen  you re beaten   crowed the small master psychologist .   i ve proven my point   this passive panic is as impossible according to classic psychology as the active form .  you re trying to deny facts and save face now  by harping on a technicality .  go home  go home  gentlemen  and hide under the bed .    psychologists are only human .  they can analyze the motives that drive them  but they are the slave of those motives just as much as the commonest mortal of all .  these galaxy famous psychologists writhed under the lash of wounded pride and shattered vanity  and their blind stubbornness was the mechanical reaction due there from .  they knew it was and they knew porus knew it was   and that made it all the harder .   inar tubal stared angrily from red rimmed eyes .   active panic or nothing  tan porus .  that s what you promised  and that s what we ll have .  we want the letter of the bond or  by space and time  we ll balk at any technicality .  active panic or we report failure .    porus swelled ominously and  with a tremendous effort  spoke quietly .   be reasonable  gentlemen .  we haven t the equipment to handle active panic .  we ve never come up against this superform they have here on earth .  what if it gets beyond control .   he shook his head violently .    isolate it  then   snarled semper gor .   start it up and put it out .  make all the preparations you want  but do it .     if you can   grunted hybron prat .   but tan porus had his weak point .  his brittle temper lay in splintered shards about him .  his agile tongue blistered the atmosphere and inundated the sullen psychologist with wave after wave of concentrated profanity .    have your way  vacuumheads .  have your way and to outer space with you .   he was breathless with passion .   we ll set it off right here in terrapolis as soon as all the men are back home .  only you d all better get from under .   and with one last parting snarl  he stalked from the room .   tan porus parted the curtains with a sweep of his hand  and the five psychologists facing him averted their eyes .  the streets of earth s capital were deserted  of civilian population .  the ordered tramp of the military patrolling the highways of the city sounded like a dirge .  the wintry sky hung low over the scene of strewn bodies   and silence  the silence that follows an orgy of wild destruction .    it was touch and go for a few hours there  colleagues .   porus  voice was tired .   if it had passed the city limits  we could never have stopped it .     horrible  horrible .   muttered hybron prat .   it was a scene a psychologist would have given his right arm to witness   and his life to forget .     and these are humanoids .   groaned kim winson .   semper gor rose to his feet in sudden decision .   do you see the significance of this  porus .  these earthmen are sheer uncontrolled atomite .  they can t be handled .  were they twice the technological geniuses they are  they would be useless .  with their mob psychology  their mass panics  their superemotionalism  they simply won t fit into the humanoid picture .    porus raised an eyebrow .   comet gas .  individually  we are as emotional as they are .  they carry it into mass action and we don t  that s the only difference .     and that s enough .   exclaimed tubal .   we ve made our decision  porus .  we made it last night  at the height of the  .  .  .  the  .  .  .  of it .  the solar system is to be left to itself .  it is a plague spot and we want none of it .  as far as the galaxy is concerned  homo sol will be placed in strict quarantine .  that is final .    the rigellian laughed softly .   for the galaxy  it may be final .  but for homo sol .    tubal shrugged .   they don t concern us .    porus laughed again .   say  tubal .  just between the two of us  have you tried a time integration of equation     followed by expansion with karolean tensors .     no o .  i can t say i have .     well  then  just glance up and down these calculations and enjoy yourself .    the five scientists of the board grouped themselves about the sheets of paper porus had handed them .  expressions changed from interest to bewilderment and then to something approaching panic .   naru helvin tore the sheets across with a spasmodic movement .   it s a lie   he screeched .    we re a thousand years ahead of them now  and by that time we ll be advanced another two hundred years .   tubal snapped .   they won t be able to do anything against the mass of the galaxy s people .    tan porus laughed in a monotone  which is hard to do  but very unpleasant to hear .   you still don t believe mathematics .  that s in your behaviour pattern  of course .  all right  let s see if experts convince you   as they should  unless contact with these off normal humanoids has twisted you .  joselin   joselin arn   come in here .    the centaurian commander came in  saluted automatically  and looked expectant .    can one of your ships defeat one of the sol ships in battle  if necessary .    arn grinned sourly .   not a chance  sir .  these humanoids break kraut s law in panic   and also in fighting .  we have a corps of experts manning our ships  these people have a single crew that functions as a unit  without individuality .  they manifest a form of fighting   panic  i imagine  is the best word .  every individual on a ship becomes an organ of the ship .  with us  as you know  that s impossible .    furthermore  this world s a mass of mad geniuses .  they have  to my certain knowledge  taken no less than twenty two interesting but useless gadgets they saw in the thalsoon museum when they visited us  turned  em inside out and produced from them some of the most unpleasant military devices i ve seen .  you know of julmun thill s gravitational line tracer .  used   rather ineffectively   for spotting ore deposits before the modern electric potential method came in .    they ve turned it   somehow   into one of the deadliest automatic fire directors it s been my displeasure to see .  it will automatically lay a gun or projector on a completely invisible target in space  air  water or rock  for that matter .     we   said tan porus  gleefully   have far greater fleets than they .  we could overwhelm them  could we not .   joselin arn shook his head .   defeat them now   probably .  it wouldn t be overwhelming  though  and i wouldn t bet on it too heavily .  certainly wouldn t invite it .  the trouble is  in a military way  this collection of gadget maniacs invent things at a horrible rate .  technologically  they re as unstable as a wave in water  our civilization is more like a sand dune .  i ve seen their ground car plants install a complete plant of machine tools for production of a new model of automobile   and rip it out in six months because it s completely obsolete .    now we ve come in contact with their civilization briefly .  we ve learned the methods of one new civilization to add to our previous two hundred and eighty odd   a small percentage advantage .  they ve added one new civilization to their previous one   a one hundred percent advance .     how about   porus asked gently   our military position if we simply ignore them completely for two hundred years .    joselin arn gave an explosive little laugh .   if we could  which means if they d let us   i d answer offhand and with assurance .  they re all i d care to tackle right now .  two hundred years of exploring the new tracks suggested by their brief contact with us and they d be doing things i can t imagine .  wait two hundred years and there won t be a battle  there ll be an annexation .    tan porus bowed formally .  thank you  joselin am .  that was the result of my mathematical work .    joselin arn saluted and left the room .   turning to the five thoroughly paralyzed scientists  porus went on   and i hope these learned gentlemen still react in a vaguely humanoid way .  are you convinced that it is not up to us to decide to end all intercourse with this race .  we may  but they won t .    fools    he spat out the word    do you think i m going to waste time arguing with you .  i m laying down the law  do you understand .  homo sol shall enter the federation .  they are going to be trained into maturity in two hundred years .  and i m not asking you  i m telling you .   the rigellian stared up at them truculently .    come with me .   he growled brusquely .   they followed in tame submission and entered tan porus   sleeping quarters .  the little psychologist drew aside a curtain and revealed a life size painting .    make anything of that .    it was the portrait of an earthman  but of such an earthman as none of the psychologists had yet seen .  dignified and sternly handsome  with one hand stroking a regal beard  and the other holding the single flowing garment that clothed him  he seemed personified majesty .    that s zeus   said poms .   the primitive earthmen created him as the personification of storm and lightning .   he whirled upon the bewildered five .   does it remind you of anybody .     homo canopus .   ventured helvin uncertainly .   for a moment  porus  face relaxed in momentary gratification and then it hardened again .   of course   he snapped .   why do you hesitate about it .  that s canopus to the life  down to the full yellow beard .    then   here s something else .   he drew another curtain .   the portrait was of a female  this time .  full bosomed and wide hipped she was .  an ineffable smile graced her face and her hands seemed to caress the stalks of grain that sprang thickly about her feet .    demeter .   said porus .   the personification of agricultural fertility .  the idealized mother .  whom does that remind you of .    there was no hesitation this time .  five voices rang out as one   homo betelgeuse .    tan porus smiled in delight .   there you have it .  well .     well .   said tubal .    don t you see .   the smile faded .   isn t it clear .  nitwit .  if a hundred zeuses and a hundred demeters were to land on earth as part of a  trade mission   and turned out to be trained psychologists   now do you see .    semper gor laughed suddenly .   space  time and little meteors .  of course .  the earthmen would be putty in the hands of their own personifications of storm and motherhood come to life .  in two hundred years   why  in two hundred years  we could do anything .     but this so called trade mission of yours  porus   interposed prat .   how would you get homo sol to accept it in the first place .    porus cocked his head to one side .   dear colleague prat   he murmured   do you suppose that i created the passive panic just for the show   or just to gratify five woodenheads .  this passive panic paralyzed industry  and the terrestrial government is faced with revolution   another form of mob action that could use investigation .  offer them galactic trade and eternal prosperity and do you think they d jump at it .  has matter mass .    the rigellian cut short the excited babble that followed with an impatient gesture .   if you ve nothing more to ask  gentlemen  let s begin our preparations to leave .  frankly  i m tired of earth  and  more than that  i m blasted anxious to get back to that squid of mine .    he opened the door and shouted down the corridor   hey  haridin .  tell arn to have the ship ready in six hours .  we re leaving .     but .  .  .  but      the chorus of puzzled objections crystallized into sudden action as semper gor dashed at porus and snatched him back as he was on the point of leaving .  the little rigellian struggled vainly in the other s powerful grasp .    let go .     we ve endured enough  porus   said gor   and now you ll just calm down and behave like a humanoid .  whatever you say  we re not leaving until we re finished .  we ve got to arrange with the terrestrial government concerning the trade mission .  we ve got to secure approval of the board .  we ve got to pick our psychologist .  we ve got to       here porus  with a sudden jerk  freed himself .   do you suppose for one moment that i would wait for your precious board to start to begin to commence to consider doing something about the situation in two or three decades .    earth agreed to my terms unconditionally a month ago .  the squad of canopans and betelgeusans set sail five months ago  and landed day before yesterday .  it was only with their help that we managed to stop yesterday s panic   though you never suspected it .  you probably thought you did it yourself .  today  gentlemen  they have the situation in full control and your services are no longer needed .  we re going home .    the end     homo sol  has a plot of a sort that particularly appealed to campbell .  although the human beings in the story are far be  hind the other intelligences of the galaxy  it is clear that there is something special about them  that they have an unusual ability to move ahead very quickly  and that everyone else had better watch out for them .   campbell liked stories in which human beings proved themselves superior to other intelligences  even when those others were further advanced technologically .  it pleased him to have human beings shown to possess a unique spirit of daring  or a sense of humor  or a ruthless ability to kill when necessary  that always brought them victory over other intelligences  even against odds .   i sometimes got the uncomfortable notion  however  that this attitude reflected campbell s feelings on the smaller  earth scale .  he seemed to me to accept the natural superiority of americans over non americans  and he seemed automatically to assume the picture of an american as one who was of northwest european origin .   i cannot say that campbell was racist in any evil sense of the term .  i cannot recall any act of his that could be construed as unkind  and certainly he never  not once  made me feel uncomfortable over the fact that i was jewish .  nevertheless  he did seem to take for granted  somehow  the stereotype of the nordic white as the true representative of man the explorer  man the darer  man the victor .   i argued with him strenuously on the subject  or as violently as i dared  and in years to come our relationship was to be as nearly strained as it could be  considering our mutual affection  and all that i owed him  over the civil rights issue .  i was on the liberal side of the issue  he on the conservative  and our minds never met on that subject .   all this had an important bearing on my science fiction work .  i did not like campbell s attitude concerning humanity vis a vis other intelligences and it took two revisions of  homo sol  before campbell could move me close enough to what he wanted .  even then  he inserted several paragraphs  here and there  without consulting me  in the final version .   i tried to avoid such a situation in future .  one way out was to depart from the traditions of those writers who wove plots against the gigantic web of entire galaxies containing many intelligences   notably those of e .  e .  smith and of campbell himself .  instead  i began to think of stories involving a galaxy populated by human intelligences only .   this came to fruit  soon enough  in the  foundation  series .  undoubtedly the smith campbell view makes more sense .  it is almost certain that among the hundreds of billions of worlds in a large galaxy there ought to be hundreds or even thousands of different intelligent species .  that there should be only one  ourselves  as i postulated  is most unlikely .   some science fiction critics  notably sam moskowitz  have given me credit for inventing the human only galaxy  as though it were some kind of literary advance .  others may have thought privately  i have never heard it stated openly  that i had only human intelligences in my galaxy because i lacked the imagination to think up extraterrestrials .   but the fact is that i was only trying to avoid a collision with campbell s views  i did not want to set up a situation in which i would be forced to face the alternatives of adopting campbell s views when i found them repugnant and failing to sell a story  which i also found repugnant  .   on march           the day i put through my final submission of  homo sol   i went on to visit fred pohl at his office .  he told me that the response to  half breed  had been such that he felt justified in asking for a sequel .  it was the first time i had ever been requested to write a specific story with acceptance virtually guaranteed in advance .   i spent april and may working on the sequel   half breeds on venus   and submitted it to pohl on june   .  on june     he accepted it the story was ten thousand words long  the longest i had ever sold up to that time .  what s more  pohl s magazines were doing so well that his budget had been increased and he was able to pay me five eighths of a cent a word for it      .    .   it appeared in the issue of astonishing that reached the stands on october           two years almost to a day since my first sale .  this was a red letter day for me  too  since it was the first time that the cover painting on a magazine was ever taken from one of my stories .  i had  made the cover .    the title of the story and my name were on the cover in bold letters .  it was a flattering indication that my name could be counted on to sell magazines by this time .            half breeds on venus     the damp  somnolent atmosphere stirred violently and shrieked aside .  the bare plateau shook three times as the heavy egg shaped projectiles shot down from outer space .  the sound of the landing reverberated from the mountains on one side to the lush forest on the other  and then all was silent again .   one by one  three doors clanged open  and human figures stepped out in hesitant single file .  first slowly  and then with impatient turbulence  they set first foot upon the new world  until the space surrounding the ships was crowded .   a thousand pairs of eyes gazed upon the prospect and a thousand mouths chattered excitedly .  and in the other world wind  a thousand crests of foot high white hair swayed gracefully .   the tweenies had landed on venus .   max scanlon sighed wearily   here we are .    he turned from the porthole and slumped into his own special arm chair .   they re as happy as children   and i don t blame them .  we ve got a new world   one all for ourselves  and that s a great thing .  but just the same  there are hard days ahead of us .  i am almost afraid .  it is a project so lightly embarked upon  but one so hard to carry out to completion .    a gentle arm stole about his shoulder and he grasped it tightly  smiling into the soft  blue eyes that met his .   but you re not afraid  are you  madeline .     certainly not .   and then her expression grew sadder   if only father had come with us .  you   you know that he meant more to us than to the others .  we were the   the first he took under his wing  weren t we .    there was a long silence after that as each fell into deep thought .   max  . sighed   i remember him that day forty years ago   old suit  pipe  everything .  he took me in .  me  a despised halfbreed .  and   and he found you for me  madeline .     i know   there were tears in her eyes .   but he s still with us  max  and always will be   here  and there .   her hand crept first to her own heart and then to max s .    hey  there  dad  catch her  catch her .    max whirled at the sound of his elder son s voice  just in time to catch up the little bundle of flying arms and legs that catapulted into him .   he held her gravely up before him   shall i give you to your papa  elsie .  he wants you .    the little girl kicked her legs ecstatically .   no  no .  i want you  grand daddy .  i want you to give me a piggy back and come out with grandmamma to see how nice everything is .    max turned to his son  and motioned him sternly away   depart  despised father  and let old grand dad have a chance .    arthur laughed and mopped a red face   keep her  for heaven s sake .  she s been leading me and the wife a merry chase outside .  we had to drag her back by the dress to keep her from running off into the forest .  didn t we  elsie .    elsie  thus appealed to  suddenly recalled a past grievance .   grand daddy  tell him to let me see the pretty trees .  he doesn t want me to .   she wriggled from max s grasp and ran to the porthole .   see them  grand daddy  see them .  it s all trees outside .  it s not black anymore .  i hated it when it was black  didn t you .    max leaned over and ruffled the child s soft  white hair gravely   yes  elsie  i hated it when it was black .  but it isn t black anymore  and it won t ever be black again .  now go run to grandmamma .  she ll get some cake specially for you .  go ahead  run .    he followed the departing forms of his wife and granddaughter with smiling eyes  and then  as they turned to his son  they became serious once more .    well  arthur .     well  dad  what now .     there s no time to waste  son .  we ve got to start building immediately   underground .    arthur snapped into an attentive attitude   underground .   he frowned his dismay .    i know  i know .  i said nothing of this previously  but it s got to be done .  at all costs we must vanish from the face of the system .  there are earthmen on venus   purebloods .  there aren t many  it s true  but there are some .  they mustn t find us   at least  not until we are prepared for whatever may follow .  that will take years .     but father  underground .  .  to live like moles  hidden from light and air .  i don t like that .     oh  nonsense .  don t overdramatize .  we ll live on the surface   but the city  the power stations  the food and water reserves  the laboratories   all that must be below and impregnable .    the old tweenie gestured the subject away with impatience   forget that  anyway .  i want to talk about something else  something we ve discussed already .    arthur s eyes hardened and he shifted his glance to the ceiling .  max rose and placed his hands upon his son s brawny shoulders .    i m past sixty  arthur .  how long i have yet to live  i don t know .  in any case  the best of me belongs to the past and it is better that i yield the leadership to a younger  more vigorous person  .     dad  that s sentimental bosh and you know it .  there isn t one of us that s fit to wipe your shoes and no one is going to listen for a second to any plan of appointing a successor while you re still alive .     i m not going to ask them to listen .  it s done   and you re the new leader .    the younger man shook his head firmly   you can t make me serve against my will .    max smiled whimsically   i m afraid you re dodging responsibility  son .  you re leaving your poor old father to the strains and hardships of a job beyond his aged strength .     dad .   came the shocked retort .   that s not so .  you know it isn t .  you        then prove it .  look at it this way .  our race needs active leadership  and i can t supply it .  i ll always be here   while i live   to advise you and help you as best i can  but from now on  you must take the initiative .    arthur frowned and the words came from him reluctantly   all right  then .  i take  the job of field commander .  but remember  you re commander in chief .     good .  and now let s celebrate the occasion .   max opened a cupboard and withdrew a box  from which he abstracted a pair of cigars .  he sighed   the supply of tobacco is down to the vanishing point and we won t have any more until we grow our own  but   we ll smoke to the new leader .    blue smoke curled upwards and max frowned through it at his son   where s henry .    arthur grinned   dunno .  i haven t seen him since we landed .  i can tell you with whom he is  though .    max grunted   i know that  too .     the kid s making hay while the sun shines .  it won t be many years now  dad  before you ll be spoiling a second set of grandchildren .     if they re as good as the three of my first set  i only hope i live to see the day .    and father and son smiled affectionately at each other and listened in silence to the muted sound of happy laughter from the hundreds of tweenies outside .   henry scanlon cocked his head to one side  and raised his hand for silence   do you hear running water  irene .    the girl at his side nodded   over in that direction .     let s go there  then .  a river flashed by just before we landed and maybe that s it .     all right  if you say so  but i think we ought to be getting back to the ships .     what for .   henry stopped and stared .   i should think you d be glad to stretch your legs after weeks on a crowded ship .     well  it might be dangerous .     not here in the highlands  irene .  venusian highlands are practically a second earth .  you can see this is forest and not jungle .  now if we were in the coastal regions      he broke off short  as if he had just remembered something .   besides  what s there to be afraid of .  i m with you  aren t i .   and he patted the tonite gun at his hip .   irene repressed a sudden smile and shot an arch glance at her strutting companion   i m quite aware that you re with me .  that s the danger .    henry s chest deflated with an audible gasp .  he frowned .   very funny   and i on my best behavior  too .   he drifted away  brooded sulkily awhile  and then addressed the trees in a distant manner   which reminds me that tomorrow is daphne s birthday .  i ve promised her a present .     get her a reducing belt   came the quick retort .   fat thing .     who s fat .  daphne .  oh   i wouldn t say so .   he considered matters carefully  one thoughtful eye upon the young girl at his side .   now my description of her would be   shall we say    pleasingly plump   or  maybe   comfortably upholstered .       she s fat   irene s voice was suddenly a hiss  and something very like a frown wrinkled her lovely face   and her eyes are green .   she swung on ahead  chin high  and superbly conscious of her own little figure .   henry hastened his steps and caught up   of course  i prefer skinny girls any day .    irene whirled on him and her little fists clenched   i m not skinny  you incredibly stupid ape .     but irene  who said i meant you .   his voice was solemn  but his eyes were laughing .   the girl reddened to the ears and turned away  lower lip trembling .  the smile faded from henry s eyes and was replaced by a look of concern .  his arm shot out hesitantly and slipped about her shoulder .    angry  irene .    the smile that lit her face of a sudden was as brilliant as the sparkling sheen of her silvery hair in the bright sun    no   she said .   their eyes met and  for a moment  henry hesitated   and found that he who hesitates is lost  for with a sudden twist and a smothered laugh  irene was free once more .   pointing through a break in the trees  she cried   look  a lake .   and was off at a run .   henry scowled  muttered something under his breath and ran after .   the scene was truly earthly .  a rapids broken stream wound its way through banks of slender trunked trees and then spread into a placid lake some miles in width .  the brooding quiet was unbroken save by the muffled beat that issued from the throat bags of the frilled lizards that nested in the upper reaches of the trees .   the two tweenies   boy and girl   stood hand in hand upon the bank and drank in the beauty of the scene .   then there was a muffled splash near by and irene shrank into the encircling arms of her companion .    what s the matter .     n nothing .  something moved in the water  i think .     oh  imagination  irene .     no .  i did see something .  it came up and   oh  goodness  henry  don t squeeze so tightly       she almost lost her balance as henry suddenly dropped her altogether and jerked at his tonite gun .   immediately before them  a dripping green head lifted out of the water and regarded them out of wide set  staring goggle eyes .  its broad lipless mouth opened and closed rapidly  but not a sound issued forth .   max scanlon stared thoughtfully at the rugged foot hills ahead and clasped his hands behind his back .    you think so  do you .     certainly  dad   insisted arthur  enthusiastically .   if we burrow under these piles of granite  all earth couldn t get at us .  it wouldn t take two months to form the entire cavern  with our unlimited power .     hmph .  it will require care .     it will get it .     mountainous regions are quake regions .     we can rig up enough stat rays to hold up all venus  quakes or no quakes .     stat rays eat up energy wholesale  and a breakdown that will leave us energyless would mean the end .     we can hook up five separate power houses   as foolproof as we can make them .  all five won t break down at once .    the old tweenie smiled .   all right  son .  i see you ve got it planned thoroughly .  go ahead .  start whenever you want  and remember  it s all up to you .     good .  let s get back to the ships .   they picked their way gingerly down the rocky slope .    you know  arthur   said max  stopping suddenly   i ve been thinking about those stat beams .     yes .   arthur offered his arm  and the two resumed their walk .    it s occurred to me that if we could make them two dimensional in extent and curve them  we d have the perfect defense  as long as our energy lasted   a stat field .     you need four dimensional radiation for that  dad   nice to think about but can t be done .     oh  is that so .  well  listen to this       what arthur was to listen to remained hidden  however  for that day at least .  a piercing shout ahead jerked both their heads upward .  up towards them came the bounding form of henry scanlon  and following him  at a goodly distance and a much more leisurely pace  came irene .    say  dad  i had a devil of a time finding you .  where were you .     right here  son .  where were you .     oh  just around .  listen  dad .  you know those amphibians the explorers talk about as inhabiting the highland lakes of venus  don t you .  well  we ve located them  lots of them  a regular convoy of them .  haven t we  irene .    irene paused to catch her breath and nodded her head   they re the cutest things  mr .  scanlon .  all green .   she wrinkled her nose laughingly .   arthur and his father exchanged glances of doubt .  the former shrugged .   are you sure you haven t been seeing things .  i remember once  henry  when you sighted a meteor in space  scared us all to death  and then had it turn out to be your own reflection in the port glass .    henry  painfully aware of irene s snicker  thrust out a belligerent lower lip   say  art  i guess you re looking for a shove in the face .  and i m old enough to give it to you  too .     whoa there  quiet down   came the peremptory voice of the elder scanlon   and you  arthur  had better learn to respect your younger brother s dignity .  now here  henry  all arthur meant was that these amphibians are as shy as rabbits .  no one s ever caught more than a glimpse of them .     well  we have  dad .  lots of them .  i guess they were attracted by irene .  no one can resist her .     i know you can t   and arthur laughed loudly .   henry stiffened once more  but his father stepped between .   grow up  you two .  let s go and see these amphibians .     this is amazing   exclaimed max scanlon .   why  they re as friendly as children  i can t understand it .    arthur shook his head   neither can i  dad .  in fifty years  no explorer has ever gotten a good look at one  and here they are thick as flies .    henry was throwing pebbles into the lake .   watch this  all of you .    a pebble curved its way into the water  and as it splashed six green forms turned a back somersault and slid smoothly below the surface .  with no time for a breath between  one was up again and the pebble arced back to fall at henry s feet .   the amphibians were crowding closer in ever increasing numbers now  approaching the very edge of the lake  where they grasped at the coarse reeds on the bank and stared goggle eyed at the tweenies .  their muscular webbed legs could  be seen below the surface of the water  moving back and forth with lazy grace .  without cessation  the lipless mouths opened and closed in a queer  uneven rhythm .    i think they re talking  mr .  scanlon   said irene  suddenly .    it s quite possible   agreed the old tweenie  thoughtfully .   their brain cases are fairly large  and they may possess considerable intelligence .  if their voice boxes and ears are tuned to sound waves of higher or lower range than our own  we would be unable to hear them   and that might very well explain their boundlessness .     they re probably discussing us as busily as we are them   said arthur .    yes  and wondering what sort of freaks we are   added irene .   henry said nothing .  he was approaching the edge of the lake with cautious steps .  the ground grew muddy beneath his feet  and the reeds thick .  the group of amphibians nearest turned anxious eyes toward him  and one or two loosened their hold and slipped silently away .   but the nearest held his ground .  his wide mouth was clamped tight  his eyes were wary   but he did not move .   henry  paused  hesitated  and then held out his hand   hiya  phib .    the  phib  stared at the outstretched hand .  very cautiously  his own webbed forelimb stretched out and touched the tweenie s fingers .  with a jerk  they were drawn back  and the phib s mouth worked in soundless excitement .    be careful   came max s voice from behind .   you ll scare him that way .  his skin is terribly sensitive and dry objects must irritate him .  dip your hand in the water .    slowly  henry obeyed .  the phib s muscles tensed to escape at the slightest sudden motion  but none came .  again the tweenie s hand was held out  dripping wet this time .   for a long minute  nothing happened  as the phib seemed to debate within itself the future course of action .  and then  after two false starts and hasty withdrawals  fingers touched again .    ataphib   said henry  and clasped the green hand in his own .   a single  startled jerk followed and then a lusty return of pressure to an extent that numbed the tweenie s fingers .  evidently encouraged by the first phib s example  his fellows were crowding close now  offering hosts of hands .   the other three tweenies slushed up through the mud now  and offered wetted hands in their turn .    that s funny   said irene .   every time i shake hands i seem to keep thinking of hair .    max turned to her   hair .     yes  ours .  i get a picture of long  white hair  standing straight up and shining in the sun .   her hand rose unconsciously to her own smooth tresses .    say .   interrupted henry suddenly   i ve been noticing that  too  now that you mention it .  only when i shake hands  though .     how about you  arthur .   asked max .   arthur nodded once  his eyebrows climbing .   max smiled and pounded fist into palm .   why  it s a primitive sort of telepathy   too weak to work without physical contact and even then capable of delivering only a few simple ideas .     but why hair  dad .   asked arthur .    maybe it s our hair that attracted them in the first place .  they ve never seen anything like it and   and   well  who can explain their psychology .    he was down on his knees suddenly  splashing water over his high crest of hair .  there was a frothing of water and a surging of green bodies as the phibs pressed closer .  one green paw passed gently through the stiff white crest  followed by excited  if noiseless  chattering .  struggling among themselves for favored vantage points  they competed for the privilege of touching the hair until max  for sheer weariness  was forced to rise again .    they re probably our friends for life now   he said .   a pretty queer set of animals .    it was irene  then  who noticed the group of phibs a hundred yards from shore .  they paddled quietly  making no effort to approach closer .   why don t they come .   she asked .   she turned to one of the foremost phibs and pointed  making frantic gestures of dubious meaning .  she received only solemn stares in return .    that s not the way  irene   admonished max  gently .  he held out his hand  grasped that of a willing phib and stood motionless for a moment .  when he loosed his grip  the phib slid into the water and disappeared .  in a moment  the laggard phibs were approaching shore slowly .    how did you do it .   gasped irene .    telepathy .  i held on tightly and pictured an isolated group of phibs and a long hand stretching out over the water to shake theirs .   he smiled gently   they are quite intelligent  or they would not have understood so readily .     why  they re females   cried arthur  in sudden breathless astonishment .   by all that s holy   they suckle their young .    the newcomers were slenderer and lighter in color than the others .  they advanced shyly  urged on by the bolder males and held out timid hands in greeting .    oh h   irene cried in sudden delight .   look at this .    she was down on her knees in the mud  arms outstretched to the nearest female .  the other three watched in fascinated silence as the nervous she phib clasped its tiny armful closer to its breast .   but irene s arms made little inviting gestures   please  please .  it s so cute .  i won t hurt him .    whether the phib mother understood is doubtful  but with a sudden motion  she held out a little green bundle of squirming life and deposited it in the waiting arms .   irene rose  squealing with delight .  little webbed feet kicked aimlessly and round frightened eyes stared at her .  the other three crowded close and watched it curiously .    it s the dearest little thing  it is .  look at its funny little mouth .  do you want to hold it  henry .    henry jumped backwards as if stung   not on your life .  i d probably drop it .     do you get any thought images  irene .   asked max  thoughtfully .   irene considered and frowned her concentration   no o .  it s too young  maybe   oh  yes .  it s   it s      she stopped  and tried to laugh .   it s hungry .    she returned the little baby phib to its mother  whose mouth worked in transports of joy and whose muscular arms clasped the little mite close .  the tiny phib swiveled its little green head to bend one last goggling look at the creature that had held it for an instant .    friendly creatures   said max   and intelligent .  they can keep their lakes and rivers .  we ll take the land and won t interfere with them .    a lone tweenie stood on scanlon ridge and his field glass pointed at the divide ten miles up the hills .  for five minutes  the glass did not waver and the tweenie stood like some watchful statue made of the same rock as formed the mountains all about .   and then the field glass lowered  and the tweenie s face was a pale thin lipped picture of gloom .  he hastened down the slope to the guarded  hidden entrance to venustown .   he shot past the guards without a word and descended into the lower levels where solid rock was still being puffed into nothingness and shaped at will by controlled blasts of super energy .   arthur scanlon looked up and with a sudden premonition of disaster  gestured the disintegrators to a halt .    what s wrong  sorrell .    the tweenie leant over and whispered a single word into arthur s ear .    where .   arthur s voice jerked out hoarsely .    on the other side of the ridge .  they re coming through the divide now in our direction .  i spotted the blaze of sun on metal and      he held up his field glass significantly .    good lord .   arthur rubbed his forehead distractedly and then turned to the anxiously watching tweenie at the controls of the disinto .   continue as planned .  no change .    he hurried up the levels to the entrance  and snapped out hurried orders   triple the guard immediately .  no one but me or those with me  are to be permitted to leave .  send out men to round up any stragglers outside immediately and order them to keep within shelter and make so unnecessary sound .    then  back again through the central avenue to his father s quarters .   max scanlon looked up from his calculations and his grave forehead smoothed out slowly .    hello  son .  is anything wrong .  another resistant stratum .     no  nothing like that .   arthur closed the door carefully and lowered his voice .   earthmen .    for a moment  max made no movement .  the expression on his face froze for an instant  and then  with a sudden exhalation  he slumped in his chair and the lines in his forehead deepened wearily .    settlers .     looks so .  sorrell said women and children were among them .  there were several hundred in all  equipped for a stay  and headed in this direction .    max groaned   oh  the luck  the luck .  all the vast empty spaces of venus to choose and they come here .  come  let s get a firsthand look at this .    they came through the divide in a long  snaky line .  hardbitten pioneers with their pinched work worn women and their carefree  half barbarous  wilderness bred children .  the low  broad  venus vans  joggled clumsily over the untrodden ways  loaded down with amorphous masses of household necessities .   the leaders surveyed the prospect and one spoke in clipped  jerky syllables   almost through  jem .  we re out among the foothills now .    and the other replied slowly   and there s good new growing land ahead .  we can stake out farms and settle down .   he sighed   it s been tough going this last month .  i m glad it s over .    and from a ridge ahead   the last ridge before the valley  the scanlons  father and son  unseen dots in the distance  watched the newcomers with heavy hearts .   the one thing we could not prepare for   and it s happened .    arthur spoke slowly and reluctantly   they are few and unarmed .  we can drive them out in an hour .   with sudden fierceness   venus is ours .     yes  we can drive them out in an hour   in ten minutes .  but they would return  in thousands  and armed .  we re not ready to fight all earth  arthur .    the younger man bit his lip and words were muttered forth half in shame   for the sake of the race  father   we could kill them all .     never .   exclaimed max  his old eyes flashing .   we will not be the first to strike .  if we kill  we can expect no mercy from earth  and we will deserve none .     but  father  what else .  we can expect no mercy from earth as it is .  if we re spotted    if they ever suspect our existence  pur whole hegira becomes pointless and we lose out at the very beginning .     i know .  i know .     we can t change now   continued arthur  passionately .   we ve spent months preparing venustown .  how could we start over .     we can t   agreed max  tonelessly .   to even attempt to move would mean sure discovery .  we can only        live like moles after all .  hunted fugitives .  frightened refugees .  is that it .     put it any way you like   but we must hide  arthur  and bury ourselves .     until    .     until i   or we   perfect a curved two dimensional stat beam .  surrounded by an impermeable defense  we can come out into the open .  it may take years  it may take one week .  i don t know .     and every day we run the risk of detection .  any day the swarms of purebloods can come down upon us and wipe us out .  we ve got to hang on by a hair day after day  week after week  month after month        we ve got to .   max s mouth was clamped shut  and his eyes were a frosty blue .   slowly  they went back to venustown .   things were quiet in venustown  and eyes were turned to the topmost level and the hidden exits .  out there was air and the sun and space   and earthmen .   they had settled several miles up the river bed .  their rude houses were springing up .  surrounding land was being cleared .   farms were being staked out .  planting was taking place .   and in the bowels of venus  eleven hundred tweenies shaped their home and waited for an old man to track down the elusive equations that would enable a stat ray to spread in two dimensions and curve .   irene brooded somberly as she sat upon the rocky ledge and stared ahead to where the dim gray light indicated the existence of an exit to the open .  her shapely legs swung gently back and forth and henry scanlon  at her side  fought desperately to keep his gaze focussed harmlessly upon air .    you know what  henry .     what .     i ll bet the phibs could help us .     help us do what  irene .     help us get rid of the earthmen .    henry thought it over carefully   what makes you think that .     well  they re pretty clever   cleverer than we think .  their minds are altogether different  though  and maybe they could fix it .  besides   i ve just got a feeling .   she withdrew her hand suddenly   you don t have to hold it  henry .    henry swallowed   i   i thought you had a sort of unsteady seat there   might fall  you know .     oh .   irene looked down the terrific three foot drop .   there s something hi what you say .  it does look pretty high here .    henry decided he was in the presence of a hint  and acted accordingly .  there was a moment s silence while he seriously considered the possibility of her feeling a bit chilly   but before he had quite decided that she probably was  she spoke again .    what i was going to say  henry  was this .  why don t we go out and see the phibs .     dad would take my head off if i tried anything like that .     it would be a lot of fun .     sure  but it s dangerous .  we can t risk anyone seeing us .    irene shrugged resignedly   well  if you re afraid  we ll say no more about it .    henry gasped and reddened .  he was off the ledge in a bound   who s afraid .  when do you want to go .     right now  henry .  right this very minute .   her cheeks flushed with enthusiasm .    all right then .  come on .   he started off at a half run  dragging her along .    and then a thought occurred to him and he stopped short .   he turned to her fiercely   i ll show you if i m afraid .   his arms were suddenly about her and her little cry of surprise was muffled effectively .    goodness   said irene  when in a position to speak once more .   how thoroughly brutal .     certainly .  i m a very well known brute   gasped henry  as he uncrossed his eyes and got rid of the swimming sensation in his head .   now let s get to those phibs  and remind me  when i m president  to put up a memorial to the fellow who invented kissing .    up through the rock lined corridor  past the backs of outward gazing sentries  out through the carefully camouflaged opening  and they were upon the surface .   the smudge of smoke on the southern horizon was grim evidence of the presence of man  and with that in mind  the two young tweenies slithered through the underbrush into the forest and through the forest to the lake of the phibs .   whether in some strange way of their own the phibs sensed the presence of friends  the two could not tell  but they had scarcely reached the banks when approaching dull green smudges beneath water told of the creatures  coming .   a wide  goggle eyed head broke the surface  and  in a second  bobbing frogheads dotted the lake .   henry wet his hand and seized the friendly forelimb outstretched to him .    hi there  phib .    the grinning mouth worked and made its soundless answer .    ask him about the earthmen  henry   urged irene .  henry motioned impatiently .    wait a while .  it takes time .  i m doing the best i can .    for two slow minutes  the two  tweenie and phib  remained motionless and stared into each other s eyes .  and then the phib broke away and  at some silent order  every lake creature vanished  leaving the tweenies alone .   irene stared for a moment  nonplussed   what happened .    henry shrugged   i don t know .  i pictured the earthmen and he seemed to know who i meant .  then i pictured earthmen fighting us and killing us   and he pictured a lot of us and only a few of them and another fight in which we killed them .  but then i pictured us killing them and then a lot more of them coming   hordes and hordes   and killing us and then       but the girl was holding her hands to her tortured ears   oh  my goodness .  no wonder the poor creature didn t understand .  i wonder he didn t go crazy .     well  i did the best i could   was the gloomy response .   this was all your nutty idea  anyway .    irene got no further with her retort than the opening syllable  for in a moment the lake was crowded with phibs once more .   they ve come back   she said instead .   a phib pushed forward and seized henry s hand while the others crowded around in great excitement .  there were several moments of silence and irene fidgeted .    well .   she said .    quiet  please .  i don t get it .  something about big animals  or monsters  or     his voice trailed away  and the furrow between his eyes deepened into painful concentration .   he nodded  first abstractedly  then vigorously .   he broke away and seized irene s hands .   i ve got it   and it s the perfect solution .  we can save venustown all by ourselves  irene  with the help of the phibs   if you want to come to the lowlands with me tomorrow .  we can take along a pair of tonite pistols and food supplies and if we follow the river  it oughtn t to take us more than two or three days there and the same time back .  what do you say  irene .    youth is not noted for forethought .  irene s hesitation was for effect only   well   maybe we shouldn t go ourselves  but  but i ll go   with you .   there was the lightest accent on the last word .   ten seconds later  the two were on their way to venustown  and henry was wondering  if on the whole  it weren t better to put up two memorials to the fellow who invented kissing .   the flickering red yellow of the fire sent back ruddy highlights from henry s lordly crest of hair and cast shifting shadows upon his brooding face .   it was hot in the lowlands  and the fire made it worse  yet henry huddled close and kept an anxious eye upon the sleeping form of irene on the other side .  the teeming life of the venusian jungle respected fire  and the flames spelt safety .   they were three days from the plateau now .  the stream had become a lukewarm  slowly moving river  the shores of which were covered with the green scum of algae .  the pleasant forests had given way to the tangled  vine looped growths of the jungle .  the mingled sounds of life had grown in volume and increased to a noisy crescendo .  the air became warmer and damper  the ground swampier  the surroundings more fantastically unfamiliar .   and yet there was no real danger   of that  henry was convinced .  poisonous life was unknown on venus  and as for the tough skinned monsters that lorded the jungles  the fire at night and the phibs during day would keep them away .   twice the ear splitting shriek of a centosaur had sounded in the distance and twice the sound of crashing trees had caused the two tweenies to draw together in fear .  both times  the monsters had moved away again .   this was the third night out  and henry stirred uneasily .  the phibs seemed confident that before morning they could start their return trip  and somehow the thought of venustown was rather attractive .  adventure and excitement are fine and with every passing hour the glory of his scintillating bravery grew in irene s eyes   which was wonderful   but still venus town and the friendly highlands were nice to think about .   he threw himself on his stomach and gazed morosely into the fire  thinking of his twenty years of age   almost twenty years .    why  heck   he tore at the rank grass beneath .   it s about time i was thinking of getting married .   and his eye strayed involuntarily to the sleeping form beyond the fire .   as if in response  there was a flickering of eyelids and a vague stare out of deep blue eyes .   irene sat up and stretched .    i can t sleep at all   she complained  brushing futilely at her  white hair .   it s so hot .   she stared at the fire distastefully .   henry s good humor persisted .   you slept for hours   and snored like a trombone .    irene s eyes snapped wide open   i did not .   then  with a voice vibrant with tragedy   did i .     no  of course not .   henry howled his laughter  stopping only at the sudden  sharp contact between the toe of irene s shoe and the pit of his own stomach .   ouch   he said .    don t speak to me anymore  mister scanlon .   was the girl s frigid remark .   it was henry s turn to look tragic .  he rose in panicky dismay and took a simple step toward the girl .  and then he froze in his tracks at the ear piercing shriek of a centosaur .  when he came to himself  he found his arms full of irene .   reddening  she disentangled herself  and then the cento saurian shriek sounded again  from another direction    and there she was  right back again .   henry s face was pale  in spite of his fair armful .   i think the phibs have snared the centosaurs .  come with me and i ll ask them .    the phibs were dim blotches in the gray dawn that was breaking .  rows and rows of strained  abstracted individuals were all that met the eye .  only one seemed to be unoccupied and when henry rose from the handclasp  he said   they ve got three centosaurs and that s all they can handle .  we re starting back to the highlands right now .    the rising sun found the party two miles up the river .  the tweenies  hugging the shore  cast wary eyes toward the bordering jungle .  through an occasional clearing  vast gray bulks could be made out .  the noise of the reptilian shrieks was almost continuous .    i m sorry i brought you  irene   said henry .   i m not so sure now that the phibs can take care of the monsters .    irene shook her head .   that s all right  henry .  i  wanted to come .  only   i wish we had thought of letting the phibs bring the beasts themselves .  they don t need us .     yes  they do .  if a centosaur gets out of control  it will make straight for the tweenies and they d never get away .  we ve got the tonite guns to kill the  saurs with if the worst comes to the worst     his voice trailed away and he glanced at the lethal weapon in his hand and derived but cold comfort there form .   the first night was sleepless for both tweenies .  somewhere  unseen in the blackness of the river  phibs took shifts and their telepathic control over the tiny brains of the gigantic  twenty legged centosaurs maintained its tenuous hold .  off in the jungle  three hundred ton monsters howled impatiently against the force that drove them up the river side against their will and raved impotently against the unseen barrier that prevented them from approaching the stream .   by the side of the fire  a pair of tweenies  lost between mountainous flesh on one side and the fragile protection of a telepathic web on the other  gazed longingly towards the highlands some forty miles off .   progress was slow .  as the phibs tired  the centosaurs grew balkier .  but gradually  the air grew cooler .  the rank jungle growth thinned out and the distance to venustown shortened .   henry greeted the first signs of familiar temperate zone forest with a tremulous sigh of relief .  only irene s presence prevented him from discarding his role of heroism .   he felt pitifully eager for their quixotic journey to be over  but he only said   it s practically all over but the shouting .  and you can bet there ll be shouting  irene .  we ll be heroes  you and i .    irene s attempt at enthusiasm was feeble .   i m tired  henry .  let s rest .   she sank slowly to the ground  and henry  after signalling the phibs  joined her .    how much longer  henry .   almost without volition  she found her head nestling wearily against his shoulder .    one more day  irene .  tomorrow this time  we ll be back .   he looked wretched   you think we shouldn t have tried to do this ourselves  don t you .     well  it seemed a good idea at the time .     yes  i know   said henry .   i ve noticed that i get lots of ideas that seem good at the time  but sometimes they turn sour .   he shook his head philosophically   i don t know why  but that s the way it is .     all i know   said irene   is that i don t care if i never move another step in my life .  i wouldn t get up now      her voice died away as her beautiful blue eyes stared off toward the right .  one of the centosaurs stumbled into the waters of a small tributary to the stream they were following .  wallowing in the water  his huge serpentine body mounted on the ten stocky pairs of legs  glistened horribly .  his ugly head weaved towards the sky and his terrifying call pierced the air .  a second joined him .   irene was on her feet .   what are you waiting for  henry .  let s go .  hurry .    henry gripped his tonite gun tightly and followed .   arthur scanlon gulped savagely at his fifth cup of black coffee and  with an effort  brought the audiomitter into optical focus .  his eyes  he decided  were becoming entirely too balky .  he rubbed them into red rimmed irritation and cast a glance over his shoulder at the restlessly sleeping figure on the couch .   he crept over to her and adjusted the coverlet .    poor mom   he whispered  and bent to kiss the pale lips .  he turned to the audiomitter and clenched a fist at it   wait till i get you  you crazy nut .    madeline stirred   is it dark yet .     no   lied arthur with feeble cheerfulness .   he ll call before sundown  mom .  you just sleep and let me take care of things .  dad s upstairs working on that stat field and he says he s making progress .  in a few days everything will be all right .   he sat silently beside her and grasped her hand tightly .  her tired yes closed once more .   the signal light blinked on and  with a last look at his mother  he stepped out into the corridor   well .    the waiting tweenie saluted smartly   john barno wants to say that it looks as if we are in for a storm .   he handed over an official report .   arthur glanced at it peevishly   what of that .  we ve had plenty so far  haven t we .  what do you expect of venus .     this will be a particularly bad one  from all indications .  the barometer has fallen unprecedentedly .  the ionic concentration of the upper atmosphere is at an unequalled maximum .  the beiilah river has overflowed its banks and is rising rapidly .    the other frowned .   there s not an entrance to venustown that isn t at least fifty yards above river level .  as for rain   our drainage system is to be relied upon .   he grimaced suddenly   go back and tell barno that it can storm for my part   for forty days and forty nights if it wants to .  maybe it will drive the earthmen away .    he turned away  but the tweenie held his ground   beg pardon sir  but that s not the worst .  a scouting party today       arthur whirled .   a scouting party .  who ordered one to be sent out .     your father  sir .  they were to make contact with the phibs   i don t know why .     well  go on .     sir  the phibs could not be located .    and now  for the first time  arthur was startled out of his savage ill hum or   they were gone .    the tweenie nodded .   it is thought that they have sought shelter from the coming storm .  it is that which causes barno to fear the worst .     they say rats desert a sinking ship   murmured arthur .  he buried his head in trembling hands .   god .  everything at once .  everything at once .    the darkening twilight hid the pall of blackness that lowered over the mountains ahead and emphasized the darting flashes of lightning that flickered on and off continuously .   irene shivered   it s getting sort of windy and chilly  isn t it .     the cold wind from the mountains .  we re in for a storm  i guess   henry assented absently .   i think the river is getting wider .    a short silence  and then  with suddenly vivacity  .   but look  irene  only a few more miles to the lake and then we re practically at the earth village .  it s almost over .    irene nodded   i m glad for all of us   and the phibs  too .    she had reason for the last statement .  the phibs were swimming slowly now .  an additional detachment had arrived the day before from upstream  but even with those reinforcements  progress had slowed to a walk .  unaccustomed cold was nipping the multi legged reptiles and they yielded to superior mental force more and more reluctantly .   the first drops fell just after they had passed the lake .  darkness had fallen  and in the blue glare of the lightning the trees about them were ghostly specters reaching swaying fingers toward the sky .  a sudden flare in the distance marked the funeral pyre of a lightning hit tree .   henry paled .   make for the clearing just ahead .  at a time like this  trees are dangerous .    the clearing he spoke of composed the outskirts of the earth village .  the rough hewn houses  crude and small against the fury of the elements  showed lights here and there that spoke of human occupancy .  and as the first centosaur stumbled out from between splintered trees  the storm suddenly burst in all its fury .   the two tweenies huddled close .   it s up to the phibs   screamed henry  dimly heard above the wind and rain .   i hope they can do it .    the three monsters converged upon the houses ahead .  they moved more rapidly as the phibs called up every last line of mental power .   irene buried her wet head in henry s equally wet shoulder   i can t look .  those houses will go like matchsticks .  oh  the poor people .     no  irene  no .  they ve stopped .    the centosaurs pawed vicious gouges out of the ground beneath and their screams rang shrill and clear above the noise of the storm .  startled earthmen rushed from their cabins .   caught unprepared   most having been roused from sleep  and faced with a venusian storm and nightmarish venusian monsters  there was no question of organized action .  as they stood  carrying nothing but their clothes  they broke and ran .   there was the utmost confusion .  one or two  with dim attempts at presence of mind  took wild  ineffectual pot shots at the mountains of flesh before them   and then ran .   and when it seemed that all were gone  the giant reptiles surged forward once more and where once had been houses  there were left only mashed splinters .    they ll never come back  irene  they ll never come back .   henry was breathless at the success of his plan .   we re heroes now  and      his voice rose to a hoarse shriek   irene  get back .  make for the trees .    the centosaurian howls had taken on a deeper note .  the nearest one reared onto his two hindmost pairs of legs and his great head  two hundred feet above ground  was silhouetted horribly against the lightning .  with a rumbling thud  he came down on all feet again and made for the river   which under the lash of the storm was now a raging flood .   the phibs had lost control .   henry s tonite gun flashed into quick action as he shoved irene away .  she  however  backed away slowly and brought her own gun into line .   the ball of purple light that meant a hit blazed into being and the nearest centosaur screamed in agony as its mighty tail threshed aside the surrounding trees .  blindly  the hole where once a leg had been gushing blood  it charged .   a second glare of purple and it was down with an earth shaking thud  its last shriek reaching a crescendo of shrill frightfulness .   but the other two monsters were crashing toward them .  they blundered blindly toward the source of the power that had held them captive almost a week  driving violently with all the force of their mindless hate to the river .  and in the path of the juggernauts were the two tweenies .   the boiling torrent was at their backs .  the forest was a groaning wilderness of splintered trees and ear splitting sound .   then  suddenly  the report of tonite guns sounded from the distance .  purple glares   a flurry of threshing   spasmodic shrieking   and then a silence in which even the wind  as if overawed by recent events  held its peace momentarily .   henry yelled his glee and performed an impromptu war dance .   they ve come from venustown  irene   he shouted .   they ve got the centosaurs and everything s finished .  we ve saved the tweenies .    it happened in a breath s time .  irene had dropped her gun and sobbed her relief .  she was running to henry and then she tripped   and the river had her .    henry .   the wind whipped the sound away .   for one dreadful moment  henry found himself incapable of motion .  he could only stare stupidly  unbelievingly  at the spot where irene had been  and then he was in the water .  he plunged into the surrounding blackness desperately .    irene .   he caught his breath with difficulty .  the current drove him on .    irene .   no sound but the wind .  his efforts at swimming were futile .  he couldn t even break surface for more than a second at a time  his lungs were bursting .    irene .   there was no answer .  nothing but rushing water and darkness .   and then something touched him .  he lashed out at it instinctively  but the grip tightened .  he felt himself borne up into the air .  his tortured lungs breathed in gasps .  a grinning phib face stared into his and after that there was nothing but confused impressions of cold  dark wetness .   he became aware of his surroundings by stages .  first  that he was sitting on a blanket under the trees  with other blankets wrapped tightly about him .  then  he felt the warm radiation of the heat lamps upon him and the illumination of atomo bulbs .  people were crowding close and he noticed that it was no longer raining .   he stared about him hazily and then   irene .    she was beside him  as wrapped up as he  and smiling feebly   i m all right  henry .  the phibs dragged me back  too .    madeline was bending over him and he swallowed the hot coffee placed to his lips .   the phibs have told us of what you two have helped them do .  we re all proud of you  son   you and irene .    max s smile transfigured his face into the picture of paternal pride   the psychology you used was perfect .  venus is too vast and has too many friendly areas to expect earthmen to return to places that have shown themselves to be infested with centosaurs   not for a good long while .  and when they do come back  we shall have our stat field .    arthur scanlon hurried up out of the gloom .  he thwacked henry on the shoulder and then wrong irene s hand .   your guardian and i   he told her   are fixing up a celebration for day after tomorrow  so get good and rested .  it s going to be the greatest thing you ever saw .    henry spoke up   celebration  huh .  well  i ll tell you what you can do .  after it s over  you can announce an engagement .     an engagement .   madeline sat up and looked interested .   what do you mean .     an engagement   to be married   came the impatient answer .   i m old enough  i suppose .  today proves it .    irene s eyes bent in furious concentration upon the grass   with whom  henry .     huh .  with you  of course .  gosh  who else could it be .     but you haven t asked me .   the words were uttered slowly and with great firmness .   for a moment henry flushed  and then his jaws grew grim   well  i m not going to .  i m telling you .  and what are you going to do about it .    he leaned close to her and max scanlon chuckled and motioned the others away .  on tip toes  they left .   a dim shape hobbled into view and the two tweenies separated in confusion .  they had forgotten the others .   but it wasn t another tweenie .   why   why  it s a phib .   cried irene .   he limped his ungainly way across the wet grass  with the inexpert aid of his muscular arms .  approaching  he flopped wearily on his stomach and extended his forearms .   his purpose was plain .  irene and henry grasped a hand apiece .  there was silence a moment or two and the phib s great eyes glinted solemnly in the light of the atomo lamps .  then there was a sudden squeal of embarrassment from irene and a shy laugh from henry .  contact was broken .    did you get the same thing i did .   asked henry .   irene was red   yes  a long row of little baby phibs  maybe fifteen        or twenty   said henry .      with long white hair .    the end    the story  not surprisingly  reflects my personal situation at the time .  i had gone to a boys  high school and to a boys  college .  now that i was in graduate school  however  the surroundings were  for the first time  coeducational .   in the fall of       i discovered that a beautiful blond girl had the desk next to mine in the laboratory of my course in synthetic organic chemistry .  naturally i was attracted .   i persuaded her to go out with me on simple dates  the very first being on my twentieth birthday  when i took her to radio city music hall .  for five months  i mooned after her with feckless romanticism .   at the end of the school year  though  she had earned her master of arts degree and  having decided not to go on for her doctorate  left school and took a job in wilmington  delaware  leaving me behind  woebegone and stricken .   i got over it  of course  but while she was still at school i wrote  half breeds on venus .   of all the stories i had yet written  it was the most heavily boy and girl .  the heroine s name was irene  which was the name of my pretty blond lab neighbor .   merely having a few dates on the hand holding level did not  however  perform the magic required to make me capable of handling passion in literature  and i continued to use girls sparingly in later stories   and a good thing  too  i think .   the success of  half breeds on venus  made the notion of writing sequels generally seem a good idea .  a sequel to a successful story must  after all  be a reasonably sure sale .  so even while i was working on  half breeds on venus   i suggested to campbell that i write a sequel to  homo sol .    campbell s enthusiasm was moderate  but he was willing to look at such a sequel if i were to write it .  i did write it as soon as  half breeds on venus  was done and called it  the imaginary .   although it used one of the chief characters of  homo sol   the human nonhuman confrontation was absent  which probably didn t help it as far as campbell was concerned .  i submitted it to him on june     and received it back   a rejection  sequel or no sequel   on june    .   pohl rejected it  too .  tremaine read it with more sympathy and was thinking of taking it for comet  i heard  but that magazine ceased publication and the story was back on the market .  actually  i retired it  but two years later i sold it to pohl s magazine after all   but at a time when pohl was no longer editor .   but though i had my troubles and didn t click every time  or even right away  i did manage to make      during my first year as a graduate student  and that was an enormous help .            the imaginary     the telecaster flashed its fitful signal  while tan porus sat by complacently .  his sharp  green eyes glittered their triumph  and his tiny body was vibrant with excitement .  nothing could have better indicated the greatness of the occasion than his extraordinary position   tan porus had his feet on the desk .   the  caster glowed into life and a broad arcturian countenance frowned fretfully out at the rigellian psychologist   do you have to drag me here straight from bed  porus .  it s the middle of the night .     it s broad daylight in this part of the world  final .  but i ve got something to tell you that ll make you forget all about sleep .    gar final  editor of the j . g . p .    journal of galactic psychology   allowed a look of alertness to cross his face .  whatever tan porus s faults   and arcturus knew they were many  he had never issued a false alarm .  if he said something great was in the air  it was not merely great   it was colossal .   it was quite evident that porus was enjoying himself .   final   he said   the next article i send to your rag is going to be the greatest thing you ve ever printed .    final was impressed .   do you really mean what you say .   he asked idiotically .    what kind of a stupid question is that .  of course i do .  listen      there followed a dramatic silence  while the tenseness on final s face reached painful proportions .  then came porus s husky whisper    i ve solved the problem of the squid .    of course the reaction was exactly what porus had expected .  there was a blow up at the other end  and for thirty interesting seconds the rigellian was surprised to learn that the staid and respectable final had a blistering vocabulary .   porus s squid was a by word throughout the galaxy .  for two years now  he had been fussing over an obscure draconian animal that persisted in going to sleep when it wasn t supposed to .  he had set up equations and torn them down with a regularity that had become a standing joke with every psychologist in the federation   and none had explained the unusual reaction .  now final had been dragged from bed to be told that the solution had been reached   and that was all .   final ripped out a concluding phrase that all but put the  caster out of commission .   porus waited for the storm to pass and then said calmly   but do you know how i solved it .    the other s answer was an indistinct mumble .   the rigellian began speaking rapidly .  all traces of amusement had left his face and  after a few sentences  all traces of anger left final s .   the arcturian s expression became one of wide eyed interest .   no .   he gasped .    yes .    when porus had finished  final raced madly to put in rush calls to the printers to delay publication of the coming issue of the j . g . p .  for two weeks .   furo santins  head of the math department of the university of arcturus  gazed long and steadily at his sirian colleague .    no  no  you re wrong .  his equations were legitimate .  i checked them myself .     mathematically  yes   retorted the round faced sirian .   but psychologically they had no meaning .    santins slapped his high forehead .   meaning .  listen to the mathematician talk .  great space  man  what have mathematics to do with meaning .  mathematics is a tool and as long as it can be manipulated to give proper answers and to make correct predictions  actual meaning has no significance .  i ll say this for tan porus   most psychologists don t know enough mathematics to handle a slide rule efficiently  but he knows his stuff .    the other nodded doubtfully   i guess so .  i guess so .  but using imaginary quantities in psychological equations stretches my faith in science just a little bit .  square root of minus one .    he shuddered  the seniors  lounge in psychology hall was crowded and a buzz with activity .  the rumor of porus s solution to the now classic problem of the squid had spread fast  and conversation touched on nothing else .   at the center of the thickest group was lor haridin .  he was young  with but newly acquired senior status .  but as porus s assistant he was  under present conditions  master of the situation .    look  fellows   just exactly what it s all about i don t know .  that s the old man s secret .  all i can tell you is that i ve got the general idea as to how he solved it .    the others squeezed closer .   i hear he had to make up a new mathematical notation for the squid   said one   like that time we had trouble with the humanoids of sol .    lor haridin shook his head .   worse .  what made him think of it  i can t imagine .  it was either a brainstorm or a nightmare  but anyway he introduced imaginary quantities   the square root of minus one .    there was an awful silence and then someone said   i don t believe it .     fact .   was the complacent reply .    but it doesn t make sense .  what can the square root of minus one represent  psychologically speaking .  why  that would mean    he was doing rapid calculation in his head  as were most of the others    that the neural synapses were hooked up in neither more nor less than four dimensions .     sure   broke in another .   i suppose that if you stimulate the squid today  it will react yesterday .  that s what an imaginary would mean .  comet gas .  that s what i say .     that s why you re not the man tan porus is   said haridin .   do you suppose he cares how many imaginaries there are in the intermediate steps if they all square out into minus one in the final solution .  all he s interested in is that they give him the proper sign in the answer   an answer which will explain that sleep business .  as for its physical significance  what matter .  mathematics is only a tool  anyway .    the others considered silently and marveled .   tan porus sat in his stateroom aboard the newest and most luxurious interstellar liner and gazed at the young man before him happily .  he was in amazing good humour and  for perhaps the first time in his life  did not mind being interviewed by the keen  efficient employees of the ether press .   the ethereporter on his side wondered in silence at the affability of the scientist .  from bitter experience  he had found out that scientists  as a whole  detested reporters   and that psychologists  in particular  thought it fun to practice a bit of applied psych on them and to induce killingly amusing   to others   reactions .   he remembered the time that the old fellow from canopus had convinced him that arboreal life was the greatest good .  it had taken twenty men to drag him down from the tree tops and an expert psychologist to bring him back to normal .   but here was the greatest of them all  tan porus  actually answering questions like a normal human being .    what i would like to know now  professor   said the reporter   is just what this imaginary quantity is all about .  that is   he interposed hastily   not the mathematics of it   we ll take your word on that   but just a general idea that the ordinary humanoid can picture .  for instance  i ve heard that the squid has a four dimensional mind .    porus groaned   oh  rigel .  four dimensional poppycock .  to tell the honest truth  that imaginary i used   which seems to have caught the popular fancy   probably indicates nothing more than some abnormality in the squid s nervous system  but just what  i don t know .  certainly  to the gross methods of ecology and micro physiology  nothing unusual has been found .  no doubt  the answer would lie in the atomic physics of the creature s brain  but there i have no hope .   there was a trace of disdain in his voice .   the atomic physicists are too far behind the psychologists to expect them to catch up at this late date .    the reporter bore down furiously on his stylus .  the next day s headline was clear in his mind  noted psychologist blasts atomic physicists .   also  the headline of the day after  indignant physicists denounce noted psychologist .   scientific feuds were great stuff for the ether press  particularly that between psychologists and physicists  who  it was well known  hated each other s guts .   the reporter glanced up brightly .   say  professor  the humanoids of the galaxy are very interested  you know  in the private lives of you scientists .  i hope you don t mind if i ask you a few questions about your trip home to rigel iv .     go ahead   said porus  genially .  tell them it s the first time i m getting home in two years .  i m sort of looking forward to it .  arcturus is just a bit too yellow for my eyes and the furniture you have here is too big .     it s true  isn t it  that you have a wife at home .    porus coughed .   hmm  yes .  sweetest little woman in the galaxy .  i m looking forward to seeing her  too .  put that down .    the reporter put it down .   how is it you didn t bring her to arcturus with you .    some of the geniality left the rigellian s face .   i like to be alone when i work .  women are all right   in their place .  besides  my idea of a vacation is one by myself .  don t put that down .    the reporter didn t put it down .  he gazed at the other s little form with open admiration .   say  prof  how did you ever get her to stay home  though .  i wish you d tell me the secret .   then  with a wealth of feeling he added   i could use it .    porus laughed .   i tell you  son .  when you re an ace psychologist  you re master in your own home .    he motioned the interview to an end and then suddenly grasped the other by the arm .  his green eyes were piercingly sharp .   and listen  son  that last remark doesn t go into the story  you know .    the reporter paled and backed away .   no  sir  no  sir .  we ve got a little saying in our profession that goes   never monkey around with a psychologist  or he ll make a monkey of you .      good .  i can do it literally  you know  if i have to .    the young press employee ducked out hastily after that  wiped the cold perspiration from his brow and left with his story .  for a moment  towards the last  he had felt himself hanging on the ragged edge .  he made a mental note to refuse all future interviews with psychologists   unless they raised his pay .   tens of billions of miles out  the pure white orb of rigel had reached porus s eyes  and something in his heart uplifted him .   type b reaction   nostalgia  conditioned reflex through association of rigel with happy scenes of youth   words  phrases  equations spun through his keen brain  but he was happy in spite of them .  and in a little while  the human triumphed over the psychologist and porus abandoned analysis for the superior joy of uncritical happiness .   he sat up past the middle of the sleep period two nights before the landing to catch first glimpse of hanlon  fourth planet of rigel  his home world .  some place on that world  on the shores of a quiet sea  was a little two story house .  a little house   not those giant structures fit only for arcturians and other hulking humanoids .   it was the summer season now and the house would be bathed in the pearly light of rigel  and after the harsh yellow red of arcturus  how restful that would be .   and   he almost shouted in his joy   the very first night he was going to insist on gorging himself with broiled tryptex .  he hadn t tasted it for two years  and his wife was the best hand at tryptex in the system .   he winced a little at the thought of his wife .  it had been a dirty trick  getting her to stay home the last two years  but it had had to be done .  he glanced over the papers before him once more .  there was just a little nervousness in his fingers as they shuffled the sheets .  he had spent a full day in calculating her reactions at first seeing him after two years  absence and they were not pleasant .   nina porus was a woman of untamed emotions  and he would have to work quickly and efficiently .   he spotted her quickly in the crowd .  he smiled .  it was nice to see her  even if his equations did predict long and serious storms .  he ran over his initial speech once more and made a last minute change .   and then she saw him .  she waved frantically and broke from the forefront of the crowd .  she was on tan porus before he was aware of it and  in the grip of her affectionate embrace  he went limp with surprise .   that wasn t the reaction to be expected at all .  something was wrong .   she was leading him dexterously through the crowd of reporters to the waiting stratocar  talking rapidly along the way .    tan porus  i thought i d never live to see you again .  it s so good to have you with me again  you have absolutely no idea .  everything here at home is just fine  of course  but it isn t quite the same without you .    porus s green eyes were glazed .  this speech was entirely uncharacteristic of nina .  to the sensitive ears of a psychologist  it sounded little short of the ravings of a maniac .  he had not even the presence of mind to grunt at proper intervals .  frozen mutely in his seat  he watched the ground rush downwards and heard the air shriek backwards as they headed for their little house by the sea .   nina porus prattled on gaily   the one normal aspect of her conversation being her ability to uphold both ends of a dialogue with smooth efficiency .    and  of course  dear  i ve fixed up an entire tryptex  broiled to a turn  garnished with sarnees .  and  oh yes  about that affair last year with that new planet   earth  do you call it .  i was so proud of you when i heard about it .  i said       and so on and on  until her voice degenerated into a meaningless conglomeration of sounds .   where were her tears .  where were the reproaches  the threats  the impassioned self pity .   tan porus roused himself to one great effort at dinner .  he stared at the steaming dish of tryptex before him with an odd lack of appetite and said  this reminds me of the time at arcturus when i dined with the president delegate       he went into details  dilating on the gayety and abandon of the affair  waxing lyrical over his own enjoyment of it  stressing  almost unsubtly  the fact that he had not missed his wife  and finally  in one last wild burst of desperation  mentioning casually the presence of a surprising number of rigellian females in the arcturian system .   and through it all  his wife sat smiling .   wonderful  darling   she d say .   i m so glad you enjoyed yourself .  eat your tryptex .    but porus did not eat his tryptex .  the mere thought of food nauseated him .  with one lingering stare of dismay at his wife  he arose with what dignity he could muster and left for the privacy of his room .   he tore up the equations furiously and hurled himself into a chair .  he seethed with anger  for evidently something had gone wrong with nina .  terribly wrong .  even interest in another man   and for just a moment that had occurred to him as a possible explanation   would not cause such a revolution in character .   he tore at his hair .  there was some hidden factor more startling than that   but what it was he had no idea .  at that  moment tan porus would have given the sum total of his worldly possessions to have his wife enter and make one   just one   attempt to snatch his scalp off  as of old .   and below  in the dining room  nina porus allowed a crafty gleam to enter her eye .   lor haridin put down his pen and said   come in .   the door opened  and his friend  eblo ranin  entered  brushed off a corner of the desk and sat down .    haridin  i ve got an idea .   his voice was uncommonly like a guilty whisper .   haridin gazed at him suspiciously .    like the time   he said   you set up the booby trap for old man obel .    ranin shuddered .  he had spent two days hiding in the ventilator shaft after that brilliant piece of work .   no  this is legitimate .  listen  porus left you in charge of the squid  didn t he .     oh  i see what you re getting at .  it s no go .  i can feed the squid  but that s all .  if i as much as clapped my hands at it to induce a color change tropism  the boss would throw a fit .    to space with him .  he s parsecs away  anyway .   ranin drew forth a two month old copy of the j . g . p .  and folded the cover back .   have you been following livell s experiments at procyon u .  .  you know   magnetic fields applied with and without ultra violet radiation .     out of my field   grunted haridin .   i ve heard of it  but that s all .  what about it .     well  it s a type e reaction which gives  believe it or not  a strong fimbal effect in practically every case  especially in the higher invertebrates .    hmm .     now  if we could try it on this squid  we could       no  no  no  no .   haridin shook his head violently .   porus would break me .  great stars and little meteors  how he would break me .     listen  you nut   porus can t tell you what to do with the squid .  it s frian obel that has final say .  he s head of the psychological board  not porus .  all you have to do is to apply for his permission and you ll get it .  just between us  since that homo sol affair last year  he can t stand the sight of porus anyway .    haridin weakened .   you ask him .    ratlin coughed .   no .  on the whole  perhaps i d better not .  he s sort of got a suspicion that i set that booby trap  and i d rather keep out of his way .     hmm .  well  all right .    lor haridin looked as if he had not slept well for a week  which shows that sometimes appearances are not deceiving .  eblo ranin regarded him with patient kindliness and sighed .    look .  will you please sit down .  santin said he would have the final results in today  didn t he .     i know  i know  but it s humiliating .  i spent seven years on higher math .  and now i make a stupid mistake and can t even find it .     maybe it s not there to find .     don t be silly .  the answer is just impossible .  it must be impossible .  it must be .   his high forehead creased .   oh  i don t know what to think .    he continued his concentrated attempt to wear out the nap of the rug beneath and mused bitterly .  suddenly he sat down .    it s those time integrals .  you can t work with them  i tell you .  you look  em up in a table  taking half an hour to find the proper entry  and they give you seventeen possible answers .  you have to pick the one that makes sense  and   arcturus help me .    either they all do  or none do .  run up against eight of them  as we do in this problem  and we ve got enough permutations to last us the rest of our life .  wrong answer .  it s a wonder i lived through it at all .    the look he gave the fat volume of helo s tables of time integrals did not sear the binding  to ranin s great surprise .   the signal light flashed  and haridin leaped to the door .   he snatched the package from the messenger s hand and ripped open the wrappings frantically .   he turned to the last page and stared at santin s final note    your calculations are correct .  congratulations   and won t this knock porus s head right off his shoulders .  better get in touch with him at once .    ranin read it over the other s shoulder  and for one long minute the two gazed at each other .    i was right   whispered haridin  eyes bulging .   we ve found something in which the imaginary doesn t square out .  we ve got a predicted reaction which includes an imaginary quantity .    the other swallowed and brushed aside his stupefaction with an effort .   how do you interpret it .     great space .  how in the galaxy should i know .  we ve got to get porus  that s all .    ranin snapped his fingers and grabbed the other by the shoulders .   oh  no  we won t .  this is our big chance .  if we can carry this through  we re made for life .   he stuttered in his excitement .   arcturus .  any psychologist would sell his life twice over to have our opportunity right now .    the draconian squid crawled placidly about  unawed by the huge solenoid that surrounded its tank .  the mass of tangled wires  the current leads  the mercury vapor lamp up above meant nothing to it .  it nibbled contentedly at the fronds of the sea fern about it and was at peace with the world .   not so the two young psychologists .  eblo ranin scurried through the complicated set up in a last minute effort at checking everything .  lor haridin helped him in intervals between nail biting .    everything s set   said ranin  and swabbed wearily at his damp brow .   let her shoot .    the mercury vapor  . amp went on and haridin pulled the window curtains together .  in the cold red less light  two green tinted faces watched the squid closely .  it stirred restlessly  its warm pink changing to a dull black in the mercury light .    turn on the juice   said haridin hoarsely .   there was a soft click  and that was all .    no reaction .   questioned ranin  half to himself .  and then he held his breath as the other bent closer .    something s happening to the squid .  it seems to glow a bit  or is it my eyes .    the glow became perceptible and then seemed to detach itself from the body of the animal and take on a spherical shape of itself .  long minutes passed .    it s emitting some sort of radiation  field  force   whatever you want to call it   and there seems to be expansion with time .    there was no answer  and none was expected .  again they waited and watched .   and then ranin emitted a muffled cry and grasped haridin s elbow tightly .   crackling comets  what s it doing .    the globular glowing sphere of whatever it was had thrust out a pseudopod .  a gleaming little projection touched the swaying branch of the sea fern  and where it touched the leaves turned brown and withered .    shut off the current .    the current clicked off  the mercury vapor lamp went out  the shades were parted and the two stared at each other nervously .    what was it .    haridin shook his head .   i don t know .  it was something definitely insane .  i never saw anything like it .     you never saw an imaginary in a reaction equation before  either  did you .  as a matter of fact  i don t think that expanding field was any known form of energy at       his breath came out in one long whistling exhalation and he retreated slowly from the tank containing the squid .  the mollusc was motionless  but around it half the fern in the tank hung sere and withered .   haridin gasped .  he pulled the shades and in the gloom  the globe of glowing haze bulked through half the tank .  little curving tentacles of light reached toward the remaining fern and one pulsing thread extended through the glass and was creeping along the table .   that fright in ranin s voice rendered it a cracked  scarcely understood sound .    it s a lag reaction .  didn t you test it by wilbon s theorem .     how could i .   the other s heart pumped madly and his dry lips fought to form words .   wilbon s theorem didn t make sense with an imaginary in the equation .  i let it go .    ranin sped into action with feverish energy .  he left the room and was back in a moment with a tiny  squealing  squirrel like animal from his own lab .  he dropped it in the path of the thread of light stealing along the table  and held it there with a yard rule .   the glowing thread wavered  seemed to sense the presence of life in some horribly blind way  and lunged toward it .  the little rodent squealed once  a high pitched shriek of infinite torture  and went limp .  in two seconds it was a shriveled  shrunken travesty of its former self .   ranin swore and dropped the rule with a sudden yell  for the thread of light   a bit brighter  a bit thicker   began creeping up the wood toward him .    here   said haridin   let s end this .   he yanked a drawer open and withdrew the chromium plated tonite gun within .  its sharp thin beam of purple light lunged forward toward the squid and exploded in blazing  soundless fury against the edge of the sphere of force .  the psychologist shot again and again  and then compressed the trigger to form one continuous purple stream of destruction that ceased only when power failed .   and the glowing sphere remained unharmed .  it engulfed the entire tank .  the ferns were brown masses of death .    get the board   yelled ranin .   it s beyond us entirely .    there was no confusion   humanoids in the mass are simply not subject to panic  if you don t count the half genius  half humanoid inhabitants of the planets of sol   and the evacuation of the university grounds was carried out smoothly .    one fool   said old mir deana  ace physicist of arcturus u .    can ask more questions than a thousand wise men can answer .   he fingered his scraggly beard and his button nose sniffed loudly in disdain .    what do you mean by that .   questioned frian obel sharply .  his green vegan skin darkened angrily .    just that  by analogy  one cosmic fool of a psychologist can make a bigger mess than a thousand physicists can clear up .    obel drew in his breath dangerously .  he had his own opinion of haridin and ranin  but no lame brain psysicist could      the plump figure of qual wynn  university president  came charging down upon them .  he was out of breath and spoke between puffs .    i ve gotten in touch with the galactic congress and they re arranging for evacuation of all eron  if necessary .   his voice became pleading .   isn t there anything that can be done .    mir deana sighed   nothing   yet .  all we know is this  the squid is emitting some sort of pseudo living radiatory field which is not electromagnetic in character .  its advance cannot be stopped by anything we have yet tried  material or vacuum .  none of our weapons affect it  for within the field the ordinary attributes of space time apparently don t hold .    the president shook a worried head .   bad  bad .  you ve sent for porus  though .   he sounded as though he were clutching at a last straw .    yes   scowled frian obel .   he s the only one that really knows that squid .  if he can t help us  no one can .   he stared off toward the gleaming white of the university buildings  where the grass over half the campus was brown stubble and the trees blasted ruins .    do you think   said the president  turning to deana once more   that the field can span interplanetary space .     sizzling novae  i don t know what to think .   deana exploded  and he turned pettishly away .   there was a thick silence of utter gloom .   tan porus was sunk in deep apathy .  he was unaware of the brilliant coruscations of color overhead .  he didn t hear a sound of the melodious tones that filled the auditorium .   he knew only one thing   that he had been talked into attending a concert .  concerts above all were anathema to him  and in twenty years of married life he had steered clear of them with a skill and ease that only the greatest psychologist of them all could have shown .  and now      he was startled out of his stupor by the sudden discordant sounds that arose from the rear .   there was a rush of ushers to the exit where the disturbance originated  a waving of protesting uniformed arms and then a strident voice   i am here on urgent business direct from the galactic congress on eron  arcturus .  is tan porus in the audience .    tan porus was out of his seat with a bound .  any excuse to leave the auditorium was nothing short of heaven sent .   he ripped open the communication handed him by the messenger and devoured its contents .  at the second sentence  his elation left him .  when he was finished  he raised a face in which only his darting green eyes seemed alive .    how soon can we leave .     the ship is waiting now .     come  then .    he took one step forward and stopped .  there was a hand on his elbow .    where are you going .   asked nina porus .  there was hidden steel in her voice .   tan porus felt stifled for a moment .  he foresaw what would happen .   darling  i must go to eron immediately .  the fate of a world  of the whole galaxy perhaps  is at stake .  you don t know how important it is .  i tell you        all right  go .  and i ll go with you .    the psychologist bowed his head .    yes  dear .   he said .  he sighed .   the psychological board hemmed and hawed as one man and then stared dubiously at the large scale graph before them .    frankly  gentlemen   said tan porus   i don t feel too certain about it myself  but   well  you ve all seen my results  and checked them too .  and it is the only stimulus that will yield a canceling reaction .    frian obel fingered his chin nervously .   yes  the mathematics is clear .  increase of hydrogen ion activity past ph  would set up a demane s integral and that    but listen  porus  we re not dealing with space time .  the math might not hold   perhaps nothing will hold .     it s our only chance .  if we were dealing with normal space time  we could just dump in enough acid to kill the blasted squid or fry it with a tonite .  as it is  we have no choice but to take our chances with       loud voices interrupted him .   let me through  i say .  i don t care if there are ten conferences going on .    the door swung open and qual wynn s portly figure made its entrance .  he spied porus and bore down upon him .   porus  i tell you i m going crazy .  parliament is holding me  as university president  responsible for all this  and now deana says that     he sputtered into silence and mir deana  standing composedly behind him  took up the tale .    the field now covers better than one thousand square miles and its rate of increase is growing steadily .  there seems to be no doubt now that it can span interplanetary space if it wishes to do so   interstellar as well  if given the time .     you hear that .  you hear that .   wynn was fairly dancing in his anxiety .   can t you do something .  the galaxy is doomed  i tell you  doomed .     oh  keep your tunic on   groaned porus   and let us handle this .   he turned to deana .   didn t your physicist stooges conduct some clumsy investigations as to the speed of penetration of the field through various substances .    deana nodded stiffly .    penetration varies  in general  inversely with density .  osmium  iridium and platinum are the best .  lead and gold are fair .     good .  that checks .  what i ll need then is an osmium plated suit with a lead glass helmet .  and make both plating and helmet good and thick .    qual wynn stared horrified .   osmium plating .  osmium .  by the great nebula  think of the expense .     i m thinking   said porus frostily .    but they ll charge it to the university  they ll      he recovered with difficulty as the somber stares of the assembled psychologists fastened themselves upon him .   when do you need it .   he muttered weakly .    you re really going  yourself .     why not .   asked porus  clambering out of the suit .   mir deana said   the lead glass headpiece will hold off the field not longer than an hour and you ll probably be getting partial penetration in much shorter time .  i don t know if you can do it .     i ll worry about that .   he paused  and then continued uncertainly .   i ll be ready in a few minutes .  i d like to speak to my wife first   alone .    the interview was a short one .  it was one of the very few occasions that tan porus forgot that he was a psychologist  and spoke as his heart moved him  without stopping to consider the natural reaction of the one spoken to .   one thing he did know   by instinct rather than thought  and that was that his wife would not break down or go sentimental on him  and there he was right .  it was only in the last few seconds that her eyes fell and her voice quavered .  she tugged a handkerchief from her wide sleeve and hurried from the room .   the psychologist stared after her and then stooped to pick up the thin book that had fallen as she had removed the handkerchief .  without looking at it  he placed it in the inner pocket of his tunic .  he smiled crookedly .   a talisman .   he said .   tan porus s gleaming one man cruiser whistled into the  death field .   the clammy sensation of desolation impressed itself upon him at once .   he shrugged .   imagination .  mustn t get nervy now .    there was the vaguest glitter   a sparkle that was felt rather than seen   in the air about him .  and then it invaded the ship itself  and  looking up  the rigellian saw the five eronian rice birds he had brought with him lying dead on the floor of their cage  huddled masses of bedraggled feathers .    the  death field  is in   he whispered .  it had penetrated the steel hull of the cruiser .   the cruiser bumped to a rather unskillful landing on the broad university athletic field  and tan porus  an incongruous figure in the bulky osmium suit  stepped out .  he surveyed his depressing surroundings .  from the brown stubble underfoot to the glimmering haze that hid the normal blue of the sky  all seemed   dead .   he entered psychology hall .   his lab was dark  the shades were still drawn .  he parted them and studied the squid s tank .  the water replenisher was still working  for the tank was full .  however  that was the only normal thing about it .  only a few dark brown  ragged strands of rot were left of what had once been sea fern .  the squid itself lay inertly upon the floor of the tank .   tan porus sighed .  he felt tired and numbed .  his mind was hazy and unclear .  for long minutes he stared about him unseeingly .   then  with an effort  he raised the bottle he held and glanced at the label      molar hydrochloric acid .   he mumbled vaguely to himself .   two hundred cc .  just dump the whole thing in .  that ll force the ph down   if only hydrogen ion activity means something here .    he was fumbling with the glass stopper  and   suddenly  laughing .  he had felt exactly like this the one and only time he had ever been drunk .   he shook the gathering cobwebs from his brain .   only got a few minutes to do   to do what .  i don t know   something anyway .  dump this thing in .  dump it in .  dump .  dump .  dumpety dump .   he was mumbling a silly popular song to himself as the acid gurgled its way into the open tank .   tan porus felt pleased with himself and he laughed .  he stirred the water with his mailed fist and laughed some more .  he was still singing that song .   and then he became aware of a subtle change in environment .  he fumbled for it and stopped singing .  and then it hit him with the suddenness of a downpour of cold water .  the glitter in the atmosphere had gone .   with a sudden motion  he unclasped the helmet and cast it off .  he drew in long breaths of air  a bit musty  but unkilling .   he had acidified the water of the tank  and destroyed the field at its source .  chalk up another victory for the pure mathematics of psychology .   he stepped out of his osmium suit and stretched .  the pressure on his chest reminded him of something .  withdrawing the booklet his wife had dropped  he said   the talisman came through .   and smiled indulgently at his own whimsy .   the smile froze as he saw for the first time the title upon the book .   the title was intermediate course in applied psychology  volume   .   it was as if something large and heavy had suddenly fallen onto porus s head and driven understanding into it .  nina had been boning up on applied psych for two whole years .   this was the missing factor .  he could allow for it .  he would have to use triple time integrals  but      he threw the communicator switch and waited for contact .    hello .  this is porus .  come on in  all of you .  the death field is gone .  i ve beaten the squid .   he broke contact and added triumphantly     and my wife .    strangely enough   or  perhaps  not so strangely   it was the latter feat that pleased him more .   the end    the chief interest to me in  the imaginary  is that it foreshadows  psychohistory  that was to play such a big role in the  foundation  series .  it was in this story and in its predecessor   homo sol   that for the first time i treated psychology as a mathematically refined science .   it was about time that i made another stab at unknown  and i did so with a story called the oak   which  as i recall  was something about an oak tree that served as an oracle and delivered ambiguous statements .  i submitted it to campbell on july           and it was promptly rejected .   one of the bad things about writing for unknown was that the magazine was one of a kind .  if unknown rejected a story  there was no place else to submit it .  it was possible to try weird tales  a magazine that was older than any science fiction magazine  but it dealt with old fashioned  creaky horror tales and paid very little to boot .  i wasn t really interested in trying to get into it .   and besides  they rejected both  life before birth  and  the oak  when i submitted them .    still  july           was a turning point in my career  although  of course  i had no way of telling it .  i had up to that point written twenty two stories in twenty five months .  of these i had sold  or was to sell  thirteen  while nine never sold at all and no longer exist .  the record wasn t abysmal but neither was it great   let s call it mediocre .   however  as it happened  except for two short short stories that were special cases  i never again wrote a science fiction story i could never sell .  i had found the range .   but not campbell s range particularly .  in august i wrote  heredity   which i submitted to campbell on august     and which he rejected two weeks later .  fortunately  pohl snapped it up at once .            heredity     dr .  stefansson fondled the thick sheaf of typewritten papers that lay before him   it s all here  harvey   twenty five years of work .    mild mannered professor harvey puffed idly at his pipe   well  your part is over   and markey s  too  on ganymede .  it s up to the twins  themselves  now .    a short ruminative silence  and then dr .  stefansson stirred uneasily   are you going to break the news to allen soon .    the other nodded quietly   it will have to be done before we get to mars  and the sooner the better .   he paused  then added in a tightened voice   i wonder how it feels to find out after twenty five years that one has a twin brother whom one has never seen .  it must be a damned shock .     how did george take it .     didn t believe it at first  and i don t blame him .  markey had to work like a horse to convince him it wasn t a hoax .  i suppose i ll have as hard a job with allen .   he knocked the dottle from his pipe and shook his head .    i have half a mind to go to mars just to see those two get together   remarked dr .  stefansson wistfully .    you ll do no such thing  stef .  this experiment s taken too long and means too much to have you ruin it by any such fool move .     i know  i know .  heredity versus environment .  perhaps at last the definite answer .   he spoke half to himself  as if repeating an old  familiar formula   two identical twins  separated at birth  one brought up oh old  civilized earth  the other on pioneer ganymede .  then  on their twenty fifth birthday brought together for the first time on mars   god .  i wish carter had lived to see the end of it .  they re his children .     too bad .    but we re alive  and the twins .  to carry the experiment to its end will be our tribute to him .    there is no way of telling  at first seeing the martian branch of medicinal products  inc .   that it is surrounded by anything but desert .  you can t see the vast underground caverns where the native fungi of mars are artificially nurtured into huge blooming fields .  the intricate transportation system that connects all parts of the square miles of fields to the central building is invisible .  the irrigation system  the air purifiers  the drainage pipes  are all hidden .   and what one sees is the broad squat red brick building and martian desert  rusty and dry  all about .   that had been all george carter had seen upon arriving via rocket taxi  but him  at least  appearances had not deceived .  it would have been strange had it done so  for his life on ganymede had been oriented in its every phase towards eventual general managership of that very concern .  he knew every square inch of the caverns below as well as if he had been born and raised in them himself .   and now he sat in professor lemuel harvey s small office and allowed just the slightest trace of uneasiness to cross his impassive countenance .  his ice blue eyes sought those of professor harvey .    this   this twin brother o  mine .  he ll be here soon .    professor harvey nodded   he s on his way over right now .    george carter uncrossed his knees .  his expression was almost wistful   he looks a lot like me  d ya rack on .     quite a lot .  you re identical twins  you know .     hmm .  rackon so .  wish i d known him all the time   on ganny .   he frowned   he s lived on airth all s life  huh .    an expression of interest crossed professor harvey s face .  he said briskly   you dislike earthmen .     no  not exactly   came the immediate answer .   it s just the airthmen are tenderfeet .  all of  m i know are .    harvey stifled a grin  and conversation languished .   the door signal snapped harvey out of his reverie and george carter out of his chair at the same instant .  the professor pressed the desk button and the door opened .   the figure on the threshold crossed into the room and then stopped .  the twin brothers faced each other .   it was a tense  breathless moment  and professor harvey sank into his soft chair  put his finger tips together and watched keenly .   the two stood stiffly erect  ten feet apart  neither making a move to lessen the distance .  they made a curious contrast   a contrast all the more marked because of the vast similarity between the two .   eyes of frozen blue gazed deep into eyes of frozen blue .  each saw a long  straight nose over full  red lips pressed firmly together .  the high cheekbones were as prominent in one as in the other  the jutting  angular chin as square .  there was even the same  odd half cock of one eyebrow in twin expressions of absorbed  part quizzical interest .   but with the face  all resemblance ended .  allen carter s clothes bore the new york stamp on every square inch .  from his loose blouse  past his dark purple knee breeches  salmon colored cellulite stockings  down to the glistening sandals on his feet  he stood a living embodiment of latest terrestrial fashion .   for a fleeting moment  george carter was conscious of a feeling of ungainliness as he stood there in his tight sleeved  close necked shirt of ganymedan linen .  his unbuttoned vest and his voluminous trousers with their ends tucked into high laced  heavy soled boots were clumsy and provincial .  even he felt it   for just a moment .   from his sleeve pocket allen removed a cigarette case   it was the first move either of the brothers had made   opened it  withdrew a slender cylinder of paper covered tobacco that spontaneously glowed into life at the first puff .   george hesitated a fraction of a second and his subsequent action was almost one of defiance .  his hand plunged into his inner vest pocket and drew there from the green  shriveled form of a cigar made of ganymedan greenleaf .  a match flared into flame upon his thumbnail and for a long moment  he matched  puff for puff  the cigarette of his brother .   and then allen laughed   a queer  high pitched laugh   your eyes are a little closer together  i think .     rackon  tis  maybe .  y r hair s fixed sort o  different .   there was faint disapproval in his voice .  allen s hand went selfconsciously to his long  light brown hair  carefully curled at the ends  while his eyes flickered over the carelessly bound queue into which the other s equally long hair was drawn .    i suppose we ll have to get used to each other .    i m willing to try .   the earth twin was advancing now  hand outstretched .   george smiled   y  bet .   at goes here  too .    the hands met and gripped .    y r name s all n  huh .   said george .    and yours is george  isn t it .   answered allen .   and then for a long while they said nothing more .  they just looked   and smiled as they strove to bridge the twenty five year gap that separated them .   george carter s impersonal gaze swept over the carpet of low growing purple blooms that stretched in plot path bordered squares into the misty distance of the caverns .  the newspapers and feature writers might rhapsodize over the  fungus gold  of mars   about the purified extracts  in yields of ounces to acres of blooms  that had become indispensable to the medical profession of the system .  opiates  purified vitamins  a new vegetable specific against pneumonia   the blooms were worth their weight in gold  almost .   but they were merely blooms to george garter   blooms to be forced to full growth  harvested  baled and shipped to the aresopolis labs hundreds of miles away .   he cut his little ground car to half speed and leant furiously out the window   hi y  mudcat there .  y  with the dairty face .  watch what y r doing   keep the donined water in the channel .    he drew back and the ground car leapt ahead once more .  the ganymedan muttered viciously to himself   these domned men about here are wairse than useless .  so many machines t  do their wairk for  m they give their brains a pairrnenent vacation .  i rackon .    the ground car came to a halt and he clambered out .  picking his way between the fungus plots  he approached the clustered group of men about the spider armed machine in the plotway ahead .    well  here i am .  what is  t  all n .    allen s head bobbed up from behind the other side of the machine .  he waved at the men about him   stop it for a second  .   and leaped toward his twin .    george  it works .  it s slow and clumsy  but it works .  we can improve it now that we ve got the fundamentals down .  and in no time at all  we ll be able to        now wait a while  all n .  on ganny  we  go slow .  y  live long  that way .  what y  got there .    allen paused and swabbed at his forehead .  his face shone with grease  sweat and excitement .   i ve been working on this thing ever since i finished college .  it s a modification of something we have on earth   but it s no end improved .  it s a mechanical bloom picker .    he had fished a much folded square of heavy paper from his pocket and talked steadily as he spread it on the plotway before them   up to now  bloom picking has been the bottleneck of production  to say nothing of the    to     loss due to picking under  and over ripe blooms .  after all  human eyes are only human eyes  and the blooms     here  look .    the paper was spread flat and allen squatted before it .  george leaned over his shoulder  with frowning watchfulness .    you see .  it s a combination of fluoroscope and photo electric cell .  the ripeness of the bloom can be told by the state of the spores within .  this machine is adjusted so that the proper circuit is tripped upon the impingement of just that combination of light and dark formed by ripe spores within the bloom .  on the other hand  this second circuit   but look  it s easier to show you .    he was up again  brimming with enthusiasm .  with a jump  he was in the low seat behind the picker and had pulled the lever .   ponderously  the picker turned toward the blooms and its  eye  travelled sideways six inches above the ground .  as it passed each fungus bloom  a long spidery arm shot out  lopping it cleanly half an inch from the ground and depositing it neatly in the downward sloping slide beneath .  a pile of blooms formed behind the machine .    we can hook on a binder  too  later on .  do you notice those blooms it doesn t touch .  those are unripe .  just wait till it comes to an over ripe one and see what it does .    he yelled in triumph a moment later when a bloom was torn out and dropped on the spot .   he stopped the machine .   you see .  in a month  perhaps  we can actually start putting it to work in the fields .    george carter gazed sourly upon his twin   take more  n a month  i rackon .  it ll take foraver  more likely .     what do you mean  forever .  it just has to be sped up        i don t care if  t just has t  be painted pairple .   tisn t going t  appear on my fields .     your fields .     yup  mine   was the cool response .   i ve got veto pow r here same as you have .  y  can t do anything  thout my say so   and y  won t get it f r this .  in fact  i want y  t  clear that thing out o  here  altogether .  got no use f r  t .    allen dismounted and faced his brother   you agreed to let me have this plot to experiment on  veto free  and i m holding you to that agreement .     all right  then .  but keep y r domned machine out o  the rest o  the fields .    the earthman approached the other slowly .  there was a dangerous look in his eyes .   look  george  i don t like your attitude   and i don t like the way you re using your veto power .  i don t know what you re used to running on ganymede  but you re in the big time now  and there are a lot of provincial notions you ll have to get out of your head .     not unless i want to .  and if y  want t  have  t out with me  we d batter go t  y r office .  spatting before the men  d be bad for discipline .    the trip back to central was made in ominous silence .  george whistled softly to himself while allen folded his arms and stared with ostentatious indifference at the narrow  twisting plotway ahead .  the silence persisted as they entered the earthman s office .  allen gestured shortly toward a chair and the ganymedan took it without a word .  he brought out his ever present green leaf cigar and waited for the other to speak .   allen hunched forward upon the edge of his seat and leaned both elbows on his desk .  he began with a rush .    there s lots to this situation  george  that s a mystery to me .  i don t know why they brought up you on ganymede and me on earth  and i don t know why they never let us know of each other  or made us co managers now with veto power over one another   but i do know that the situation is rapidly growing intolerable .    this corporation needs modernization  and you know that .  yet you ve been wielding that veto power over every trifling advance i ve tried to initiate .  i don t know just what your viewpoint is  but i ve a suspicion that you think you re still living on ganymede .  if you re still in the sticks    i m warning you   get out of them fast .  i m from earth  and this corporation is going to be run with earth efficiency and earth organization .  do you understand .    george puffed odorous tobacco at the ceiling before answering  but when he did  his eyes came down sharply  and there was a cutting edge to his voice .    airth  is it .  airth efficiency  no less .  well  all n  i like ye .  i can t help it .  y r so much like me  that disliking y  would be like disliking myself  i rackon .  i hate t  say this  but y re upbringing s all wrong .    his .  voice became sternly accusatory   y r an airthman .  well  look at y  .  an airthman s but half a man at best  and naturally y  lean on machines .  but d  y  suppose   want the corporation to be run by machines   just machines   what re the men t  do .     the men run the machines   came the clipped  angry response .   the ganymedan rose  and a fist slammed down on the desk   the machines run the men  and y  know it .  fairst  y  use them  then y  depend on them  and finally y r slaves t  them .  over on y r pracious airth  it was machines  machines  machines   and as a result  what are y  .  i ll tell y  .  half a man .    he drew himself up   i still like y  .  i like y  well enough t  wish y d lived on gannie with me .  by jupe  n  domn   twould have made a man o  y  .     finished .   said allen .    rackon so .     then i ll tell you something .  there s nothing wrong with you that a life time on a decent planet wouldn t have fixed .  as it is  however  you belong on ganymede .  i d advise you to go back there .    george spoke very softly   y r not thinking o  taking a punch at me  are y  .     no .  i couldn t fight a mirror image of myself  but if your face were only a little different  i would enjoy splashing it about the premises a bit .     think y  could do it   an airthman like you .  here  sit down .  we re both getting a bit too excited  i rackon .  nothing ll be settled this way .    he sat down once more  puffed vainly at his dead cigar  and tossed it into the incinerator chute in disgust .    where s y r water .   he grunted .   allen grinned with sudden delight   would you object to having a machine supply it .     machine .  what d  y  mean .   the ganymedan gazed about him suspiciously .    watch .  i had this installed a week ago .   he touched a button on his desk and a low click sounded below .  there was the sound of pouring water for a second or so and then a circular metal disk beside the earthman s right hand slid aside and a cup of water lifted up from below .    take it   said allen .   george lifted it gingerly and drank it down .  he tossed the empty cup down the incinerator shaft  then stared long and thoughtfully at his brother   may i see this water feeder o  y rs .     surely .  it s just under the desk .  here  i ll make room for you .    the ganymedan crawled underneath while allen watched uncertainly .  a brawny hand was thrust out suddenly and a muffled voice said   hand me a screwdriver .     here .  what are you going to do .     nothing .  nothing  t all .  just want t  investigate this contraption .    the screw driver was handed down and for a few minutes there was no other sound than an occasional soft scraping of metal on metal .  finally  george withdrew a flushed face and adjusted his wrinkled collar with satisfaction .    which button do i press for the water .    allen gestured and the button was pressed .  the gurgling of water sounded .  the earthman stared in mystification from his desk to his brother and back again .  and  . then he became aware of a moistness about his feet .   he jumped  looked downwards and squawked in dismay   why  damn you  what have you done .   a snaky stream of water wriggled blindly out from under the desk and the pouring sound of water still continued .   george made leisurely for the door   just short caircuited it .  here s y r screw driver  fix  t up again .   and just before he slammed the door   so much f r y r pracious machines .  they go wrong at the wrong times .    the sounder was buzzily insistent and allen carter opened one eye peevishly .  it was still dark .   with a sigh  he lifted one arm to the head of his bed and put the audiomitter into commission .   the treble voice of amos wells of the night shift squawked excitedly at him .  allen s eyes snapped open and he sat up .    you re crazy .   but he was plunging into his breeches even as he spoke .  in ten seconds  he was careening up the steps three at a time .  he shot into the main office just behind the charging figure of his twin brother .   the place was crowded    its occupants in a jitter .   allen brushed his long hair out of his eyes   turn on the turret searchlight .     it s on   said someone helplessly .   the earthman rushed to the window and looked out .  the yellow beam reached dimly out a few feet and ended in a muddy murkiness .  he pulled at the window and it lifted upwards grittily a few inches .  there was a whistle of wind and a tornado of coughing from within the room .  allen slammed it down again and his hands went at once to his tear filled eyes .   george spoke between sneezes   we re not located in the sandstorm zone .  this can t be one .     it is   asserted wells in a squeak .   it s the worst i ve ever seen .  started full blast from scratch just like that .  it caught me flat footed .  by the time i closed off all exits to above  it was too late .     too late .   allen withdrew his attention from his sand filled eyes and snapped out the words   too late for what .     too late for our rolling stock .  our rockets got it worst of all .  there isn t one that hasn t its propulsives clogged with sand .  and that goes for our irrigation pumps and the ventilating system .  the generators below are safe but everything else will have to be taken apart and put together again .  we re stalled for a week at least .  maybe more .    there was a short  pregnant silence  and then allen said   take charge  wells .  put the men on double shift and tackle the irrigation pumps first .  they ve got to be in working order inside of twenty four hours  or half the crop will dry up and die on us .  here   wait  i ll go with you .    he turned to leave  but his first footstep froze in midair at the sight of michael anders  communications officer  rushing up the stairs .   what s the matter .    anders spoke between gasps   the damned planet s gone crazy .  there s been the biggest quake in history with its center not ten miles from aresopolis .    there was a chorus of  what .   and a ragged follow up of blistering imprecations .  men crowded in anxiously    many had relatives and wives in the martian metropolis .   anders went on breathlessly   it came all of a sudden .  aresopolis is in ruins and fires have started .  there aren t any details but the transmitter at our aresopolis labs went dead five minutes ago .    there was a babel of comment .  the news spread out into the furthest recesses of central  and excitement waxed to dangerously panicky proportions .  allen raised his voice to a shout .    quiet  everyone .  there s nothing we can do about aresopolis .  we ve got our own troubles .  this freak storm is connected with the quake some way   and that s what we have to take care of .  everyone back to his work now   and work fast .  they ll be needing us at aresopolis damned soon .   he turned to anders   you .  get back to that receiver and don t knock off until you ve gotten in touch with aresopolis again .  coming with me  george .     no  rackon not   was the response .   y  tend t  y r machines .  i ll go down with anders .    dawn was breaking  a dusky  lightless dawn  when allen carter returned to central .  he was weary   weary in mind and body   and looked it .  he entered the radio room .    things are a mess .  if       there was a  shhh  and george waved frantically .  allen fell silent .  anders bent over the receiver  turning tiny dials with nervous fingers .   anders looked up .   it s no use  mr .  carter .  can t get them .     all right .  stay here and keep y r ears open .  let me know if anything turns up .    he walked out  hooking an arm underneath his brother s and dragging the latter out .    when c n we get out the next shipment  all n .     not for at least a week .  we haven t a thing that ll either roll or fly for days  and it will be even longer before we can start harvesting again .     have we any supplies on hand now .     a few tons of assorted blooms   mainly the red purples .  the earth shipment last tuesday took off almost everything .    george fell into a reverie .   his brother waited a moment and did sharply   well  what s on your mind .  what s the news from aresopolis .     domned bad .  the quake s leveled three fourths o  aresopolis and the rest s pretty much gutted with fire  i rackon .  there  re fifty thousand that ll have t  camp out nights .   that s no fun in martian autumn weather with the airth gravity system broken down .    allen whistled   pneumonia .     and common colds and influenza and any o  half doz n diseases t  say nothing o  people bairnt .    old vincent is raising cain .     wants blooms .     he s only got a two day supply on hand .  he s got t  have more .    both were speaking quietly  almost with indifference  with the vast understatement that is all that makes great crises bearable .   there was a pause and then george spoke again   what the best we c n do .     not under a week   not if we kill ourselves to do it .  if they could send over a ship as soon as the storm dies down  we might be able to send what we have as a temporary supply until we can get over with the rest .     silly even t  think o  that .  the aresopolis port is just ruins .  they haven t a ship t  their names .    again silence .  then allen spoke in a low  tense voice   what are you waiting for .  what s that look on your face for .     i m waiting f r y  t  admit y r domned machines have failed y  in the fairest emergency we ve had t  meet .     admitted   snarled the earthman .    good .  and now it s up t  me t  show y  what human ingenuity can do .   he handed a sheet of paper to his brother   there s a copy of the message i sent vincent .    allen looked long at his brother and slowly read the pencilled scribbling .    will deliver all we have on hand in thirty six hours .  hope it will keep you going the few days until we can get a real shipment out .  things are a little rough out here .     how are you going to do it .   demanded allen  upon finishing .    i m trying to show y    answered george  and allen realized for the first time that they had left central and were out in the caverns .   george led the way for five minutes and stopped before an object bulking blackly in the dimness .  he turned on the section lights and said   sand truck .    the sand truck was not an imposing object .  with the low driving car in front and the three squat  open topped freight cars behind it  presented a picture of obsolete decrepitude .  fifteen years ago  it had been relegated to the dust heap by the sand sleds and rocket freights .   the ganymedan was speaking   checked it an hour ago  m self  and  tis still in wairking order .  it has shielded bearings  air conditioning unit f r the driving car and an intairnal combustion engine .    the other looked up sharply .  there was an expression of distaste on his face .   you mean it burns chemical fuel .     yup .  gas line .  that s why i like it .  reminds me o  ganymede .  on gannie  i had a gas engine that        but wait a while .  we haven t any of that gasoline .     no  rackon not .  but we got lots o  liquid hydrocarbons round the place .  how about solvent d .  that s mostly octane .  we ve got tanks o  it .    allen said   that s so    but the truck holds only two .     i know it .  i m one .     and i m the other .    george grunted   i rackond y d say that   but this isn t going t  be a push button machine job .  rackon y r up t  it   airth man .     i reckon i am   gannie .    the sun had been up some two hours before the sand truck s engine whirred into life  but outside  the murk had become  if anything  thicker .   the main driveway within the caverns was ahum with activity .  grotesque figures with eyes peering through the thick glass of improvised air helmets stepped back as the truck s broad  sand adapted wheels began their slow turn .  the three cars behind had been piled high with purple blooms  canvas covers had been thrown over them and bound down tightly   and now the signal was given to open the doors .   the lever was jerked downwards and the double doors separated with sand clogged protests .  through a gray whirl of inblown sand  the truck made its way outwards  and behind it sand coated figures brushed at their air helmets and closed the doors again .   george carter  inured by long ganymedan custom  met the sudden gravity change as they left the protective gravitor fields of the caverns  with a single long drawn breath .  his hands held steady upon the wheels .  his terrestrial brother  however  was in far different condition .  the hard nauseating knot into which his stomach tied itself loosened only very gradually  and it was a long time before his irregular stertorous breathing approached anything like normality again .   and throughout  the earthman was conscious of the other s side long glance and of just a trace of a smile about the other s lips .   it was enough to keep the slightest moan from issuing forth  though his abdominal muscles cramped and icy perspiration bathed his face .   the miles clicked off slowly  but the illusion of motionless ness was almost as complete as that in space .  the surroundings were gray   uniform  monotonous and unvarying .  the noise of the engine was a harsh purr and the clicking of the air purifier behind like a drowsy tick .  occasionally  there was an especially strong gust of wind  and a patter of sand dashed against the window with a million tiny  separate pings .   george kept his eye strictly upon the compass before him .  the silence was almost oppressive .   and then the ganymedan swivelled his head  and growled   what s wrong with the domned vent lator .    allen squeezed upward  head against the low top  and then turned back  pale faced   it s stopped .     it ll be hours  fore the storm s over .  we ve got t  have air till then .  crawl in back there and start it again .   his voice was flat and final .    here   he said  as the other crawled over his shoulder into the back of the car .   here s the tool kit .  y ve got  bout twenty minutes  fore the air gets too foul t  breathe .   tis pretty bad now .    the clouds of sand hemmed in closer and the dim yellow light above george s head dispelled only partially the darkness within .   there was the sound of scrambling from behind him and then allen s voice   damn this rope .  what s it doing here .   there was a hammering and then a disgusted curse .   this thing is choked with rust .     anything else wrong .   called out the ganymedan .    don t know .  wait till i clear it out .   more hammering and an almost continuous harsh  scraping sound followed .   allen backed into his seat once more .  his face dripped rusty perspiration and a swab with the back of an equally damp  rust covered hand did it no good .    the pump is leaking like a punctured kettle  now that the rust s been knocked loose .  i ve got it going at top speed  but the only thing between it and a total breakdown is a prayer .     start praying   said george  bruskly .   pray for a button to push .    the earthman frowned  and stared ahead in sullen silence .   at four in the afternoon  the ganymedan drawed   air s beginning t  thin out  looks like .    allen snapped to alertness .  the air was foul and humid within .  the ventilator behind swished sibilantly between each click and the clicks were spacing themselves further apart .  it wouldn t hold out much longer now .    how much ground have we covered .       bout a thaird o  the distance   was the reply .   how  r y  holding out .     well enough   allen snapped back .  he retired once more into his shell .   night came and the first brilliant stars of a martian night peeped out when with a last futile and long sustained swi i is s sh  the ventilator died .    domn .   said george .   i can t breathe this soup any longer  anyway .  open the windows .    the keenly cold martian wind swept in and with it the last traces of sand .  george coughed as he pulled his woolen cap over his ears and turned on the heaters .    y  can still taste the grit .    allen looked wistfully up into the skies   there s earth  with the moon hanging right onto her tail .     airth .   repeated george with fine contempt .  his finger pointed horizonwards   there s good old jupe for y  .    and throwing back his head  he sang in a full throated baritone   when the golden orb o  love shines down from the skies above  then my spirit longs to go to that happy land i know  back f good  old ganyme e e e e ede .    the last note quavered and broke  and quavered and broke again and still again in an ever increasing rapidity of tempo until its vibrating ululation pierced the air about ear shatteringly .   allen stared at his brother wide eyed   how did you do that .    george grinned   that s the gannie quaver .  didn t y  ever hear it before .    the earthman shook his head   i ve heard of it  but that s all .    the other became a bit more cordial   well  o  course y  can only do it in a thin atmosphere .  y  should hear me on gannie .  i c d shake y  right off y r chair when i m going good .  here .  wait till i gulp down some coffee  and then i ll sing y  vairse twenty four o  the  ballad o  ganymede .     he took a deep breath    there s a fair haired maid i love  standing in the light o  jove and she s waiting there for me e e e e .   then      allen grasped him by the arm and shook him .  the ganymedan choked into silence .    what s the matter .   he asked sharply .    there was a thumping sound on the roof just a second ago .  there s something up there .    george stared upwards   grab the wheel .  i ll go up .   allen shook his head   i m going myself .  i wouldn t trust myself running this primitive contraption .    he was out on the running board the next instant .    keep her going   he shouted  and threw one foot up onto the roof .   he froze in that position when he became aware of two yellow slits of eyes staring hard into his .  it took not more than a second for him to realize that he was face to face with a keazel  a situation which for discomfort is about on a par with the discovery of a rattlesnake in one s bed back on earth .   there was little time for mental comparisons of his position with earth predicaments  however  for the keazel lunged forward  its poisonous fangs agleam in the starlight .   allen ducked desperately and lost his grip .  he hit the sand with a slow motion thud and the cold  scaly body of the martian reptile was upon him .   the earthman s reaction was almost instinctive .  his hand shot out and clamped down hard upon the creature s narrow muzzle .   in that position  beast and man stiffened into breathless statuary .  the man was trembling and within him his heart pounded away with hard rapidity .  he scarcely dared move .  in the unaccustomed martian gravity  he found he could not judge the movements of his limbs .  muscles knotted almost of their own accord and legs swung when they ought not to .   he tried to lie still   and think .   the keazel squirmed  and from its lips  clamped shut by earth muscles  issued a tremendous whine .  allen s hand grew slick with perspiration and he could feel the beast s muzzle turn a bit within his palm .  he clamped harder  panic stricken .  physically  the keazel was no match for an earthman  even a tired  frightened  gravity unaccustomed earthman   but one bite  anywhere  was all that was needed .   the keazel jerked suddenly  its back humped and its legs threshed .  allen held on with both hands and could not let go .  he had neither gun or knife .  there was no rock on the level desert sands to crack its skull against .  the sand truck had long since disappeared into the martian night  and he was alone  alone with a keazel .   in desperation  he twisted .  the keazel s head bent .  he could hear its breath whistling forth harshly   and again there was that low whine .   allen writhed above it and clamped knees down upon its cold  scaly abdomen .  he twisted the head  further and further .  the keazel fought desperately  but allen s earthly biceps maintained their hold .  he could almost sense the beast s agony in the last stages  when he called up all his strength    and something snapped .   and the beast lay still .   he rose to his feet  half sobbing .  the martin night wind knifed into him and the perspiration froze on his body .  he was alone in the desert .   reaction set in .  there was an intense buzzing in his ears .  he found it difficult to stand .  the wind was biting   but somehow he didn t feel it any more .   the buzzing in his ears resolved itself into a voice   a voice calling weirdly through the martian wind .    all n  where are y  .  domn y   y  tanderfoot  where are y  .  all n .  all n .    new life swept into the earthman .  he tossed the keazel s carcass onto his shoulders and staggered on towards the voice .    here i am  g gannie .  right here .    he stumbled blindly into his brother s arms .   george began harshly   y  blasted airthman  can t y  even keep y r footing on a sandtruck moving at ten miles per .  y  might ve       his voice died away in a semi gurgle .   allen said tiredly   there was a keazel on the roof .  he knocked me off .  here  put it somewhere .  there s a hundred dollar bonus for every keazel skin brought in to aresopolis .    he had no clear recollection of anything for the next half hour .  when things straightened out  he was in the truck again with the taste of warm coffee in his mouth .  the engine was rumbling once more and the pleasant warmth of the heaters surrounded him .   george sat next to him silently  eyes fixed on the desert ahead .  but once in a while  he cleared his throat and shot a lightning glance at his brother .  there was a queer look in his eyes .   allen said   listen  i ve got to keep awake   and you look half dead yourself   so how about teaching me that  gannie quaver  of yours .  that s bound to wake the dead .    the ganymedan stared even harder and then said gruffly   sure  watch m  adam s apple while i do  t again .    the sun was half way to zenith when they reached the canal .   an hour before dawn there had come the crackling sound of hoarfrost beneath the heavy wheels and that signified the end of the desert area and the approach of the canal oasis .  with the rising of the sun  the crackling disappeared and the softening mud underneath slowed the sand adapted truck .  the pathetic clumps of gray green scrub that dotted the flat landscape were the first variant to eternal red sand since the two had started on their journey .   and then allen had learned forward and grasped his brother by the arm   look  there s the canal itself right ahead .    the  canal    a small tributary of the mighty jefferson canal   contained a mere trickle of water at this season of the year .  a dirty winding line of dampness  it was  and little more .  surrounding it on both sides were the boggy areas of black mud that were to fill up into a rushing ice cold current an earth year hence .   the sand truck nosed gingerly down the gentle slope  weaving a tortuous path among the sparsely strewn boulders brought down by the spring s torrents and left there as the sinking waters receded .   it slopped through the mud and splashed clumsily through the puddles .  it jounced noisily over rocks  muddied itself past the hubs as it made its way through the murky mid stream channel and then settled itself for the upward pull out .   and then  with a suddenness that tossed the two drivers out of their seats  it sideslipped  made one futile effort to proceed onwards and thereafter refused to budge .   the brothers scrambled out and surveyed the situation .  george swore lustily  voice more thickly accented than ever .    b  jupe  n  domn  we re in a pickled situation f r fair .   tis wallowing in the mud there like a blasted pig .    allen shoved his hair back wearily   well  don t stand there looking at it .  we re still a hundred miles or better from areso polis .  we ve got to get it out of there .     sure  but how .   his imprecations dropped to sibilant breathings as he reached into the truck for the coil of rope in the back .  he looked at it doubtfully .    y  get in here  all n  and when i pull  press down with y r foot on that pedal .    he was tying the rope to the front axle even as he spoke .  he played it out behind him as he slogged out through ankledeep mud  and stretched it taut .    all right  now  give i  he yelled .  his face turned purple with effort as his back muscles ridged .  allen  within the car  pressed the indicated pedal to the floor  heard a loud roar from the engine and a spinning whir from the back wheels .  the truck heaved once  and then sank back .     tis no use   george called .   i can t get a footing .  if the ground were dry  i c d do it .     if the ground were dry  we wouldn t be stuck   retorted allen .   here  give me that rope .     d y  think y  can do it  if   can t .   came the enraged cry  but the other had already left the car .   allen had spied the large  deep bedded boulder from the truck  and it was with relief that he found it to be within reaching distance of the rope .  he pulled it taut and tossed its free end about the boulder .  knotting it clumsily  he pulled  and it held .   his brother leaned out of the car window  as he made his way  back  with one lumped ganymedan fist agitating the air .    hi  y  nitwit .  what re y  doing .  d  y  expect that overgrown rock t  pull us out .     shut up   yelled back allen   and feed her the gas when i pull .    he paused midway between boulder and truck and seized the rope .    give .   he shouted in his turn  and with a sudden jerk pulled the rope toward him with both hands .   the truck moved  its wheels caught hold .  for a moment it hesitated with the engine blasting ahead full speed  and george s hands trembling upon the wheel .  and then it went over .  and almost simultaneously  the boulder at the other end of the taut rope lifted out of the mud with a liquid smacking sound and went over on its side .   allen slipped the noose off it and ran for the truck .    keep her going   he shouted  and hopped onto the running board  rope trailing .    how did y  do that .   asked george  eyes round with awe .    i haven t got the energy to explain it now .  when we get to aresopolis and after we ve had a good sleep  i ll draw the triangle of forces for you  and show you what happened .  no muscles were involved .  don t look at me as if i were hercules .    george withdrew his gaze with an effort   triangle o  forces  is it .  i never heard o  it  but if that s what it c n do  education s a great thing .     comet gas .  is any coffee left .   he stared at the last thermos bottle  shook it near his ear dolefully  and said   oh  well  let s practice the quaver .  it s almost as good and i ve practically got it perfected .    he yawned prodigiously   will we make it by nightfall .     maybe .    the canal was behind them now .   the reddening sun was lowering itself slowly behind the southern range .  the  southern range is one of the two  mountain chains  left on mars .  it is a region of hills  ancient  time worn  eroded hills behind which lies aresopolis .   it possesses the only scenery worth mentioning on all mars and also the golden attribute of being able  through the up drafts along its sides to suck an occasional rain out of the desiccated martian atmosphere .   ordinarily  perhaps  a pair from earth and ganymede might have idled through this picturesque area  but this was definitely not the case with the carter twins .   eyes  puffed for lack of sleep  glistened once more at the sight of hills on the horizon .  bodies  almost broken for sheer weariness  tensed once more when they rose against the sky .   and the truck leaped ahead    for just behind the hills lay aresopolis .  the road they traveled was no longer a rule edge straight one  guided by the compass  over table top flat land .  it followed narrow  twisting trails over rocky ground .   they had reached twin peaks  then  when there was a sudden sputter from the motor  a few halting coughs and then silence .   allen sat up and there was weariness and utter disgust in his voice   what s wrong with this everlastingly to be damned machine now .    his brother shrugged   nothing that i haven t been expecting for the last hour .  we re out o  gas .  doesn t matter at all .  we re at twin peaks   only ten miles fr m the city .  we c n get there in an hour  and then they c n send men out here for the blooms .     ten miles in an hour .   protested allen .   you re crazy .   his face suddenly twisted at an agonizing thought   my god .  we can t do it under three hours and it s almost night .  no one can last that long in a martian night .  george  we re       george was pulling him out of the car by main force   by jupe  n  domn  all n  don t let the tenderfoot show through now .  we c n do it in an hour  i tell y  .  didn t y  ever try running under sub normal gravity .  it s like flying .  look at me .    he was off  skimming the ground closely  and proceeding in ground covering leaps that shrank him to a speck up the mountain side in a moment .   he waved  and his voice came thinly   come on .    allen started    and sprawled at the third wild stride  arms flailing and legs straddled wide .  the ganymedan s laughter drifted down in heartless gusts .   allen rose angrily and dusted himself .  at an ordinary walk  he made his way upwards .    don t get sore  all n   said george .   it s a knack  and i ve had practice on gannie .  just pretend y r running along a feather bed .  run rhythmically   a sort o  very slow rhythm  and run close t  the ground  don t leap high .  like this .  watch me .    the earthman tried it  eyes on his brother .  his first few uncertain strides became surer and longer .  his legs stretched and his arms swung as he matched his brother  step for step .   george shouted encouragement and speeded his pace   keep lower t  the ground  all n .  don t leap  fore y r toes hit the ground .    allen s eyes shone and  for the moment  weariness was forgotten   this is great .  it is like flying   or like springs on your shoes .     y  ought t  have lived on gannie with me .  we ve got special fields f r subgravity races .  an expairt racer c n do forty miles an hour at times   and i c n do thirty five myself .    o  course  the gravity there s a bit lower than here on mars .    long hair streamed backwards in the wind and skin reddened at the bittercold air that blew past .  the ruddy patches of sunlight traveled higher and higher up the slopes  lingered briefly upon the very summits and went out altogether .  the short martian twilight started upon its rapidly darkening career .  the evening star   earth   was already glimmering brightly  its attendant moon somewhat closer than the night previous .   the passing minutes went unheeded by allen .  he was too absorbed by the wonderful new sensation of sub gravity running  to do anything more than follow his brother .  even the increasing chilliness scarcely registered upon his consciousness .   it was george  then  upon whose countenance a tiny  puckered uneasiness grew into a vast  panicky frown .    hi  all n  hold up .   he called .  leaning backward  he brought himself to a short  hopping halt full of grace and ease .  allen tried to do likewise  broke his rhythm and went forward upon his face .  he rose with loud reproaches .   the ganymedan turned a deaf ear to them .  his gaze was sombre in the dusk   d  y  know where we are  all n .    allen felt a cold constriction about his windpipe as he stared about him quickly .  things looked different in semi darkness  but they looked more different than they ought .  it was impossible for things to be so different .    we should ve sighted old baldy by now  shouldn t we have .   he quavered .    we sh d ve sighed him long ago   came the hard answer .     tis that domned quake .  landslides must ve changed the trails .  the peaks themselves must ve been screwed up      his voice was thin edged   allen   tisn t any use making believe .  we re dead lost .    for a moment  they stood silently   uncertainly .  the sky was purple and the hills retreated into the night .  allen licked bluechilled lips with a dry tongue .    we can t be but a few miles away .  we re bound to stumble on the city if we look .     consider the situation  airthman   came the savage  shouted answer     tis night  martian night .  the temperature s down past zero and plummeting every minute .  we haven t any time t  look    we ve got t  go straight there .  if we re not there in half an hour  we re not going t  get there at all .    allen knew that well  and mention of the cold increased his consciousness of it .  he spoke through chattering teeth as he drew his heavy  fur lined coat closer about him .    we might build a fire .   the suggestion was a half hearted one  muttered indistinctly  and fallen upon immediately by the other .    with what .   george was beside himself with sheer disappointment and frustration .   we ve pulled through this far  and now we ll prob ly freeze t  death within a mile o  the city .  c mon  keep running .  it s a hundred t  one chance .    but allen pulled him back .  there was a feverish glint in the earthman s eye   bonfires .   he said irrelevantly .   it s a possibility .  want to take a chance that might do the trick .     nothin  else t  do   growled the other .   but hurry .  every minute i        then run with the wind   and keep going .     why .     never mind why .  do what i say   run with the wind .    there was no false optimism in allen as he bounded through the dark  stumbling over loose stones  sliding down declivities    always with the wind at his back .  george ran at his side  a vague  formless blotch in the night .   the cold was growing more bitter  but it was not quite as bitter as the freezing pang of apprehension gnawing at the earthman s vitals .   death is unpleasant .   and then they topped the rise  and from george s throat came a loud  b  jupe  n  domn .   of triumph .   the ground before them  as far as the eye could see  was dotted by bonfires .  shattered aresopolis lay ahead  its homeless inhabitants making the night bearable by the simple agency of burning wood .   and on the hilly slortes  two weary figures slapped each other on the backs  laughed wildly and pressed half frozen  stubbly cheeks together for sheer  unadulterated joy .   they were there at last .   the aresopolis lab  on the very outskirts of the city  was one of the few structures still standing .  within  by makeshift light  haggard chemists were distilling the last drops of extract .   without  the city s police force remnants were clearing desperate way for the precious flasks and vials as they were distributed to the various emergency medical centres set up in various regions of the bonfire pocked ruins that were once the martian metropolis .   old hal vincent supervised the process and his faded eyes ever and again peered anxiously into the hills beyind  watching hopefully but doubtfully for the promised cargo of blooms .   and then two figures reeled out of the darkness and collapsed to a halt before him .   chill anxiety clamped down upon him   the blooms .  where are they .  have you got them .     at twin peaks   gasped allen .   a ton of them and better in a sand truck .  send for them .      a group of police grind cars set off before he had finished  and vincent exclaimed bewilderedly   a sand truck .  why didn t you send it in a ship .  what s wrong with you out there  anyway .  earthquake      he received no direct answer .  george had stumbled toward the nearest bonfire with a beatific expression on his worn face .    ahhh   tis warm .   slowly  he folded and dropped  asleep before he hit the ground .   allen coughed gaspingly   huh .  the gannie tenderfoot .  couldn t   ulp   take it .    and the ground came up and hit him in the face .   allen woke with the evening sun in his eyes and the odor of frying bacon in his nostrils .  george shoved the frying pan toward him and said between gigantic  wolfing mouthfuls   help yourself .     he pointed to the empty sand truck outside the labs   they got the stuff all right .    allen fell to  quietly .  george wiped his lips with the back of his hand and said   say  all n  how  d y  find the city .  i ve been sitting here trying t  figure it all out .     it was the bonfires   came the muffled answer .   it was the only way they could get heat  and fires over square miles of land create a whole section of heated air  which rises  causing the cold surrounding air of the hills to sweep in .   he suited his words with appropriate gestures .   the wind in the hills was heading for the city to replace warm air and we followed the wind .    sort of a natural compass  pointing to where we wanted to go .    george was silent  kicking with embarrassed vigor at the ashes of the bonfire of the night before .    lis n  all n  i ve had y  a wrong .  y  were an airthman tanderfoot t  me till     he paused  drew a deep breath and exploded with   well  by jupe  n  domn  y r my twin brother and i m  . proud o  it .  all airth c dn t drown out the carter blood in y  .    the earthman opened his mouth to reply but his brother clamped one palm over it .   y  keep quiet  till i m finished .  after we get back  y  can fix up that mechanical picker or anything else y  want .  i drop my veto .  if airth and machines c n tairn out y r kind o  man  they re all right .  but just the same   there was a trace of wistfulness in his voice   y  got t  admit that everytime the machines broke down   from irrigation trucks and rocket ships to ventilators and sand trucks   twas men who had t  pull through in spite o  all that mars could do .    allen wrenched his face from out behind the restraining palm .   the machines do their best   he said  but not too vehemently .    sure  but that s all they can do .  when the emergency comes  a man s got t  do a damn lot better than his best or he s a goner .    the other paused  nodded and gripped the other s hand with sudden fierceness   oh  we re not so different .  earth and ganymede are plastered thinly over the outside of us  but inside       he caught himself .    come on  let s give out with that old gannie quaver .    and from the two fraternal throats tore forth a shrieking eldritch yell such as the thin  cold martian air had seldom before carried .   the end    i got the cover again with  heredity .    in connection with that story  i remember best a comment i received from a young fellow named scott feldman  who was then still in his teens but who was later  as scott meredith  to become one of the most important literary agents in the business  .  he disapproved of the story because i introduced two characters at the start who disappeared from the story and were never heard of again .   once that was pointed out to me  it seemed to me that this was indeed a major flaw  and i wondered why neither campbell nor pohl had specifically pointed it out .  i never quite had the courage to ask  however .   but it did cause me to look at my stories more closely thereafter  and to realize again that writing isn t all inspiration and free flow .  you do have to ask yourself pretty mechanical questions  such as   what do i do with this character now that i ve taken the trouble to make use of him .    by the time campbell was rejecting  and pohl accepting  heredity   i was writing  history .   the same thing happened .  i submitted it to campbell on september    .  it was rejected  and  eventually  pohl took it .            history     ullen s lank arm pushed the stylus carefully and painstakingly across the paper  his near sighted eyes blinked through thick lenses .  the signal light flashed twice before he answered .   he turned a page  and called out   is dat you  johnnie .  come in  please .    he smiled gently  his thin  martian face alight with pleasure .    sit down  johnnie   but first lower de window shade .  de glare of your great eard sun is annoying .  ah  dat s good  and now sid down and be very  very quiet for just a little while  because i am busy .    john brewster shifted a pile of ill stacked papers and seated himself .  he blew the dust from the edges of an open book in the next chair and looked reproachfully on the martian historian .    are you still poking around these musty old things .  don t you get tired .     please  johnnie   ullen did not look up   you will lose de page .  dat book dere is william stewart s  hitlerian era  and it is very hard to read .  so many words h   uses which he doesn t explain .    his expression as it focussed upon johnnie was one of frowning petulance   never do dey explain deir terms .  it is so unscientific .  on mars  before we even start  we say   dis is a list of all definitions of terms to be used .   how oderwise can people talk sensibly .  hmp .  you crazy eardmen .     oh  nuts  ullen   forget it .  why don t you look at me .  don t you even notice anything .    the martian sighed  removed his glasses  cleaned them thoughtfully and carefully replaced them .  he stared impersonally at johnnie   well  i dink it is new clothes you are wearing .  it is not so .     new clothes .  is that all you can say  ullen .  this is a uniform .  i m a member of the home defense .   he rose to his feet  a picture of boyish exuberance .    what is dis  home defense  .   asked ullen languidly .   johnnie gulped and sat down helplessly   you know  i really think you haven t heard that earth and venus have been at war for the last week .  i ll bet money you haven t .     i ve been busy .   he frowned and pursed his thin  bloodless lips   on mars  dere is no war   at least  dere isn t any more .  once  we used to fight  but dat was long ago .  once we were scientists  too  and dat was long ago .  now  dere are only a few of us   and we do not fight .  dere is no happiness dat way .   he seemed to shake himself  and spoke more briskly   tell me  johnnie  do you know where it is i can find what it means  dis  national honor .   it holds me back .  i can t go furder unless i can understand it .    johnnie rose to his full height and glittered in the spotless green of the terrestrial service .  he laughed with fond indulgence .   you re hopeless  ullen    you old coot .  aren t you going to wish me luck .  i m hitting space tomorrow .     oh  is dere danger .    there was a squawk of laughter   danger .  what do you think .     well  den  to seek danger   it is foolish .  why do you do it .     you wouldn t understand  ullen .  just wish me luck and say you hope i come through whole .     cer tain ly .  i don t want anyone to die .   he slipped his hand into the strong fist held out to him .   take care of yourself  johnnie   and wait  before you go  bring me stewart s book .  everything is so heavy here on eard .  heavy  heavy   and de words have no definitions .    he sighed  and was back at his books as johnnie slipped quietly out of the room .    dese barbarous people   he muttered sleepily to himself .   war .  dey dink dat by killing     his voice died away and merged into a slurred mumble as his eyes followed creeping finger across the page .      from the very moment of the union of the anglo saxon world into a single governmental entity and even as far back as the spring of       it was evident that the doom of        dese crazy eardmen .    ullen leaned heavily upon his crutches on the steps of the university library and one thin hand shielded his watering eyes from the terrible earthly sun .   the sky was blue  cloudless    undisturbed .  yet somewhere up above  beyond the planet s airy blanket  steel sided ships were veering and sparking in vicious combat .  and down upon the city were falling the tiny  drops of death   the highly publicized radioactive bombs that noiselessly and inexorably ate out a fifteen foot crater wherever they fell .   the city s population was herding into the shelters and burying themselves inside the deep set leaden cells .  upstaring  silent  anxious  they streamed past ullen .  uniformed guards invested some sort of order into the gigantic flight  steering the stragglers and speeding the laggards .   the air was filled with barked orders .    hit the shelter  pop .  better get going .  you can t stand there  you know .    ullen turned to the guard who addressed him and slowly brought his wandering thoughts to bear upon the situation .    i am sorry  eardman   but i cannot move very fast on your huge world .   he tapped one crutch upon the marble flags beneath .   dings are so heavy .  if i were to crowd in wid de rest  i would be crushed .    he smiled gently down from his lank height  and the guard rubbed a stubby chin   all right  pop  i can fix that .  it is tough on you marsies at that .    here  hold those crutches up out of the way .    with a heave  he cradled the martian   hold your legs close to my body  because we re going to travel fast .    his bulky figure pressed through the line of earthmen .  ullen shut his eyes as the rapid motion under supernormal gravity stirred his stomach into rebellion .  he opened them once again in the dim recesses of the low ceilinged shelter .   the guard set him down carefully and adjusted the crutches beneath ullen s armpits   o . k .  pop .  take care of yourself .    ullen took in his surroundings and hobbled to one of the low benches at the near end of the shelter .  from behind him came the sombre clang of the thick  leaden door .   the martian historian fished a worn tablet from his pocket and scribbled slow notes .  he disregarded the excited babble that arose about him and the scraps of heated talk that filled the air thickly .   and then he scratched at his furrowed forehead with the stub end of his pencil  meeting the staring eyes of the man sitting next to him .  he smiled abstractedly and returned to his notes .    you re a martian  aren t you .   his neighbor spoke in quick  squeaky tones .   i don t like foreigners much  but i ve got nothing special against marsies .  these veenies  now  they       ullen s soft tones interrupted him .   hate is all wrong  i dink .  dis war is a great annoyance   a great one .  it interferes wid my work and you eardmen ought to stop it .  is it not so .     you can bet your hide we re going to stop it   came the emphatic reply .   we re going to bash their planet inside out  and the dirty veenies with it .     you mean attack deir cities like dis .   the martian blinked owlishly in thought   you dink dat would be best .     damn it  yes .  it        but look .   ullen placed a skeleton finger in one palm and continued in gentle argument .   would it not be easier to get de ships demselves by de fall apart weapon .    don t you dink so .  or is it dat de venus people  dey have de screens .     what weapon  did you say .    ullen ruminated carefully   i suppose dat isn t de name you call it by   but i don t know about weapons  anyway .  we call it on mars de  skellingbeg  and dat means in english  fall apart weapon .   now you know .    there was no direct answer unless a vague under breath mutter could be called one .  the earthman pushed away from his companion and stared at the opposite wall in a fidget .   ullen sensed the rebuff and shrugged one shoulder wearily   it is not dat i care much about de whole ding .  it is only dat de war is a big bodder .  it should be ended .   he sighed   but i don t care .    his fingers had just begun manipulating the pencil once more in its travels across the open tablet on his lap  when he looked up again .    tell me  please  what is de name of dat country where hitler died .  your hard names  dey are so complicated sometimes .  i dink it begins wid an m .    his neighbor ripped him open with a stare and walked away   ullen s eyes followed him with a puzzled frown .  and then the all clear signal sounded .   oh  yes   said ullen .   madagascar .  such a silly name .    johnnie brewster s uniform was war worn now  a bit more wrinkled about the neck and shoulders  a trance more worn at knees and elbows .   ullen ran his finger along the angry scar that ran the length of johnnie s right fore arm   it hurts no more  johnnie .     nuts .  a scratch .  i got the veenie that did that .  he s chasing dreams in the moon now .     you were in de hospital long  johnnie .     a week .   he lit a cigarette  pushed some of the mess off the martian s desk and seated himself .   i ve spent the rest of the time with my family  though i did get around to visiting you  you see .    he leaned over and poked an affectionate hand at the martian s leathery cheek   aren t you going to say you re glad to see me .    ullen removed his glasses and peered at the earthman   why  johnnie  are you so uncertain dat i am glad to see you  dat you require i should say it in words .   he paused   i ll make a note of dat .  you silly eardmen must always be telling each oder dese simple dings   and den you don t believe it anyway .  on mars       he was rubbing his glasses methodically  as he spoke  and now he replaced them   johnnie  don t you eardmen have de  fall apart  weapon .  i met a person once in de raid shelter and he didn t know what i was talking about .    johnnie frowned   i don t either  for that matter .  why do you ask .     because it seems strange dat you should have to fight so hard dese venus men  when dey don t seem to have de screens to stop it wid .  johnnie  i want de war should be over .  it makes me all de time stop my work to go to a shelter .     hold on  now  ullen .  don t sputter .  what is this  fall apart  weapon .  a disintegrator .  what do you know about it .     i .  i know nodding about it at all .  i dought you knew   dat s why i asked .  back on mars  in our histories  dey talk about using dat kind of weapon in our old wars .  but we don t know nodding about weapons any more .  anyway  dey re so silly  because de oder side always dinks of someding which protects against it  and den everyding is de same as always .    johnnie  do you suppose you could go down to de desk and ask for a copy of higginboddam s  beginnings of space travel .     the earthman clenched his fists and shook them impotently   ullen  you damned martian pedant   don t you understand that this is important .  earth is at war .  war .  war .  war .     well  den  stop de war .   there was irritation in ullen s voice .   dere is no peace and quiet anywheres on eard .  i wish i had dis library   johnnie  be careful .  please  what are you doing .  you re hurting me .     i m sorry  ullen  but you ve got to come with me .  we re going to see about this .   johnnie had the feebly protesting martian wedged into the wheel chair and was off with a rush  before he had finished the sentence .   a rocket taxi was at the bottom of the library steps  and together chauffeur and spaceman lifted the chair inside .  with a comet tail of smoke  they were off .   ullen moaned softly at the acceleration  but johnnie ignored him .   washington in twenty minutes  fellow   he said to the driver   and ignore the signal beams .    the starched secretary spoke in a frozen monotone   admiral korsakoff will see you now .    johnnie wheeled and stamped out the last cigarette butt .  he shot a hasty glance at his watch and grunted .   at the motion of the wheel chair  ullen roused himself out of a troubled sleep .  he adjusted his glasses   did dey let us in finally  johnnie .     sh .    ullen s impersonal stare swept over the rich furnishings of the room  the huge maps of earth and venus on the wall  the imposing desk in the center .  it lingered upon the pudgy  bearded figure behind this desk and then came to rest upon the lanky  sandy haired man at his side .   the martian attempted to rise from the chair in sudden eagerness   aren t you dr .  doming .  i saw you last year at princeton .  you remember me  don t you .  dey gave me at dat time  my honorary degree .    dr .  thorning had advanced and shook hands vigorously    certainly .  you spoke then on martian historical methods  didn t you .     oh  you remember .  i m glad .  but dis is a great opportunity for me  meeting you .  tell me  as a scientist  what would be your opinion of my deory dat de social insecurity of de hitlerian era was de direct cause for de lag       dr .  thoming smiled   i ll discuss it with you later  dr .  ullen .  right now  admiral korsakoff wants information from you  with which we hope to end the war .     exactly   korsakoff spoke in clipped tones as he met ullen s mild gaze .   although a martian  i presume you favor the victory of the principles of freedom and justice over the foul practices of venusian tyranny .    ullen stared uncertainly   dat sounds familiar   but i don t dink about it much .  you mean  maybe  de war should end .     with victory  yes .     oh   victory   dat is just a silly word .  history proves dat a war decided on military superiority only lays de groundwork for future wars of retaliation and revenge .  i refer you to a very good essay on de subject by a james calkins .  it was published all de way back in      .     my dear sir .    ullen raised his voice in bland indifference to johnnie s urgent whisperings .   now to end de war   really end it   you should say to de plain people of venus   it is unnecessary to fight .  let us just talk        there was the slam of fist on desk and a muttered oath of frightful import .   for god s sakes  thorning  get what you want out of him .  i give you five minutes .    thorning stifled his chuckle   dr .  ullen  we want you to tell us what you know about the disintegrator .     disintegrator .   ullen put a puzzled finger to his cheek .    the one you told lieutenant brewster of .     ummmm    oh .  you mean de  fall apart  weapon .  i don t know nodding about it .  de martian historians mention it some times  but none of dem know about it   de technical side  dat is .    the sandy haired physicist nodded patiently   i know  i know .  but what do they say .  what kind of a weapon is it .     well  de way dey talk about it  it makes de metals to fall to pieces .  what is it you call de ding dat holds metals togedder  now .     intra molecular forces .    ullen frowned and then spoke thoughtfully   maybe .  i forgot what de martian word is     except dat it s long .  anyway  dis weapon  it makes dis force dat holds de metals togedder not to exist anymore and it all falls apart in a powder .  but it only works on de dree metals  iron  cobalt and   uh   de odder one .     nickel   prompted johnnie  softly .    yes  yes  nickel .    thorning s eyes glittered   aha  the ferromagnetic elements .  there s an oscillating magnetic field mixed up in this  or i m a veenie .  how about it  ullen .    the martian sighed   such crazy eard words .    let s see now  most of what i know about de weapon is from de work of hogel beg .  it was   i m pretty sure   in his  cultural and social history of de bird empire .   it was a huge work in twenty four volumes  but i always dought it was radder mediocre .  his technique in de presentation of        please   said thorning   the weapon        oh  yes  dat .   he hitched himself higher in his chair and grimaced with the effort .   he talks about electricity and it goes back and ford very fast   very fast  and its pressure     he paused hopelessly  and regarded the scowling visage of the bearded admiral naively   i dink de word is pressure  but i don t know  because it is hard to translate .  de martian word is  cranstad .   does dat help .     i think you mean  potential   dr .  ullen .   thorning sighed audibly .    well  if you say so .  anyway  dis  potential  changes also very fast and de two changes are synchronized somehow along wid magnetism dat   uh     shifts and dat s all i know about it .   he smiled uncertainly   i would like to go back now .  it would be all right now  wouldn t it .    the admiral vouchsafed no answer   do you make anything out of that mess  doctor .     damned little   admitted the physicist   but it gives me a lead or two .  we might try getting hold of this beg s book  but there s not much hope .  it will simply repeat what we ve just heard .  dr .  ullen  are there any scientific works on your planet .    the martian saddened   no  dr .  doming  dey were all destroyed during de kalynian reaction .  on mars  we doroughly disbelieve in science .  history has shown dat it comes from science no happiness .   he turned to the young earthman at his side   johnnie  let us go now  please .    korsakoff dismissed the two with a wave of the hand .   ullen bent carefully over the closely typed manuscript and inserted a word .  he glanced up brightly at johnnie brewster  who shook his head and placed a hand on the martian s arm .  his brow furrowed more deeply .    ullen   he said harshly   you re in trouble .     eh .  i .  in trouble .  why  johnnie  dat is not so .  my book is coming along famously .  de whole first volume  it is completed and  but for a bit of polishing  is ready for de printers .     ullen  if you can t give the government definite information on the disintegrator  i won t answer for the consequences .     but i told all i knew       it won t do .  it s not enough .  you ve got to remember more  ullen  you ve got to .     but knowledge where dere is none is impossible to have  dat is an axiom .   ullen sat upright in his seat  propping himself on a crutch .    i know it   johnnie s mouth twisted in misery   but you ve got to understand .    the venusians have control of space  our asteroid garrisons have been wiped out  and last week phobos and deimos  .  fell .  communications between earth and luna are broken and god knows how jong the lunar squadron can hold out .  earth itself is scarcely secure and their bombings are becoming more serious    oh  ullen  don t you understand .    the martian s look of confusion deepened   eard is losing .     god  yes .     den give up .  dat is de logical ding to do .  why did you start at all   you stupid eardmen .    johnnie ground his teeth   but if we have the disintegrator  we won t lose .    ullen shrugged   oh  johnnie  it gets wearisome to listen to de same old story .  you eardmen have one track minds .  look  wouldn t it make you feel better to have me read you some of my manuscript .  it would do your intellect good .     all right  ullen  you ve asked for it  and here s everything right out .  if you don t tell thorning what he wants to know  you re going to be arrested and tried for treason .    there was a short silence  and then a confused stutter  t treason .  you mean dat i betray      the historian removed his glasses and wiped them with shaking hand   it s not true .  you re trying to frighten me .     oh  no  i m not .  korsakoff thinks you know more than you re telling .  he s sure that you re either holding out for a price or  more likely  that you ve sold out to the veenies .     but doming       thorning isn t any too secure himself .  he has his own skin to think of .  earth governments in moments of stress are not famous for being reasonable .   there were sudden tears in his eyes   ullen  there must be something you can do .  it s not only you   it s for earth .    ullen s breathing whistled harshly   dey tink i would sell my scientific knowledge .  is dat de kind of insult dey pay my sense of eddies  my scientific integrity .   his voice was thick with fury and for the first time since johnnie knew him  he lapsed into guttural martian .   for dat  i say not a word   he finished .   let dem put me in prison or shoot me  but dis insult i cannot forget .    there was no mistaking the firmness in his eyes  and johnnie s shoulders sagged .  the earthman didn t move at the glare of the signal light .    answer de light  johnnie   said the martian  softly   dey are coming for me .    in a moment  the room was crowded with green uniforms .  dr .  thorning and the two with him were the only ones present in civilian clothes .   ullen struggled to his feet   gentlemen  say nodding .  i have heard dat it is dought dat i am selling what i know   selling for money .   he spat the words .   it is a ding never before said of me   a ding i have not deserved .  if you wish you can imprison me immediately  but i shall say nodding more   nor have any ding furder to do wid de eard government .    a green garbed official stepped forward immediately  but dr .  thorning waved him back .    whoa  there  dr .  ullen   he said jovially   don t jump too soon .  i ve just come to ask if there isn t a single additional fact that you remember .  anything  no matter how insignificant      there was stony silence .  ullen leant heavily on his crutches but remained stolidly erect .   dr .  thorning seated himself imperturbably upon the historian s desk  picked up the high stack of type written pages   ah  is this the manuscript young brewster was telling me about .   he gazed at it curiously   well  of course  you realize that your attitude will force the government to confiscate all this .     eh .   ullen s stern expression melted into dismay .  his crutch slipped and he dropped heavily into his seat .   the physicist warded off the other s feeble clutch   keep your hands off  dr .  ullen  i m taking care of this .   he leafed through the pages with a rustling noise .   you see  if you are arrested for treason  your writings become subversive .     subversive .   ullen s voice was hoarse   dr .  doming  you don t know what you are saying .  it is my   my great labor .   his voice caught huskily   please  dr .  doming  give me my manuscript .    the other held it just beyond the martian s shaking fingers .    if    he said .    but i don t know .    the sweat stood out on the historian s pale face .  his voice came thickly .   time .  give me time .  but let me dink   and don t  please don t harm dis manuscript .    the other s fingers sank painfully into ullen s shoulder   so help me  i burn your manuscript in five minutes  if       wait  i ll tell you .  somewhere   i don t know where   it was said dat in de weapon dey used a special metal for some of de wiring .  i don t know what metal  but water spoiled it and had to be kept away   also air .  it        holy jumping jupiter   came the sudden shout from one of thorning s companions .   chief  don t you remember aspartier s work on sodium wiring in argon atmosphere five years ago      dr  thorning s eyes were deep with thought   wait   wait  wait   damn .  it was staring us in the face        i know   shrieked ullen suddenly .   it was in karisto .  he was discussing de fall of gallonie and dat was one of de minor causes   de lack of dat metal   and den he mentioned       he was talking to an empty room  and for a while he was silent in puzzled astonishment .   and then   my manuscript .   he salvaged it from where it lay scattered over the floor  hobbling painfully about  smoothing each wrinkled sheet with care .    de barbarians   to treat a great scientific work so .    ullen opened still another drawer and scrabbled through its contents .  he closed it and looked about peevishly   johnnie  where did i put dat bibliography .  did you see it .    he looked toward the window   johnnie .    johnnie brewster said   wait a while  ullen .  here they come now .    the streets below were a burst of color .  in a long  stiffly moving line the green of the navy paraded down the avenue  the air above them snow thick with confetti  hail thick with ticker tape .  the roar of the crowd was dull  muted .    ah  de foolish people   mused ullen .   dey were happy just like dis when de war started and dere was a parade just like dis   and now anodder one .  silly .   he stumped back to his chair .   johnnie followed   the government is naming a new museum after you  isn t it .     yes   was the dry reply .  he peered helplessly about under the desk   de ullen war museum   and it will be filled wid ancient weapons  from stone knife to anti aircraft gun .  dat is your queer eard sense of de fitness of dings .  where in dun deration is dat bibliography .     here   said johnnie  withdrawing the document from ullen s vest pocket .   our victory was due to your weapon  ancient to you  so it is fit in a way .     victory .  sure .  until venus rearms and reprepares and re fights for revenge .  all history shows   but never mind .  it is useless  dis talk .   he settled himself deeply in his chair   here  let me show you a real victory .  let me read you some of de first volume of my work .  it s already in print  you know .    johnnie laughed   go ahead  ullen .  right now i m even willing to listen to you read your entire twelve volumes   word for word .    and ullen smiled gently .   it would be good for your intellect   he said .   the end     history   you will notice  mentions hitler s end .  it was written in the first days of september       when hitler seemed at the very peak of his success .  france was defeated and occupied and britain was at bay and seemed unlikely to survive .    still  i had no doubt as to his ultimate defeat .  i did not visualize his ending in suicide  however  i thought that like napoleon and the kaiser  he would end his life in exile .  madagascar was the place i picked .   also mentioned in the story are  the tiny  drops of death   the highly publicized radioactive bombs that noiselessly and inexorably ate out a fifteen foot crater wherever they fell .    by the time i wrote the story  uranium fission had been discovered and announced .  i had not yet heard of it  however  and i was unaware that reality was about to outstrip my prized science fictional imagination .   on october           i visited campbell and outlined to him another robot story i wanted to write  a story i planned to call  reason .   campbell was completely enthusiastic .  i had trouble writing it and had to start over several times  but eventually it was done  and on november    i submitted it to john .  he accepted it on the twenty second  and it appeared in the april      issue of astounding .   it was the third story of mine that he had accepted and the first in which he did not ask for a revision .   he told me  in fact  that he had liked it so well  he had almost decided to pay me a bonus .    with  reason   the  positronic robot  series was fairly launched  and my two most successful characters yet  gregory powell and mike donovan  improvements on turner and snead of  ring around the sun   made their appearance .  eventually   reason  and others of the series that were to follow  together with  robbie   which campbell had rejected  were to appear in i  robot .   the success of  reason  didn t mean that i was to have no further rejections from campbell .   on december          influenced by the season and never stopping to think that a christmas story must sell no later than july in order to make the christmas issue  i began  christmas on ganymede .   i submitted it to him on the twenty third  but the holiday season did not affect his critical judgment .  he rejected it .   i tried pohl next  and  as was happening so often that year  he took it .  in this case  for reasons i will describe later  the acceptance fell through .  i eventually sold it the next summer  june           the proper time of year  to startling stories  the younger  sister magazine of thrilling wonder stones .            christmas on ganymede     olaf johnson hummed nasally to himself and his china blue eyes were dreamy as he surveyed the stately fir tree in the corner of the library .  though the library was the largest single room in the dome  olaf felt it none too spacious for the occasion .  enthusiastically he dipped into the huge crate at his side and took out the first roll of red and green crepe paper .   what sudden burst of sentiment had inspired the ganymedan products corporation  inc .  to ship a complete collection of christmas decorations to the dome  he did not pause to inquire .  olaf s was a placid disposition  and in his self imposed job as chief christmas decorator  he was content with his lot .   he frowned suddenly and muttered a curse .  the general assembly signal light was flashing on and off hysterically .  with a hurt air olaf laid down the tack hammer he had just lifted  then the roll of crepe paper  picked some tinsel out of his hair and left for officers quarters .   commander scott pelham was in his deep armchair at the head of the table when olaf entered .  his stubby fingers were drumming unrhythmically upon the glass topped table .  olaf met the commander s hotly furious eyes without fear  for nothing had gone wrong in his department in twenty ganymedan revolutions .   the room filled rapidly with men  and pelham s eyes hardened as he counted noses in one sweeping glance .    we re all here .  men  we face a crisis .    there was a vague stir .  olaf s eyes sought the ceiling and he relaxed .  crises hit the dome once a revolution  on the average .  usually they turned out to be a sudden rise in the quota of oxite to be gathered  or the inferior quality of the last batch of karen leaves .  he stiffened  however  at the next words .    in connection with the crisis  i have one question to ask .   pelham s voice was a deep baritone  and it rasped unpleasantly when he was angry .   what dirty imbecilic troublemaker has been telling those blasted ossies fairy tales .    olaf cleared his throat nervously and thus immediately became the center of attention .  his adam s apple wobbled in sudden alarm and his forehead wrinkled into a washboard .  he shivered .    i   i     he stuttered  quickly fell silent .  his long fingers made a bewildered gesture of appeal .   i mean i was out there yesterday  after the last   uh   supplies of karen leaves  on account the ossies were slow and    a deceptive sweetness entered pelham s voice .  he smiled .    did you tell those natives about santa claus  olaf .    the smile looked uncommonly like a wolfish leer and olaf broke down .  he nodded convulsively .    oh  you did .  well  well  you told them about santa claus .  he comes down in a sleigh that flies through the air with eight reindeer pulling it  huh .     well   er   doesn t he .   olaf asked unhappily .    and you drew pictures of the reindeer  just to make sure there was no mistake .  also  he has a long white beard and red clothes with white trimmings .     yeah  that s right   said olaf  his face puzzled .    and he has a big bag  chock full of presents for good little  boys and girls  and he brings it down the chimney and puts presents inside stockings .     sure .     you also told them he s about due  didn t you .  one more revolution and he s going to visit us .    olaf smiled weakly .   yeah  commander  i meant to tell you .  i m fixing up the tree and        shut up .   the commander was breathing hard in a whistling sort of way .   do you know what those ossies have thought of .     no  commander .    pelham leaned across the table toward olaf and shouted   they want santa claus to visit them .    someone laughed and changed it quickly into a strangling cough at the commander s raging stare .    and if santa claus doesn t visit them  the ossies are going to quit work .   he repeated   quit cold   strike .    there was no laughter  strangled or otherwise  after that .  if there were more than one thought among the entire group  it didn t show itself .  olaf expressed that thought    but what about the quota .     well  what about it .   snarled pelham .   do i have to draw pictures for you .  ganymedan products has to get one hundred tons of wolframite  eighty tons of karen leaves and fifty tons of oxite every year  or it loses its franchise .  i suppose there isn t anyone here who doesn t know that .  it so happens that the current year ends in two ganymedan revolutions  and we re five per cent behind schedule as it is .    there was pure  horrified silence .    and now the ossies won t work unless they get santa claus .  no work  no quota  no franchise   no jobs .  get that  you low grade morons .  when the company loses its franchise  we lose the best paying jobs in the system .  kiss them good bye  men  unless       he paused  glared steadily at olaf  and added    unless  by next revolution  we have a flying sleigh  eight reindeer and a santa claus .  and by every cosmic speck in the rings of saturn  we re going to have just that  especially a santa .    the faces turned ghastly pale .    got someone in mind  commander .   asked someone in a voice that was three quarters croak .    yes  as a matter of fact  i have .    he sprawled back in his chair .  olaf johnson broke into a sudden sweat as he found himself staring at the end of a pointing forefinger .    aw  commander .   he quavered .   the pointing finger never moved .   pelham tramped into the foreroom  removed his oxygen nosepiece and the cold cylinders attached to it .  one by one he cast off thick woolen outer garments and  with a final  weary sigh  jerked off a pair of heavy knee high space boots .   sim pierce paused in his careful inspection of the latest batch of karen leaves and cast a hopeful glance over his spectacles .    well .   he asked .   pelham shrugged .   i promised them santa .  what else could i do .  i also doubled sugar rations  so they re back on the job for the moment .     you mean till the santa we promised doesn t show up .   pierce straightened and waved a long karen leaf at the commander s face for emphasis .   this is the silliest thing i ever heard of .  it can t be done .  there ain t no santa claus .    try telling that to the ossies .   pelham slumped into a chair and his expression became stonily bleak .   what s benson doing .     you mean that flying sleigh he says he can rig up .   pierce held a leaf up to the light and peered at it critically .   he s a crackpot  if you ask me .  the old buzzard went down to the sub level this morning and he s been there ever since .  all i know is that he s taken the spare lectro dissociator apart .  if anything happens to the regular  it just means that we re without oxygen .     well   pelham rose heavily   for my part i hope we do choke .  it would be an easy way out of this whole mess .  i m going down below .    he stumped out and slammed the door behind him .   in the sub level he gazed about in bewilderment  for the room was littered with gleaming chrome steel machine parts .  it took him some time to recognize the mess as the remains of what had been a compact  snugly built lectro dissociator the day before .  in the center  in anachronistic contrast  stood a dusty wooden sleigh atop rust red runners .  from beneath it came the sound of hammering .    hey  benson .   called pelham .   a grimy  sweat streaked face pushed out from underneath the sleigh  and a stream of tobacco juice shot toward benson s ever present cuspidor .    what are you shouting like that for .   he complained .   this is delicate work .     what the devil is that weird contraption .   demanded pelham .    flying sleigh .  my own idea  too .   the light of enthusiasm shone in benson s watery eyes  and the quid in his mouth shifted from cheek to cheek as he spoke .   the sleigh was brought here in the old days  when they thought ganymede was covered with snow like the other jovian moons .  all i have to do is fix a few gravo repulsors from the dissociator to the bottom and that ll make it weightless when the current s on .   compressed air jets will do the rest .    the commander chewed his lower lip dubiously .    will it work .     sure it will .  lots of people have thought of using repulsors in air travel  but they re inefficient  especially in heavy gravity fields .  here on ganymede  with a field of one third gravity and a thin atmosphere  a child could run it .  even johnson could run it  though i wouldn t mourn if he fell off and broke his blasted neck .     all right  then  look here .  we ve got lots of this native purple wood .  get charlie finn and tell him to put that sleigh on a platform of it .  he s to have it extend about twenty feet or more frontward  with a railing around the part that projects .    benson spat and scowled through the stringy hair over his eyes .    what s the idea  commander .    pelham s laughter came in short  harsh barks .    those ossies are expecting reindeer  and reindeer they re going to have .  those animals will have to stand on something  won t they .     sure  .  .  .  but wait  hold on .  there aren t any reindeer on ganymede .    commander pelham paused on his way out .  his eyes narrowed unpleasantly as they always did when he thought of olaf johnson .    olaf is out rounding up eight spiny backs for us .  they ve got four feet  a head on one end and a tail on the other .  that s close enough for the ossies .    the old engineer chewed this information and chuckled nastily .    good .  i wish the fool joy of his job .     so do i   gritted pelham .   he stalked out as benson  still leering  slid underneath the sleigh .   the commander s description of a spinyback was concise and accurate  but it left out several interesting details .  for one thing  a spinyback has a long  mobile snout  two large ears that wave back and forth gently and two emotional purple eyes .  the males have pliable spines of a deep crimson color along the backbone that seem to delight the female of the species .   combine these with a scaly  muscular tail and a brain by no means mediocre  and you have a spinyback   or at least you have one if you can catch one .   it was just such a thought that occurred to olaf johnson as he sneaked down from the rocky eminence toward the herd of twenty five spinybacks grazing on the sparse  gritty undergrowth .  the nearest spinies looked up as olaf  bundled in fur and grotesque with attached oxygen nosepiece  approached .  however  spinies have no natural enemies  so they merely gazed at the figure with languidly disapproving eyes and returned to their crunchy but nourishing fare .   olaf s notions on bagging big game were sketchy .  he fumbled in his pocket for a lump of sugar  held it out and said    here  pussy  pussy  pussy  pussy  pussy .     the ears of the nearest spinie twitched in annoyance .  olaf came closer and held out the sugar again .    come  bossy .  come  bossy .    the spinie caught sight of the sugar and rolled his eyes at it .  his snout twitched as he spat out his last mouthful of vegetation and ambled over .  with neck stretched out  he sniffed .  then  using a rapid  expert motion  he struck at the out held palm and flipped the lump into his mouth .  olaf s other hand whistled down upon nothingness .   with a hurt expression  olaf held out another piece .    here  prince .  here  fido .    the spinie made a low  tremulous sound deep in his throat .  it was a sound of pleasure .  evidently this strange monstrosity before him  having gone insane  intended to feed him these bits of concentrated succulence forever .  he snatched and was back as quickly as the first time .  but  since olaf had held on firmly this time  the spinie almost bagged half a finger as well .   olaf s yell lacked a bit of the nonchalance necessary at such times .  nevertheless  a bite that can be felt through thick gloves is a bite .   he advanced boldly upon the spinie .  there are some things that stir the johnson blood and bring up the ancient spirit of the vikings .  having one s finger bitten  especially by an unearthly animal  is one of these .   there was an uncertain look in the spinie s eyes as he backed slowly away .  there weren t any white cubes being offered any more and he wasn t quite sure what was going to happen now .  the uncertainty vanished with a suddenness he did not expect  when two glove muffled hands came down upon his ears and jerked .  he let out a high pitched yelp and charged forward .   a spinie has a certain sense of dignity .  he doesn t like to have his ears pulled  particularly when other spinies  including several unattached females  have formed a ring and are looking on .   the earthman went over backward and remained in that position for awhile .  meantime  the spinie backed away a few feet in a gentlemanly manner and allowed johnson to get to his feet .   the old viking blood frothed still higher in olaf .  after rubbing the hurt spot where he had landed on his oxygen cylinder  he jumped  forgetting to allow for ganymedan gravity .  he sailed five feet over the spinie s back .   there was awe in the animal s eye as he watched olaf  for it was a stately jump .  but there was a certain amount of bewilderment as well .  there seemed to be no purpose to the maneuver .   olaf landed on his back again and got the cylinder in the same place .  he was beginning to feel a little embarrassed .  the sounds that came from the circle of onlookers were remarkably like snickers .    laugh .   he muttered bitterly .   i haven t even begun to fight yet .    he approached the spinie slowly  cautiously .  he circled  watching for his opening .  so did the spinie .  olaf feinted and the spinie ducked .  then the spinie reared and olaf ducked .   olaf kept remembering new profanity all the time .  the husky  ur r r r r  that came out the spinie s throat seemed to lack the brotherly spirit that is usually associated with christmas .   there was a sudden  swishing sound .  olaf felt something collide with his skull  just behind his left ear .  this time he turned a back somersault and landed on the nape of his neck .  there was a chorused whinny from the onlookers  and the spinie waved his tail triumphantly .   olaf got rid of the impression that he was floating through a star studden unlimited space and wavered to his feet    listen   he objected   using your tail is a foul .    he leaped back as the tail shot forward again  then flung himself forward in a diving tackle .  he grabbed at the spinie s feet and felt the animal come down on his back with an indignant yelp .   now it was a case of earth muscles against ganymedan muscles  and olaf became a man of brute strength .  he struggled up  and the spinie found himself slung over the stranger s shoulders .   the spinie objected vociferously and tried to prove his objections by a judicious whip of the tail .  but he was in an inconvenient position and the stroke whistled harmlessly over olaf s head .   the other spinies made way for the earthman with saddened expressions .  evidently they were all good friends of the captured animal and hated to see him lose a fight .  they returned to their meal in philosophic resignation  plainly convinced that it was kismet .   on the other side of the rocky ledge  olaf reached his prepared cave .  there was the briefest of scrambling struggles before he managed to sit down hard on the spinie s head and put enough knots into rope to hold him there .   a few hours later  when he had coralled his eighth spiny back  he possessed the technique that comes of long practice .  he could have given a terrestrial cowboy valuable pointers on throwing a maverick .  also  he could have given a terrestrial stevedore lessons in simple and compound swearing .    twas the night before christmas   and all through the ganymedan dome there was deafening noise and bewildering excitement  like an exploding nova equipped for sound .  around the rusty sleigh  mounted on its huge platform of purplewood  five earthmen were staging a battle royal with a spinie .   the spinie had definite views about most things  and one of his stubbornest and most definite views was that he would never go where he didn t want to go .  he made that clear by flailing one head  one tail  three spines and four legs in every possible direction  with all possible force .   but the earthmen insisted  and not gently .  despite loud  agonized squeaks  the spinie was lifted onto the platform  hauled into place and harnessed into hopeless helplessness .    okay .   peter benson yelled .   pass the bottle .    holding the spinie s snout with one hand  benson waved the bottle under it with the other .  the spinie quivered eagerly and whined tremulously .  benson poured some of the liquid down the animal s throat .  there was a gurgling swallow and an appreciative whinny .  the spinie s neck stretched out for more .   benson sighed .   our best brandy  too .    he up ended the bottle and withdrew it half empty .  the spinie  eyes whirling in their sockets rapidly  did what seemed an attempt at a gay jig .  it didn t last long  however  for ganymedan metabolism is almost immediately affected by alcohol .  his muscles locked in a drunken rigor and  with a loud hiccup  he went out on his feet .    drag out the next .   yelled benson .   in an hour the eight spinybacks were so many cataleptic statues .  forked sticks were tied around their heads as antlers .  the effect was crude and sketchy  but it would do .   as benson opened his mouth to ask where olaf johnson was  that worthy showed up in the arms of three comrades  and he was putting up as stiff a fight as any spinie .  his objections  however  were highly articulate .    i m not going anywhere in this costume .   he roared  gouging at the nearest eye .   you hear me .    there certainly was cause for objection .  even at his best  olaf had never been a heart throb .  but in his present condition  he resembled a hybrid between a spinie s nightmare and a picassian conception of a patriarch .   he wore the conventional costume of santa .  his clothes were as red as red tissue paper sewed onto his space coat could make it .  the  ermine  was as white as cotton wool  which it was .  his beard  more cotton wool glued into a linen foundation  hung loosely from his ears .  with that below and his oxygen nosepiece above  even the strongest were forced to avert their eyes .   olaf had not been shown a mirror .  but  between what he could see of himself and what his instinct told him  he would have greeted a good  bright lightning bolt like a brother .   by fits and starts  he was hauled to the sleigh .  others pitched in to help  until olaf was nothing but a smothered squirm and muffled voice .    leggo   he mumbled .   leggo and come at me one by one .  come on .    he tried to spar a bit  to point his dare .  but the multiple grips upon him left him unable to wriggle a finger .    get in .   ordered benson .    you go to hell .   gasped olaf .   i m not getting into any patented short cut to suicide  and you can take your bloody flying sleigh and        listen   interrupted benson   commander pelham is waiting for you at the other end .  he ll skin you alive if you don t show up in half an hour .     commander pelham can take the sleigh sideways and        then think of your job .  think of a hundred and fifty a week .  think of every other year off with pay .  think of hilda  back on earth  who isn t going to marry you without a job .  think of all that .    johnson thought  snarled .  he thought some more  got into the sleigh  strapped down his bag and turned on the gravo repulsors .  with a horrible curse  he opened the rear jet .   the sleigh dashed forward and he caught himself from going backward  over and out of the sleigh  by two thirds of a whisker .  he held onto the sides thereafter  watching the surrounding hills as they rose and fell with each lurch of the unsteady sleigh .   as the wind rose  the undulations grew more marked .  and when jupiter came up  its yellow light brought out every jag and crag of the rocky ground  toward every one of which  in turn  the sleigh seemed headed .  and by the time the giant planet had shoved completely over the horizon  the curse of drink   which departs from the ganymedan organism just as quickly as it descends   began removing itself from the spinies .   the hindmost spinie came out of it first  tasted the inside of his mouth  winced and swore off drink .  having made that resolution  he took in his immediate surroundings languidly .  they made no immediate impression on him .  only gradually was the fact forced upon him that his footing  whatever it was  was not the usual stable one of solid ganymede .  it swayed and shifted  which seemed very unusual .   yet he might have attributed this unsteadiness to his recent orgy  had he not been so careless as to drop his glance over the railing to which he was anchored .  no spinie ever died of heart failure  as far as is recorded  but  looking downward  this one almost did .   his agonized screech of horror and despair brought the other spinies into full  if headachy  consciousness .  for a while there was a confused blur of squawking conversation as the animals tried to get the pain out of their heads and the facts in .  both aims were achieved and a stampede was organized .  it wasn t much of a stampede  because the spinies were anchored tightly .  but  except for the fact that they got nowhere  they went through all the motions of a full gallop .  and the sleigh went crazy .   olaf grabbed his beard a second before it let go of his ears .    hey .   he shouted .   it was something like saying  tut  tut  to a hurricane .     the sleigh kicked  bucked and did a hysterical tango .  it made sudden spurts  as if inspired to dash its wooden brains out against ganymede s crust .  meanwhile olaf prayed  swore  wept and jiggled all the compressed air jets at once .   ganymede whirled and jupiter was a wild blur .  perhaps it was the spectacle of jupiter doing the shimmy that steadied the spinies .  more likely it was the fact that they just didn t give a hang any more .  whatever it was  they halted  made lofty farewell speeches to one another  confessed their sins and waited for death .   the sleigh steadied and olaf resumed his breathing once more .  only to stop again as he viewed the curious spectacle of the hills and solid ground up above  and black sky and swollen jupiter down below .   it was at this point that he  too  made his peace with the eternal and awaited the end .    ossie  is short for ostrich  and that s what native ganymedans look like  except that their necks are shorter  their heads are larger and their feathers look as if they were about to fall out by the roots .  to this  add a pair of scrawny  feathered arms with three stubby fingers apiece .  they can speak english  but when you hear them  you wish they couldn t .   there were fifty of them in the low purplewood structure that was their  meeting hall .   on the mound of raised dirt in the front of the room   dark with the smoky dimness of burning purplewood torches fetid to boot   sat commander scott pelham and five of his men .   . before them strutted the frowziest ossie of them all  inflating his huge chest with rhythmic  booming sounds .   he stopped for a moment and pointed to a ragged hole in the ceiling .    look .   he squawked .   chimney .  we make .  sannycaws come in .    pelham grunted approval .  the ossie clucked happily .  he pointed to the little sacks of woven grass that hung from the walls .    look .  stockies .  sannycaws put presets .     yeah   said pelham unenthusiastically .   chimney and stockings .  very nice .   he spoke out of the corner of his mouth to sim pierce  who sat next to him   another half hour in this dump will kill me .  when is that fool coming .    pierce stirred uneasily .    listen   he said   i ve been doing some figuring .  we re safe on everything but the karen leaves  and we re still four tons short on that .  if we can get this fool business over with in the next hour  so we can start the next shift and work the ossies at double  we can make it .   he leaned back .   yes  i think we can make it .     just about   replied pelham gloomily .   that s if johnson gets here without pulling another bloomer .    the ossie was talking again  for ossies like to talk .  he said    every year kissmess comes .  kissmess nice  everybody friendly .  ossie like kissmess .  you like kissmess .     yean  fine   pelham snarled politely .   peace on ganymede  good will toward men   especially johnson .  where the devil is that idiot  anyhow .    he fell into an annoyed fidget  while the ossie jumped up and down a few times in a thoughtful sort of manner  evidently for the exercise of it .  he continued the jumping  varying it with little hopping dance steps  till pelham s fists began making strangling gestures .  only an excited squawk from the hole in the wall dignified by the term  window  kept pelham from committing ossie slaughter .   ossies swarmed about and the earthmen fought for a view .   against jupiter s great yellowness was outlined a flying sleigh  complete with reindeers .  it was only a tiny thing  but there was no doubt about it .  santa claus was coming .   there was only one thing wrong with the picture .  the sleigh   reindeer  and all  while plunging ahead at a terrific speed  was flying upside down .   the ossies dissolved into squawking cacophony .    sannycaws .  sannycaws .  sannycaws .    the scrambled out the window like so many animated dust mops gone mad .  pelham and his men used the low door .   the sleigh was approaching  growing larger  lurching from side to side and vibrating like an off center flywheel .  olaf johnson was a tiny figure holding on desperately to the side of the sleigh with both hands .   pelham was shouting wildly  incoherently  choking on the thin atmosphere every time he forgot to breathe through his nose .  then he stopped and stared in horror .  the sleigh  almost life size now  was dipping down .  if it had been an arrow shot by william tell  it could not have aimed between pelham s eyes more accurately .    everybody down .   he shrieked  and dropped .   the wind of the sleigh s passage whistled keenly and brushed his face .  olaf s voice could be heard for an instant  high pitched and indistinct .  compressed air spurted  leaving tracks of condensing water vapor .   pelham lay quivering  hugging ganymede s frozen crust .  then  knees shaking like a hawaiian hula girl  he rose slowly .  the ossies who had scattered before the plunging vehicle had assembled again .  off in the distance  the sleigh was veering back .   pelham watched as it swayed and hovered  still rotating .  it lurched toward the dome  curved off to one side  turned back  and gathered speed .   inside that sleigh  olaf worked like a demon .  straddling his legs wide  he shifted his weight desperately .  sweating and cursing  trying hard not to look  downward  at jupiter  he urged the sleigh into wilder and wilder swings .  it was wobbling through an angle of     degrees now  and olaf felt his stomach raise strenuous objections .   holding his breath  he leaned hard with his right foot and felt the sleigh swing far over .  at the extremity of that swing  he released the gravo repulsor and  in ganymede s weak gravity  the sleigh jerked downward .  naturally  since the vehicle was bottom heavy due to the metal gravo repulsor beneath  it righted itself as it fell .   but this was little comfort to commander pelham  who found himself once more in the direct path of the sleigh .    down .   he yelled  and dropped again .   the sleigh whi i ished overhead  came up against a huge boulder with a crack  bounced twenty five feet into the air  came down with a rush and a bang and olaf fell over the railing and out .   santa claus had arrived .   with a deep  shuddering breath  olaf swung his bag over his shoulders  adjusted his beard and patted one of the silently suffering spinies on the head .  death might be coming   in fact  olaf could hardly wait   but he was going to die on his feet nobly  like a johnson .   inside the shack  into which the ossies had once more swarmed  a thump announced the arrival of santa s bag on the roof  and a second thud the arrival of santa himself .  a ghastly face appeared through the makeshift hole in the ceiling .    merry christmas .   it croaked  and tumbled through .   olaf landed on his oxygen cylinders  as usual  and got them in the usual place .   the ossies jumped up and down like rubber balls with the itch .   olaf limped heavily toward the first stocking and deposited the garishly colored sphere he withdrew from his bag  one of the many that had originally been intended as a christmas tree ornament .  one by one he deposited the rest in every available stocking .   having completed his job  he dropped into an exhausted squat  from which position he watched subsequent proceedings with a glazed and fishy eye .  the jolliness and belly shaking good humor  traditionally characteristic of santa claus  were absent from this one with remarkable thoroughness .   the ossies made up for it by their wild ecstasy .  until olaf had deposited the last globe  they had kept their silence and their seats .  but when he had finished  the air heaved and writhed under the stresses of the discordant screeches that arose .  in half a second the hand of each ossie contained a globe .   they chattered among themselves furiously  handling the globes carefully and hugging them close to their chests .  then they compared one with another  flocking about to gaze at particularly good ones .   the frowziest ossie approached pelham and plucked at the commander s sleeve .   sannycaws good   he cackled .   look  he leave eggs .   he stared reverently at his sphere and said   pit tier n ossie eggs .  must be sannycaws eggs  huh .    his skinny finger punched pelham in the stomach .    no .   yowled pelham vehemently .   hell  no .    but the ossie wasn t listening .  he plunged the globe deep into the warmth of his feathers and said    pitty colors .  how long take for little sannycaws come out .  and what little sannycaws eat .   he looked up .   we take good care .  we teach little sannycaws  make him smart and full of brain like ossie .    pierce grabbed commander pelham s arm .    don t argue with them   he whispered frantically .   what do you care if they think those are santa claus eggs .  come on .  if we work like maniacs  we can still make the quota .  let s get started .     that s right   pelham admitted .  he turned to the ossie .  tell everyone to get going .   he spoke clearly and loudly .   work now .  do you understand .  hurry  hurry  hurry .  come on .    he motioned with his arms .  but the frowzy ossie had come to a sudden halt .  he said slowly    we work  but johnson says kissmess come every year .     isn t one christmas enough for you .   pelham rasped .    no .   squawked the ossie .   we want sannycaws next year .  get more eggs .  and next year more eggs .  and next year .  and next year .  and next year .  more eggs .  more little sannycaws eggs .  if sannycaws not come  we not work .     that s a long time off   said pelham .   we ll talk about it then .  by that time i ll either have gone completely crazy  or you ll have forgotten all about it .    pierce opened his mouth  closed it  open his mouth  closed it  opened it and finally managed to speak .    commander  they want him to come every year .     i know .  they won t remember by next year  though .     but you don t get it .  a year to them is one ganymedan revolution around jupiter .  in earth time  that s seven days and three hours .  they want santa claus to come every week .    every week .   pelham gulped .   johnson told them      for a moment everything turned sparkling somersaults before his eyes .  he choked  and automatically his eye sought olaf .   olaf turned cold to the marrow of his bones and rose to his feet apprehensively  sidling toward the door .  there he stopped as a sudden recollection of tradition hit him .  beard a dangle  he croaked    merry christmas to all  and to all a good night .   he made for the sleigh as if all the imps of hades were after him .  the imps weren t  but commander scott pelham was .   the end    in january of       the month in which i attained my majority   i undertook something new   a collaboration .   fred pohl  after all  was not merely an editor .  he was also a budding writer .  he has since come to be a giant in the field  but in those early days he was struggling along with only the sort of meager success i was having .  alone  and in collaboration with other futurians  he turned out stories under a variety of pseudonyms .  the one he used most frequently was  james maccreigh .    as it happened  he had written  under that pseudonym  a small fantasy called  the little man on the subway   which he apparently had hopes for but couldn t get right .  he asked me if i would rewrite it  and the request flattered me .  besides  i was still trying to get into unknown  and if i couldn t do it on my own  maybe i could do it by way of a collaboration .  i wasn t proud   at least as far as fantasy was concerned .   i took on the task and did it virtually at a sitting .  doing it easily didn t help  however .  i submitted it to campbell for unknown on january           and he rejected it .  i had to hand it back to pohl .   pohl  however  with the true agent s soul  never gave up  and in       long after i had utterly forgotten it  he managed to place it with a small magazine called fantasy book .            the little man on the subway  with james maccreigh      subway stations are places where people usually get out  so when no one left the first car at atlantic avenue station  conductor cullen of the i . r . t .  began to get worried .  in fact  no one had left the first car from the time the run to flatbush had begun   though dozens were getting on all the time .   odd .  very odd .  it was the kind of proposition that made well bred conductors remove their caps and scratch their heads .  conductor cullen did so .  it didn t help  but he repeated the process at bergen street  the next station  where again the first car lost not one of its population .  and at grand army plaza  he added to the headscratching process a few rare old gaelic words that had passed down from father to son for hundreds of years .  they ionized the surrounding atmosphere  but otherwise did not affect the situation .   at eastern parkway  cullen tried an experiment .  he carefully refrained from opening the first car s doors at all .  he leaned forward eagerly  twisted his head and watched   and was treated to nothing short of a miracle .  the new york subway rider is neither shy  meek nor modest  and doors that do not open immediately or sooner are helped on their way by sundry kicks .  but this time there was not a kick  not a shriek  not even a modified yell .  cullen s eyes popped .   he was getting angry .  at franklin avenue  where he again contacted the express  he flung open the doors and swore at the crowd .  every door spouted commuters of both sexes and all ages  except that terrible first car .  at those doors  three men and a very young girl got on  though cullen could plainly see the slight bulging of the walls that the already super crowded condition of the car had caused .   for the rest of the trip to flatbush avenue  cullen ignored the first car completely  concentrating on that last stop where everyone would have to get off .  everyone .  president  church and beverly road were visited and passed  and cullen found himself counting the stations to the flatbush terminus .   they seemed like such a nice bunch of passengers  too .  they read their newspapers  stared into the whirling blackness out the window  or at the girl s legs across the way  or at nothing at all  quite like ordinary people .  only  they didn t want to get out .  they didn t even want to get into the next car  where empty seats filled the place .  imagine new yorkers resisting the impulse to pass from one car to the other  and missing the chance to leave the doors open for the benefit of the draft .   but it was flatbush avenue .  cullen rubbed his hands  slammed the doors open and yelled in his best unintelligible manner   lasstop .   he repeated it two or three times hoarsely and several in that damned first car looked up at him .  there was reproach in their eyes .  have you never heard of the mayor s anti noise campaign  they seemed to say .   the last other passenger had come out of the train  and the scattered new ones were coming in .  there were a few curious looks at the jammed car  but not too many .  the new yorker considers everything he cannot understand a publicity stunt .   cullen fell back on his gaelic once more and dashed up the platform toward the motorman s booth .  he needed moral assistance .  the motorman should have been out of his cab  preparing for his next trip  but he wasn t .  cullen could see him through the glass of the door  leaning on the controls and staring vacantly at the bumper stop ahead .    gus .   cried cullen .   come out .  there s a hell of      at that point  his tongue skidded to a halt  because it wasn t gus .  it was a little old man  who smiled politely and twiddled his fingers in greeting .   patrick cullen s irish soul rebelled .  with a yelp  he grabbed the edge of the door and tried to shove it open .  he should have known that wouldn t work .  so  taking a deep breath and commending said irish soul to god  he made for the open door and ploughed into the mass of haunted humans in that first car .  momentum carried him six feet  and then there he stuck .  behind him  those he had knocked down picked themselves up from the laps of their fellow travelers  apologized with true new york courtesy  consisting of a growl  a grunt  and a grimace  and returned to their papers .   then  caught helplessly  he heard the dispatcher s bell .  it was time for his own train to be on its way .  duty called .  with a superhuman effort  he inched toward the door  but it closed before he could get there  and the train commenced to move .   it occurred to cullen that he had missed a report for the first time  and he said   damn .   after the train had travelled some fifty feet  it came to him that they were going the wrong way  and this time he said nothing .   after all  what was there to say   even in the purest of gaelic .   how could a train go the wrong way at flatbush ave .  there were no further tracks .  there was no further tunnel .  there was a bumper stop to prevent eccentric motormen from trying to bore one .  it was absurd .  even the big deal couldn t do it .   but there they were .   there were stations in this new tunnel  too   cute little small ones just large enough for one car .  but that was all right  because only one car was travelling .  the rest had somehow become detached  presumably to make the routine trip to bronx park .   there were maybe a dozen stations on the line   with curious names .  cullen noticed only a few  because he found it difficult to keep his eyes from going out of focus .  one was archangel boulevard  another seraph road  still another cherub plaza .   and then  the train slid into a monster station  that looked uncommonly like a cave  and stopped .  it was huge  about three hundred feet deep and almost spherical .  the tracks ran to the exact center without trusses  and the platform at its side likewise rested comfortably upon air .   the conductor was the only person left in the car  the rest having mostly gotten off at hosannah square .  he hung limply from the porcelain hand grip  staring fixedly at a lip stick advertisement .  the door of the motorman s cabin opened and the little man came out .  he glanced at cullen  turned away  then whirled back .    hey   he said   who are you .    cullen rotated slowly  still clutching the hand grip .   only the conductor .  don t mind me .  i m quitting anyway .  i don t like the work .     oh dear  dear  this is unexpected .   the little man waggled his head and tch tched .   i m mr .  crumley   he explained .   i steal things .  people mostly .  sometimes subway cars    but they re such big  clumsy things  don t you think .     mister   groaned cullen .   i quit thinking two hours ago .  it didn t get me anywhere .  who are you  anyway .     i told you   i m mr .  crumley .  i m practicing to be a god .     a gob .   said cullen .   you mean a sailor .     dear  no   frowned mr .  crumley .   i said   god   as in jehovah .  look .   he pointed out the window to the wall of the cave .  where his finger pointed  the rock billowed and rose .  he moved his finger and there was a near ridge of rock describing a reversed  lower case  h .    that s my symbol   said crumley modestly .   mystic  isn t it .  but that s nothing .  wait till i really get things organized .  dear  dear  will i give them miracles .    cullen s head swivelled between the raised rock symbol and the simpering mr .  crumley  until he began to get dizzy  and then he stopped .    listen   he demanded hoarsely .   how did you get that car out of flatbush avenue .  where did that tunnel come from .  are some of them foreigners        oh  my  no .   answered mr .  crumley .   i made that myself and willed it so that no one would notice .  it was quite difficult .  it just wears the ectoplasm right out of me .  miracles with people mixed up in it are much harder than the other kind  because you have to fight their wills .  unless you have lots of believers  you can t do it .   now that i ve got over a hundred thousand  i can do it  but there was a time   he shook his head reminiscently   when i couldn t even have levitated a baby   or healed a leper .  oh  well  we re wasting time .  we ought to be at the nearest factory .    cullen brightened .   factory  was more prosaic .   i once had a brother   he said   who worked in a sweater factory  but       oh  goodness  mr .  cullen .  i m referring to my believers  factories .  i have to educate people to believe in me  don t i  and preaching is such slow work .  i believe in mass production .  some day i intend to be called the henry ford of utopia  why  i ve got twelve factories in brooklyn alone and when i manufacture enough believers  i ll just cover the world with them .    he sighed   gracious me  if i only had enough believers .  i ve got to have a million before i can let things progress by themselves and until then i have to attend to every detail myself .  it is so boring .  i even have to keep reminding my believers who i am   even the disciples .  incidentally  cullen    i read your mind  by the way  so that s how i know your name you want to be a believer  of course .     well  now   said cullen nervously .    oh  come now .  some gods would have been angry at your intrusion and done away with you   he snapped his fingers   like that .  not i  though  because i think killing people is messy and inconsiderate .  just the same  you ll have to be a believer .    now patrick cullen was an intelligent irishman .  that is to say  he admitted the existence of banshees  leprechauns and the little folk  and kept an open mind on poltergeists  werewolves  vampires and such like foreign trash .  at mere super naturalities  he was too well educated to sneer .  still  cullen did not intend to compromise his religion .  his theology was weak  but for a mortal to claim godship smacked of heresy  not to say sacrilege and blasphemy  even to him .    you re a faker   he cried boldly   and you re headed straight for hell the way you re going .    mr .  crumley clicked his tongue   what terrible language you use .  and so unnecessary .  of course you believe in me .     oh  yeah .     well  then  if you are stubborn  i ll pass a minor miracle .  it s inconvenient  but now   he made vague motions with his left hand   you believe in me .     certainly   said cullen  hurt .   i always did .  how do i go about worshipping you .  i want to do this properly .     just believe in me  and that s enough .  now you must go to the factories and then we ll send you back home   they ll never know you were gone   and you can live your life like a believer .    the conductor smiled ecstatically   oh  happy life .  i want to go to the factories .     of course you would   replied mr .  crumley .   you d be a fine crumleyite otherwise  wouldn t you .  come .   he pointed at the door of the car  and the door slid open .  they walked out and crumley kept on pointing .  rock faded away in front  and bit down again behind .  through the wall cullen walked  following that little figure who was his god .   that was a god  thought cullen .  any god that could do that was one hell of a damn good god to believe in .   and then he was at the factory   in another cave  only smaller .  mr .  crumley seemed to like caves .   cullen didn t pay much attention to his surroundings .  he couldn t see much anyway on account of the faint violet mist that blurred his vision .  he got the impression of a slowly moving conveyor belt  with men stationed at intervals along it .  disciples  he thought .  and the parts being machined on that belt were probably non believers  or such low trash .   there was a man watching him  smiling .  a disciple  cullen thought  and quite naturally made the sign to him .  he had never made it before  but it was easy .  the disciple replied in kind .    he told me you were coming   said the disciple .   he made a special miracle for you  he said .  that s quite a distinction .  do you want me to show you around the belt .     you bet .     well  this is factory one .  it s the nerve center of all the factories of the country .  the others give preliminary treatment only  and make only believers .  we make disciples .    oh  boy  disciples .   am i going to be a disciple .   asked cullen eagerly .    after being miraculated by him .  of course .  you re a somebody  you know .  there are only five other people he ever took personal charge of .    this was a glorious way to do things .  everything mr .  crumley did was glorious .  what a god .  what a god .    you started that way  too .     certainly   said the disciple  placidly   i m an important fellow  too .  only i wish i were more important  even .     what for .   said cullen  in a shocked tone of voice .   are you murmuring against the dictates of mr .  crumley .   may he prosper  .  this is sacrilege .    the disciple shifted uncomfortably   well  i ve got ideas  and i d like to try them out .     .  you ve got ideas  huh .   muttered cullen balefully .   does mr .  crumley  may he live forever  know .     well   frankly  no .  but just the same   the disciple looked over each shoulder carefully and drew closer   i m not the only one .  there are lots of us that think mr .  crumley  on whom be blessings  is just a trifle old fashioned .  for instance  take the lights in this place .    cullen stared upwards .  the lights were the same type as those in the terminal cave .  they might have been stolen from any line of the irt subway .  perfect copies of the stop and go signals and the exit markers .    what s wrong .   he asked .   the disciple sneered  they lack originality .  you d think a grade a god would do something new .  when he takes people  he does it through the subway  and he obeys subway rules .  he waits for the dispatcher to tell him to go  he stops at every station  he uses crude electricity and so on .  what we need   the disciple was waving his hands wildly and shouting   is more enterprise  more git and go .  we ve got to speed up things and run them with efficiency and vim .    cullen stared hotly   you are a heretic   he accused .   you are doomed to damnation .   he looked angrily about for a bell  whistle  gong or drum wherewith to summon the great crumley  but found nothing .   the other blinked in quick thought .   say   he said  bluffly   look at what time it is .  i m behind schedule .  you better get on the belt for your first treatment .    cullen was hot about the slovenly assistance .  mr .  crumley was getting from this inferior disciple  but a treatment is a treatment  so making the sign devoutly  he got on .  he found it fairly comfortable despite its jerky motion .  the disciple motioned to cullen s first preceptor   another disciple   standing beside a sort of blackboard .  cullen had watched others while discussing crumley and he had noticed the question and answer procedure that had taken place .  he had noticed it particularly .   consequently  he was surprised  when the second disciple  instead of using his heavy pointer to indicate a question on the board  reversed it and brought it down upon his head .   the lights went out .   when he came to  he was under the belt  at the very bottom of the cave .  he was tied up  and the rebellious disciple and three others were talking about him .    he couldn t be persuaded   the disciple was saying .   crumley must have given him a double treatment or something .     it s the last double treatment crumley ll ever give   said the fat little man .    let s hope so .  how s it coming .     very well .  very well  indeed .  we teleported ourselves to section four about two hours ago .  it was a perfect miracle .    the disciple was pleased .  tine .  how re they doing at four .    the fat little man clucked his lips .   well  now  not so hot .  for some reason  they re getting odd effects over there .  miracles are just happening .  even ordinary crumleyites can pass them  and sometimes they   just happen .  it s extremely annoying .     hmm  that s bad .  if there are too many hitches  crumley ll get suspicious .  if he investigates there first  he can reconvert all of them in a jiffy  before he comes here and then without their support we might not be strong enough to stand up against him .     say  now   said the fat man apprehensively   we re not strong enough now  you know .  none of this going off half cocked .     we re strong enough   pointed out the disciple stiffly   to weaken him long enough to get us a new god started  and after that       a new god  eh .   said another .  he nodded wisely .    sure   said the disciple .   a new god  created by us  can be destroyed by us .  he d be completely under our thumb and then instead of this one man tyranny  we can have a sort of   er  council .    there were general grins and everyone looked pleased .    but we ll discuss that further some other time   continued the disciple briskly .   let s believe just a bit .  crumley isn t stupid  you know  and we don t want him to observe any slackening .  come on  now .  all together .    they closed their eyes  concentrated a bit  and then opened them with a sigh .    well   said the little  fat man   that s over .  i d better be getting back now .    from under the belt  cullen watched him .  he looked singularly like a chicken about to take off for a tree as he flexed his knees and stared upwards .  then he added to the resemblance not a little when he spread his arms  gave a little hop and fluttered away .   gullen could follow his flight only by watching the eyes of the three remaining .  those eyes turned up and up  following the fat man to the very top of the cave  it seemed .  there was an air of self satisfaction about those eyes .  they were very happy over their miracles .   then they all went away and left cullen to his holy indignation .  he was shocked to the very core of his being at this sinful rebellion  this apostasy   this   this     there weren t any words for it  even when he tried gaelic .   imagine trying to create a god that would  be under the thumbs of the creators .  it was anthropomorphic heresy  where had he heard that word  now .   and struck at the roots of all religion .  was he going to lie there and watch anything strike at the roots of all religion .  was he going to submit to having mr .  crumley  may he swim through seas of ecstasy  deposed .   never .   but the ropes thought otherwise  so there he stayed .   and then there was an interruption in his thoughts .  there came a low  booming sound   a sound which would have been a voice if it had not been pitched so incredibly low .  there was a menace to it that got immediate attention .  it got attention from cullen  who quivered in his bonds  from the others in the cave  who quivered even harder  not being restrained by ropes  from the belt itself  which stopped dead with a jerk  and quivered mightily .   the rebellious disciple dropped to his knees and quivered more than any of them .   the voice came again  this time in a recognizable language   where is that bum  crumley .   it roared .   there was no wait for an answer .  a cloud of shadow gathered in the center of the hall and spat a black bolt at the belt .  a spot of fire leaped out from where the bolt had touched and spread slowly outward .  where it passed  the belt ceased to exit .  it was far from cullen  but there were humans nearer  and among those scurrying pandemonium existed .   cullen wanted very much to join the flight  but unfortunately the disciple who had trussed him up had evidently been a boy scout .  jerking  twisting and writhing had no effect upon the stubborn ropes  so he fell back upon gaelic and wishing .  he wished he were free .  he wished he weren t tied .  he wished he were far away from that devouring flame .  he wished lots of things  some unprintable  but mainly those .   and with that he felt a gentle slipping pressure and down at his feet was an untidy pile of hempen fibre .  evidently the forces liberated by the rebellion were getting out of control here as well as in section four .  what had the little fat man said .   miracles are just happening .  even ordinary crumleyites can pass them  and sometimes they   just happen .    but why waste time .  he ran to the rock wall and howled a wish at it to dissolve into nothing .  he howled several times  with gaelic modifications  but the wall didn t even slightly soften .  he stared wildly and then saw the hole .  it was on the side of the cave  diametrically across from cullen s position at the bottom of the hall  and about three loops of the belt up .  the upward spiral passed just below it .   somehow he made the leap that grabbed the lower lip of the spiral  wriggled his way onto it and jumped into a run .  the fire of disintegration was behind him and plenty far away  but it was making time .  up the belt to the third loop he ran  not taking time to be dizzy from the circular trip .  but when he got there  the hole  large  black and inviting  was just the tiniest bit higher than he could jump .   he leaned against the wall panting .  the spot of fire was now two spots  crawling both ways from a twenty foot break in the belt .  everyone in the cavern  some two hundred people  was in motion  and everyone made some sort of noise .   somehow  the sight stimulated him .  it nerved him to further efforts to get into the hole .  wildly  he tried walking up the sheer wall  but this didn t work .   and then mr .  crumley stuck his head out of the hole and said   oh  mercy me  what a perfectly terrible mess .  dear  dear .  come up here  cullen .  why do you stay down there .    a great peace descended upon cullen .   hail  mr .  crumley .   he cried .   may you sniff the essence of roses forever .    mr .  crumley looked pleased   thank you  cullen .   he waved his hand  and the conductor was beside him   a simple matter of levitation .  once again   . cullen decided in his inmost soul that here was a god .    and now   said mr .  crumley   we must hurry  hurry  hurry .  i ve lost most of my power when the disciples rebelled  and my subway car is stuck half way .  i ll need your help .  hurry .    cullen had no time to admire the tiny subway at the end of the tunnel .  he jumped off the platform on crumley s heels and dashed about a hundred feet down the tube to where the car was standing idle .  he wafted into the open front door with the grace of a chorus boy .  mr .  crumley took care of that .    cullen   said mr .  crumley   start this thing and take it back to the regular line .  and be careful  he is waiting for me .     who .     he  the new god .  imagine those fools   no  idiots   thinking they could create a controllable god  when the very essence of godship is uncontrollability .  of course  when they made a god to destroy me  they made a destroyer  and he ll just destroy everything in sight that i created  including my disciples .    cullen worked quickly .  he knew how to start car        any conductor would .  he raced to the other end of the car for the control lever  snatched it off  and returned at top speed .  that was all he needed .  there was power in the rail  the lights were on  and there were no stop signals between him and god s country .   mr .  crumley lay himself down on a seat   be very quiet .  he may let you get past him .  i m going to blank myself out  and maybe he won t notice me .  at any rate  he won t harm you   i hope .  dear  dear  since this all started in section four  things are such a mess .    eight stations passed before anything happened and then came utopia circle station and   well  nothing really happened .  it was just an impression   an impression of people all around him for a few seconds watching him closely with a virulent hostility .  it wasn t exactly people  but a person .  it wasn t exactly a person either  but just a huge eye  watching  watching   watching .   but it passed  and almost immediately cullen saw a black and white  flatbush avenue  sign at the side of the tunnel .  he jammed on his brakes in a hurry  for there was a train  waiting there .  but the controls didn t work the way they should have  and the car edged up until it was in contact with the cars before .  with a soft click  it coupled and       was just the last car of the train .   it was mr .  crumley s work  of course .  mr .  crumley stood behind him  watching .   he didn t get you  did he .  no   i see he didn t .     is there any more danger .   asked cullen  anxiously .    i don t think so   responded mr .  crumley sadly .   after he has destroyed all my creation  there will be nothing left for him to destroy  and  deprived of a function  he will simply cease to exist .  that s the result of this nasty  slipshod work .   i m disgusted with human beings .     don t say that   said cullen .    i will   retorted mr .  crumley savagely   human beings aren t fit to be god of .  they re too much trouble and worry .  it would give any self respecting god gray hairs and i suppose you think a god looks very dignified all gray .  darn all humans .  they can get along without me .  from now on  i m going to go to africa and try the chimpanzees .  i ll bet they make much better material .     but wait   wailed cullen .   what about me .  i believe in you .     oh  dear  that would never do .  here .  return to normal .    mr .  crumley s hand caressed the air  and cullen  once more a god fearing irishman  let loose a roar in the purest gaelic and made for him .    why  you blaspheming spalpeen       but there was no mr .  crumley .  there was only the dispatcher  asking very impolitely   in english   what the blankety blank hell was the matter with him .   the end    i am sorry to say that i have no clear memory  at this time  what parts of the story are mine and what parts are pohl s .  going over it  i can say   this part sounds like me  this part doesn t   but whether i d be right or not i couldn t swear   fantasy book was a very borderline publication that lasted only eight issues .   the little man on the subway  was in the sixth .   an amusing fact about this issue of a small magazine that had to make do with what it could find among the rejects of the field was that it included  scanners live in vain   by cordwainer smith .  this was smith s first published story and he was not to publish another for eight years or so .  in the     s  smith  a pseudonym for a man whose real identity was not made clear until after his death  became a writer of considerable importance  and this first story of his became a classic .   while working on  the little man on the subway  i was also doing another  positronic robot  story  called  liar .   in this one  my character susan calvin first appeared  she has been a character in ten of my stories up to the present time and  i don t eliminate the possibility that she will appear yet again  .   it was while campbell and i were discussing this story  by the way  on december           that the  three laws of robotics  were worked out in full .   i say it was campbell who worked them out and he says it was i   but i know i m right .  it was he .     liar .   was accepted at once by campbell  at the end of january  without revision  and appeared in the may      issue of astounding .  it was my fourth appearance in that magazine .  the fact that it appeared the month after  reason  helped fix the  positronic robot  stories in the readers  minds as a  series .    liar .   eventually appeared in i  robot .   the sale of two  positronic robot  stories   reason  and  liar .   virtually back to back put me all on fire to do more of the same .  when i suggested still another story of the sort to campbell on february          he approved  but he said he didn t want me  this early in the game  tying myself down too completely into a rigid formula .  he suggested i do other kinds of stories first .  i was a good boy  i obeyed .   on that very day  in fact  i decided to try fantasy again .  i wrote a short one        words  called  masks   and heaven only knows what it was about  for i don t .  i submitted it to campbell for unknown on february     and he rejected it .  it is gone  it no longer exists .   later that month i also wrote a short story called  the hazing   intended for pohl .  i submitted it to him on february     and he rejected it at once .  eventually i submitted it to thrilling wonder stories .  they requested a revision  i obliged  and they accepted it on july          .            the hazing     the campus of arcturus university  on arcturus s second planet  eron  is a dull place during mid year vacations and  moreover  a hot one  so that myron tubal  sophomore  found life boring and uncomfortable .  for the fifth time that day  he looked in at the undergraduate lounge in a desperate attempt at locating an acquaintance  and was at last gratified to behold bill sefan  a green skinned youngster from vega s fifth planet .   sefan  like tubal  had flunked biosociology and was staying through vacation to study for a make up exam .  things like that weave strong bonds between sophomore and sophomore .   tubal grunted a greeting  dropped his huge hairless body  he was a native of the arcturian system itself   into the largest chair and said    have you seen the new freshmen yet .     already .  it s six weeks before the fall semester starts .    tubal yawned .   these are a special breed of frosh .  they re the very first batch from the solarian system   ten of them .     solarian system .  you mean that new system that joined the galactic federation three four years ago .    that s the one .  their world capital is called earth  i think .     well  what about them .     nothing much .  they re just here  that s all .  some of them have hair on the upper lip  and very silly it looks  too .  otherwise  they look like any of a dozen or so other breeds of humanoids .    it was at this point that the door flew open and little wri forase ran in .  he was from deneb s single planet  and the short  gray fuzz that covered his head and face bristled with agitation  while his large purple eyes gleamed excitedly .    say   he twittered breathlessly   have you seen the earth men .    sefan sighed .   isn t anyone ever going to change the subject .  tubal was just telling me about them .     he was .   forase seemed disappointed .   but   but did he tell you these were that abnormal race they made such a fuss over when the solarian system entered the federation .     they looked all right to me   said tubal .    i m not talking about them from the physical standpoint   said the denebian disgustedly .   it s the mental aspect of the case .  psychology .  that s the stuff .   forase was going to be a psychologist some day .   oh  that .  well  what s wrong with them .     their mob psychology as a race is all wrong   babbled forase .   instead of becoming less emotional with numbers  as is the case with every other type of humanoid known  they become more emotional .  in groups  these earthmen riot  panic  go crazy .  the more there are  the worse it is .  so help me  we even invented a new mathematical notation to handle the problem .  look .    he had his pocket pad and stylus out in one rapid motion  but tubal s hand clamped down upon them before the stylus so much as made a mark .   tubal said   whoa .  i ve got a walloping lulu of an idea .     imagine .   murmured sefan .   tubal ignored him .  he smiled again  and his hand rubbed thoughtfully over his bald dome .    listen   he said  with sudden briskness .  his voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper .   albert williams  late of earth  stirred in his sleep and became conscious of a prodding finger exploring the space between his second and third ribs .  he opened his eyes  swiveled his head  stared stupidly  then gasped  shot upright and reached for the light switch .    don t move   said the shadowy figure beside his bed .  there was a muted click  and the earthman found himself centered in the pearly beam of a pocket flash .   he blinked and said   who the blasted devil are you .    you are going to get out of bed   replied the apparition stolidly .   dress  and come with me .   williams grinned savagely .   try and make me .   there was no answer  but the flash beam shifted slightly and fell upon the shadow s other hand .  it held a  neuronic whip   that pleasant little weapon that paralyzes the vocal chords and twists nerves into so many knots of agony .  williams swallowed hard  and got out of bed .   he dressed in silence  and then said    all right  what do i do now .    the gleaming  whip  gestured  and the earthman moved toward the door .    just walk ahead   said the unknown .   williams moved out of the room  along the silent corridor  and down eight stories without daring to look back .  out upon the campus he stopped  and felt metal probe the small of his back .    do you know where obel hall is .    williams  nodding  began walking .  he walked past obel hall  turned right at university avenue  and after half a mile stepped off the roads and past the trees .  a spaceship hulked dimly in the darkness  with ports closely curtained and only a dim light showing where the airlock opened a crack .    get in .   he was shoved up a flight of stairs and into a small room .   he blinked  looked about him and counted aloud .     seven  eight  nine  and i make ten .  they ve got us all  i guess .     it s no guess   growled eric chamberlain sourly .   it s a certainty .   he was rubbing his hand .   i ve been here an hour .     what s wrong with the mitt .   asked williams .    i sprained it on the jaw of the rat that brought me here .  he s as tough as a spaceship s hull .    williams seated himself cross legged upon the floor and rested his head against the wall .    has anyone any idea as to what this is all about .     kidnapping .   said little joey sweeney .  his teeth were chattering .    what the devil for .   snorted chamberlain .   if any of us are milionaires  i hadn t heard of it .  i know i m not .    williams said   look  let s not go off the deep end .  kidnaping or anything of that sort is out .  these people can t be criminals .  it stands to reason that a civilization that has developed psychology to the extent this galactic federation has  would be able to wipe out crime without raising a sweat .     pirates   grunted lawrence marsh .   i don t think so  but it s just a suggestion .     nuts .   said williams .   piracy is a frontier phenomenon .  this region of space has been civilized for tens of millennia .     just the same  they had guns   insisted joe   and i don t like it .   he had left his glasses in his room and peered about in nearsighted anxiety .    that doesn t mean much   answered williams .   now  i ve been thinking .  here we are   ten newly arrived freshmen at arcturus u .  on our first night here  we re bundled mysteriously out of our rooms and into a strange spaceship .  that suggests something to me .  how about it .    sidney morton raised his head from his arms long enough to say sleepily    i ve thought of it  too .  it looks like we re in for one hell of a hazing .  gents  i think the local sophs are just having good  clean fun .     exactly   agreed williams .   anyone have any other ideas .    silence .   all right  then  so there isn t anything to do but wait .  personally  i m going to catch up on my sleep .  they can wake me up if they need me .    there was a jar at that moment and he fell off balance .    well  we re off   wherever we re going .    moments later  bill sefan hesitated just an instant before entering the control room .  when he finally did  it was to face a highly excited wri forase .    how is it working .   demanded the denebian .    rotten   responded sefan sourly .   if they re panicked  then i m damned .  they re going to sleep .     asleep .  all of them .  but what were they saying .     how do i know .  they weren t speaking galactic  and i can t make head or tail out of their infernal foreign gibberish .    forase threw his hands into the air in disgust .   tubal spoke finally .   listen  forase  i m cutting a class in biosoc .    which i can t afford .  you guaranteed the psychology of this stunt .  if it turns out to be a flop  i m not going to like it    well  for the love of deneb   grated forase desperately   you two are a fine pair of yellow bellies .  did you expect them to start screaming and kicking right off .  sizzling arcturus .  wait till we get to the spican system  will you .  when we maroon them overnight      he tittered suddenly .   this is going to be the fanciest trick since they tied those stink bats to the chromatic organ on concert night .    tubal cracked a grin  but sefan leaned back in his chair and remarked thoughtfully .    what if someone   say  president wynn   hears about this .    the arcturian at the controls shrugged .   it s only a hazing .  they ll go easy .     don t play dumb  m .  t .  this isn t kid stuff  planet four  spica   the whole spican system  in fact   is banned to galactic ships  and you know that .  it s got a sub humanoid race on it .  they re supposed to develop entirely free of interference until they discover interstellar travel on their own .  that s the law  and they re strict about it .  space .  if they find out about this  we ll be in the soup for fair .    tubal turned in his seat .   how in arcturus do you expect prexy wynn   damn his thick hide .    to find out about us .  now  mind you  i m not saying the story won t spread around the campus  because half the fun will be killed if we have to keep it to ourselves .  but how will names come out .  no one will squeal .  you know that .     okay   said sefan  and shrugged .   and then tubal said   ready for hyper space .    he compressed keys and there was the queer internal wrench that marked the ship s departure from normal space .   the ten earthmen were rather the worse for wear  and looked it .  lawrence marsh squinted at his watch again .   two thirty   he said .   that s thirty six hours now .  i wish they d get this over with .     this isn t a hazing   moaned sweeney .   it takes too long .    williams grew red .   what do you all look half dead about .  they ve been feeding us regularly  haven t they .  they haven t tied us up  have they .  i should say it was pretty evident that they were taking good care of us .     or   came sidney morton s discontented drawl   fattening us up for the slaughter .    he paused  and everyone stiffened .  there was no mistaking the queer internal wrench they had felt .    get that .   said eric chamberlain in sudden frenzy .   we re back in normal space again  and that means we re only an hour or two from wherever we re going .  we ve got to do something .     hear  hear   williams snorted .   but what .     there are ten of us  aren t there .   shouted chamberlain  puffing out his chest .   well  i ve only seen one of them so far .  next time he comes in  and we ve got another meal due us pretty soon  we re going to mob him .    sweeney looked sick .   what about the neuronic whip he always carries .     it won t kill us .  he can t get us all before we pin him down  anyway .     eric   said williams bluntly   you re a fool .    chamberlain flushed and his stub fingered fists closed slowly .    i m just in the mood for a little practice persuasion .  call me that again  will you .     sit down .   williams scarcely bothered to look up .   and don t work so hard justifying my epithet .  all of us are nervous and keyed up  but that doesn t mean we ought to go altogether crazy .  not yet  anyway .  first of all  even discounting the whip  mobbing our jailer won t be particularly successful .    we ve only seen one  but that one is from the arcturian system .  he s better than seven feet tall  and comfortably past the three hundred pound mark .  he d mop us up   all ten of us   with his bare fists .  i thought you had one run in with him already  eric .    there was a thickish silence .   williams added   and even if we could knock him out and finish as many others as there may be in the ship  we still haven t the slightest idea where we are or how to get back or even how to run the ship .   a pause .  then   well .     nuts .   chamberlain turned away  and glowered in silence .   the door kicked open and the giant acturian entered .  with one hand  he emptied the bag he carried  and with the other kept his neuronic whip carefully leveled .    last meal   he grunted .   there was a general scramble for the rolling cans  still lukewarm from recent heating .  morton glared at his with disgust .    say   he spoke stumblingly in galactic   can t you give us a change .  i m tired of this rotten goulash of yours .  this is the fourth can .     so what .  it s your last meal   the arcturian snapped  and left .   a horrified paralysis prevailed .    what did he mean by that .   gulped someone huskily .    they re going to kill us .   sweeney was round eyed  the thin edge of panic in his voice .   williams  mouth was dry and he felt unreasoning anger grow against sweeney s contagious fright .  he paused   the kid was only seventeen   and said huskily   stow it  will you .  let s eat .    it was two hours later that he felt the shuddering jar that meant the landing and end of  . the journey .  in that time  no one had spoken  but williams could feel the pall of fear choke tighter with the minutes .   spica had dipped crimsonly below the horizon and there was a chill wind blowing .  the ten earthmen  huddled together miserably upon the rock strewn hilltop  watched their captors sullenly .  it was the huge arcturian  myron tubal  that did the talking  while the green skinned vegan  bill sefan  and the fuzzy little denebian  wri forase  remained placidly in the background .    you ve got your fire   said the arcturian gruffly   and there s plenty of wood about to keep it going .  that will keep the beasts away .  we ll leave you a pair of whips before we go  and those will do as protection  if any of the aborigines of the planet bother you .  you will have to use your own wits as far as food  water and shelter are concerned .    he turned away .  chamberlain let loose with a sudden roar  and leaped after the departing arcturian .  he was sent reeling back with an effortless heave of the other s arm .   the lock closed after the three other world men .  almost at once  the ship lifted off the ground and shot upward .  williams finally broke the chilled silence .   they ve left the whips .  i ll take one and you can have the other  eric .    one by one  the earthmen dropped into a sitting position  back to the fire  frightened  half panicky .   williams forced a grin .   there s plenty of game about   the region is well wooded .  come on  now  there are ten of us and they ve got to come back sometime .  let s show them we earthmen can take it .  how about it  fellows .    he was talking aimlessly now .  morton said listlessly .    why don t you shut up .  you re not making this any easier .    williams gave up .  the pit of his own stomach was turning cold .   the twilight blackened into night  and the circle of light about the fire contracted into a little flickering area that ended in shadows .  marsh gasped suddenly  and his eyes went wide .    there s some   something coming .    the stir that followed froze itself into attitudes of breathless attention .    you re crazy   began williams huskily   and stopped dead at the unmistakable  slithering sound that reached his ears .    grab your whip .   he screamed to chamberlain .   joey sweeney laughed suddenly   a strained  high pitched laugh .   and then   there was a sudden shrieking in the air  and the shades charged down upon them .   things were happening elsewhere  too .   tubal s ship lazed outward from spica s fourth planet  with bill sefan at the controls .  tubal himself was in his own cramped quarters  polishing off a huge flagon of denebian liquor in two gulps .   wri forase watched the operation sadly .    it cost twenty credits a bottle   he said   and i only have a few left .     well  don t let me hog it   said tubal magnanimously   match me bottle for bottle .  it s all right with me .     one swig like that   grumbled the denebian   and i d be out till the fall exams .    tubal paid scant attention .   this   he began   is going to make campus history as the hazing stunt       and at this point  there was a sharp  singing pinging ping g  g g  scarcely muffled by intervening walls  and the lights went out .   wri forase felt himself pressed hard against the wall .  he struggled for breath and stuttered out in gasps .    b by space  we re at f full acceleration .  what s wr rong with the equalizer .     damn the equalizer .   roared tubal  heaving to his feet .   what s wrong with the ship .    he stumbled out the door  into the equally dark corridor  with forase crawling after him .  when they burst into the control room  they found sefan surrounded by the dim emergency lights  his green skin shining with perspiration .    meteor   he croaked .   it played hob with our power distributors .  it s all going into acceleration .  the lights  heating units and radio are all out of commission  while the ventilators are just barely limping .   he added   and section four is punctured .    tubal gazed about him wildly .   idiot .  why didn t you keep your eye on the mass indicator .     i did  you overgrown lump of putty   howled sefan   but it never registered .  it   never   registered .  isn t that just what you d expect from a second hand jalopy  rented for two hundred credits .  it went through the screen as if it were empty ether .     shut up .   tubal flung open the suit compartments and groaned .   they re all arcturian models .  i should have checked up .  can you handle one of these  sefan .     maybe .   the vegan scratched a doubtful ear .   in five minutes  tubal swung into the lock and sefan  stumbling awkwardly  followed after .  it was half an hour before they returned .   tubal removed his head piece .   curtains .    wri forase gasped .   you mean   we re through .    the arcturian shook his head .   we can fix it  but it will take time .  the radio is ruined for good  so we can t get help .     get help .   forase looked shocked .   that s all we need .  how would we explain being inside the spican system .  we might as well commit suicide as send out radio calls .  as long as we can get back without help  we re safe .  missing a few more classes won t hurt us too much .    sefan s voice broke in dully .   but what about those panicky earthmen back on spica four .    forase s mouth opened  but he didn t say a word .  it closed again  and if ever a humanoid looked sick  forase was that humanoid .   that was only the beginning .   it took a day and a half to unscramble the space jalopy s power lines .  it took two more days to decelerate to safe turning point .  it took four days to return to spica iv .  total   eight days .   when the ship hovered once more over the place where they had marooned the earthmen  it was midmorning  and the tubal s face as he surveyed the area through the televisor was a study in length .  shortly he broke a silence that had long since become sticky .    i guess we ve made every boner we could possibly have made .  we landed them right outside a native village .  there s no sign of the earthmen .    sefan shook his head dolefully .   this is a bad business .    tubal buried his head in his long arms clear down to the elbows .    that s the finish .  if they didn t scare themselves to death  the natives got them .  violating prohibited solar systems is bad enough   but it s just plain murder now  i guess .     what we ve got to do   said sefan   is to get down there and find out if there are any still alive .  we owe them that much .  after that      he swallowed .  forase finished in a whisper .    after that  it s expulsion from the u .   psycho revision   and manual labor for life .     forget it .   barked tubal .   we ll face that when we have to .    slowly  very slowly  the ship circled downward and came to rest on the rocky clearing where  eight days previously  ten earthmen had been left stranded .    how do we handle these natives .   tubal turned to forase with raised eyebrow ridges  there was no hair on them  of course    come on  son  give with some sub humanoid psychology .  there are only three of us and i don t want any trouble .    forase shrugged and his fuzzy face wrinkled in perplexity .   i ve just been thinking about that  tubal .  i don t know any .     what .   exploded sefan and tubal in twin shouts .    no one does   added the denebian hurriedly .   it s a fact .  after all  we don t let sub humanoids into the federation till they re fully civilized  and we quarantine them until then .  do you suppose we have much opportunity to study their psychology .    the arcturian seated himself heavily .   this gets better and better .  think  fuzzy face  will you .  suggest something .    forase scratched his head .   well   uh   the best we can do is to treat them like normal humanoids .  if we approach slowly  palms spread out  make no sudden movements and keep calm  we ought to get along .  now  remember  i m saying we ought to .  i can t be certain about this .     let s go  and damnation with certainty   urged sefan impatiently .   it doesn t matter much  anyway .  if i get knocked off here  i don t have to go back home .   his face took on a hunted look .   when i think of what my family is going to say       they emerged from the ship and sniffed the atmosphere of spica s fourth planet .  the sun was at meridian  and loomed overhead like a large orange basketball .  off in the woods  a bird called once in a creaky caw .  utter silence descended .    hmph .   said tubal  arms akimbo .    it s enough to make you feel sleepy .  no signs of life at all .  now  which way is the village .    there was a three way dispute about this  but it didn t last long .  the arcturian first  the other two tagging along  they strode down the slope and toward the straggling forest .   a hundred feet inside  the trees came alive  as a wave of natives dropped noiselessly from the overhanging branches .  wri forase went under at the very first of the avalanche .  bill sefan stumbled  stood his ground momentarily  then went over backward with a grunt .   only huge myron tubal was left standing .  legs straddled wide  and whooping hoarsely  he laid about right and left .  the attacking natives hit him and bounced off like drops of water from a whirling flywheel .  modeling his defense on the principle of the windmill  he backed his way against a tree .   here he made a mistake .  on the lowest branch of that tree squatted a native at once more cautious and more brainy than his fellows .  tubal had already noticed that the natives were equipped with stout  muscular tails  and had made a mental note of the fact .  of all the races in the galaxy  only one other  homo gamma cepheus  possessed tails .  what he didn t notice  however  was that these tails were prehensile .   this he found out almost immediately  for the native in the branch above his head looped his tail downward  flashed it about tubal s neck and contracted it .   the arcturian threshed wildly in agony  and the tailed attacker was jerked from his tree .  suspended head first and whirled about in huge sweeps  the native nevertheless maintained his hold and tightened that tail grip steadily .   the world blacked out .  tubal was unconscious before he hit the ground .   tubal came to slowly  unpleasantly aware of the stinging stiffness of his neck .  he tried vainly to rub that stiffness  and it took a few seconds to realize that he was tied tightly .  the fact startled him into alertness .  he became aware  first  that he was lying on his stomach  second  of the horrible din about him  third  of sefan and forase bundled up next to him   and last  that he could not break his bonds .    hey  sefan  forase .  can you hear me .    it was sefan that answered joyfully .   you old draconian goat .  we thought you were out for good .     i don t die so easy   grunted the arcturian  where are we .    there was a short pause .    in the native village  i imagine   wri forase said dully .   did you ever hear such a noise .  the drum hasn t stopped a minute since they dumped us here .     have you see anything of       hands were upon tubal  and he felt himself whirled about .  he was in a sitting posture now and his neck hurt worse than ever .  ramshackle huts of thatch and green logs gleamed in the early afternoon sun .  in a circle about them  watching in silence  were dark skinned  long tailed natives .  there must have been hundreds  all wearing feathered head dresses and carrying short  wickedly barbed spears .   their eyes were upon the row of figures that squatted mysteriously in the foreground  and upon these tubal turned his angry glare .  it was plain that they were the leaders of the tribe .  dressed in gaudy  fringed robes of ill tamed skins  they added further to their barbaric impressiveness by wearing tall wooden masks painted into caricatures of the human face .   with measured steps  the masked horror nearest the humanoids approached .    hello   it said  and the mask lifted up and off .   back so soon .    for quite a long while  tubal and sefan said absolutely nothing  while wri forase went into a protracted fit of coughing .   finally  tubal drew a long breath .   you re one of the earth men  aren t you .     that s right .  i m al williams .  just call me al .     they haven t killed you yet .    williams smiled happily .   they haven t killed any of us .  quite the contrary .  gentlemen   he bowed extravagantly   meet the new tribal   er   gods .     the new tribal what .   gasped forase .  he was still coughing .      er   gods .  sorry  but i don t know the galactic word for a god .     what do you  gods  represent .     we re sort of supernatural entities   objects to be worshipped .  don t you get it .    the humanoids stared unhappily .    yes  indeed   williams grinned   we re persons of great power .     what are you talking about .   exclaimed tubal indignantly .   why should they think you were of great power .  you earth people are below average physically   well below .     it s the psychology of the thing   explained williams .   if they see us landing in a large  gleaming vehicle that travels mysteriously through the air  and then takes off in a burst of rocket flame   they re bound to consider us supernatural .  that s elementary barbaric psychology .    forase s eyes seemed on the point of dropping out as williams continued .    incidentally  what detained you .  we figure it was all a hazing of some sort  and it was  wasn t it .     say   broke in sefan   i think you re feeding us a lot of bull .  if they thought you people were gods  why didn t they think we were .  we had the ship  too  and        that   said williams   is where we started to interfere .  we explained   via pictures and sign language   that you people were devils .  when you finally came back   and say  were we glad to see that ship coming down   they knew what to do .     what   asked forase  with a liberal dash of awe in his voice   are  devils  .    williams sighed .   don t you galaxy people know anything .  tubal moved his aching neck slowly .   how about letting us up now .   he rumbled .   i ve got a crick in my neck .     what s your hurry .  after all  you were brought here to be sacrificed in our honor .     sacrificed .     sure .  you re to be carved up with knives .    there was a horror laden silence .   don t give us any of that comet gas .   tubal managed to grind out at last .   we re not earthmen who get panicky or scared  you know .     oh  we know that .  i wouldn t fool you for the world .  but simple ordinary savage psychology always goes for a little human sacrifice  and      sefan writhed against his bonds and tried to throw himself in a rage at forase .    i thought you said no one knew any sub humanoid psychology .  trying to alibi your ignorance  weren t you  you shriveled  fuzz covered  pop eyed son of a half breed vegan lizard .  a fine mess we re in now .    forase shrank away .   now  wait .  just       williams decided the joke had gone far enough .    take it easy   he soothed .   your clever hazing blew up right in your faces   it blew up beautifully   but we re not going to carry it too far .  i guess we ve had enough fun out of you fellows .  sweeney is with the native chief now  explaining that we re leaving and taking you three with us .  frankly  i ll be glad to get going   wait a while  sweeney s calling me .    when williams returned two seconds later  his expression was peculiar  having turned a bit greenish .  in fact  he got greener by the second .    it looks   he gulped throatily   as if our counter haze has blow up in our faces .  the native chief insists on the sacrifice .    silence brooded  while the three humanoids thought over the state of affairs .  for moments  none of them could say a word .    i ve told sweeney   williams added  glumly   to go back and tell the chief  that if the doesn t do as we say  something terrible is going to happen to his tribe .  but it s pure bluff and he may not fall for it .  uh    i m sorry  fellows .  i guess we went too far .  if it looks really bad  we ll cut you loose and join in the fight .     cut us loose now   growled tubal  his blood running cold .   let s get this over with .     wait .   cried forase frantically .   let the earthmen try some of his psychology .  go ahead  earthman .  think hard .    williams thought until his brain began to hurt .    you see   he said weakly   we ve lost some of our godlike prestige  ever since we were unable to cure the chief s wife .  she died yesterday .   he nodded abstractedly to himself .   what we need is an impressive miracle .  er   have you fellows anything in your pockets .    he knelt beside them and began searching .  wri forase had a stylus  a pocket pad  a thin toothed comb  some anti itch powder  a sheaf of credits and a few odds and ends .  sefan had a collection of similar nondescript material .   it was from tubal s hip pocket that williams withdrew a small black gunlike object with a huge hand grip and a short barrel .    what s this .    tubal scowled .   is that what i ve been sitting on all this while .  it s a weld gun that i used to fix up a meteor puncture in our ship .  it s no good  power s almost gone .    williams  eyes kindled .  his whole body galvanized with excitement .    that s what you think .  you galaxy men never could see farther than your noses .  why don t you come down to earth for a spell   and get a new point of view .    williams was running toward his fellow conspirators now .    sweeney   he howled   you tell that damned monkey tailed chief that in just about one second  i m going to get sore and pull the whole sky down over his head .  get tough .    but the chief did not wait for the message .  he gestured defiance and the natives made a united rush .  tubal roared  and his muscles cracked against the bonds .  the weld gun in william s hand flared into life  its feeble power beaming outward .   the nearest native hut went up in sudden flames .  another followed   and another   and the fourth   and then the weld gun went dead .   but it was enough .  not a native remained standing .  all were groveling on their faces  wailing and shrieking for pardon .  the chief wailed and shrieked loudest of all .   tell the chief   said williams to sweeney   that that s just a little  insignificant sample of what we re thinking of doing to him .    to the humanoids  as he cut the rawhide holding them  he added complacently    just some simple  ordinary savage psychology .    it was only after they were back in their ship and off in space again that forase locked up his pride .    but i thought earthmen had never developed mathematical psychology .  how did you know all that sub humanoid stuff .  no one in the galaxy has got that far yet .    well   williams grinned   we have a certain amount of rule of thumb knowledge about the workings of the uncivilized mind .  you see   we come from a world where most people  in a manner of speaking  are still uncivilized .  so we have to know .    forase nodded slowly .   you screwball earthmen .  at least  this little episode has taught us all one thing .     what s that .     never   said forase  dipping a second time into earth slang   get tough with a bunch of nuts .  they may be nuttier than you think .    the end    in going through my stories while preparing this book  i found  the hazing  to be the only published story concerning which i could remember nothing from the title alone .  even as i reread it  nothing clicked .  if i had been given the story without my name on it and had been asked to read it and guess the author  i would probably have been stumped .  maybe that means something .   it does seem to me  though  that the story is set against a  homo sol  background .   i had better luck with fred pohl with another story   super neutron   which i wrote at the end of the same february in which i did  masks  and  the hazing .   i submitted it to him on march          and he accepted it on march   .   by that time  less than three years after my first submission  i was clearly becoming rather impatient with rejections .  at least  the news of the acceptance of  super neutron  is greeted in my diary with an  it s about time i made a sale   five and a half weeks since the last one .             super neutron     it was at the seventeenth meeting of the honorable society of ananias that we got the greatest scare of our collective lives and consequently elected gilbert hayes to the office of perpetual president .   the society is not a large one .  before the election of hayes there were only four of us  john sebastian  simon murfree  morris levin and myself .  on the first sunday of every month we met at luncheon  and on these monthly occasions justified our society s title by gambling the dinner check on our ability to lie .   it was quite a complicated process  with strict parliamentary rules .  one member spun a yarn each meeting as his turn came up  and two conditions had to be adhered to .  his story had to be an outrageous  complicated  fantastic lie  and  it had to sound like the truth .  members were allowed to   and did  attack any and every point of the story by asking questions or demanding explanations .   woe to the narrator who did not answer all questions immediately  or who  in answering  involved himself in a contradiction .  the dinner check was his .  financial loss was slight  but the disgrace was great .   and then came that seventeenth meeting   and gilbert hayes .  hayes was one of several non members who attended occasionally to listen to the after dinner whopper  paying his own check  and  of course  being forbidden to participate  but on this occasion he was the only one present aside from the regular members .   dinner was over  i had been voted into the chair  it was my regular turn to preside   and the minutes had been read  when hayes leaned forward and said quietly   i d like a chance today  gentlemen .    i frowned   in the eyes of the society you are non existent  mr .  hayes .  it is impossible for you to take part .     then just let me make a statement   he rejoined .  the solar system is coming to an end at exactly seventeen and a half minutes after two this afternoon .    there was a devil of a stir  and i looked at the electric clock over the television receiver .  it was   .    p . m .   i said hesitantly   if you have anything to substantiate that extraordinary statement  it should be most interesting .  it is mr .  levin s turn today  but if he is willing to waive it  and if the rest of the society agrees   levin smiled and nodded  and the others joined in .   i banged the gavel   mr .  hayes has the floor .    hayes lit his cigar and gazed at it pensively .   i have little more than an hour  gentlemen  but i ll start at the beginning  which is about fifteen years ago .  at that time  though i ve resigned since  i was an astrophysicist at yerkes observatory   young  but promising .  i was hot on the trail of the solution to one of the perennial puzzles of astrophysics   the source of the cosmic rays   and full of ambition .    he paused  and continued in a different tone   you know  it is strange that with all our scientific advance in the last two centuries we have never found either that mysterious source or the equally mysterious reason for the explosion of a star .  they are the two eternal puzzles and we know as little about them today as we did in the days of einstein  eddington and millikan .    still  as i say  i thought i had the cosmic ray by the tail  so i set out to check my ideas by observation  as for that i had to go out in space .  it wasn t  however  as easy as all that .  it was in       you see  just after the last war  and the observatory was about broke   as weren t we all .    i made the best of it .  i hired an old second hand     model  piled my apparatus in and set out alone .  what s more  i had to sneak out of port without clearance papers  not wishing to go through the red tape the occupation army would have put me through .  it was illegal  but i wanted my data   so i headed out at a right angle to the ecliptic  in the direction of the south celestial pole  approximately  and left sol a billion miles behind me .    the voyage i made  and the data i collected are unimportant .  i never reported one or the other .  it was the planet i found that makes the story .    at this point  murfree raised those bushy eyebrows of his and grunted   i would like to warn the gentleman  mr .  chairman .  no member has yet escaped with his skin with the phony planet .    hayes smiled grimly   i ll take my chance .    to continue  it was on the eighteenth day of my trip that i first detected the planet  and as a little orange disc the size of a pea .  naturally  a planet in that region of space is something of a sensation .  i headed for it  and immediately discovered that i had not even scratched the surface of that planet s queerness .  to exist there at all was phenomenal   but it likewise possessed absolutely no gravitational field .    levin s wine glass crashed to the floor .   mr .  chairman   he gasped   i demand the gentleman s immediate disqualification .  no mass can exist without distorting the space in its neighborhood and thus creating a gravitational field .  he has made an impossible statement  and should therefore be disqualified .   his face was an angry red .   but hayes held his hand up   i demand time  mr .  chairman .  the explanation will be forthcoming in due course .  to make it now would only complicate things .  please  may i continue .    i considered   in view of the nature of your story  i am disposed to be lenient .  delay is granted  but please remember that an explanation will be required eventually .  you will lose without it .     all right   said hayes .   for the present  you will have to accept my statement that the planet had no gravity at all .  that is definite  for i had complete astronomical equipment upon my ship  and though my instruments were very sensitive  they registered a dead zero .    it worked the other way around as well  for the planet was not affected by the gravity of other masses .  again  i stress the point that it was not affected at all .  this i was not able to determine at the time  but subsequent observation over a period of years  showed that the planet was traveling in a straight line orbit and at a constant speed .  as it was well within the sun s influence  the fact that its orbit was neither elliptical nor hyperbolic  and that  though approaching the sun  it was not accelerating  showed definitely that it was independent of solar gravity .     wait a while  hayes .   sebastian scowled till his gold pre molar gleamed .   what held this wonderful planet together .  without gravity  why didn t it break up and drift apart .     sheer inertia  for one thing .   was the immediate retort .  there was nothing to pull it apart .  a collision with another body of comparable size might have done it   leaving out of consideration the possibility of the existence of some other binding force peculiar to the planet .    he sighed and continued   that doesn t finish the properties of the body .  its red orange color and its low reflective power  or albedo  set me on another track  and i made the astonishing discovery that the planet was entirely transparent to the whole electro magnetic spectrum from radio waves to cosmic rays .  it was only in the region of the red and yellow portion of the visible light octave that it was reasonably opaque .  hence  its color .     why was this .   demanded murfree .   hayes looked at me   that is an unreasonable question  mr .  chairman .  i maintain that i might as well be asked to explain why glass is entirely transparent to anything above or below the ultra violet region  so that heat  light and x rays pass through  while it remains opaque to ultra violet light itself .  this sort of thing is a property of the substance itself and must be accepted as such without explanation .    i whacked my gavel   question declared improper .     i object   declared murfree .   hayes missed the point .  nothing is perfectly transparent .  glass of sufficient thickness will stop even cosmic rays .  do you mean to say that blue light would pass through an entire planet  or heat  for instance .     why not .   replied hayes .   that perfect transparency does not exist in your experience does not mean it does not exist altogether .  there is certainly no scientific law to that effect .  this planet was perfectly transparent except for one small region of the spectrum .  that s a definite fact of observation .    my gavel thumped again   explanation declared sufficient .  continue  hayes .    his cigar had gone out and he paused to relight .  then   in other respects  the planet was normal .  it was not quite the size of saturn   perhaps half way in diameter between it and neptune .  subsequent experiments showed it to possess mass  though it was hard to find out how much   certainly more than twice earth s .  with mass  it possessed the usual properties of inertia and momentum   but no gravity .    it was   .    now .   hayes followed my eyes and said   yes  only three quarters of an hour is left .  i ll hurry .   .  .  .  naturally  this queer planet set me to thinking  and that  together with the fact that i had already been evolving certain theories concerning cosmic rays and novae  led to an interesting solution .    he drew a deep breath   imagine   if you can   our cosmos as a cloud of   well  super atoms which        i beg your pardon   exclaimed sebastian  rising to his feet   are you intending to base any of your explanation on drawing analogies between stars and atoms  or between solar systems and electronic orbits .     why do you ask .   questioned hayes  quietly .    because if you do  i demand immediate disqualification .  the belief that atoms are miniature solar systems is in a class with the ptolemaic scheme of the universe .  the idea has never been accepted by responsible scientists even at the very dawn of the atomic theory .    i nodded   the gentleman is correct .  no such analogy will be permitted as part of the explanation .     i object   said hayes .   in your school course in elementary physics or chemistry  you will remember that in the study of the properties of gases  it was often pretended  for the sake of illustrating a point  that the gas molecules were tiny billiard balls .  does that mean that gas molecules are billiard balls .     no   admitted sebastian .    it only means   drove on hayes   that gas molecules act similarly to billiard balls in some ways .  therefore the actions of one are better visualized by studying the actions of the other .    well  then  i am only trying to point out a phenomenon in our universe of stars  and for the sake of ease of visualization  i compare it to a similar  and better known  phenomenon in the world of atoms .  that does not mean that stars are magnified atoms .    i was won over .   the point is well taken   i said   you may continue with your explanation  but if it is the judgment of the chair that the analogy becomes a false one  you will be disqualified .     good   agreed hayes   but we ll pass on to another point for a moment .  do any of you remember the first atomic power plants of a hundred and seventy years ago and how they operated .     i believe   muttered levin   that they used the classical uranium fission method for power .  they bombarded uranium with slow neutrons and split it up into masurium  barium  gamma rays and more neutrons  thus establishing a cyclic process .     that s right .  well  imagine that the stellar universe acted in ways   mind you  this is a metaphor  and not to be taken literally   like a body composed of uranium atoms  and imagine this stellar universe to be bombarded from without by objects which might act in some ways similar to the way neutrons act on an atomic scale .    such a super neutron  hitting a sun  would cause that sun to explode into radiation and more super neutrons .  in other words  you would have a nova .   he looked around for disagreement .    what justification have you for that idea .   demanded levin .    two  one logical  and one observational .  logic first .  stars are essentially in matter energy equilibrium  yet suddenly  with no observable change  either spectral or otherwise  they occasionally explode .  an explosion indicates instability  but where .  not within the star  for it had been in equilibrium for millions of years .  not from a point within the universe  for novae occur in even concentration throughout the universe .  hence  by elimination  only from a point outside the universe .    secondly  observation .  i came across one of these super neutrons  .    said murfree indignantly   i suppose you mean that gravitationless planet you came across .     that s right .     then what makes you think it s a super neutron .  you can t use your theory as proof  because you re using the super neutron itself to bolster the theory .  we re not allowed to argue in circles here .     i know that   declared hayes  stiffly .   i ll resort to logic again .  the world of atoms possesses a cohesive force in the electro magnetic charge on electrons and protons .  the world of stars possesses a cohesive force in gravity .  the two forces are only alike in a very general manner .  for instance  there are two kinds of electrical charges  positive and .  negative  but only one kind of gravity   and innumerable minor differences .  still  an analogy this far seems to me to be permissible .  a neutron on an atomic scale is a mass without the atomic cohesive force   electric charge .  a super neutron on a stellar scale ought to be a mass without the stellar cohesive force   gravity .  therefore  if i find a body without gravity  it seems reasonable to assume it to be a super neutron .     do you consider that a rigorously scientific proof .   asked sebastian sarcastically .    no   admitted hayes   but it is logical  conflicts with no scientific fact i know of  and works out to form a consistent explanation of novae .  that should be enough for our purpose at present .    murfree was gazing hard at his fingernails   and just where is this super neutron of yours heading .     i see you anticipate   said hayes  sombrely .   it was what i asked myself at the time .  at   .       today it hits the sun square  and eight minutes later  the radiation resulting from the explosion will sweep earth to oblivion .     why didn t you report all this .   barked sebastian .    where was the use .  there was nothing to be done about it .  we can t handle astronomical masses .  all the power available on earth would not have sufficed to swerve that great body from its path .  there was no escape within the solar system itself  for neptune and pluto will turn gaseous along with the other planets  and interstellar travel is as yet impossible .  since man cannot exist independently in space  he is doomed .    why tell of all this .  what would result after i had convinced them that the death warrant was signed .  suicides  crime waves  orgies  messiahs  evangelists and everything bad and futile you could think of .  and after all  is death by nova so bad .  it is instantaneous and clean .  at   .    you re here .  at   .    you are a mass of attenuated gas .  it is so quick and easy a death  it is almost not death .    there was a long silence after this .  i felt uneasy .  there are lies and lies  but this sounded like the real thing .  hayes didn t have that little quirk of the lip or that little gleam in the eye which marks the triumph of putting over a good one .  he was deadly  deadly serious .  i could see the others felt the same .  levin was gulping at his wine  hand shaking .   finally  sebastian coughed loudly   how long ago did you discover this super neutron and where .     fifteen years ago  a billion miles or better from the sun .     and all that time it has been approaching the sun .     yes  at a constant speed of two miles per second .     good  i ve got you .   sebastian almost laughed his relief .   why haven t the astronomers spotted it in all this while .     my god   responded hayes  impatiently   it s clear you aren t an astronomer .  now  what fool would look to the southern celestial pole for a planet  when they re only found in the ecliptic .     but   pointed out sebastian   the region is studied just the same .  it is photographed .     surely .  for all i know  the super neutron has been photographed a hundred times   a thousand times if you like  though the southern pole is the most poorly watched region of the sky .  but what s to differentiate it from a star .  with its low albedo  it never passed eleventh magnitude in brightness .  after all  it s hard enough to detect any planets in any case .  uranus was spotted many times before herschel realized it was a planet .  pluto took years to find even when they were looking for it .  remember also that without gravity  it causes no planetary perturbation  and that the absence of these removes the most obvious indication of its presence .     but   insisted sebastian  desperately   as it approached the sun  its apparent size would increase and it would begin to show a perceptible disc through a telescope .  even if its reflected light were very faint  it would certainly obscure the stars behind it .     true   admitted hayes .   i will not say that a really thorough mapping of the polar region would not have uncovered it  but such mapping has been done long ago  and the present cursory searches for novae  special spectral types and so on are by no means thorough .  then  as the super neutron approaches the sun  it begins to appear only in the dawn and twilight   in evening and morning star fashion   so that observation becomes much more difficult .  and so  as a matter of fact  it just has not been observed   and it is what should have been expected .    again a silence  and i became aware that my heart was pounding .  it was two o clock even  and we hadn t been able to shake hayes  story .  we had to prove it a lie fast  or i d die of sheer suspense .  we were all of us watching the clock .   levin took up the fight .   it s an awfully queer coincidence that the super neutron should be heading straight for the sun .  what are the chances against it .  remember  that would be the same thing as reciting the chances against the truth of the story .    i interposed   that is an illegitimate objection  mr .  levin .  to cite improbability  however great  is not sufficient .  only outright impossibility or citation of inconsistency can serve to disqualify .    but hayes waved his hand   it s all right .  let me answer .  taking an individual super neutron and an individual star  the chances of collision  head on  are all but infinitely small .  however  statistically  if you shoot enough super neutrons into the universe  then  given enough time  every star ought to be hit sooner or later .  space must be swarming with super neutrons  say one every thousand cubic parsecs   so that in spite of the vast distances between the stars and the relative minuteness of the targets  twenty novae occur in our single galaxy every year   that is  there are twenty collisions between super neutrons and stars annually .    the situation is no different really from uranium being bombarded with ordinary neutrons .  only one neutron out of a hundred million may score a hit  but  given time  every nucleus is exploded eventually .  if there is an outer universe intelligence directing this bombardment   pure hypothesis  and not part of my argument  please   a year to us is probably an infinitesimal fraction of a second to them .  the hits  to them  may be occurring at the rate of billions to their seconds .  energy is being developed  perhaps  to the point where the material this universe composes has become heated to the gaseous state   or whatever passes for the gaseous state there .  the universe is expanding  you know   like a gas .     still  for the very first super neutron entering our system to head straight for the sun seems     levin ended in a weak stammer .    good lord   snapped hayes   who told you this was the first .  hundreds may have passed through the system in geologic times .  one or two may have passed through in the last thousand years or so .  how would we know .  even when one is headed straight for the sun  astronomers don t find it .  perhaps this is the only one that s passed through since the telescope was invented  and before then  of course  and never forget that  having no gravity  they can go right through the middle of the system  without affecting the planets .  only a hit on the sun registers  and then it s too late .    he looked at the clock     .    .  we ought to see it now against the sun .   he stood up and raised the window shade .  the yellow sunlight streamed in and i moved away from the dusty shaft of light .  my mouth was dry as desert sand .  murfree was mopping his brow  but beads of sweat stood out all along his cheeks and neck .   hayes took out several slips of exposed film negative and handed them out   i came prepared  you see .   he held one up and squinted at the sun .   there it is   he remarked placidly   my calculations showed it would be in transit with respect to earth at the time of collision .  rather convenient .    i was looking at the sun  too  and felt my heart skip a beat .  there  quite clear against the brightness of the sun  was a little  perfectly round  black spot .    why doesn t it vaporize .   stammered murfree .   it must be almost in the sun s atmosphere .   i don t think he was trying to disprove hayes  story .  he had gone past that .  he was honestly seeking information .    i told you   explained hayes   that it is  transparent to almost all solar radiation .  only the radiation it absorbs can go into heat and that s a very small percentage of all it receives .  besides  it isn t ordinary matter .  it s probably much more re factory than anything on earth  and the solar surface is only at       degrees centigrade .    he pointed a thumb over his shoulder   it s   .        gentlemen .  the super neutron has struck and death is on its way .  we have eight minutes .    we were dumb with something that was just simply unbearable terror .  i remember hayes  voice  quite matter of fact  saying   mercury just went .   then a few minutes later   venus has gone .   and lastly   thirty seconds left  gentlemen .    the seconds crawled  but passed at last  and another thirty  seconds  and still another  and on hayes  face  a look of astonishment grew and spread .  he lifted the clock and stared at it  then peered through his film at the sun once more .    it s gone .   he turned and faced us   it s unbelievable .  i had thought of it  but i dared not draw the atomic analogy too far .  you know that not all atomic nuclei explode on being hit by a neutron .  some  cadmium  for instance  absorb them one after the other like sponges do water .  i       he paused again  drew a deep breath  and continued musingly   even the purest block of uranium contains traces of all other elements .  and in a universe of trillions of stars acting like uranium  what does a paltry million of cadmium like stars amount to   nothing .  yet the sun is one of them .  mankind never deserved that .    he kept on talking  but relief had finally penetrated and we listened no longer .  in half hysterical fashion  we elected gilbert hayes to the office of perpetual president by enthusiastic acclamation  and voted the story the whoppingest lie ever told .   but there s one thing that bothers me .  hayes fills his post well  the society is more successful than ever   but i think he should have been disqualified after all .  his story fulfilled the second condition  it sounded like the truth .  but i don t think it fulfilled the first condition .   i think it was the truth .   the end    i had series on my mind by now .   super neutron  was certainly intended to be but the first in a long chain of very clever and very ingenious tales to be told at the meetings of the  honorable society of ananias .   it didn t work out that way .  there was never a second story  not even the beginnings of one  not even the idea for one .   by the time i was writing  super neutron   in february of      i had heard of uranium fission and had even discussed it in some detail with campbell .  i managed to refer to it in the course of the story as  the classical uranium fission method for power .   i also spoke of the metal cadmium as a neutron absorber .  it wasn t bad for a story that appeared in       and i sometimes quote it in public to create an impression .   notice  though  that in the same paragraph in which i mention fission  i also talk of  masurium .   actually  masurium was the name given to element      in       but that discovery had proven a false alarm .  the element was really discovered in      and was given the now accepted name of  technetium .   it seems  then  that i could look years into the future and see uranium fission  as a practical power source  but i couldn t look a few years into the past and see the correct name for element     .   this brings us to march           and one of the key turning points of my literary career .   by that day  i had written thirty one stories .  of these i had already sold seventeen and was yet to sell four more .  of all these stories  three perhaps  and no more  were to turn out to be of more than ephemeral value  and those were the three  positronic robots  stories i had so far written   robbie    reason  and  liar .    looking back on my first three years as a writer  then  i can judge myself to be nothing more than a steady and  perhaps  hopeful third rater .  what s more  that s all i considered myself then  too .  nor did anyone else  at that time  seriously consider me as a potential first magnitude star in the science fiction heavens   except  maybe  campbell .   what are the odds  then  that on march           i would sit down and write something that for thirty years now has been considered by a surprising number of people to be the outstanding short classic of magazine science fiction .  it was one of those things that couldn t possibly happen   yet it did .   it began when i walked into campbell s office that day and  as usual  suggested an idea .  what it was i don t remember  but whatever it was he turned it down instantly  not because it was such a bad idea but because he had something he wanted to show me that crowded everything else out of his mind .  he had come across a quotation from ralph waldo emerson that went   if the stars should appear one night in a thousand years  how would men believe and adore  and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of god .      campbell asked me what i thought would happen if the stars would appear at only very long intervals .  i had nothing intelligent to suggest .    i think men would go mad   he said thoughtfully .   we talked about that notion for quite a while  and i went home to write a story on the subject  one that campbell and i decided from the start was to be called  nightfall .    i began it that night .  i can remember the details exactly  my parents  apartment on windsor place in brooklyn  across the street from the candy store  my own room  just next to the living room  is clear in my mind  with the position of my bed  my desk  my typewriter   and myself getting started .   in years to come  fans would occasionally vote in polls designed to decide the best science fiction short stories of all time .  quite frequently   nightfall  would finish in first place .  just a couple of years ago  the science fiction writers of america polled their membership to decide the best science fiction short stories ever published  for inclusion in a hall of fame anthology .   nightfall  finished in first place by a sizable margin .  and  of course  it has been anthologized a dozen times so far .   with all this  one might argue that  nightfall  is the best  or at least the most popular  short science fiction story ever to appear in the magazines .  well  i often wonder  with a shudder  what might have happened on the evening of march           if some angelic spirit had whispered in my ear   isaac  you are about to start writing the best short science fiction story of our time .    i would undoubtedly have frozen solid .  i wouldn t have been able to type a word .   but we don t know the future  and i tapped away blissfully  writing the story and completing it by april         .  that day  i submitted it to campbell .  he asked for a small revision .  i took care of that  and on april           he bought the story .   it set several records for me .  it was the longest story i had yet sold  a little over thirteen thousand words .  since campbell    does anyone know in what essay  and in what connection  emerson says this .  every once in a while i make a desultory search through quotation books or through a collection of emerson but haven t found it yet .  i hope it exists and that the quote is  given correctly paid me a bonus  my first one   the word rate was one and a quarter cents a word  and the total check was for        more than twice as large as any single payment i had ever before received .    then  too   nightfall  appeared in the september      issue of astounding as the lead novelette .  for the first time  i made the cover of that magazine  with  nightfall  by isaac asimov  in large  bold letters .   most important of all  the appearance of  nightfall  graduated me by common consent  three years after i had begun my career  into the list of first rank science fiction writers .   alas  the story is not included here .  it appears  of course  in nightfall and other stories .     the excitement of writing  nightfall  and campbell s hearty and unqualified praise of it ought  one might think  to have set me furiously to work at the typewriter  but it didn t .  spring      was a bad time for me .   i could at any time that half year have left columbia with a master s degree  but that would have done me no good .  i had no job to go to  so i could only mark time and try to raise my value to some prospective employer by going on to the big one  the doctorate .   but that meant i had to take a series of elaborate  interminable  qualifying examinations   which i had to pass in order to be allowed to begin research without which i could not get the ph . d .  passing was difficult and i didn t feel prepared at all  but i had to try it sometime  and besides  if i didn t fall short by too far  i would be allowed to continue taking courses and to repeat the qualifying examinations at some future date .      black friar of the flame  was three thousand words longer than  nightfall   but the former was not to be sold for another half year  and since it earned merely one cent a word  it brought in only      .  of course  first time earnings are not the whole story  either .   nightfall  has earned me some thousands of dollars since      and will yet earn me more   black friar of the flame  has not yet earned me one cent over the original check   till its appearance in this book .      in telling the story  in that collection  of how  nightfall  came to be written  i mentioned that i had received      for it  quoting from memory .  once again  i must confess fallibility .  the records say      .  it is a small point  and perhaps not worth noting  but i know my readers .  by explaining this now  i fend off dozens of letters that will mention the discrepancy and demand an explanation .   so in may i absented myself from the typewriter  studied earnestly for my qualifyings  took them   and didn t pass .  i did well enough to earn the option of a future repeat  and i also received my m . a .  as a kind of consolation prize  but i was badly disheartened all the same .    and in the larger world outside  though great britain had survived air bombardment  hitler still seemed unstoppable .  he invaded the balkans and was again winning spectacular victories  and that was disheartening  too .    it was not till may           that i could bring myself to go back to my writing .  i turned out  not final .   which i submitted to campbell on june   .  it was accepted on the sixth  but without a bonus .            not final .      nicholas orloff inserted a monocle in his left eye with all the incorruptible briticism of a russian educated at oxford and said reproachfully   but  my dear mr .  secretary .  half a billion dollars .    leo birnam shrugged his shoulders wearily and allowed his lank body to cramp up still farther in the chair   the appropriation must go through  commissioner .  the dominion government here at ganymede is becoming desperate .  so far  i ve been holding them off  but as secretary of scientific affairs  my powers are small .     i know  but      and orloff spread his hands helplessly .    i suppose so .  agreed birnam .   the empire government finds it easier to look the other way .  they ve done it consistently up to now .  i ve tried for a year now to have them understand the nature of the danger that hangs over the entire system  but it seems that it can t be done .  but i m appealing to you  mr .  commissioner .  you re new in your post and can approach this jovian affair with an unjaundiced eye .    orloff coughed and eyed the tips of his boots .  in the three months since he had succeeded gridley as colonial commissioner he had tabled unread everything relating to  those damned jovian d . t .  s .   that had been according to the established cabinet policy which had labeled the jovian affair as  deadwood  long before he had entered office .   but now that ganymede was becoming nasty  he found himself sent out to jovopolis with instructions to hold the  blasted provincials  down .  it was a nasty spot .   birnam was speaking   the dominion government has reached the point where it needs the money so badly  in fact  that if they don t get it  they re going to publicize everything .    orloff s phlegm broke completely  and he snatched at the monocle as it dropped   my dear fellow .     i know what it would mean .  i ve advised against it  but they re justified .  once the inside of the jovian affair is out  once the people know about it  the empire government won t stay in power a week .  and when the technocrats come in  they ll give us whatever we ask .  public opinion will see to that    but you ll also create a panic and hysteria        surely .  that is why we hesitate .  but you might call this an ultimatum .  we want secrecy  we need secrecy  but we need money more .     i see .   orloff was thinking rapidly  and the conclusions he came to were not pleasant .   in that case  it would be advisable to investigate the case further .  if you have the papers concerning the communications with the planet jupiter        i have them   replied birnam  dryly   and so has the empire government at washington .  that won t do  commissioner .  it s the same cud that s been chewed by earth officials for the last year  and it s gotten us nowhere .  i want you to come to ether station with me .    the ganymedan had risen from his chair  and he glowered down upon orloff from his six and a half feet of height .   orloff flushed   are you ordering me .     in a way  yes  i tell you there is no time .  if you intend acting  you must act quickly or not at all .   birnam paused  then added   you don t mind walking  i hope .  power vehicles aren t allowed to approach ether station  ordinarily  and i can use the walk to explain a few of the facts .  it s only two miles off .     i ll walk   was the brusque reply .   the trip upward to subground level was made in silence  which was broken by orloff when they stepped into the dimly lit anteroom .    it s chilly here .       i know .  it s difficult to keep the temperature up to norm this near the surface .  but it will be colder outside .  here .    birnam had kicked open a closet door and was indicating the garments suspended from the ceiling .   put them on .  you ll need them .    orloff fingered them doubtfully   are they heavy enough .    birnam was pouring into his own costume as he spoke .   they re electrically heated .  you ll find them plenty warm .  that s it .  tuck the trouser legs  inside the boots and lace them tight .    he turned then and  with a grunt  brought out a double compressed gas cylinder from its rack in one corner of the closet .  he glanced at the dial reading  and then turned the stopcock .  there was a thin wheeze of escaping gas  at which birnam sniffed with satisfaction .    do you know how to work one of these .   he asked  as he screwed onto the jet a flexible tube of metal mesh  at the other end of which was a curiously curved object of thick  clear glass .    what is it .     oxygen nosepiece .  what there is of ganymede s atmosphere is argon and nitrogen  just about half arid half .  it isn t particularly breathable .   he heaved the double cylinder into position  and tightened it in its harness on orloff s back .   orloff staggered   it s heavy .  i can t walk two miles with this .     it won t be heavy out there   birnam nodded carelessly upward and lowered the glass nosepiece over orloff s head .   just remember to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth  and you won t have any trouble .  by the way  did you eat recently .     i lunched before i came to your place .    birnam sniffed dubiously   well  that s a little awkward .   he drew a small metal container from one of his pockets and tossed it to the commissioner .   put one of those pills in your mouth and keep sucking on it .    orloff worked clumsily with gloved fingers and finally managed to get a brown spheroid out of the tin and into his mouth .  he followed birnam up a gently sloped ramp .  the blind alley ending of the corridor slid aside smoothly when they reached it and there was a faint soughing as air slipped out into the thinner atmosphere of ganymede .   birnam caught the other s elbow  and fairly dragged him out .    i ve turned your air tank on full   he shouted .   breathe deeply and keep sucking at that pill    gravity had flicked to ganymedan normality as they crossed the threshold and orloff after one horrible moment of apparent levitation  felt his stomach turn a somersault and explode .   he gagged  and fumbled the pill with his tongue in desperate attempt at self control .  the oxygen rich mixture from the air cylinders burned his throat  and gradually ganymede steadied .  his stomach shuddered back into place .  he tried walking .    take it easy  now   came birnam s soothing voice .   it gets you that way the first few times you change gravity fields quickly .  walk slowly and get the rhythm  or you ll take a tumble .  that s right  you re getting it .    the ground seemed resilient .  orloff could feel the pressure of the other s arm holding him down at each step to keep him from springing too high .  steps were longer now   and flatter  as he got the rhythm .  birnam continued speaking  a voice a little muffled from behind the leather flap drawn loosely across mouth and chin .    each to his own world   he grinned .   i visited earth a few years back  with my wife  and had a hell of a time .  i couldn t get myself to learn to walk on a planet s surface without a nosepiece .  i kept choking   i really did .  the sunlight was too bright and the sky was too blue and the grass was too green .  and the buildings were right out on the surface .  i ll never forget the time they tried to get me to sleep in a room twenty stories up in the air  with the window wide open and the moon shining in .    i went back on the first spaceship going my way and don t ever intend returning .  how are you feeling now .     fine .  splendid .   now that the first discomfort had gone .  orloff found the low gravity exhilarating .  he looked about him .  the broken  hilly ground  bathed in a drenching yellow light  was covered with ground hugging broad leaved shrubs that showed the orderly arrangement of careful cultivation .   birnam answered the unspoken question  there s enough carbon dioxide in the air to keep the plants alive  and they all have the power to fix atmospheric nitrogen .  that s what makes agriculture ganymede s greatest industry .  those plants are worth their weight in gold as fertilizers back on earth and worth double or triple that as sources for half a hundred alkaloids that can t be gotten anywhere else in the system .  and  of course  everyone knows that ganymedan green leaf has terrestrial tobacco beat hollow .    there was the drone of a strato rocket overhead  shrill in the thin atmosphere  and orloff looked up .   he stopped   stopped dead   and forgot to breathe .   it was his first glimpse of jupiter in the sky .   it is one thing to see jupiter  coldly harsh  against the ebon backdrop of space .  at six hundred thousand miles  it is majestic enough .  but on ganymede  barely topping the hills  its outlines softened and ever so faintly hazed by the thin atmosphere  shining mellowly from a purple sky in which only a few fugitive stars dare compete with the jovian giant   it can be described by no conceivable combination of words .   at first  orloff absorbed the gibbous disk in silence .  it was gigantic  thirty two times the apparent diameter of the sun as seen from earth .  its stripes stood out in faint washes of color against the yellowness beneath and the great red spot was an oval splotch of orange near the western rim .   and finally orloff murmured weakly   it s beautiful .    leo birnam stared  too  but there was no awe in his eyes .  there was the mechanical weariness of viewing a sight often seen  and besides that an expression of sick revulsion .  the chin flap hid his twitching smile  but his grasp upon orloff s arm left bruises through the tough fabric of the surface suit .   he said slowly   it s the most horrible sight in the system .    orloff turned reluctant attention to his companion   eh .   then  disagreeably   oh  yes  those mysterious jovians .    at that  the ganymedan turned away angrily and broke into swinging  fifteen foot strides .  orloff followed clumsily after  keeping his balance with difficulty .    here  now   he gasped .   but birnam wasn t listening .  he was speaking coldly  bitterly   you on earth can afford to ignore jupiter .  you know nothing of it .  it s a little pin prick in your sky  a little flyspeck .  you don t live here on ganymede  watching that damned colossus gloating over you .  up and over fifteen hours   hiding god knows what on its surface .  hiding something that s waiting and waiting and trying to get out .  like a giant bomb just waiting to explode .     nonsense .   orloff managed to jerk out .   will you slow down .  i can t keep up .    birnam cut his strides in half and said tensely   everyone knows that jupiter is inhabited  but practically no one ever stops to realize what that means .  i tell you that those jovians  whatever they are  are born to the purple .  they are the natural rulers of the solar system .     pure hysteria   muttered orloff .   the empire government has been hearing nothing else from your dominion for a year .     and you ve shrugged it off .  well  listen .  jupiter  discounting the thickness of its colossal atmosphere  is eighty thousand miles in diameter .  that means it possesses a surface one hundred times that of earth  and more than fifty times that of the entire terrestrial empire .  its population  its resources  its war potential are in proportion .     mere numbers        i know what you mean   birnam drove on  passionately .   wars are not fought with numbers  but with science and with organization .  the jovians have both .  in the quarter of a century during which we have communicated with them  we ve learned a bit .  they have atomic power and they have radio .  and in a world of ammonia under great pressure   a world in other words in which almost none of the metals can exist as metals for any length of time because of the tendency to form soluble ammonia complexes   they have managed to build up a complicated civilization .  that means they have had to work through plastics  glasses  silicates and synthetic building materials of one sort or another .  that means a chemistry developed just as far as ours is  and i d put odds on its having developed further .    orloff waited long before answering .  and then   but how certain are you people about the jovians  last message .  we on earth are inclined to doubt that the jovians can possibly be as unreasonably belligerent as they have been described .    the ganymedan laughed shortly  they broke off all communication after that last message  didn t they .  that doesn t sound friendly on their part  does it .  i assure you that we ve all but stood on our ears trying to contact them .    here now  don t talk .  let me explain something to you .  for twenty five years here on ganymede a little group of men have worked their hearts out trying to make sense out of the static ridden  gravity distorted set of variable clicks in our radio apparatus  for those clicks were our only connection with living intelligence upon jupiter .  it was a job for a world of scientists  but we never had more than two dozen at the station at any one time .  i was one of them from the very beginning and  as a philologist  did my part in helping construct and interpret the code that developed between ourselves and the jovians  so that you can see i am speaking from the real inside .    it was a devil of a heartbreaking job .  it was five years before we got past the elementary clicks of arithmetic  three and four are seven  the square root of twenty five is five  factorial six is seven hundred and twenty .  after that  months sometimes passed before we could work out and check by further communication a single new fragment of thought .    but   and this is the point   by the time the jovians broke off relations  we understood them thoroughly .  there was no more chance of a mistake in comprehension  than there was of ganymede suddenly cutting loose from jupiter .  and their last message was a threat  and a promise of destruction .  oh  there s no doubt   there s no doubt .    they were walking through a shallow pass in which the yellow jupiter light gave way to a clammy darkness .   orloff was disturbed .  he had never had the case presented to him in this fashion before .  he said   but the reason  man .  what reason did we give them        no reason .  it was simply this  the jovians had finally discovered from our messages   just where and how i don t know   that we were not jovians .     well  of course .     it wasn t  of course  to them .  in their experiences they had never come across intelligences that were not jovian .  why should they make an exception in favour of those from outer space .     you say they were scientists .   orloff s voice had assumed a wary frigidity .   wouldn t they realize that alien environments would breed alien life .  we knew it .  we never thought the jovians were earthmen though we had never met intelligences other than those of earth .    they were back in the drenching wash of jupiter light again  and a spreading region of ice glimmered amberly in a depression to the right .   birnam answered   i said they were chemists and physicists  but i never said they were astronomers .  jupiter  my dear commissioner  has an atmosphere three thousand miles or more thick  and those miles of gas block off everything but the sun and the four largest of jupiter s moons .  the jovians know nothing of alien environments .    orloff considered .   and so they decided we were aliens .   what next .     if we weren t jovians  then  in their eyes  we weren t people .  it turned out that a non jovian was  vermin  by definition .    orloff s automatic protest was cut off short by birnam   in their eyes  i said  vermin we were  and vermin we are .  moreover  we were vermin with the peculiar audacity of having dared to attempt to treat with jovians   with human beings .  their last message was this  word for word    jovians are the masters .  there is no room for vermin .  we will destroy you immediately .   i doubt if there was any animosity in that message   simply a cold statement of fact .  but they meant it .     but why .     why did man exterminate the housefly .     come  sir .  you re not seriously presenting an analogy of that nature .     why not  since it is certain that the jovian considers us a sort of housefly   an insufferable type of housefly that dares aspire to intelligence .    orloff made a last attempt   but truly  mr .  secretary  it seems impossible for intelligent life to adopt such an attitude .     do you possess much of an acquaintance with any other type of intelligent life than our own .   came with immediate sarcasm .   do you feel competent to pass on jovian psychology .  do you know just how alien jovians must be physically .  just think of their world with its gravity at two and one half earth normal  with its ammonia oceans   oceans that you might throw all earth into without raising a respectable splash  with its three thousand mile atmosphere  dragged down by the colossal gravity into densities and pressures in its surface layers that make the sea bottoms of earth resemble a medium thick vacuum .  i tell you we ve tried to figure out what sort of life could exist under those conditions and we ve given up .  it s thoroughly incomprehensible .  do you expect their mentality  then  to be any more understandable .  never .  accept it as it is .  they intend destroying us .  that s all we know and all we need to know .    he lifted a gloved hand as he finished and one finger pointed   there s ether station just ahead .    orloff s head swiveled   underground .     certainly .  all except the observatory .  that s that steel and quartz dome to the right   the small one .    they had stopped before two large boulders that flanked an earthy embankment  and from behind either one a nosepieced  suited soldier in ganymedan orange  with blasters ready  advanced upon the two .   birnam lifted his face into jupiter s light and the soldiers saluted and stepped aside .  a short word was barked into the wrist mike of one of them and the camouflaged opening between the boulders fell into two and orloff followed the secretary into the yawning air lock .   the earthman caught one last glimpse of sprawling jupiter before the closing door cut off the surface altogether .   it was no longer beautiful .   orloff did not quite feel normal again until he had seated himself in the overstuffed chair in dr .  edward prosser s private office .  with a sigh of utter relaxation  he propped his monocle under his eyebrow .    would dr .  prosser mind if i smoked in here  while we re waiting .   he asked .    go ahead   replied birnam  carelessly .   my own idea would be to drag prosser away from whatever he s fooling with just now  but he s a queer chap .  we ll get more out of him if we wait until he s ready for us .   he withdrew a gnarled stick of greenish tobacco from its case  and bit off the edge viciously .   orloff smiled through the smoke of his own cigarette   i don t mind waiting .  i still have something to say .  you see  for the moment  mr .  secretary  you gave me the jitters  but  after all  granted that the jovians intend mischief once they get at us  it remains a fact   and here he spaced his words emphatically   that they can t get at us .     a bomb without a fuse  hey .     exactly .  it s simplicity itself  and not really worth discussing .  you will admit  i suppose  that under no circumstances can the jovians get away from jupiter .     under no circumstances .   there was a quizzical tinge in birnam s slow reply .   shall we analyze that .    he stared hard at the purple flame of his cigar .   it s an old trite saying that the jovians can t leave jupiter .  the fact has been highly publicized by the sensation mongers of earth and ganymede and a great deal of sentiment has been driveled about the unfortunate intelligences who are irrevocably surface bound  and must forever stare into the universe without  watching  watching  wondering  and never attaining .    but  after all  what holds the jovians to their planet .  two factors .  that s all .  the first is the immense gravity field of the planet .  two and a half earth normal .    orloff nodded .   pretty bad .   he agreed .    and jupiter s gravitational potential is even worse  for because of its greater diameter the intensity of its gravitational field decreases with distance only one tenth as rapidly as earth s field does .  it s a terrible problem   but it s been solved .     hey .   orloff straightened .    they ve got atomic power .  gravity   even jupiter s   means nothing once you ve put unstable atomic nuclei to work for you .    orloff crushed his cigarette to extinction with a nervous gesture .   but their atmosphere        yes  that s what s stopping them .  they re living at the bottom of a three thousand mile deep ocean of it  where the hydrogen of which it is composed is collapsed by sheer pressure to something approaching the density of solid hydrogen .  it stays a gas because the temperature of jupiter is above the critical point of hydrogen  but you just try to figure put the pressure that can make hydrogen gas half as heavy as water .  you ll be surprised at the number of zeros you ll have to put down .    no spaceship of metal or of any kind of matter can stand that pressure .  no terrestrial spaceship can land on jupiter without smashing like an eggshell  and no jovian spaceship can leave jupiter without exploding like a soap bubble .  that problem has not yet been solved  but it will be some day .  maybe tomorrow  maybe not for a hundred years  or a thousand .  we don t know  but when it is solved  the jovians will be on top of us .  and it can be solved in a specific way .     i don t see how        force fields .  we ve got them now  you know .     force fields .   orloff seemed genuinely astonished  and he chewed the word over and over to himself for a few moments .   they re used as meteor shields for ships in the asteroid zone  but i don t see the application to the jovian problem .     the ordinary force field   explained birnam   is a feeble rarefied zone of energy extending over a hundred miles or more outside the ship .  it ll stop meteors but it s just so much empty ether to an object like a gas molecule .  but what if you took that same zone of energy and compressed it to a thickness of a tenth of an inch .  molecules would bounce off it like this   ping g g g .  and if you used stronger generators  and compressed the field to a hundredth of an inch  molecules would bounce off even when driven by the unthinkable pressure of jupiter s atmosphere   and then if you build a ship inside     he left the sentence dangling .   orloff was pale .   you re not saying it can be done .     i ll bet you anything you like that the jovians are trying to do it .  and we re trying to do it right here at ether station .    the colonial commissioner jerked his chair closer to birnam and grabbed the ganymedan s wrist .   why can t we bombard jupiter with atomic bombs .  give it a thorough going over  i mean .  with her gravity  and her surface area  we can t miss .    birnam smiled faintly   we ve thought of that .  but atomic bombs would merely tear holes in the atmosphere .  and even if you could penetrate  just divide the surface of jupiter by the area of damage of a single bomb and find how many years we must bombard jupiter at the rate of a bomb a minute before we begin to do significant damage .  jupiter s big .  don t ever forget that .    his cigar had gone out  but he did not pause to relight .  he continued in a low  tense voice .   no  we can t attack the jovians as long as they re on jupiter .  we must wait for them to come out   and once they do  they re going to have the edge on us in numbers .  a terrific  heart breaking edge   so we ll just have to have the edge on them in science .     but   orloff broke in  and there was a note of fascinated horror in his voice   how can we tell in advance what they ll have .     we can t .  we ve got to scrape up everything we can lay our hands on and hope for the best .  but there s one thing we do know they ll have and that s force fields .  they can t get out without them .  and if they have them  we must  too  and that s the problem we re trying to solve here .  they will not insure us victory  but without them  we will suffer certain defeat .  and now you know why we need money   and more than that .  we want earth itself to get to work .  it s got to start a drive for scientific armaments and subordinate everything to that .  you see .    orloff was on his feet .   birnam  i m with you   a hundred percent with you .  you can count on me back in washington .    there was no mistaking his sincerity .  birnam gripped the hand outstretched toward him and wrung it   and at the moment  the door flew open and a little pixie of a man hurtled in .   the newcomer spoke in rapid jerks  and exclusively to birnam .   where d you come from .  been trying to get in touch with you .  secretary said you weren t in .  then five minutes later you show up on your own .  can t understand it .   he busied himself furiously at his desk .   birnam grinned .   if you ll take time out  doc  you might say hello to colonial commissioner orloff .    dr .  edward prosser turned on his toe like a ballet dancer and  looked the earthman up and down twice .  the new un  hey .  we getting any money .  we ought to .  been working on a shoestring ever since .  at that  we might not be needing any .  it depends .   he was back at the desk .   orloff seemed a trifle disconcerted  but birnam winked impressively  and he contented himself with a glassy stare through the monocle .   prosser pounced upon a black leather booklet in the recesses of a pigeonhole  threw himself into his swivel chair and wheeled about .    glad you came  birnam   he said  leafing through the booklet .   got something to show you .  commissioner orloff  too .     what were you keeping us waiting for .   demanded birnam .   where were you .     busy .  busy as a pig .  no sleep for three nights .   he looked up  and his small puckered face fairly flushed with delight .   everything fell into place of a sudden .  like a jig saw puzzle .  never saw anything like it .  kept us hopping  i tell you .     you ve gotten the dense force fields you re after .   asked orloff in sudden excitement .   prosser seemed annoyed .   no  not that .  something else .  come on .   he glared at his watch and jumped out of his seat .   we ve got half an hour .  let s go .    an electric motored flivver waited outside and prosser spoke excitedly as he sped the purring vehicle down the ramps into the depths of the station .    theory .   he said .   theory .  damned important  that .  you set a technician on a problem .  he ll fool around .  waste lifetimes .  get nowhere .  just putter about at random .  a true scientist works with theory .  lets math solve his problems .   he overflowed with self satisfaction .   the flivver stopped on a dime before a huge double door and prosser tumbled out  followed by the other two at a more leisurely pace .    through here .  through here .   he said .  he shoved the door open and led them down the corridor and up a narrow flight of stairs onto a wall hugging passageway that circled a huge three level room .  orloff recognized the gleaming quartz and steel pipe sprouting ellipsoid two levels below as an atomic generator .   he adjusted his monocle and watched the scurrying activity below .  an earphoned man on a high stool before a control board studded with dials looked up and waved .  prosser waved back and grinned .   orloff said   you create your force fields here .     that s right .  ever see one .     no .   the commissioner smiled  ruefully .   i don t even know what one is  except that it can be used as a meteor shield .    prosser said   it s very simple .  elementary matter .  all matter is composed of atoms .  atoms are held together by interatomic forces .  take away atoms .  leave interatomic forces behind .  that s a force field .    orloff looked blank  and birnam chuckled deep in his throat and scratched the back of his ear .    that explanation reminds me of our ganymedan method of suspending an egg a mile high in the air .  it goes like this .  you find a mountain just a mile high and put the egg on top .  then  keeping the egg where it is  you take the mountain way .  that s all .    the colonial commissioner threw his head back to laugh  and the irascible dr .  prosser puckered his lips in a pursed symbol of disapproval .    come  come .  no joke  you know .  force fields most important .  got to be ready for the jovians when they come .    a sudden rasping bur from below sent prosser back from the railing .    get behind screen here   he babbled .   the twenty millimeter field is going up .  bad radiation .    the bur muted almost into silence  and the three walked out onto the passageway again .  there was no apparent change  but prosser shoved his hand out over the railing and said    feel .    orloff extended a cautious finger  gasped  and slapped out with the palm of his hand .  it was like pushing against very soft sponge rubber or superresilient steel springs .   birnam tried  too .   that s better than anything we ve done yet  isn t it .   he explained to orloff   a twenty millimeter screen is one that can hold an atmosphere of a pressure of twenty millimeters of mercury against a vacuum without appreciable leakage .    the commissioner nodded   i see .  you d need a seven hundred sixty millimeter screen to hold earth s atmosphere then .     yes .  that would be a unit atmosphere screen .  well  prosser  is this what got you excited .     this twenty millimeter screen .  of course not .  i can go up to two hundred fifty millimeters using the activated vanadium pentasulphide in the praseodymium breakdown .  but it s not necessary .  technician would do it and blow up the place .  scientist checks on theory and goes slow   he winked .   we re hardening the field now .  watch .     shall we get behind the screen .     not necessary now .  radiation bad only at beginning .    the burring waxed again  but not as loudly as before .  prosser shouted to the man at the control board  and a spreading wave of the hand was the only reply .   then the control man waved a clenched fist and prosser cried   we ve passed fifty millimeters .  feel the field .    orloff extended his hand and poked it curiously .  the sponge rubber had hardened .  he tried to pinch it between finger and thumb so perfect was the illusion  but here the  rubber  faded to unresisting air .   prosser tch tched impatiently .   no resistance at right angles to force .  elementary mechanics  that is .    the control man was gesturing again .    past seventy   explained prosser .   we re slowing down now .  critical point is       .    he hung over the railing and kicked out with his feet at the other two .   stay away .  dangerous .    and then he yelled   careful .  the generator s bucking .    the bur had risen to a hoarse maximum and the control man worked frantically at his switches .  from within the quartz heart of the central atomic generator  the sullen red glow of the bursting atoms had brightened dangerously .   there was a break in the bur  a reverberant roar and a blast of air that threw orloff hard against the wall .   prosser dashed up .  there was a cut over his eye .   hurt .  no .  good  good .  i was expecting something of the sort .  should have warned you .  let s go down .  where s birnam .    the tall ganymedan picked himself up off the floor and brushed at his clothes .   here i am .  what blew up .     nothing blew up .  something buckled .  come on  down we go .   he dabbed at  his forehead with a handkerchief and led the way downward .   the control man removed his earphones as he approached and got off his stool .  he looked tired  and his dirt smeared face was greasy with perspiration .    the damn thing started going at    .    boss .  it almost caught me .     it did  did it .   growled prosser .   within limits of error  isn t it .  how s the generator .  hey  stoddard .    the technician addressed replied from his station at the generator   tube   died .  it ll take two days to replace .    prosser turned in satisfaction and said   it worked .  went exactly as presumed .  problem solved  gentlemen .  trouble over .  let s get back to my office .  i want to eat .  and then i want to sleep .    he did not refer to the subject again until once more behind the desk in his office  and then he spoke between huge bites of a liver and onion sandwich .   he addressed birnam   remember the work on space strain last june .  it flopped  but we kept at it .  finch got a lead last week and i developed it .  everything fell into place .  slick as goose grease .  never saw anything like it .     go ahead   said birnam  calmly .  he knew prosser sufficiently well to avoid showing impatience .    you saw what happened .  when a field tops    .    millimeters  it becomes unstable .  space won t stand the strain .  it buckles and the field blows .  boom .    birnam s mouth dropped open and the arms of orloff s chair creaked under sudden pressure .  silence for a while  and then birnam said unsteadily   you mean force fields stronger than that are impossible .     they re possible .  you can create them .  but the denser they are  the more unstable they are .  if i had turned on the two hundred and fifty millimeter field  it would have lasted one tenth of a second .  then  blooie .  would have blown up the station .  and myself .  technician would have done it .  scientist is warned by theory .  works carefully  the way i did .  no harm done .    orloff tucked his monocle into his vest pocket and said tremulously   but if a force field is the same thing as interatomic forces  why is it that steel has such a strong interatomic binding force without bucking space .  there s a flaw there .    prosser eyed him in annoyance .   no flaw .  critical strength depends on number of generators .  in steel  each atom is a force field generator .  that means about three hundred billion trillion generators for every ounce of matter .  if we could use that many    as it is  one hundred generators would be the practical limit .  that only raises the critical point to ninety seven or thereabout .    he got to his feet and continued with sudden fervor   no .  problem s over  i tell you .  absolutely impossible to create a force field capable of holding earth s atmosphere for more than a hundredth of a second .  jovian atmosphere entirely out of question .  cold figures say that  backed by experiment .  space won t stand it .    let the jovians do their damnedest .  they can t get out .  that s final .  that s final .  that s final .    orloff said   mr .  secretary  can i send a spacegram anywhere in the station .  i want to tell earth that i m returning by the next ship and that the jovian problem is liquidated   entirely and for good .    birnam said nothing  but the relief on his face as he shook hands with the colonial commissioner  transfigured the gaunt homeliness of it unbelievably .   and dr .  prosser repeated  with a birdlike jerk of his head   that s final .    hal tuttle looked up as captain everett of the spaceship transparent  newest ship of the comet space lines  entered his private observation room in the nose of the ship .   the captain said   a spacegram has just reached me from the home offices at tucson .  we re to pick up colonel commissioner orloff at jovopolis  ganymede  and take him back to earth .     good .  we haven t sighted any ships .     no  no .  we re way off the regular space lanes .  the first the system will know of us will be the landing of the transparent on ganymede .  it will be the greatest thing in space travel since the first trip to the moon .   his voice softened suddenly   what s wrong  hal .  this is your triumph  after all .    hal tuttle looked up and out into the blackness of space .   i suppose it is .  ten years of work  sam .  i lost an arm and an eye in that first explosion  but i don t regret them .  it s the reaction that s got me .  the problem is solved  my lifework is finished .     so is every steel hulled ship in the system .    tuttle smiled .   yes .  it s hard to realize  isn t it .   he gestured outward .   you see the stars .  part of the time  there s nothing between them and us .  it gives me a queazy feeling .   his voice brooded   nine years i worked for nothing .  i wasn t a theoretician  and never really knew where i was headed  just tried everything .  i tried a little too hard and space wouldn t stand it .  i paid an arm and an eye and started fresh .    captain everett balled his fist and pounded the hull   the hull through which the stars shone unobstructed .  there was the muffled thud of flesh striking an unyielding surface   but no response whatever from the invisible wall .   tuttle nodded   it s solid enough  now   though it flicks on and off eight hundred thousand times a second .  i got the idea from the stroboscopic lamp .  you know them   they flash on and off so rapidly that it gives all the impression of steady illumination .    and so it is with the hull .  it s not on long enough to buckle space .  it s not off long enough to allow appreciable leakage of the atmosphere .  and the net effect is a strength better than steel .    he paused and added slowly   and there s no telling how far we can go .  speed up the intermission effect .  have the field flick off and on millions of times per second   billions of times .  you can get fields strong enough to hold an atomic explosion .  my lifework .    captain everett pounded the other s shoulder .   snap out of it  man .  think of the landing on ganymede .  the devil .  it will be great publicity .  think of orloff s face  for instance  when he finds he is to be the first passenger in history ever to travel in a spaceship with a force field hull .  how do you suppose he ll feel .    hal tuttle shrugged .   i imagine he ll be rather pleased .    the end    with  not final .   i completed my third year as a writer  three years since my initial trip to campbell s office .  in that time i had earned just a hair short of a thousand dollars  not as bad as it sounds in days when college tuition was only four hundred dollars a year  and i had about a quarter of that in my savings account .   still  you can see that there was nothing in that financial record to lead me to think that writing was a possible way of making a living   especially since i had no dream of ever writing anything but magazine science fiction .   on june           in the course of a talk with fred pohl  i mentioned my frustration at not being able to make a sale to unknown .  fred said he had a good idea for a fantasy  and from that it was a short step to an agreement to go halfies .  we d talk the idea over  i would write it  and we d split the sale  if any  fifty fifty .   fred must have been willing because  as i found out three days later  his magazines were doing poorly and he was being relieved of his editorial position .   it was too bad  of course  but not an irredeemable catastrophe .  pohl had had nearly two years of valuable editorial experience  and the time would come when this would stand him in good stead in a much more important and longer enduring role as editor of galaxy  which during the     s and     s was to compete with astounding for leadership in the field .   as for myself  i could scarcely complain .  pohl had accepted eight of my stories  over a quarter of those i had written and nearly half of those i had sold up to then  .  of these  six had already been published and one   super neutron   was safely slated for publication in the forthcoming issue of astonishing .  that left the ninth   christmas on ganymede .   it was not yet paid for  nor had it actually been set in type  and  regretfully  pohl had to return it .  however  i sold it within two weeks to thrilling wonder stories for a little more than pohl would have been able to pay me  so no harm was done even there .   and though i regretted the loss of a market  pohl had safely seen me through the period during which i developed to the point where campbell and astounding itself could become my major market .   at first  when  christmas on ganymede  was returned  i thought it was because the pohl magazines had been suspended altogether .  if the publishers had intended that  they changed their minds .  astonishing continued a couple of years  until it was killed by the world war ii paper shortage .  super science stones survived world war ii and even a little past the     s  and was yet to publish one more story of mine .   but back to june       taking fred s fantasy idea  i wrote the story entirely on my own  calling it  legal rights .   once again  though  a collaboration didn t succeed .  on july    campbell rejected it  the first rejection i had received from him in half a year .   by that time  though  fred was agenting again .  i gave him the story  rather shamefacedly  and forgot about it .  he changed the name to  legal rites   much better  and rewrote it quite a bit .  seven years later  he actually sold it .            legal rites  with james maccreigh      already the stars were out  though the sun had just dipped under the horizon  and the sky of the west was a blood stuck gold behind the sierra nevadas .    hey .   squawked russell harley .   come back .    but the one lunged motor of the old ford was making too much noise  the driver didn t hear him .  harley cursed as he watched the old car careen along the sandy ruts on its half flat tires .  its taillight was saying a red no to him .  no  you can t get away tonight  no  you ll have to stay here and fight it out .   harley grunted and climbed back up the porch stairs of the old wooden house .  it was well made  anyhow .  the stairs  though half a century old  neither creaked beneath him nor showed cracks .   harley picked up the bags he d dropped when he experienced his abrupt change of mind   fake leather and worn out  they were   and carted them into the house .  he dumped them on a dust jacketed sofa and looked around .   it was stifling hot  and the smell of the desert outside had permeated the room .  harley sneezed .    water   he said out loud .   that s what i need .    he d prowled through every room on the ground floor before he stopped still and smote his head .  plumbing   naturally there d be no plumbing in this hole eight miles out on the desert .  a well was the best he could hope for      if that .   it was getting dark .  no electric lights either  of course .  he blundered irritatedly through the dusky rooms to the back of the house .  the screen door shrieked metallically as he opened it .  a bucket hung by the door .  he picked it up  tipped it  shook the loose sand out of it .  he looked over the  back yard    about thirty thousand visible acres of hilly sand  rock and patches of  sage and flame tipped ocotillo .   no well .   the old fool got water from somewhere  he thought savagely .  obstinately he climbed down the back steps and wandered out into the desert .  overhead the stars were blinding  a million million of them  but the sunset was over already and he could see only hazily .  the silence was murderous .  only a faint whisper of breeze over the sand  and the slither of his shoes .   he caught a glimmer of starlight from the nearest clump of sage and walked to it .  there was a pool of water  caught in the angle of two enormous boulders .  he stared at it doubtfully  then shrugged .  it was water .  it was better than nothing .  he dipped the bucket in the little pool .  knowing nothing of the procedure  he filled it with a quart of loose sand as he scooped it along the bottom when he lifted it  brimful  to his lips  he spat out the first mouthful and swore violently .   then he used his head .  he set the bucket down  waited a   second for the sand grains to settle  cupped water in his hands   lifted it to his lips  pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss       what the hell .   harley stood up  looked around in abrupt puzzlement .  it sounded like water dripping from somewhere  onto a red hot stove  flashing into sizzling steam .  he saw nothing  only the sand and the sage and the pool of tepid  sickly water .   pat .  hiss      then he saw it  and his eyes bulged .  out of nowhere it was dripping  a drop a second  a sticky  dark drop that was thicker than water  that fell to the ground lazily  in slow defiance of gravity .  and when it struck each drop sizzled and skittered about  and vanished .  it was perhaps eight feet from him  just visible in the starlight .   and then   get off my land .   said the voice from nowhere .   harley got .  by the time he got to rebel butte three hours later  he was barely managing to walk  wishing desperately that he d delayed long enough for one more good drink of water  despite all the fiends of hell .  but he d run the first three miles .  he d had plenty of encouragement .  he remembered with a shudder how the clear desert air had taken milky shape around the incredible trickle of dampness and had advanced on him theateningly .   and when he got to the first kerosene lighted saloon of rebel butte  and staggered inside  the saloonkeeper s fascinated stare at the front of his shoddy coat showed him strong evidence that he hadn t been suddenly taken with insanity  or drunk on the unaccustomed sensation of fresh desert air .  all down the front of him it was  and the harder he rubbed the harder it stayed  the stickier it got .  blood .    whiskey .   he said in a strangled voice  tottering to the bar .  he pulled a threadbare dollar bill from his pocket  flapped it onto the mahogany .   the blackjack game at the back of the room had stopped .  harley was acutely conscious of the eyes of the players  the bartender and the tall  lean man leaning on the bar .  all were watching him .   the bartender broke the spell .  he reached for a bottle behind him without looking at it  placed it on the counter before harley .  he poured a glass of water from a jug  set it down with a shot glass beside the bottle .    i could of told you that would happen   he said casually .   only you wouldn t of believed me .  you had to meet hank for yourself before you d believe he was there .    harley remembered his thirst and drained the glass of water  then poured himself a shot of the whiskey and swallowed it without waiting for the chaser to be refilled .  the whiskey felt good going down  almost good enough to stop his internal shakes .    what are you talking about .   he said finally .  he twisted his body and leaned forward across the bar to partly hide the stains on his coat .  the saloonkeeper laughed .    old hank   he said .   i knowed who you was right away  even before tom came back and told me where he d took you .  i knowed you was zeb harley s no good nephew  come to take harley hall an  sell it before he was cold in the grave .    the blackjack players were still watching him  russell harley saw .  only the lean man farther along the bar seemed to have dismissed him .  he was pouring himself another drink  quite occupied with his task .   harley flushed .   listen   he said   i didn t come in here for advice .  i wanted a drink .  i m paying for it .  keep your mouth out of this .    the saloonkeeper shrugged .  he turned his back and walked away to the blackjack table .  after a couple of seconds one of the players turned  too  and threw a card down .  the others followed suit .   harley was just getting set to swallow his pride and talk to the saloonkeeper again   he seemed to know something about what harley d been through  and might be helpful   when the lean man tapped his shoulder .  harley whirled and almost dropped his glass .  absorbed and jumpy  he hadn t seen him come up .    young man   said the lean one   my name s nicholls .  come along with me  sir  and we ll talk this thing over .  i think we may be of service to each other .    even the twelve cylinder car nicholls drove jounced like a hay wagon over the sandy ruts leading to the place old zeb had   laughingly   named  harley hall .    russell harley twisted his neck and stared at the heap of paraphernalia in the open rumble seat .   i don t like it   he complained .   i never had anything to do with ghosts .  how do i know this stuff ll work .    nicholls smiled .   you ll have to take my word for it .  i ve had dealings with ghosts before .  you could say that i might qualify as a ghost exterminator  if i chose .    harley growled .   i still don t like it .    nicholls turned a sharp look on him .   you like the prospect of owning harley hall  don t you .  and looking for all the money your late uncle is supposed to have hidden around somewhere .   harley shrugged .   certainly you do   said nicholls  returning his eyes to the road .   and with good reason .  the local reports put the figure pretty high  young man .     that s where you come in  i guess   harley said sullenly .   i find the money   that i own anyhow   and give some of it to you .  how much .     we ll discuss that later   nicholls said .  he smiled absently as he looked ahead .    we ll discuss it right now .    the smile faded from nicholls  face .   no   he said .   we won t .  i m doing you a favor  young harley .  remember that .  in return   you ll do as i say  all the way .    harley digested that carefully  and it was not a pleasant meal .  he waited a couple of seconds before he changed the subject .    i was out here once when the old man was alive   he said .   he didn t say nothing about any ghost .     perhaps he felt you might think him   well  peculiar   nicholls said .   and perhaps you would have .  when were you here .     oh  a long time ago   harley said evasively .   but i was here a whole day  and part of the night .  the old man was crazy as a coot  but he didn t keep any ghosts in the attic .     this ghost was a friend of his   nicholls said .  the gentleman in charge of the bar told you that  surely .  your late uncle was something of a recluse .  he lived in this house a dozen miles from nowhere  came into town hardly ever  wouldn t let anyone get friendly with him .  but he wasn t exactly a hermit .  he had hank for company .     fine company .    nicholls inclined his head seriously .   oh  i don t know   he said .   from all accounts  they got on well together .  they played pinochle and chess   hank s supposed to have been a great pinochle player .  he was killed that way  according to the local reports .  caught somebody dealing from the bottom and shot it out with him .  he lost .  a bullet pierced his throat and he died quite bloodily .   he turned the wheel  putting his weight into the effort  and succeeded in twisting the car out of the ruts of the  road   sent it jouncing across unmarked sand to the old frame house to which they were going .    that   he finished as he pulled up before the porch   accounts for the blood that accompanies his apparition .    harley opened the door slowly and got out  looking uneasily at the battered old house .  nicholls cut the motor  got out and walked at once to the back of the car .      come on   he said  dragging things out of the compartment .   give me a hand with this .  i m not going to carry this stuff all by myself .    harley came around reluctantly  regarded the curious assortment of bundles of dried faggots  lengths of colored cord  chalk pencils  ugly little bunches of wilted weeds  bleached bones of small animals and a couple of less pleasant things without pleasure .   pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss       he s here .   harley yelped .   listen .  he s someplace around here watching us .     ha .    the laugh was deep  unpleasant and   bodiless .  harley looked around desperately for the tell tale trickle of blood .  and he found it  from the air it issued  just beside the car  sinking gracefully to the ground and sizzling  vanishing  there .    i m watching you  all right   the voice said grimly .   russell  you worthless piece of corruption  i ve got no more use for you than you used to have for me .  dead or alive  this is my land .  i shared it with your uncle  you young scalawag  but i won t share it with you .  get out .    harley s knees weakened and he tottered dizzily to the rear bumper  sat on it .   nicholls      he said confusedly .    oh  brace up   nicholls said with irritation .  he tossed a ball of gaudy twine  red and green  with curious knots tied along it  to harley .  then he confronted the trickle of blood and made a few brisk passes in the air before it .  his lips were moving silently  harley saw  but no words came out  there was a gasp and a chopped off squawk from the source of the blood drops .  nicholls clapped his hands sharply  then turned to young harley .   take that cord you have in your hands and stretch it around the house   he said .   all the way around  and make sure it goes right across the middle of the doors and windows .  it isn t much  but it ll hold him till we can get the good stuff set up .    harley nodded  then pointed a rigid finger at the drops of blood  now sizzling and fuming more angrily than before .   what about that .   he managed to get out .   nicholls grinned complacently .   i ll hold him here till the cows come home   he said   get moving .    harley inadvertently inhaled a lungful of noxious white smoke and coughed till the tears rolled down his cheeks .  when he recovered he looked at nicholls  who was reading silently from a green leather book with dog eared pages .  he said   can i stop stirring this now .    nicholls grimaced angrily and shook his head without looking at him .  he went on reading  his lips contorting over syllables that were not in any language harley had ever heard  then snapped the book shut and wiped his brow .    fine   he said .   so far  so good .   he stepped over to windward of the boiling pot harley was stirring on the hob over the fireplace  peered down into it cautiously .   that s about done   he said .   take it off the fire and let it cool a bit .    harley lifted it down  then squeezed his aching biceps with his left hand .  the stuff was the consistency of sickly green fudge .    now what .   he asked .   nicholls didn t answer .  he looked up in mild surprise at the sudden squawk of triumph from outside  followed by the howling of a chill wind .    hank must be loose   he said casually .   he can t do us any harm  i think  but we d better get a move on .   he rummaged in the dwindled pile of junk he d brought from the car  extracted a paintbrush .   smear this stuff around all the windows and doors .  all but the front door .  for that i have something else .   he pointed to what seemed to be the front axle of an old model t .   leave that on the doorsill .  cold iron .  you can just step over it  but hank won t be able to pass it .  it s been properly treated already with the very best thaumaturgy .     step over it   harley repeated .   what would i want to step over it for .  he s out there .     he won t hurt you   said nicholls .   you will carry an amulet with you   that one  there   that will keep him away .  probably he couldn t really hurt you anyhow  being a low order ghost who can t materialize to any great density .  but just to take no chances  carry the amulet and don t stay out too long .  it won t hold him off forever  not for more than half an hour .  if you ever have to go out and stay for any length of time  tie that bundle of herbs around your neck .   nicholls smiled .   that s only for emergencies  though .  it works on the asafoe tida principle .  ghosts can t come anywhere near it   but you won t like it much yourself .  it has   ah   a rather definite odor .    he leaned gingerly over the pot again  sniffing .  he sneezed .    well  that s cool enough   he said .   before it hardens  get moving .  start spreading the stuff upstairs   and make sure you don t miss any windows .     what are you going to do .     i   said nicholls sharply   will be here .  start .    but he wasn t .  when harley finished his disagreeable task and came down  he called nicholls  name  but the man was gone .  harley stepped to the door and looked out  the car was gone  too .   he shrugged .   oh  well   he said  and began taking the dust cloths off the furniture .   somewhere within the cold  legal mind of lawyer turnbull  he weighed the comparative likeness of nightmare and insanity .   he stared at the plush chair facing him  noted with distinct uneasiness how the strangely weightless  strangely sourceless trickle of redness disappeared as it hit the floor  but left long  mud ochre streaks matted on the upholstery .  the sound was unpleasant  too  pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss      the voice continued impatiently   damn your human stupidity .  i may be a ghost  but heaven knows i m not trying to haunt you .  friend  you re not that important to me .  get this  i m here on business .    turnbull learned that you cannot wet dry lips with a dehydrated tongue .   legal business .     sure .  the fact that i was once killed by violence  and have to continue my existence on the astral plane  doesn t mean i ve lost my legal rights .  does it .    the lawyer shook his head in bafflement .  he said  this would be easier on me if you weren t invisible .  can t you do something about it .    there was a short pause .   well  i could materialize for a minute   the voice said .   it s hard work   damn hard  for me .  there are a lot of us astral entities that can do it easy as falling out of bed  but     well  if i have to i shall try to do it once .    there was a shimmering in the air above the armchair  and a milky  thin smoke condensed into an intangible seated figure .  turnbull took no delight in noting that  through the figure  the outlines of the chair were still hazily visible .  the figure thickened .  just as the features took form   just as turnbull s bulging eyes made out a prominent hooked nose and a crisp beard   it thinned and exploded with a soft pop .   the voice said weakly   i didn t think i was that bad .  i m way out of practice .  i guess that s the first daylight materialization i ve made in seventy five years .    the lawyer adjusted his rimless glasses and coughed .  hell s binges  he thought  the worst thing about this is that i m believing it .    oh  well   he said aloud .  then he hurried on before the visitor could take offense   just what did you want .  i m just a small town lawyer  you know .  my business is fairly routine       i know all about your business   the voice said .   you can handle my case   it s a land affair .  i want to sue russell harley .     harley .   turnbull fingered his cheeks .   any relation to zeb harley .     his nephew   and his heir  too .    turnbull nodded .   yes  i remember now .  my wife s folks live in rebel butte  and i ve been there .  quite a coincidence you should come to me       the voice laughed .   it was no coincidence   it said softly .    oh .   turnbull was silent for a second .  then   i see   he said .  he cast a shrewd glance at the chair .   lawsuits cost money  mr .    i don t think you mentioned your name .     hank jenkins   the voice prompted .   i know that .  would  let s see .  would six hundred and fifty dollars be sufficient .    turnbull swallowed .   i think so   he said in a relatively unemotional tone   relative to what he was thinking .    then suppose we call that your retainer .  i happen to have cached a considerable sum in gold when i was     that is to say  before i became an astral entity .  i m quite certain it hasn t been disturbed .  you will have to call it treasure trove  i guess  and give half of it to the state  but there s thirteen hundred dollars altogether .    turnbull nodded judiciously .   assuming we can locate your trove   he said   i think that would be quite satisfactory .   he leaned back in his chair and looked legal .  his aplomb had returned .   and half an hour later he said slowly   i ll take your case .    judge lawrence gimbel had always liked his job before .  but his thirteen honorable years on the bench lost their flavor for him as he grimaced wearily and reached for his gavel .  this case was far too confusing for his taste .   the clerk made his speech  and the packed courtroom sat down en masse .  gimbel held a hand briefly to his eyes before he spoke .    is the counsel for the plaintiff ready .     i am  your honor .   turnbull  alone at his table  rose and bowed .   the counsel for the defendant .     ready  your honor .   fred wilson snapped .  he looked with a hard flicker of interest at turnbull and his solitary table  then leaned over and whispered in russell harley s ear .  the youth nodded glumly  then shrugged .   gimbel said   i understand the attorneys for both sides have waived jury trial in this case of henry jenkins versus russell joseph harley .    both lawyers nodded .  gimbel continued   in view of the unusual nature of this case  i imagine it will prove necessary to conduct it with a certain amount of informality .  the sole purpose of this court is to arrive at the true facts at issue  and to deliver a verdict in accord with the laws pertaining to these facts .  i will not stand on ceremony .  nevertheless  i will not tolerate any disturbances or unnecessary irregularities .  the spectators will kindly remember that they are here on privilege .  any demonstration will result in the clearing of the court .    he looked severely at the white faces that gleamed unintelligently up at him .  he suppressed a sigh as he said   the counsel for the plaintiff will begin .    turnbull rose quickly to his feet  faced the judge .    your honor   he said   we propose to show that my client  henry jenkins  has been deprived of his just rights by the defendant .  mr .  jenkins  by virtue of a sustained residence of more than twenty years in the house located on route     eight miles north of the town of rebel butte  with the full knowledge of its legal owner  has acquired certain rights .  in legal terminology we define these as the rights of adverse possession .  the layman would call them common law rights   squatters  rights .    gimbel folded his hands and tried to relax .  squatters  rights   for a ghost .  he sighed  but listened attentively as turnbull went on .    upon the death of sebulon harley  the owner of the house involved   it is better known  perhaps  as harley hall   the defendant inherited title to the property .  we do not question his right to it .  but my client has an equity in harley hall  the right to free and full existence .  the defendant has forcefully evicted my client  by means which have caused my client great mental distress  and have even endangered his very existence .    gimbel nodded .  if the case only had a precedent somewhere .  .  .  but it hadn t  he remembered grimly the hours he d spent thumbing through all sorts of unlikely law books  looking for anything that might bear on the case .  it had been his better judgment that he throw the case out of court outright   a judge couldn t afford to have himself laughed at  not if he were ambitious .  and public laughter was about the only certainty there was to this case .  but wilson had put up such a fight that the judge s temper had taken over .  he never did like wilson  anyhow .    you may proceed with your witnesses   he said .   turnbull nodded .  to the clerk he said   call henry jenkins to the stand .    wilson was on his feet before the clerk opened his mouth .    objection .   he bellowed .   the so called henry jenkins cannot qualify as a witness .     why not .   demanded turnbull .    because he s dead .    the judge clutched his gavel with one hand  forehead with the other .  he banged on the desk to quieten the courtroom .   turnbull stood there  smiling .   naturally   he said   you ll have proof of that statement .    wilson snarled .   certainly .   he referred to his brief .   the so called henry jenkins is the ghost  spirit or specter of one hank jenkins  who prospected for gold in this territory a century ago .  he was killed by a bullet through the throat from the gun of one long tom cooper  and was declared legally dead on september          .  cooper was hanged for his murder .  no matter what hocus pocus you produce for evidence to the contrary now  that status of legal death remains completely valid .     what evidence have you of the identity of my client with this hank jenkins .   turnbull asked grimly .    do you deny it .    turnbull shrugged .   i deny nothing .  i m not being cross examined .  furthermore  the sole prerequisite of a witness is that he understand the value of an oath .  henry jenkins was tested by john quincy fitzjames  professor of psychology at the university of southern california .  the results   i have dr .  fitzjames  sworn statement of them here  which i will introduce as an exhibit   show clearly that my client s intelligence quotient is well above normal  and that a psychiatric examination discloses no important aberrations which would injure his validity as a witness .  i insist that my client be allowed to testify on his own behalf .     but he s dead .   squawked wilson .   he s invisible right now .     my client   said turnbull stiffly   is not present just now .  undoubtedly that accounts for what you term his invisibility .   he paused for the appreciative murmur that swept through the court .  things were breaking perfectly  he thought  smiling .   i have here another affidavit   he said .   it is signed by elihu james and terence macrae  who respectively head the departments of physics and biology at the same university .  it states that my client exhibits all the vital phenomena of life .  i am prepared to call all three of my expert witnesses to the stand  if necessary .    wilson scowled but said nothing  judge gimbel leaned forward .    i don t see how it is possible for me to refuse the plaintiff the right to testify   he said .   if the three experts who prepared these reports will testify on the stand to the facts contained in them  henry jenkins may then take the stand .    wilson sat down heavily .  the three experts spoke briefly  and dryly .  wilson put them through only the most formal of cross examinations .   the judge declared a brief recess .  in the corridor outside  wilson and his client lit cigarettes and looked unsympathetic ally at each other .    i feel like a fool   said russell harley .   bringing suit against a ghost .     the ghost brought the suit   wilson reminded him .   if only we d been able to hold fire for a couple more weeks  till another judge came on the bench  i could ve got this thing thrown right out of court .     well  why couldn t we wait .     because you were in such a damn hurry .   wilson said .   you and that idiot nicholls   so confident that it would never come to trial .    harley shrugged  and thought unhappily of their failure in completely exorcising the ghost of hank jenkins .  that had been a mess .  jenkins had somehow escaped from the charmed circle they d drawn around him  in which they d hoped to keep him till the trial was forfeited by non appearance .    that s another thing   said wilson .   where is nicholls .    harley shrugged again .   i dunno .  the last i saw of him was in your office .  he came around to see me right after the deputy slapped the show cause order on me at the house .  he brought me down  to you   said you d been recommended to him .  then you and him and i talked about the case for a while .  he went out  after he lent me a little money to help meet your retainer .  haven t seen him since .     i d like to know who recommended me to him   wilson said grimly .   i don t think he d ever recommend anybody else .  i don t like this case   and i don t much like you .    harley growled but said nothing .  he flung his cigarette away .  it tasted of the garbage that hung around his neck  everything did .  nicholls had told no lies when he said harley wouldn t much like the bundle of herbs that would ward off the ghost of old jenkins .  they smelled .   the court clerk was in the corridor  bawling something  and people were beginning to trickle back in .  harley and his attorney went with them .   when the trial had been resumed  the clerk said   henry jenkins .    wilson was on his feet at once .  he opened the door of the judge s chamber  said something in a low tone .  then he stepped back  as if to let someone through .   pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss      there was a concerted gasp from the spectators as the weirdly appearing trickle of blood moved slowly across the open space to the witness chair .  this was the ghost   the plaintiff in the most eminently absurd case in the history of jurisprudence .    all right  hank   turnbull whispered .   you ll have to materialize long enough to let the clerk swear you in .    the clerk drew back nervously at the pillar of milky fog that appeared before him  vaguely humanoid in shape .  a phantom hand  half transparent  reached out to touch the bible .  the clerk s voice shook as he administered the oath  and heard the response come from the heart of the cloudpillar .   the haze drifted into the witness chair  bent curiously at about hip height  and popped into nothingness .   the judge banged his gavel wildly .  the buzz of alarm that had arisen from the spectators died out .      i   ll warn you again   he declared   that unruliness will not be tolerated .  the counsel for the plaintiff may proceed .    turnbull walked to the witness chair and addressed its emptiness .    your name .     my name is henry jenkins .     your occupation .    there was a slight pause .   i have none .  i guess you d say i m retired .     mr .  jenkins  just what connections have you with the building referred to as harley hall .     i have occupied it for ninety years .     during this time  did you come to know the late zebulon harley  owner of the hall .     i knew zeb quite well .    turnbull nodded .   when did you make his acquaintance .   he asked .    in the spring of      .  zeb had just lost his wife .  after that  you see  he made harley hall his year round home .  he became   well  more or less of a hermit .  before that we had never met  since he was only seldom at the hall .  but we became friendly then .     how long did this friendship last .     until he died last fall .  i was with him when he died .  i still have a few keepsakes he left me then .   there was a distinct nostalgic sigh from the witness chair  which by now was liberally spattered with muddy red liquid .  the falling drops seemed to hesitate for a second  and their sizzling noise was muted as with a strong emotion .   turnbull went on   your relations with  him were good  then .     i d call them excellent   the emptiness replied firmly .   every night we sat up together .  when we didn t play pinochle or chess or cribbage  we just sat and talked over the news of the day .  i still have the book we used to keep records of the chess and pinochle games .  zeb made the entries himself  in his own handwriting .    turnbull abandoned the witness for a moment .  he faced the judge with a smile .   i offer in evidence   he said   the book mentioned .  also a ring given to the plaintiff by the late mr .  harley  and a copy of the plays of gilbert and sullivan .  on the flyleaf of this book is inscribed   to old hank   in harley s own hand .    he turned again to the empty  blood leaking witness chair .   he said   in all your years of association  did zebulon harley ever ask you to leave  or to pay rent .    of course not .  not zeb .    turnbull nodded .   very good   he said .   now  just one or two more questions .  will you tell in your own words what occurred  after the death of zebulon harley  that caused you to bring this suit .     well  in january young harley        you mean russell joseph harley  the defendant .     yes .  he arrived at harley hall on january fifth .  i asked him to leave  which he did .  on the next day he returned with another man .  they placed a talisman upon the threshold of the main entrance  and soon after sealed every threshold and windowsill in the hall with a substance which is noxious to me .  these activities were accompanied by several of the most deadly spells in the ars magicorum .  he further added an exclusion circle with a radius of a little over a mile  entirely surrounding the hall .     i see   the lawyer said .   will you explain to the court the effects of these activities .     well   the voice said thoughtfully   it s a little hard to put in words .  i can t pass the circle without a great expenditure of energy .  even if i did i couldn t enter the building because of the talisman and the seals .     could you enter by air .  through a chimney  perhaps .     no .  the exclusion circle is really a sphere .  i m pretty sure the effort would destroy me .     in effect  then  you are entirely barred from the house you have occupied for ninety years  due to the wilful acts of russell joseph harley  the defendant  and an unnamed accomplice of his .     that is correct .    turnbull beamed .   thank you .  that s all .    he turned to wilson  whose face had been a study in dourness throughout the entire examination .   your witness   he said .   wilson snapped to his feet and strode to the witness chair .   he said belligerently   you say your name is henry jenkins .     yes .       that is your name now  you mean to say .  what was your name before .     before .   there was surprise in the voice that emanated from above the trickling blood drops .   before when .    wilson scowled .   don t pretend ignorance   he said sharply .   before you died  of course .     objection .   turnbull was on his feet  glaring at wilson .  the counsel for the defense has no right to speak of some hypothetical death of my client .    gimbel raised a hand wearily and cut off the words that were forming on wilson s lips .   objection sustained   he said .   no evidence has been presented to identify the plaintiff as the prospector who was killed in        or anyone else .    wilson s mouth twisted into a sour grimace .  he continued on a lower key .    you say  mr .  jenkins  that you occupied harley hall for ninety years .     ninety two years next month .  the hall wasn t built   in its present form  anyhow   until       but i occupied the house that stood on the site previously .     what did you do before then .     before then .   the voice paused  then said doubtfully   i don t remember .     you re under oath .   wilson flared .   the voice got firmer .   ninety years is a long time   it said .   i don t remember .       let s see if i can t refresh your memory .  is it true that ninety one years ago  in the very year in which you claim to have begun your occupancy of harley hall  hank jenkins was killed in a gun duel .     that may be true  if you say so .  i don t remember .     do you remember that the shooting occurred not fifty feet from the present site of harley hall .     it may be .     well  then   wilson thundered   is it not a fact that when hank jenkins died by violence his ghost assumed existence .  that it was then doomed to haunt the site of its slaying throughout eternity .    the voice said evenly   i have no knowledge of that .     do you deny that it is well known throughout that section that the ghost of hank jenkins haunts harley hall .     objection .   shouted turnbull .   popular opinion is not evidence .     objection sustained .  strike the question from the record .    wilson  badgered  lost his control .  in a dangerously uneven voice  he said   perjury is a criminal offense .  mr .  jenkins  do you deny that you are the ghost of hank jenkins .    the tone was surprised .   why  certainly .     you are a ghost  aren t you .    stiffly   i m an entity on the astral plane .     that  i believe  is what is called a ghost .     i can t help what it s called .  i ve heard you called a lot of things .  is that proof .    there was a surge of laughter from the audience .  gimbel slammed his gavel down on the bench .    the witness   he said   will confine himself to answering questions .    wilson bellowed   in spite of what you say  it s true  isn t it  that you are merely the spirit of a human being who had died through violence .    the voice from above the blood drops retorted   i repeat that i am an entity of the astral plane .  i am not aware that i was ever a human being .    the lawyer turned an exasperated face to the bench .    your honor   he said   i ask that you instruct the witness to cease playing verbal hide and seek .  it is quite evident that the witness is a ghost  and that he is therefore the relict of some human being  ipso facto .  circumstantial evidence is strong that he is the ghost of the hank jenkins who was killed in      .  but this is a non essential point .  what is definite is that he is the ghost of someone who is dead  and hence is unqualified to act as witness .  i demand his testimony be stricken from the record .    turnbull spoke up at once .   will the counsel for the defense quote his authority for branding my client a ghost   in the face of my client s repeated declaration that he is an entity of the astral plane .  what is the legal definition of a ghost .    judge gimbel smiled .   counsel for the defense will proceed with the cross examination   he said .   wilson s face flushed dark purple .  he mopped his brow with a large bandanna  then glared at the dropping  sizzling trickle of blood .    whatever you are   he said   answer me this question .  can you pass through a wall .     why  yes .  certainly .   there was a definite note of surprise in the voice from nowhere .   but it isn t as easy as some people think .  it definitely requires a lot of effort .     never mind that .  you can do it .     yes .     could you be bound by any physical means .  would handcuffs hold you .  or ropes  chains  prison walls  a hermetically sealed steel chest .    jenkins had no chance to answer .  turnbull  scenting danger  cut in hastily .   i object to this line of questioning .  it is entirely irrelevant .     on the contrary   wilson cried loudly   it bears strongly on the qualifications of the so called henry jenkins as a witness .  i demand that he answer the question .    judge gimbel said   objection overruled .  witness will answer the question .    the voice from the chair said superciliously   i don t mind answering .  physical barriers mean nothing to me  by and large .    the counsel for the defense drew himself up triumphantly .    very good   he said with satisfaction .   very good .   then to the judge  the words coming sharp and fast   i claim  your honor  that the so called henry jenkins has no legal status as a witness in court .  there is clearly no value in understanding the nature of an oath if a violation of the oath can bring no punishment in its wake .  the statements of a man who can perjure himself freely have no worth .  i demand they be stricken from the record .    turnbull was at the judge s bench in two strides .    i had anticipated that  your honor   he said quickly .   from the very nature of the case  however  it is clear that my client can be very definitely restricted in his movements   spells  pentagrams  talismans  amulets  exclusion circles and whatnot .  i have here   which i am prepared to deliver to the bailiff of the court   a list of the various methods of confining an astral entity to a restricted area for periods ranging from a few moments to all eternity .  moreover  i have also signed a bond for five thousand dollars  prior to the beginning of the trial  which i stand ready to forfeit should my client be confined and make his escape  if found guilty of any misfeasance as a witness .    gimbel s face  which had looked startled for a second  slowly cleared .  he nodded .   the court is satisfied with the statement of the counsel for the plaintiff   he declared .   there seems no doubt that the plaintiff can be penalized for any mis statements  and the motion of the defense is denied .    wilson looked choleric  but shrugged .   all right   he said .  that will be all .     you may step down  mr .  jenkins   gimbel directed  and watched in fascination as the blood dripping column rose and floated over the floor  along the corridor  out the door .   turnbull approached the judge s bench again .  he said   i would like to place in evidence these notes  the diary of the late zebuloh harley .  it was presented to my client by harley himself last fall .  i call particular attention to the entry for april sixth  nineteen seventeen  in which he mentions the entrance of the united states into the first world war  and records the results of a series of eleven pinochle games played with a personage identified as  old hank .   with the court s permission  i will read the entry for that day  and also various other entries for the next four years .  please note the references to someone known variously as  jenkins    hank jenkins  and   in one extremely significant passage    old invisible .     wilson stewed silently during the slow reading of harley s diary .  there was anger on his face  but he paid close attention  and when the reading was over he leaped to his feet .    i would like to know   he asked   if the counsel for the plaintiff is in possession of any diaries after nineteen twenty .    turnbull shook his head .   harley apparently never kept a diary  except during the four years represented in this .    then i demand that the court refuse to admit this diary as evidence on two counts   wilson said .  he raised two fingers to tick off the points .   in the first place  the evidence presented is frivolous .  the few vague and unsatisfactory references to jenkins nowhere specifically describe him as what he is   ghost  astral entity or what you will .  second  the evidence  even were the first point overlooked  concerns only the years up to nineteen twenty one .  the case concerns itself only with the supposed occupation of harley hall by the so called jenkins in the last twenty years   since  twenty one .  clearly  the evidence is therefore irrelevant .    gimbel looked at turnbull  who smiled calmly .    the reference to  old invisible  is far from vague   he said .   it is a definite indication of the astral character of my client .  furthermore  evidence as to the friendship of my client with the late mr .  zebulon harley before nineteen twenty one is entirely relevant  as such a friendship  once established  would naturally be presumed to have continued indefinitely .  unless of course  the defense is able to present evidence to the contrary .    judge gimbel said   the diary is admitted as evidence .    turnbull said   i rest my case .    there was a buzz of conversation in the courtroom while the judge looked over the diary  and then handed it to the clerk to be marked and entered .   gimbel said   the defense may open its case .    wilson rose .  to the clerk he said   russell joseph harley .    but young harley was recalcitrant .   nix   he said  on his feet  pointing at the witness chair .   that thing s got blood all over it .  you don t expect me to sit down in that large puddle of blood  do you .    judge gimbel leaned over to look at the chair .  the drip drop trickle of blood from the apparition who d been testifying had left its mark .  muddy brown all down the front of the chair .  gimbel found himself wondering how the ghost managed to replenish its supply of the fluid  but gave it up .    i see your point   he said .   well  it s getting a bit late anyhow .  the clerk will take away the present witness chair and replace it .  in the interim  i declare the court recessed till tomorrow morning at ten o clock .    russell harley noticed how the elevator boy s back registered repulsion and disapproval  and scowled .  he was not a popular guest in the hotel  he knew well .  where he made his mistake  though  was in thinking that the noxious bundle of herbs about his neck was the cause of it .  his odious personality had a lot to do with the chilly attitude of the management and his fellow guests .   he made his way to the bar  ignoring the heads that turned in surprise to follow the reeking comet tail of his passage .  he entered the red leather and chromium drinking room  and stared about for lawyer wilson .   and blinked in surprise when he saw him .  wilson wasn t alone .  in the booth with him was a tall  dark figure  with his back to harley .  the back alone was plenty for recognition .  nicholls .   wilson had seen him .   hello  harley   he said  all smiles and affability in the presence of the man with the money .   come on and sit down .  mr .  nicholls dropped in on me a little while ago  so i brought him over .     hello   harley said glumly  and nicholls nodded .  the muscles of his cheeks pulsed  and he seemed under a strain  strangely uncomfortable in harley s presence .  still there was a twinkle in the look he gave young harley  and  . his voice was friendly enough   though supercilious   as he said    hello  harley .  how is the trial going .     ask him   said harley  pointing a thumb at wilson as he slid his knees under the booth s table and sat down .   he s the lawyer .  he s supposed to know these things .     doesn t he .    harley shrugged and craned his neck for the waitress .   oh  i guess so .  .  .  . rye and water .   he watched the girl appreciatively as she nodded and went off to the bar  then turned his attention back to nicholls .   the trouble is   he said   wilson may think he knows  but i think he s all wet .    wilson frowned .   do you imply     he began  but nicholls put up a hand .    let s not bicker   said nicholls .   suppose you answer my question .  i have a stake in this  and i want to know .  how s the trial going .    wilson put on his most open faced expression .  .   frankly   he said   not too well .  i m afraid the judge is on the other side .  if you d listened to me and stalled till another judge came along       i had no time to stall   said nicholls .   i have to be elsewhere within a few days .  even now  i should be on my way .  do you think we might lose the case .    harley laughed sharply .  as wilson glared at him he took his drink from the waitress  tray and swallowed it .  the smile remained on his face as he listened to wilson say smoothly    there is a good deal of danger  yes .     hum .   nicholls looked interestedly at his fingernails .   perhaps i chose the wrong lawyer .     sure you did .   harley waved at the waitress  ordered another drink .  you want to know what else i think .  i think you picked the wrong client  spelled s t o o g e .  i m getting sick of this .  this damn thing around my neck smells bad .  how do i know it s any good  anyhow .  far as i can see  it just smells bad  and that s all .     it works   nicholls said succinctly .   i wouldn t advise you to go without it .  the late hank jenkins is not a very strong ghost   a strong one would tear you apart and chew up your herbs for dessert   but without the protection of what you wear about your neck  you would become a very uncomfortable human as soon as jenkins heard you d stopped wearing it .      he put down the glass of red wine he d been inhaling without drinking  looked intently at wilson .   i ve put up the money in this   he said .   i had hoped you d be able to handle the legal end .  i see i ll have to do more .  now listen intently  because i have no intention of repeating this .  there s an angle to this case that s got right by your blunted legal acumen .  jenkins claims to be an astral entity  which he undoubtedly is .  now  instead of trying to prove him a ghost  and legally dead  and therefore unfit to testify  which you have been doing  suppose you do this .  .  .  .    he went on to speak rapidly and to the point .   and when he left them a bit later  and wilson took harley up to his room and poured him into bed  the lawyer felt happy for the first time in days .   russell joseph harley  a little hung over and a lot nervous  was called to the stand as first witness in his own behalf .   wilson said   your name .     russell joseph harley .     you are the nephew of the late zebulon harley  who bequeathed the residence known as harley hall to you .     yes .    wilson turned to the bench .   i offer this copy of the late mr .  zebulon harley s will in evidence .  all his possessions are left to his nephew and only living kin  the defendant .    turnbull spoke from his desk .  the plaintiff in no way disputes the defendant s equity in harley hall .    wilson continued   you passed part of your childhood in harley hall  did you not  and visited it as a grown man on occasion .     yes .     at any time  has anything in the shape of a ghost  specter or astral entity manifested itself to you in harley hall .     no .  i d remember it .     did your late uncle ever mention any such manifestation to you .     him .  no .    that s all .    turnbull came up for the cross examination .    when  mr .  harley  did you last see your uncle before his death .     it was in nineteen thirty eight .  in september  some time  around the tenth or eleventh of the month .     how long a time did you spend with him .    harley flushed unaccountably .   ah   just one day   he said .    when before that did you see him .     well  not since i was quite young .  my parents moved to pennsylvania in nineteen twenty .     and since then   except for that one day visit in nineteen thirty eight   has any communication passed between your uncle and yourself .     no  i guess not .  he was a rather queer duck   solitary .  a little bit balmy  i think .     well  you re a loving nephew .  but in view of what you ve just said  does it sound surprising that your uncle never told you of mr .  jenkins .  he never had much chance to  did he .     he had a chance in nineteen thirty eight  but he didn t .   harley said defiantly .   turnbull shrugged .   i m finished   he said .   gimbel began to look bored .  he had anticipated something more in the way of fireworks .  he said   has the defense any further witnesses .    wilson smiled grimly .   yes  your honor   he said .  this was his big moment  and he smiled again as he said gently   i would like to call mr .  henry jenkins to the stand .    in the amazed silence that followed  judge gimbel leaned forward .   you mean you wish to call the plaintiff as a witness for the defense .    serenely   yes  your honor .    gimbel grimaced   call henry jenkins   he said wearily to the clerk  and sank back in his chair .   turnbull was looking alarmed .  he bit his lip  trying to decide whether to object to this astonishing procedure  but finally shrugged as the clerk bawled out the ghost s name .   turnbull sped down the corridor  out the door .  his voice was heard in the anteroom  then he returned more slowly .  behind him came the trickle of blood drops  pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss       one moment   said gimbel  coming to life again .   i have no objection to your testifying  mr .  jenkins  but the state should not be subjected to the needless expense of reupholstering its witness chair every time you do .  bailiff  find some sort of a rug or something to throw over the chair before mr .  jenkins is sworn in .    a tarpaulin was hurriedly procured and adjusted to the chair  jenkins materialized long enough to be sworn in  then sat .   tell me  mr .  jenkins   he said   just how many  astral entities    i believe that is what you call yourself   are there .     i have no way of knowing .  many billions .     as many  in other words  as there have been human beings to die by violence .    turnbull rose to his feet in sudden agitation  but the ghost neatly evaded the trap .   i don t know .  i only know there are billions .    the lawyer s cat who ate canary smile remained undimmed .    and all these billions are constantly about us  everywhere  only remaining invisible .  is that it .     oh  no .  very few remain on earth .  of course  still fewer have anything to do with humans .  most humans are quite boring to us .     well  how many would you say are on earth .  a hundred thousand .     even more  maybe .  but that s a good guess .    turnbull interrupted suddenly .   i would like to know the significance of these questions .  i object to this whole line of questioning as being totally irrelevant .    wilson was a study in legal dignity .  he retorted   i am trying to elicijt some facts of major value  your honor .  this may change the entire character of the case .  i ask your patience for a moment or two .     counsel for the defense may continue   gimbel said curtly .   wilson showed his canines in a grin .  he continued to the blood dripping before him .   now  the contention of your counsel is that the late mr .  harley allowed an  astral entity  to occupy his home for twenty years or more  with his full knowledge and consent .  that strikes me as being entirely improbable  but shall we for the moment assume it to be the case .    certainly .  it s the truth .     then tell me  mr .  jenkins  have you fingers .     have i what .     you heard me .   wilson snapped .   have you fingers  flesh and blood fingers  capable of making an imprint .     why  no .  i      wilson rushed on .   or have you a photograph of yourself  or specimens of your handwriting   or any sort of material identification .  have you any of these .    the voice was definitely querulous .   what do you mean .    wilson s voice became harsh  menacing .   i mean  can you prove that you are the astral entity alleged to have occupied zebulon harley s home .  was it you   or was it another of the featureless  faceless  intangible unknowns   one of the hundreds of thousands of them that  by your own admission  are all over the face of the earth  rambling where they choose  not halted by any locks or bars .  can you prove that you are anyone in particular .     your honor .   turnbull s voice was almost a shriek as he found his feet at last .   my client s identity was never in question .     it is now .   roared wilson .   the opposing counsel has presented a personage whom he styles  henry jenkins .   who is this jenkins .  what is he .  is he even an individual   or a corporate aggregation of these mysterious  astral entities  which we are to believe are everywhere  but which we never see .  if he is an individual  is he the individual .  and how can we know that  even if he says he is .  let him produce evidence   photographs  a birth certificate  fingerprints .  let him bring in identifying witnesses who have known both ghosts  and are prepared to swear that these ghosts are the same ghost .  failing this  there is no case .  your honor  i demand the court declare an immediate judgment in favor of the defendant .    judge gimbel stared at turnbull .   have you anything to say .   he asked .   the argument of the defense would seem to have every merit with it .  unless you can produce some sort of evidence as to the identity of your client  i have no alternative but to find for the defense .    for a moment there was a silent tableau .  wilson triumphant  turnbull furiously frustrated .   how could you identify a ghost .   and then came the quietly amused voice from the witness chair .    this thing has gone far enough   it said above the sizzle and splatter of its own leaking blood .   i believe i can present proof that will satisfy the court .    wilson s face fell with express elevator speed .  turnbull held his breath  afraid to hope .   judge gimbel said   you are under oath .  proceed .    there was no other sound in the courtroom as the voice said   mr .  harley  here  spoke of a visit to his uncle in nineteen thirty eight .  i can vouch for that .  they spent a night and a day together .  they weren t alone .  i was there .    no one was watching russell harley  or they might have seen the sudden sick pallor that passed over his face .   the voice  relentless  went on .   perhaps i shouldn t have eavesdropped as i did  but old zeb never had any secrets from me anyhow .  i listened to what they talked about .  young harley was working for a bank in philadelphia at the time .  his first big job .  he needed money  and needed it bad .  there was a shortage in his department .  a woman named sally        hold on .   wilson yelled .   this has nothing to do with your identification of yourself .  keep to the point .    but turnbull had begun to comprehend .  he was shouting  too  almost too excited to be coherent .   your honor  my client must be allowed to speak .  if he shows knowledge of an intimate conversation between the late mr .  harley and the defendant  it would be certain proof that he enjoyed the late mr .  harley s confidence  and thus  q . e . d .   that he is no other than the astral entity who occupied harley hall for so long .    gimbel nodded sharply .   let me remind counsel for the defense that this is his own witness .  mr .  jenkins  continue .    the voice began again   as i was saying  the woman s name        shut up  damn you .   harley yelled .  he sprang upright  turned beseechingly toward the judge .   he is twisting it .  make him stop .  sure  i knew my uncle had a ghost .  he s it  all right  curse his black soul .  he can have the house if he wants it   i ll clear out .  i ll clear out of the whole damned state .    he broke off into babbling and turned about wildly .  only the intervention of a marshal kept him from hurtling out of the courtroom .   banging of the gavel and hard work by the court clerk and his staff restored order in the courtroom .  when the room had returned almost to normalcy  judge gimbel  perspiring and annoyed  said   as far as i am concerned  identification of the witness is complete .  has the defense any further evidence to present .    wilson shrugged morosely .   no  your honor .     counsel for the plaintiff .     nothing  your honor .  i rest my case .    gimbel plowed a hand through his sparse hair and blinked .   in that case   he said   i find for the plaintiff .  an order is entered hereby that the defendant  russell joseph harley  shall remove from the premises of harley hall all spells  pentagrams  talismans and other means of exorcism employed  that he shall cease and desist from making any attempts  of whatever nature  to evict the tenant in the future  and that henry jenkins  the plaintiff  shall be permitted the full use and occupancy of the premises designated as harley hall for the full term of his natural   ah   existence .   the gavel banged .   the case is closed .     don t take it so hard   said a mild voice behind russell harley .  he whirled surlily .  nicholls was coming up the street after him from the courthouse  wilson in tow .   nicholls said   you lost the case  but you ve still got your life .  let me buy you a drink .  in here  perhaps .    he herded them into a cocktail lounge  sat them down before they had a chance to object .  he glanced at his expensive wrist watch .   i have a few minutes   he said .   then i really must be off .  it s urgent .    he hailed a barman  ordered for all .  then he looked at young harley and smiled broadly as he dropped a bill on the counter to pay for the drinks .    harley   he said   i have a motto that you would do well to remember at times like these .  i ll make you a present of it  if you like .     what is it .      the worst is yet to come .     harley snarled and swallowed his drink without replying .  wilson said   what gets me is  why didn t they come to us before the trial with that stuff about this charmingly illicit client you wished on me .  we d have had to settle out of court .    nicholls shrugged .   they had their reasons   he said .   after all  one case of exorcism  more or less  doesn t matter .  but lawsuits set precedents .  you re a lawyer  of sorts  wilson  do you see what i mean .     precedents .   wilson looked at him slackjawed for a moment  then his eyes widened .    i see you understand me .   nicholls nodded .   from now on in this state   and by virtue of the full faith and credence clause of the constitution  in every state of the country   a ghost has a legal right to haunt a house .     good lord .   said wilson .  he began to laugh  not loud  but from the bottom of his chest .   harley stared at nicholls .   once and for all   he whispered   tell me   what s your angle on all this .    nicholls smiled again .    think about it a while   he said lightly .   you ll begin to understand .   he sniffed his wine once more  then sat the glass down gently      and vanished .   the end    as i ve mentioned before  i was never a reader of weird tales  and its type of fiction did not captivate me .  in       though  when  legal rites  finally appeared  weird tales was nearing the end of its thirty year road and i m rather glad i made its pages at least once before its end  even if only as half of a collaboration .  it was the longest story in the issue and it received the cover .    legal rites  and  the little man on the subway  are the only pieces of fiction i ever wrote in collaboration  and i didn t really enjoy the process .  later on in my career  i had occasion to collaborate on four or five non fiction books and never really enjoyed that either  nor were any of the collaborations successful .  i m essentially a loner and like to take full responsibility for what i write .   in the case of  legal rites  it seems to me that the beginning is mostly pohl s rewriting  the trial scene is mostly mine  the ending   i don t remember .   fantasy was not the only type of story i kept bullheadedly trying  over and over  without much success .  another type was the broadly farcical .  i never sold either type to campbell  but i at least sold the latter elsewhere .   even while i was writing  legal rites   i was working on another robot story  but a humorous one   or what i considered humor .  i called it  source of power  and at least knew better than to waste time trying it on campbell .  i sent it directly to thrilling wonder  and when it was rejected there  i tried amazing .   amazing bought it on october           my first sale to that magazine since those exciting beginning days of the fall of      .  when it appeared on the stands  two days after pearl harbor  in the february      issue  i found that amazing had retitled it  robot al    goes astray .    although  robot al    goes astray  was a  positronic robot  story  it didn t really fit in with the other three i had thus far written .  when i  robot  my first collection of  positronic robot  stories  was put together  in       i did not include  robot al    goes astray  in that volume .  when  however  in       the rest of the robots was put together  i felt honor bound by the title  if nothing else  to include all the remaining robot stories published till then  and therefore  robot al    goes astray  was included .   august           robot al    goes astray  was then still working its slow way through the typewriter  because the nazi invasion of the soviet union distracted me  was another important day in my writing career .  i went to see john campbell that day and  not liking to come to him without an idea  i thought hard on the subway ride there .   the fate of  pilgrimage   soon to become  black friar of the flame   was still rankling  and i wanted to write another future historical .  i therefore suggested to him that i do a short story against the background of the slow fall of the galactic empire  something i intended to model quite frankly on the fall of the roman empire  .   campbell caught fire .  we spent two hours together  and by the time it was over it was not going to be a short story at all  but an indefinitely long series of stories dealing with the fall of the first galactic empire and the rise of the second .   i submitted the first story of the series   foundation   to campbell on september          and it was accepted on the fifteenth .  it appeared in the may      issue of astounding .   over the next eight years i was to write seven more stories of what came to be called the  foundation  series  and these were finally collected into three volumes  foundation  foundation and empire  and second foundation  which collectively were called the foundation trilogy .   of all my science fiction  these books were most successful .  first published in            and       respectively  they have been in print constantly as hard covers ever since  despite the appearance of numerous soft cover editions .  and in       at the   th world science fiction convention  in cleveland  the  foundation  series received a hugo  science fiction s equivalent of the oscar  as the  best all time series .    after  foundation  i was ready to try a serious positronic robot story for the first time in half a year .  this one   run around   was submitted to campbell on october           and he accepted it on the twenty third .  it appeared in the march      issue of astounding and was eventually included in i  robot .   i then had to get to work at once on a sequel to  foundation .    foundation  had been brought to an inconclusive ending on the assumption that a sequel would be forthcoming  and i had to come through .  on november     the sequel   bridle and saddle   which was the second story of the  foundation  series  was submitted to campbell  and he accepted it the same day  a record in speed .  what s more  it was the longest story i had yet written   eighteen thousand words   and even though i received no bonus  the check  for       was the largest single check i had yet received .   bridle and saddle  was eventually included in foundation .   now  at last  i had a series of long stories going  together with my  positronic robot  series of short stories .  i was feeling quite good .   on november           the day i submitted and sold  bridle and saddle   campbell told me his plan for starting a new department in astounding  one to be called  probability zero .   this was to be a department of short shorts  five hundred to one thousand words  which were to be in the nature of plausible and entertaining munchausen like lies .  campbell s notion was that  aside from the entertainment value of these things  they would offer a place where beginners could penetrate the market without having to compete quite so hard with established writers .  it would form a stairway to professional status .   this was a good idea in theory and even worked a little .  ray bradbury  later to be one of the best known and successful of all science fiction writers  broke into the field with a  probability zero  item in the july      astounding .  hal clement and george o .  smith also published in  probability zero  near the very start of their careers .   unfortunately  it didn t work enough .  campbell had to start the department going with professionals  hoping to let the amateurs carry on once they saw what it was campbell wanted .  there were  however  never enough amateurs who could meet campbell s standards even for short shorts of an  undemanding nature  and after twelve appearances of  probability zero  over a space of two and a half years  campbell gave up .   on november     however  he was just beginning  and he wanted me to do a  probability zero  for him .  i was delighted that he considered me to be at that stage of virtuosity where he could order me to do something for him according to measure .  i promptly sat down and wrote a short short called  big game .   on november           i showed it to campbell .  he glanced over it and  rather to my astonishment  handed it back .  it wasn t what he wanted .   i wish i could remember what  big game  was about  for i thought enough of it to try submitting it to collier s magazine  an over awing slick  in        and it was  of course  rejected .  the title  however  recalls nothing to my mind  and the story now no longer exists .   i tried a second time and did a humorous little positronic robot story called  first law .   i showed it to campbell on december    and he didn t like that  either .  this time  though  i kept the story .  thank goodness  i had finally learned that stories must be carefully saved for eternity  however many times they are rejected  and however firmly you imagine they are retired .   big game  was the eleventh of my stories to disappear  but it was also the last .   in the case of  first law  there came a time when a magazine that did not exist in      was to ask me for something .  the magazine in question was fantastic universe  whose editor  hans stefan santesson  asked me for a story at rates that would have been fine in      but that by the mid     s i was reluctant to accept .  i remembered  first law   however  and sent it in .  santesson took it and ran it in the october      issue of fantastic universe  and  eventually  i included it in the rest of the robots .   but back to  probability zero       i tried a third time with a short story called  time pussy   which i wrote on the morning of sunday  december          finishing it just before the radio went crazy with the news of pearl harbor .  i brought it in to campbell the next day  life goes on .    and this time he took it  but  not too enthusiastically   according to my diary .            time pussy     this was told me long ago by old mac  who lived in a shack just over the hill from my old house .  he had been a mining prospector out in the asteroids during the rush of      and spent most of his time now in feeding his seven cats .    what makes you like cats so much  mr .  mac .   i asked him .   the old miner looked at me and scratched his chin .   well   he said   they reminds me o  my leetle pets on pallas .  they was something like cats   same kind of head  sort o    and the cleverest leetle fellers y  ever saw .  all dead .    i felt sorry and said so .  mac heaved a sigh .    cleverest leetle fellers   he repeated .  they was four dimensional pussies .     four dimensional  mr .  mac .  but the fourth dimension is time .   i had learned that the year before  in the third grade .    so you ve had a leetle schooling  hey .   he took out his pipe and filled it slowly .   sure  the fourth dimension is time .  these pussies was about a foot long and six inches high and four inches wide and stretched somewheres into middle o  next week .  that s four dimensions  ain t it .   why  if you petted their heads  they wouldn t wag their tails till next day  mebbe .  some o  the big ones wouldn t wag till day after .  fact .    i looked dubious  but didn t say anything .   mac went on   they was the best leetle watchdogs in all creation  too .  they had to be .  why  if they spotted a burglar or any suspicious character  they d shriek like a banshee .  and when one saw a burglar today  he d shriek yesterday  so we had twenty four hours  notice every time .    my mouth opened .   honest .     cross my heart .  y  want to know how we used to feed them .  we d wait for them to go to sleep  see  and then we d know they was busy digesting their meals .  these leetle time pussies  they always digested their meals exactly three hours before they ate it  on account their stomachs stretched that far back in time .  so when they went to sleep  we used the time  get their dinner ready and feed it to them exactly three hours later .    he had lit his pipe now and was puffing away .  he shook his head sadly .   once  though  i made a mistake .  poor leetle time pussy .  his name was joe  and he was just about my favorite  too .  he went to sleep one morning at nine and somehow i got the idea it was eight .  naturally  i brought him his feed at eleven .  i looked all over for him  but i couldn t find him .     what had happened  mr .  mac .     well  no time pussy s insides could be expected to handle his breakfast only two hours after digesting it .  it s too much to expect .  i found him finally under the tool kit in the outer shed .  he had crawled there and died of indigestion an hour before .  poor leetle feller .  after that  i always set an alarm  so i never made that mistake again .    there was a short  mournful silence after that  and i resumed in a respectful whisper   you said they all died  before .  were they all killed like that .    mac shook his head solemnly .   no .  they used to catch colds from us fellers and just die anywhere from a week to ten days before they caught them .  they wasn t too many to start with  and a year after the miners hit pallas they wasn t but about ten left and them ten sort o  weak and sickly .  the trouble was  leetle feller  that when they died  they went all to pieces  just rotted away fast .  especially the little four dimensional jigger they had in their brains which made them act the way they did .  it cost us all millions o  dollars .     how was that  mr .  mac .     y  see  some scientists back on earth got wind of our leetle time pussies  and they knew they d all be dead before they could get out there next conjunction .  so they offered us all a million dollars for each time pussy we preserved for them .     and did you .     well  we tried  but they wouldn t keep .  after they died  they were just no good any more  and we had to bury them .  we tried packing them in ice  but that only kept the outside all right .  the inside was a nasty mess  and it was the inside the scientists wanted .    naturally  with each dead time pussy costing us a million dollars  we didn t want that to happen .  one of us figured out that if we put a time pussy into hot water when it was about to die  the water would soak all through it .  then  after it died  we could freeze the water so it would just be one solid chunk o  ice  and then it would keep .    my lower jaw was sagging .   did it work .     we tried and we tried  son  but we just couldn t freeze the water fast enough .  by the time we had it all iced  the four dimensional jigger in the time pussy s brain had just corrupted away .  we froze the water faster and faster but it was no go .  finally  we had only one time pussy left  and he was just fixing to die  too .  we was desperate   and then one of the fellers thought o  something .  he figured out a complicated contraption that would freeze all the water just like that   in a split second .    we picked up the last leetle feller and put him into the hot water and hooked on the machine .  the leetle feller gave us a last look and made a funny leetle sound and died .  we pressed the button and iced the whole thing into a solid block in about a quarter of a second .   here mac heaved a sigh that must have weighed a ton .   but it was no use .  the time pussy spoiled inside o  fifteen minutes and we lost the last million dollars .    i caught my breath .   but mr .  mac  you just said you iced the time pussy in a quarter of a second .  it didn t have time to spoil .     that s just it  leetle feller   he said heavily .   we did it too doggoned fast .  the time pussy didn t keep because we froze that hot water so darned fast that the ice was still warm .    the end    the most unusual thing about this small item is that it was not published under my own name .  campbell wanted one item in that first  probability zero  to appear to be by a non professional  just to encourage the newcomers he hoped would try to break in .  he had three entries in that first department and the other two were by l .  sprague de camp and malcolm jameson .  both were longer established and  despite  nightfall   more renowned than i .  as low man  it was up to me to use a pseudonym and pretend to be a newcomer .   i saw campbell s point and  just a little sullenly  agreed .  i used the name george e .  dale .  it is the only time i ever used a pseudonym in the magazines .  in later years i used the pseudonym paul french on a series of six teen age science fiction novels for reasons that are another story altogether .  that was a special case  and in      and      those six novels appeared as paperbacks under my own name .  now  time pussy  appears here under my own name  and the record is at last absolutely clean .
