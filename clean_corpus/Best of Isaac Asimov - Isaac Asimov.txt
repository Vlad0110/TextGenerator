the best of isaac asimov  isaac asimov copyright          contents  introduction marooned off vesta nightfall c chute the martian way the deep the fun they had the last question the dead past the dying night anniversary the billiard ball mirror image  introduction  i must admit the title of this book gives me pause .  who says the enclosed stories are my    best    .  do i .  does the editor .  or some critic .  some reader .  a general vote among the entire population of the world .  and whoever says it  can it be so .  can the word    best    mean anything at all  except to some particular person in some particular mood .  perhaps not  so if we allow the word to stand as an absolute  you  or you  or perhaps you  may be appalled at omissions or inclusions or  never having read me before  may even be impelled to cry out     good heavens  are those his best .     so i   ll be honest with all of you .  what is included here in this book are a dozen stories chosen in such a way as to span a third of a century of writing  with two early samples  two late samples  and eight from the gold decade  for me  of the fifties .  those presented are as nearly representative as is consistent with the careful selection of good stories  i . e .  those the editor and i like   and as nearly the best of my stories as is consistent with making them representative .  i suppose we ought really call the book     the pretty good and pretty representative stories of isaac asimov     but who would then buy it .  so    best    it is .  as to the individual stories          marooned off vesta    was the very first story i ever published  so its inclusion is virtually a necessity .  it wasn   t the first i ever wrote with the hope of publication .  actually  it was the third .  the first was never sold and no longer exists  the second was sold a couple of years after it was written  but is not very good .  far be it from me to crave indulgence  but i think it is important to understand that at the time i wrote and sold the story  in       i was eighteen years old and had spent all the years i could remember in a city slum .  my vision of strong adventurers bravely facing danger in distant vastnesses was just that  visionary .         nightfall     written two and a half years later  was the thirty second story i had written  what else did i have to do in those days except work in my father   s candy store and study for my college degrees  and perhaps the fourteenth story published .  yet within less than three years of the start of my career it turned out that i had written the best of asimov .  at least     nightfall    has been frequently reprinted  is commonly referred to as a    classic     and when some magazine  or fan organization  conducts a vote on short stories  it frequently ends up on the top of the list  not only of my stories but of anybody   s .  one of its advantages is that it has a unique plot .  there was nothing resembling it ever published before  as far as i know  and of course  it is now so well known that nothing like it can be published again .  it   s nice to have one story like that  anyway .  yet i was only twenty one when i wrote it and was still feeling my way .  it isn   t my favorite .  later on  i   ll tell you what my favorite is and you can then judge for yourself .         c chute    comes after a ten year hiatus  as far as the stories included in this book are concerned .  i hadn   t quit writing of course  don   t think that .  to be sure  i had slowed down a bit  what with the war and the time consuming effort toward the doctorate  but the real reason for the gap is that i spent most of the forties writing the stories collected in my books i  robot and the foundation trilogy .  it seemed inadvisable to amputate portions of either for this collection .     c chute    comes near the beginning of my    mature    period  or whatever you want to call it  .  i had my ph . d .   i was an assistant professor of biochemistry at boston university school of medicine  i had published my first three books  and i was full of self confidence .  what   s more i had broken away from exclusive dependence on astounding science fiction .  new magazines had arisen to challenge its leadership  notably galaxy  and also fantasy and science fiction .     c chute    appeared in galaxy .  so did the next two stories in the collection .         the martian way    represents my reaction to the mccarthy era  a time  in the early fifties  when americans seemed to abandon their own history and become  in some cases  witch hunters  in some cases  victims  and in most cases  cowards .   brave men remained  fortunately  which is why we pulled out of it .      the martian way     written and published at the height of the mccarthy era  was my own personal statement of position .  i felt very brave at the time and was disappointed that no one ever as much as frowned at me in consequence .  i must have been too subtle  or too unimportant .  a second point about the story is that i managed to foresee something accurately  science fiction writers are often assumed to be keen eyed peerers into the future who see things others don   t .  actually  few writers have much of a record in this respect and mine  at best  can only be said to attain the abysmally low average .  just the same  in    the martian way     i described the euphoric effects of the spacewalk fifteen years before anyone had space walked  and then  when they did  euphoria is apparently what they experienced .         the deep    is the sleeper of the collection .  every once in a while i wrote a story which  though good in my opinion  and i don   t like all my stories   seems to stir up no reaction .  this is one of them .  perhaps it   s because i deliberately chose to describe a society in which mother love was a crime and the world wasn   t ready for that        the fun they had    is probably the biggest surprise of my literary career .  a personal friend asked me to write a little science fiction story for a syndicated boys and girls newspaper page he edited and i agreed for friendship   s sake .  i expected it would appear in a few newspapers for one day and would then disappear forever .  however  fantasy and science fiction picked it up and  to my surprise  the reprint requests began to come in .  it has been reprinted at least thirty times  and there has been no time in perhaps fifteen years  including right now  when new reprints haven   t been pending .  why .  i don   t know why .  if i had the critic   s mentality  which i emphatically don   t  i would sit down and try to analyze my stories  work out the factors that make some more successful than others  cultivate those factors  and simply explode with excellence .  but the devil with that .  i won   t buy success at the price of self consciousness .  i don   t have the temperament for it .  f   write as i please .  and let the critics do the analyzing .   yesterday  someone said to me that a critic was like a eunuch in a harem .  he could observe  study  and analyze  but he couldn   t do it himself .          the last question    is my personal favorite  the one story i made sure would not be omitted from this collection .  why is it my favorite .  for one thing i got the idea all at once and didn   t have to fiddle with it  and i wrote it in whiteheat and scarcely had to change a word .  this sort of thing endears any story to any writer .  then  too  it has had the strangest effect on my readers .  frequently someone writes to ask me if i can write them the name of a story  which they think i may have written  and tell them where to find it .  they don   t remember the title but when they describe the story it is invariably    the last question    .  this has reached the point where i recently received a long distance phone call from a desperate man who began     dr .  asimov  there   s a story i think you wrote  whose title i can   t remember      at which point i interrupted to tell him it was    the last question    and when i described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after .  i left him convinced i could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles .  no other story i have written has anything like this effect on my readers  producing at once an unshakeable memory of the plot and an unshakeable forgettery of the title and even author .  i think it may be that the story fills them so frighteningly full  that they can retain none of the side issues .         the dead past    was written after i had been teaching for seven years .  i was as saturated as could be with the world of scientific research .  naturally  anyone who writes is going to reveal the world in which he is immersed  whether he wants to or desperately wants not to .  i   ve never tried to avoid letting my personal background creep into my stories  but i must admit it has rarely crept in quite as thickly as it did in this one .  as an example of how my stories work out  consider this   i had my protagonist interested in carthage because i myself am a great admirer of hannibal and have never quite gotten over the battle of zama .  i introduced carthage  idly  without any intention of weaving it into the plot .  but it got woven in just the same .  that happens to me over and over .  some writers work out the stories in meticulous detail before starting  and stick to the outline .  p .  g .  wodehouse does it  i understand  and i worship his books .  but just the same i don   t .  i work out my ending  decide on a beginning and then proceed  letting everything in between work itself out as i come to it .         the dying night    is an example of a mystery as well as a science fiction story  i have been a mystery reader as long as i have been a science fiction reader and  on the whole  i think i enjoy mysteries more .  i   m not sure why that is .  perhaps it was that after i became an established science fiction writer i was no longer able to relax with science fiction stories .  i read every story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine  in which case i had no patience with it  or that it might be better  in which case i felt miserable .  mysteries  especially the intellectual puzzle variety  ah  good old hercule poirot   offered me no such stumbling blocks .  sooner or later  then  i was bound to try my hand at science fiction mysteries and    the dying night    is one of these .        anniversary    was written to fulfill a request  that i write a story for the march        issue of amazing stories as a way of celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the march        issue  which had contained my first published story     marooned off vesta     so  inevitably  i wrote a story dealing with the characters of    marooned off vesta    twenty years later .  the magazine then ran both stories together  and i was sure someone would send me a letter saying that my writing was better in the first story  but no one did .   perhaps a reader of this book will decide it would be humorous to do so  but if so  please restrain yourself .           the billiard ball    comes  in this collection  after an eight year hiatus and is an example of my    late    style .   that is  if there is such a thing .  some critics say that it is a flaw in my literary nature that i haven   t grown  that my late stories have the same style and aura of my early stories .  maybe you   ll think so  too  and scorn me in consequence  but then  i   ve already told you what some people think of critics .   the reason for the hiatus is that in      i quit the academic life to become a full time writer .  i at once proceeded to write everything under the sun  straight science  straight mystery  children   s books  histories  literary annotations  etymology  humor  etc .   etc .   except science fiction .  i never entirely abandoned it  of course  witness    the billiard ball    .          mirror image    is a particularly recent science fiction short story i   ve written for the magazines and  unlike the first eleven stories  has not yet had time to be reprinted .  one of the reasons for writing it was to appease those readers who were forever asking me for sequels  for one more book involving characters who have appeared in previous books .  one of the most frequent requests was that i write a third novel to succeed the caves of steel and the naked sun  both of which dealt with the adventures of the detective  elijah baley  and his robot assistant  r .  daneel olivaw .  unable to find the time to do so  i wrote a short story about them     mirror image    .  alas  all i got as a result were a spate of letters saying     thanks  but we mean a novel .     anyway  there you are .  turn the page and you can begin a representative  and possibly a more or less    best             words or so out of the roughly           words of science fiction i have written so far .  i hope it amuses you .  and if it doesn   t  remember that i have also written about           words of non science fiction  and you are at least spared any of that .   isaac asimov  marooned off vesta     will you please stop walking up and down like that .     said warren moore from the couch .     it won   t do any of us any good .  think of our blessings  we   re airtight  aren   t we .     mark brandon whirled and ground his teeth at him .     i   m glad you feel happy about that     he spat out viciously .     of course  you don   t know that our air supply will last only three days .     he resumed his interrupted stride with a defiant air .  moore yawned and stretched  assumed a more comfortable position  and replied .     expending all that energy will only use it up faster .  why don   t you take a hint from mike here .  he   s taking it easy .        mike    was michael shea  late a member of the crew of the silver queen .  his short  squat body was resting on the only chair in the room and    his feet were on the only table .  he looked up as his name was mentioned  his mouth widening in a twisted grin .     you   ve got to expect things like this to happen sometimes     he said .     bucking the asteroids is risky business .  we should   ve taken the hop .  it takes longer  but it   s the only safe way .  but no  the captain wanted to make the schedule  he would go through     mike spat disgustedly     and here we are .        what   s the    hop    .     asked brandon .     oh  i take it that friend mike means that we .  should have avoided the asteroid belt by plotting a course outside the plane of the ecliptic     answered moore .     that   s it  isn   t it  mike .     mike hesitated and then replied cautiously     yeah  i guess that   s it .     moore smiled blandly and continued     well  i wouldn   t blame captain crane too much .  the repulsion screen must have failed five minutes before that chunk of granite barged into us .  that   s not his fault  though of course we ought to have steered clear instead of relying on the screen .     he shook his head meditatively .     the silver queen just went to pieces .  it   s really miraculously lucky that this part of the ship remained intact  and what   s more  airtight .        you   ve got a funny idea of luck  warren     said brandon .     always have  for as long as i   ve known you .  here we are in a tenth part of a spaceship  comprising only three whole rooms  with air for three days  and no prospect of being alive after that  and you have the infernal gall to prate about luck .        compared to the others who died instantly when the asteroid struck  yes     was moore   s answer .     you think so  eh .  well  let me tell you that instant death isn   t so bad compared with what we   re going to have to go through .  suffocation is a damned unpleasant way of dying .        we may find a way out     moore suggested hopefully .     why not face facts .     brandon   s face was flushed and his voice trembled .     we   re done  i tell you .  through .     mike glanced from one to the other doubtfully and then coughed to attract their attention .     well  gents  seeing that we   re all in the same fix  i guess there   s no use hogging things .     he drew a small bottle out of his pocket that was filled with a greenish liquid .     grade a jabra this is .  i ain   t too proud to share and share alike .     brandon exhibited the first signs of pleasure for over a day .     martian jabra water .  why didn   t you say so before .     but as he reached for it  a firm hand clamped down upon his wrist .  he looked up into the calm blue eyes of warren moore .     don   t be a fool     said moore     there isn   t enough to keep us drunk for three days .  what do you want to do .  go on a tear now and then die cold sober .  let   s save this for the last six hours when the air gets stuffy and breathing hurts  then we   ll finish the bottle among us and never know when the end comes  or care .     brandon   s hand fell away reluctantly .     damn it  warren  you   d bleed ice if you were cut .  how can you think straight at a time like this .     he motioned to mike and the bottle was once more stowed away .  brandon walked to the porthole and gazed out .  moore approached and placed a kindly arm over the shoulders of the younger man .     why take it so hard  man .     he asked .     you can   t last at this rate .  inside of twenty four hours you   ll be a madman if you keep this up .     there was no answer .  brandon stared bitterly at the globe that filled almost the entire porthole  so moore continued     watching vesta won   t do you any good either .     mike shea lumbered up to the porthole .     we   d be safe if we were only down there on vesta .  there   re people there .  how far away are we .        not more than three or four hundred miles judging from its apparent size     answered moore .     you must remember that it is only two hundred miles in diameter .        three hundred miles from salvation      murmured brandon     and we might as well be a million .  if there were only a way to get ourselves out of the orbit this rotten fragment adopted .  you know  manage to give ourselves a push so as to start falling .  there   d be no danger of crashing if we did  because that midget hasn   t got enough gravity to crush a cream puff .        it has enough to keep us in the orbit      retorted brandon .     it must have picked us up while we were lying unconscious after the crash .  wish it had come closer  we might have been able to land on it .        funny place  vesta     observed mike shea .     i was down there two three times .  what a dump .  it   s all covered with some stuff like snow  only it ain   t snow .  i forget what they call it .        frozen carbon dioxide .     prompted moore .     yeah  dry ice  that carbon stuff  that   s it .  they say that   s what makes vesta so shiny .        of course .  that would give it a high albedo .     mike cocked a suspicious eye at moore and decided to let it pass .     it   s hard to see anything down there on account of the snow  but if you look close     he pointed     you can see a sort of gray smudge .  i think that   s bennett   s dome .  that   s where they keep the observatory .  and there is calorn   s dome up there .  that   s a fuel station  that is .  there   s plenty more  too  only i don   t see them .     he hesitated and then turned to moore .     listen  boss  i   ve been thinking .  wouldn   t they be looking for us as soon as they hear about the crash .  and wouldn   t we be easy to find from vesta  seeing we   re so closer    moore shook his head     no  mike  they won   t be looking for us .  no one   s going to find out about the crash until the silver queen fails to turn up on schedule .  you see  when the asteroid hit  we didn   t have time to send out an sos     he sighed     and they won   t find us down there at vesta  either .  we   re so small that even at our distance they couldn   t see us unless they knew what they were looking for  and exactly where to look .        hmm .     mike   s forehead was corrugated in deep thought .     then we   ve got to get to vesta before three days are up .        you   ve got the gist of the matter  mike .  now  if we only knew how to go about it  eh .     brandon suddenly exploded     will you two stop this infernal chitter chatter and do something .  for god   s sake  do something .     moore shrugged his shoulders and without answer returned to the couch .  he lounged at ease  apparently carefree  but there was the tiniest crease between his eyes which bespoke concentration .  there was no doubt about it  they were in a bad spot .  he reviewed the events of the preceding day for perhaps the twentieth time .  after the asteroid had struck  tearing the ship apart  he   d gone out like a light  for how long he didn   t know  his own watch being broken and no other timepiece available .  when he came to  he found himself  along with mark brandon  who shared his room  and mike shea  a member of the crew  sole occupants of all that was left of the silver queen .  this remnant was now careening in an orbit about vesta .  at present things were fairly comfortable .  there was a food supply that would last a week .  likewise there was a regional gravitator under the room that kept them at normal weight and would continue to do so for an indefinite time  certainly for longer than the air would last .  the lighting system was less satisfactory but had held on so far .  there was no doubt  however  where the joker in the pack lay .  three days    air .  not that there weren   t other disheartening features .  there was no heating system  though it would take a long time for the ship to radiate enough heat into the vacuum of space to render them too uncomfortable .  far more important was the fact that their part of the ship had neither a means of communication nor a propulsive mechanism .  moore sighed .  one fuel jet in working order would fix everything  for one blast in the right direction would send them safely to vesta .  the crease between his eyes deepened .  what was to be done .  they had but one spacesuit among them  one heat ray  and one detonator .  that was the sum total of space appliances after a thorough search of the accessible parts of the ship .  a pretty hopeless mess  that .  moore shrugged  rose  and drew himself a glass of water .  he swallowed it mechanically  still deep in thought  when an idea struck him .  he glanced curiously at the empty cup in his hand .     say  mike     he said     what kind of water supply have we .  funny that i never thought of that before .     mike   s eyes opened to their fullest extent in an expression of ludicrous surprise .     didn   t you know  boss .        know what .     asked moore impatiently .     we   ve got all the water there was .     he waved his hand in an all inclusive gesture .  he paused  but as moore   s expression showed nothing but total mystification  he elaborated     don   t you see .  we   ve got the main tank  the place where all the water for the whole ship was stored .     he pointed to one of the walls .     do you mean to say that there   s a tank full of water adjoining us .     mike nodded vigorously     yep    cubic vat a hundred feet each way .  and she   s three quarters full .     moore was astonished .     seven hundred and fifty thousand cubic feet of water .     then suddenly     why hasn   t it run out through the broken pipes .        it only has one main outlet  which runs down the corridor just outside this room .  i was fixing that main when the asteroid hit and had to shut it off .  after i came to i opened the pipe leading to our faucet  but that   s the only outlet open now .        oh .     moore had a curious feeling way down deep inside .  an idea had half formed in his brain  but for the life of him he could not drag it into the light of day .  he knew only that there was something in what he had just heard that had some important meaning but he just could not place his finger on it .  brandon  meanwhile  had been listening to shea in silence  and now he emitted a short  humorless laugh .     fate seems to be having its fill of fun with us  i see .  first  it puts us within arm   s reach of a place of safety and then sees to it that we have no way of getting there .     then she provides us with a week   s food  three days    air  and a year   s supply of water .  a year   s supply  do you hear me .  enough water to drink and to gargle and to wash and to take baths in and  and to do anything else we want .  water  damn the water .        oh  take a less serious view  mark     said moore in an attempt to break the younger man   s melancholy .     pretend we   re a satellite of vesta  which we are .  we have our own period of revolution and of rotation .  we have an equator and an axis .  our    north pole    is located somewhere toward the top of the porthole  pointing toward vesta  and our    south    sticks out away from vesta through the water tank somewhere .  well  as a satellite  we have an atmosphere  and now  you see  we have a newly discovered ocean .     and seriously  we   re not so badly off .  for the three days our atmosphere will last  we can eat double rations and drink ourselves soggy .  hell  we have water enough to throw away      the idea which had been half formed before suddenly sprang to maturity and was nailed .  the careless gesture with which he had accompanied the last remark was frozen in mid air .  his mouth closed with a snap and his head came up with a jerk .  but brandon  immersed in his own thoughts  noticed nothing of moore   s strange actions .     why don   t you complete the analogy to a satellite     he sneered     or do you  as a professional optimist  ignore any and all disagreeable facts .  if i were you  i   d continue this way .     here he imitated moore   s voice     the satellite is at present habitable and inhabited but  due to the approaching depletion of its atmosphere in three days  is expected to become a dead world .     well  why don   t you answer .  why do you persist in making a joke out of this .  can   t you see  what   s the matter .     the last was a surprised exclamation and certainly moore   s actions did merit surprise .  he had risen suddenly and  after giving himself a smart rap on the forehead  remained stiff and silent  staring into the far distance with gradually narrowing eyelids .  brandon and mike shea watched him in speechless astonishment .  suddenly moore burst out     hal i   ve got it .  why didn   t i think of it before .     his exclamation degenerated into the unintelligible .  mike drew out the jabra bottle with a significant look  but moore waved it away impatiently .  whereupon brandon  without any warning  lashed out with his right  catching the surprised moore flush on the jaw and toppling him .  moore groaned and rubbed his chin .  somewhat indignant  he asked     what was the reason for that .        stand up and i   ll do it again     shouted brandon     i can   t stand it anymore .  i   m sick and tired of being preached at  and having to listen to your pollyanna talk .  you   re the one that   s going daffy .        daffy  nothing .  just a little overexcited  that   s all .  listen  for god   s sake .  i think i know a way      brandon glared at him balefully .     oh  you do  do you .  raise our hopes with some silly scheme and then find it doesn   t work .  i won   t take it  do you hear .  i   ll find a real use for the water  drown you  and save some of the air besides .     moore lost his temper .     listen  mark  you   re out of this .  i   m going through alone .  i don   t need your help and i don   t want it if you   re that sure of dying and that afraid  why not have the agony over .  we   ve got one heat ray and one detonator  both reliable weapons .  take your choice and kill yourself .  shea and i won   t interfere .     brandon   s lips curled in a last weak gesture of defiance and then suddenly he capitulated  completely and abjectly .     all right  warren  i   m with you .  i  i guess i didn   t quite know what i was doing .  i don   t feel well  warren .  i  i         aw  that   s all right  boy .     moore was genuinely sorry for him .     take it easy .  i know how you feel .  it   s got me too .  but you mustn   t give in to it .  fight it  or you   ll go stark  raving mad .  now you just try and get some sleep and leave everything to me .  things will turn out right yet .     brandon  pressing a hand to an aching forehead  stumbled to the couch and tumbled down .  silent sobs shook his frame while moore and shea remained in embarrassed silence nearby .   at last moore nudged mike .     come on     he whispered     let   s get busy .  we   re going places .  airlock five is at the end of the corridor  isn   t it .     shea nodded and moore continued     is it airtight .        well     said shea after some thought     the inner door is  of course  but i    don   t know anything about the outer one .  for all i know it may be a sieve .  you see  when i tested the wall for airtightness  i didn   t dare open the inner door  because if there was anything wrong with the outer one  blooey .     the accompanying gesture was very expressive .     then it   s up to us to find out about that outer door right now .  i   ve got to get outside some way and we   ll just have to take chances .  where   s the spacesuit .     he grabbed the lone suit from its place in the cupboard  threw it over his shoulder and led the way into the long corridor that ran down the side of the room .  he passed closed doors behind whose airtight barriers were what once had been passenger quarters but which were now merely cavities  open to space .  at the end of the corridor was the tight fitting door of airlock   .  moore stopped and surveyed it appraisingly .     looks all right     he observed     but of course you can   t tell what   s outside .  god  i hope it   ll work .     he frowned .     of course we could use the entire corridor as an airlock  with the door to our room as the inner door and this as the outer door  but that would mean the loss of half our air supply .  we can   t afford that  yet .     he turned to shea .      all right  now .  the indicator shows that the lock was last used for entrance  so it should be full of air .  open the door the tiniest crack  and if there   s a hissing noise  shut it quick .        here goes     and the lever moved one notch .  the mechanism had been severely shaken up during the shock of the crash and its former noiseless workings had given way to a harsh  rasping sound  but it was still in commission .  a thin black line appeared on the left hand side of the lock  marking where the door had slid a fraction of an inch on the runners .  there was no hiss .  moore   s look of anxiety faded somewhat .  he took a small pasteboard from his pocket and held it against the crack .  if air were leaking  that card should have held there  pushed by the escaping gas .  it fell to the floor .  mike shea stuck a forefinger in his mouth and then put it against the crack .     thank the lord     he breathed     not a sign of a draft .        good  good .  open it wider .  go ahead .     another notch and the crack opened farther .  and still no draft .  slowly  ever so slowly  notch by notch  it creaked its way wider and wider .  the two men held their breaths  afraid that while not actually punctured  the outer door might have been so weakened as to give way any moment .  but it held .  moore was jubilant as he wormed into the spacesuit .     things are going fine so far  mike     he said .     you sit down right here and wait for me .  i don   t know how long i   ll take  but i   ll be back .  where   s the heat ray .  have you got it .     shea held out the ray and asked     but what are you going to do .  i   d sort of like to know .     moore paused as he was about to buckle on the helmet .     did you hear me say inside that we had water enough to throwaway .  well  i   ve been thinking it over and that   s not such a bad idea .  i   m going to throw it away .     with no other explanation  he stepped into the lock  leaving behind him a very puzzled mike shea .   it was with a pounding heart that moore waited for the outer door to open .  his plan was an extraordinarily simple one  but it might not be easy to carry out .  there was a sound of creaking gears and scraping ratchets .  air sighed away to nothingness .  the door before him slid open a few inches and stuck .  moore   s heart sank as for a moment he thought it would not open at all  but after a few preliminary jerks and rattles the barrier slid the rest of the way .  he clicked on the magnetic grapple and very cautiously put a foot out into space .  clumsily he groped his way out to the side of the ship .  he had never been outside a ship in open space before and a vast dread overtook him as he clung there  flylike  to his precarious perch .  for a moment dizziness overcame him .  he closed his eyes and for five minutes hung there  clutching the smooth sides of what had once been the silver queen .  the magnetic grapple held him firm and when he opened his eyes once more he found his self confidence in a measure returned .  he gazed about him .  for the first time since the crash he saw the stars instead of the vision of vesta which their porthole afforded .  eagerly he searched the skies for the little blue white speck that was earth .  it had often amused him that earth should always be the first object sought by space travelers when stargazing  but the humor of the situation did not strike him now .  however  his search was in vain .  from where he lay  earth was invisible .  it  as well as the sun  must be hidden behind vesta .  still  there was much else that he could not help but note .  jupiter was off to the left  a brilliant globe the size of a small pea to the naked eye .  moore observed two of its attendant satellites .  saturn was visible too  as a brilliant planet of some negative magnitude  rivaling venus as seen from earth .  moore had expected that a goodly number of asteroids would be visible  marooned as they were in the asteroid belt  but space seemed surprisingly empty .  once he thought he could see a hurtling body pass within a few miles  but so fast had the impression come and gone that he could not swear that it was not fancy .  and then  of course  there was vesta .  almost directly below him it loomed like a balloon filling a quarter of the sky .  it floated steadily  snowy white  and moore gazed at it with earnest longing .  a good hard kick against the side of the ship  he thought  might start him falling toward vesta .  he might land safely and get help for the others .  but the chance was too great that he would merely take on a new orbit about vesta .  no  it would have to be better than that .  this reminded him that he had no time to lose .  he scanned the side of the ship  looking for the water tank  but all he could see was a jungle of jutting walls  jagged  crumbling  and pointed .  he hesitated .  evidently the only thing to do was to make for the lighted porthole to their room and proceed to the tank from there  carefully he dragged himself along the wall of the ship .  not five yards from the lock the smoothness stopped abruptly .  there was a yawning cavity which moore recognized as having once been the room adjoining the corridor at the far end .  he shuddered .  suppose he were to come across a bloated dead body in one of those rooms .  he had known most of the passengers  many of them personally .  but he overcame his squeamishness and forced himself to continue his precarious journey toward its goal .  and here he encountered his first practical difficulty .  the room itself was made of non ferrous material in many parts .  the magnetic grapple was intended for use only on outer hulls and was useless throughout much of the ship   s interior .  moore had forgotten this when suddenly he found himself floating down an incline  his grapple out of use .  he grasped and clutched at a nearby projection .  slowly he pulled himself back to safety .  .  he lay for a moment  almost breathless .  theoretically he should be weightless out here in space  vesta   s influence being negligible  but the regional gravitator under his room was working .  without the balance of the other gravitators  it tended to place him under variable and suddenly shifting stresses as he kept changing his position .  for his magnetic grapple to let go suddenly might mean being jerked away from the ship altogether .  and then what .  evidently this was going to be even more difficult than he had thought .  he inched forward in a crawl  testing each spot to see if the grapple would hold .  sometimes he had to make long  circuitous journeys to gain a few feet   s headway and at other times he was forced to scramble and slip across small patches of non ferrous material .  and always there was that tiring pull of the gravitator  continually changing directions as he progressed  setting horizontal floors and vertical walls at queer and almost haphazard angles .  carefully he investigated all objects that he came across .  but it was a barren search .  loose articles  chairs  tables had been jerked away at the first shock  probably  and now were independent bodies of the solar system .  he did manage  however  to pick up a small field glass and fountain pen .  these he placed in his pocket .  they were valueless under present conditions  but somehow they seemed to make more real this macabre trip across the sides of a dead ship .  for fifteen minutes  twenty  half an hour  he labored slowly toward where he thought the porthole should be .  sweat poured down into his eyes and rendered his hair a matted mass .  his muscles were beginning to ache under the unaccustomed strain .  his mind  already strained by the ordeal of the previous day  was beginning to waver  to play him tricks .  the crawl began to seem eternal  something that had always existed and would exist forever .  the object of the journey  that for which he was striving  seemed unimportant  he only knew that it was necessary to move .  the time  one hour back  when he had been with brandon and shea  seemed hazy and lo  in the far past .  that more normal time  two days    age  wholly forgotten .  only the jagged walls before him  only the vital necessity of getting at some uncertain destination existed in his spinning brain .  grasping  straining  pulling .  feeling for the iron alloy .  up and into gaping holes that were rooms and then out again .  feel and pull  feel and pull  and  a light .  moore stopped .  had he not been glued to the wall he would have fallen .  somehow that light seemed to clear things .  it was the porthole  not the many dark  staring ones he had passed  but alive and alight .  behind it was brandon .  a deep breath and he felt better  his mind cleared .  and now his way lay plain before him .  toward that spark of life he crept .  nearer  and nearer  and nearer until he could touch it .  he was there .  his eyes drank in the familiar room .  god knows that it hadn   t  any happy associations in his mind  but it was something real  something almost natural .  brandon slept on the couch .  his face was worn and lined but a smile passed over it now and then .  moore raised his fist to knock .  he felt the urgent desire to talk with someone  if only by sign language  yet at the last instant he refrained .  perhaps the kid was dreaming of home .  he was young and sensitive and had suffered much .  let him sleep .  time enough to wake him when  and if  his idea had been carried through .  he located the wall within the room behind which lay the water tank and then tried to spot it from the outside .  now it was not difficult  its rear wall stood out prominently .  moore marveled  for it seemed a miracle that it had escaped puncture .  perhaps the fates had not been so ironic after all .  passage to it was easy though it was on the other side of the fragment .  what was once a corridor led almost directly to it .  once when the silver queen had been whole  that corridor had been level and horizontal  but now  under the unbalanced pull of the regional gravitator  it seemed more of a steep incline than anything else .  and yet it made the path simple .  since it was of uniform beryl steel  moore found no trouble holding on as he wormed up the twenty odd feet to the water supply .  and now the crisis  the last stage  had been reached .  he felt that he ought to rest first  but his excitement grew rapidly in intensity .  it was either now or bust .  he pulled himself out to the bottom center of the tank .  there  resting on the small ledge formed by the floor of the corridor that had once extended on that side of the tank  he began operations .     it   s a pity that the main pipe is pointing in the wrong direction     he muttered .     it would have saved me a lot of trouble had it been right .  as it is .  .  .     he sighed and bent to his work .  the heat ray was adjusted to maximum concentration and the invisible emanations focused at a spot perhaps a foot above the floor of the tank .  gradually the effect of the excitatory beam upon the molecules of the wall became noticeable .  a spot the size of a dime began shining faintly at the point of focus of the ray gun .  it wavered uncertainly  now dimming  now brightening  as moore strove to steady his tired arm .  he propped it on the ledge and achieved better results as the tiny circle of radiation brightened .  slowly the color ascended the spectrum .  the dark  angry red that had first appeared lightened to a cherry color .  as the heat continued pouring in  the brightness seemed to ripple out in widening areas  like a target made of successively deepening tints of red .  the wall for a distance of some feet from the focal point was becoming uncomfortably hot even though it did not glow and moore found it necessary to refrain from touching it with the metal of his suit .  moore cursed steadily  for the ledge itself was also growing hot .  it seemed that only imprecations could soothe him .  and as the melting wall began to radiate heat in its own right  the chief object of his maledictions were the spacesuit manufacturers .  why didn   t they build a suit that could keep heat out as well as keep it in .  but what brandon called professional optimism crept up .  with the salt tang of perspiration in his mouth  he kept consoling himself     it could be worse  i suppose .  at least  the two inches of wall here don   t present too much of a barrier .  suppose the tank had been built flush against the outer hull .  whew .  imagine trying to melt through a foot of this .     he gritted his teeth and kept on .  the spot of brightness was now flickering into the orange yellow and moore knew that the melting point of the beryl steel alloy would soon be reached .  he found himself forced to watch the spot only at widely spaced intervals and then only for fleeting moments .  evidently it would have to be done quickly if it were to be done at all .  the heat ray had not been fully loaded in the first place  and  pouring out energy at maximum as it had been doing for almost ten minutes now  must be approaching exhaustion .  yet the wall was just barely passing the plastic stage .  in a fever of impatience  moore jammed the muzzle of the gun directly at the center of the spot  drawing it back speedily .  a deep depression formed in the soft metal  but a puncture had not been formed .  however  moore was satisfied .  he was almost there now .  had there been air between himself and the wall  he would undoubtedly have heard the gurgling and the hissing of the steaming water within .  the pressure was building up .  how long would the weakened wall endure .  then so suddenly that moore did not realize it for a few moments  he was through .  a tiny fissure formed at the bottom of that little pit made by the ray gun and in less time than it takes to imagine  the churning water within had its way .  the soft  liquid metal at that spot puffed out  sticking out raggedly around a pea sized hole .  and from that hole there came a hissing and a roaring .  a cloud of steam emerged and enveloped moore .  through the mist he could see the steam condense almost immediately to ice droplets and saw these icy pellets shrink rapidly into nothingness .  for fifteen minutes he watched the steam shoot out .  then he became aware of gentle pressure pushing him away from the ship .  a savage joy welled up within him as he realized that this was the effect of acceleration on the ship   s part .  his own inertia was holding him back .  that meant his work had been finished  and successfully .  that stream of water was substituting for the rocket blast .  he started back .  if the horrors and dangers of the journey to the tank had been great  those of the way back should have been greater .  he was infinitely more tired  his aching eyes were all but blind  and added to the crazy pull of the gravitator was the force induced by the varying acceleration of the ship .  but whatever his labors to return  they did not bother him .  in later time  he never even remembered the heartbreaking trip .  how he managed to negotiate the distance in safety he did not know .  most of the time he was lost in a haze of happiness  scarcely realizing the actualities of the situation .  his mind was filled with one thought only  to get back quickly  to tell the happy news of their escape .  suddenly he found himself before the airlock .  he hardly grasped the fact that it was the airlock .  he almost did not understand why he pressed the signal button .  some instinct told him it was the thing to do .  mike shea was waiting .  there was a creak and a rumble and the outer door started opening  caught  and stopped at the same place as before  but once again it managed to slide the rest of the way .  it closed behind moore  then the inner door opened and he stumbled into shea   s arms .  as in a dream he felt himself half pulled  half carried down the corridor to the room .  his suit was ripped off .  a hot  burning liquid stung his throat .  moore gagged  swallowed  and felt better .  shea pocketed the jabra bottle once more .  the blurred  shifting images of brandon and shea before him steadied and became solid .  moore wiped the perspiration from his face with a trembling hand and essayed a weak smile .     wait     protested brandon     don   t say anything .  you look half dead .  rest  will you .     but moore shook his head .  in a hoarse  cracked voice he narrated as well as he could the events of the past two hours .  the tale was incoherent  scarcely intelligible but marvelously impressive .  the two listeners scarcely breathed during the recital .     you mean     stammered brandon     that the water spout is pushing us toward vesta  like a rocket exhaust .        exactly  same thing as  rocket exhaust     panted moore .      action and reaction .  is located  on side opposite vesta  hence pushing us toward vesta .     shea was dancing before the porthole .     he   s right  brandon  me boy .  you can make out bennett   s dome as clear as day .  we   re getting there  we   re getting there .     moore felt himself recovering .     we   re approaching in spiral path on account of original orbit .  we   ll land in five or six hours probably .  the water will last for quite a long while and the pressure is still great  since the water issues as steam .        steam  at the low temperature of space .     brandon was surprised .     steam  at the low pressure of space .     corrected moore .     the boiling point of water falls with the pressure .  it is very low indeed in a vacuum .  even ice has a vapor pressure sufficient to sublime .     he smiled .      as a matter of fact  it freezes and boils at the same time .  i watched it .     a short pause  then     well  how do you feel now  brandon .  much better  eh .     brandon reddened and his face fell .  he groped vainly for words for a few moments .  finally he said in a half whisper     you know  i must have acted like a damn fool and a coward at first .  i  i guess i don   t deserve all this after going to pieces and letting the burden of our escape rest on your shoulders .     i wish you   d beat me up  or something  for punching you before .  it   d make me feel better .  i mean it .     and he really did seem to mean it .  moore gave him an affectionate push .     forget it .  you   ll never know how near i came to breaking down myself .     he raised his voice in order to drown out any further apologies on brandon   s part     hey  mike  stop staring out of that porthole and bring over that jabra bottle .     mike obeyed with alacrity  bringing with him three plexatron units to be used as makeshift cups .  moore filled each precisely to the brim .  he was going to be drunk with a vengeance .     gentlemen     he said solemnly     a toast .     the three raised the mugs in unison     gentlemen  i give you the year   s supply of good old h o we used to have      nightfall  if the stars should appear one night in a thousand years  how would men believe and adore  and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of god .      emerson  aton     director of saro university  thrust out a belligerent lower lip and glared at the young newspaperman in a hot fury .  theremon     took that fury in his stride .  in his earlier days  when his now widely syndicated column was only a mad idea in a cub reporter   s mind  he had specialized in    impossible    interviews .  it had cost him bruises  black eyes  and broken bones  but it had given him an ample supply of coolness and self confidence .  so he lowered the outthrust hand that had been so pointedly ignored and calmly waited for the aged director to get over the worst .  astronomers were queer ducks  anyway  and if aton   s actions of the last two months meant anything  this same aton was the queer duckiest of the lot .  aton    found his voice  and though it trembled with restrained emotion  the careful  somewhat pedantic phraseology  for which the famous astronomer was noted  did not abandon him .     sir     he said     you display an infernal gall in coming to me with that impudent proposition of yours .     the husky telephotographer of the observatory  beenay     thrust a tongue   s tip across dry lips and interposed nervously     now  sir  after all        the director turned to him and lifted a white eyebrow .     do not interfere  beenay .  i will credit you with good intentions in bringing this man here  but i will tolerate no insubordination now .     theremon decided it was time to take a part .     director aton  if you   ll let me finish what i started saying  i think           i don   t believe  young man     retorted aton     that anything you could say now would count much as compared with your daily columns of these last two months .  you have led a vast newspaper campaign against the efforts of myself and my colleagues to organize the world against the menace which it is now too late to avert .  you have done your best with your highly personal attacks to make the staff of this observatory objects of ridicule .     the director lifted a copy of the saro city chronicle from the table and shook it at theremon furiously .     even a person of your well known impudence should have hesitated before coming to me with a request that he be allowed to cover today   s events for his paper .  of all newsmen  you .     aton dashed the newspaper to the floor  strode to the window  and clasped his arms behind his back .     you may leave     he snapped over his shoulder .  he stared moodily out at the skyline where gamma  the brightest of the planet   s six suns  was setting .  it had already faded and yellowed into the horizon mists  and aton knew he would never see it again as a sane man .  he whirled .     no  wait  come here .     he gestured peremptorily .  i   ll give you your story .     the newsman had made no motion to leave  and now he approached the old man slowly .  aton gestured outward .     of the six suns  only beta is left in the sky .  do you see it .     the question was rather unnecessary .  beta was almost at zenith  its ruddy light flooding the landscape to an unusual orange as the brilliant rays of setting gamma died .  beta was at aphelion .  it was small  smaller than theremon had ever seen it before  and for the moment it was undisputed ruler of lagash   s sky .  lagash   s own sun .  alpha  the one about which it revolved  was at the antipodes  as were the two distant companion pairs .  the red dwarf beta    alpha   s immediate companion    was alone  grimly alone .  aton   s upturned face flushed redly in the sunlight .     in just under four hours     he said     civilization  as we know it  comes to an end .  it will do so because  as you see .  beta is the only sun in the sky .     he smiled grimly .     print that .  there   ll be no one to read it .        but if it turns out that four hours pass    and another four    and nothing happens .     asked theremon softly .     don   t let that worry you .  enough will happen .        granted .  and still    it nothing happens .     for a second time  beenay    spoke .     sir  i think you ought to listen to him .     theremon said     put it to a vote  director aton .     there was a stir among the remaining five members of the observatory staff  who till now had maintained an attitude of wary neutrality .     that     stated aton flatly     is not necessary .     he drew out his pocket watch .     since your good friend  beenay  insists so urgently  i will give you five minutes .  talk away .        good .  now  just what difference would it make if you allowed me to take down an eyewitness account of what   s to come .  if your prediction comes true  my presence won   t hurt  for in that case my column would never be written .  on the other hand  if nothing comes of it  you will just have to expect ridicule or worse .  it would be wise to leave that ridicule to friendly hands .     aton snorted .     do you mean yours when you speak of friendly hands .        certainly .     theremon sat down and crossed his legs .     my columns may have been a little rough  but i gave you people the benefit of the doubt every time .  after all  this is not the century to preach    the end of the world is at hand    to lagash .  you have to understand that people don   t believe the book of revelations anymore  and it annoys them to have scientists turn about face and tell us the cultists are right after all           no such thing  young man     interrupted aton .     while a great deal of our data has been supplied us by the cult  our results contain none of the cult   s mysticism .  facts are facts  and the cult   s so called mythology has certain facts behind it .  we   ve exposed them and ripped away their mystery .  i assure you that the cult hates us now worse than you do .        i don   t hate you .  i   m just trying to tell you that the public is in an ugly humor .  they   re angry .     aton twisted his mouth in derision .     let them be angry .        yes  but what about tomorrow .        there   ll be no tomorrow .        but if there is .  say that there is    just to see what happens .  that anger might take shape into something serious .  after all  you know  business has taken a nosedive these last two months .  investors don   t really believe the world is coming to an end  but just the same they   re being cagy with their money until it   s all over .  johnny public doesn   t believe you  either  but the new spring furniture might just as well wait a few months    just to make sure .     you see the point .  just as soon as this is all over  the business interests will be after your hide .  they   ll say that if crackpots    begging your pardon    can upset the country   s prosperity any time they want  simply by making some cockeyed prediction    it   s up to the planet to prevent them .  the sparks will fly  sir .     the director regarded the columnist sternly .     and just what were you proposing to do to help the situation .        well       theremon grinned       i was proposing to take charge of the publicity .  i can handle things so that only the ridiculous side will show .  it would be hard to stand  i admit  because i   d have to make you all out to be a bunch of gibbering idiots  but if i can get people laughing at you  they might forget to be angry .  in return for that  all my publisher asks is an exclusive story .     beenay nodded and burst out     sir  the rest of us think he   s right .  these last two months we   ve considered everything but the million to one chance that there is an error somewhere in our theory or in our calculations .  we ought to take care of that  too .     there was a murmur of agreement from the men grouped about the table  and aton   s expression became that of one who found his mouth full of something bitter and couldn   t get rid of it .     you may stay if you wish  then .  you will kindly refrain  however  from hampering us in our duties in any way .  you will also remember that i am in charge of all activities here  and in spite of your opinions as expressed in your columns  i will expect full cooperation and full respect        his hands were behind his back  and his wrinkled face thrust forward determinedly as he spoke .  he might have continued indefinitely but for the intrusion of a new voice .     hello  hello  hello .     it came in a high tenor  and the plump cheeks of the newcomer expanded in a pleased smile .     what   s this morgue like atmosphere about here .  no one   s losing his nerve  i hope .     aton started in consternation and said peevishly     now what the devil are you doing here  sheerin .  i thought you were going to stay behind in the hideout .     sheerin laughed and dropped his stubby figure into a chair .     hideout be blowed .  the place bored me .  i wanted to be here  where things are getting hot .  don   t you suppose i have my share of curiosity .  i want to see these stars the cultists are forever speaking about .     he rubbed his hands and added in a soberer tone .     it   s freezing outside .  the wind   s enough to hang icicles on your nose .  beta doesn   t seem to give any heat at all  at the distance it is .     the white haired director ground his teeth in sudden exasperation .     why do you go out of your way to do crazy things  sheerin .  what kind of good are you around here .        what kind of good am i around there .     sheerin spread his palms in comical resignation .     a psychologist isn   t worth his salt in the hideout .  they need men of action and strong  healthy women that can breed children .  me .  i   m a hundred pounds too heavy for a man of action  and i wouldn   t be a success at breeding children .  so why bother them with an extra mouth to feed .  i feel better over here .     theremon spoke briskly .     just what is the hideout  sir .     sheerin seemed to see the columnist for the first time .  he frowned and blew his ample cheeks out .     and just who in lagash are you  redhead .     aton compressed his lips and then muttered sullenly     that   s theremon      the newspaper fellow .  i suppose you   ve heard of him .     the columnist offered his hand .     and  of course  you   re sheerin     of saro university .  i   ve heard of you .     then he repeated     what is this hideout  sir .        well     said sheerin     we have managed to convince a few people of the validity of our prophecy of    er    doom  to be spectacular about it  and those few have taken proper measures .  they consist mainly of the immediate members of the families of the observatory staff  certain of the faculty of saro university  and a few outsiders .  altogether  they number about three hundred  but three quarters are women and children .        i see .  they   re supposed to hide where the darkness and the    er    stars can   t get at them  and then hold out when the rest of the world goes poof .        if they can .  it won   t be easy .  with all of mankind insane  with the great cities going up in flames    environment will not be conducive to survival .  but they have food  water  shelter  and weapons           they   ve got more     said aton .     they   ve got all our records  except for what we will collect today .  those records will mean everything to the next cycle  and that   s what must survive .  the rest can go hang .     theremon uttered a long  low whistle and sat brooding for several minutes .  the men about the table had brought out a multi chess board and started a six member game .  moves were made rapidly and in silence .  all eyes bent in furious concentration on the board .  theremon watched them intently and then rose and approached aton  who sat apart in whispered conversation with sheerin .     listen     he said  let   s go somewhere where we won   t bother the rest of the fellows .  i want to ask some questions .     the aged astronomer frowned sourly at him  but sheerin chirped up     certainly .  it will do me good to talk .  it always does .  aton was telling me about your ideas concerning world reaction to a failure of the prediction    and i agree with you .  i read your column pretty regularly  by the way  and as a general thing i like your views .        please  sheerin     growled aton .     eh .  oh  all right .  we   ll go into the next room .  it has softer chairs  anyway .     there were softer chairs in the next room .  there were also thick red curtains on the windows and a maroon carpet on the floor .  with the bricky light of beta pouring in  the general effect was one of dried blood .  theremon shuddered .     say  i   d give ten credits for a decent dose of white light for just a second .  i wish gamma or delta were in the sky .        what are your questions .     asked aton .     please remember that our time is limited .  in a little over an hour and a quarter we   re going upstairs  and after that there will be no time for talk .        well  here it is .     theremon leaned back and folded his hands on his chest .     you people seem so all fired serious about this that i   m beginning to believe you .  would you mind explaining what it   s all about .     aton exploded     do you mean to sit there and tell me that you   ve been bombarding us with ridicule without even finding out what we   ve been trying to say .     the columnist grinned sheepishly .     it   s not that bad  sir .  i   ve got the general idea .  you say there is going to be a world wide darkness in a few hours and that all mankind will go violently insane .  what i want now is the science behind it .        no  you don   t .  no  you don   t     broke in sheerin .     if you ask aton for that    supposing him to be in the mood to answer at all    he   ll trot out pages of figures and volumes of graphs .  you won   t make head or tail of it .  now if you were to ask me  i could give you the layman   s standpoint .        all right  i ask you .        then first i   d like a drink .     he rubbed his hands and looked at aton .     water .     grunted aton .     don   t be silly .        don   t you be silly .  no alcohol today .  it would be too easy to get my men drunk .  i can   t afford to tempt them .     the psychologist grumbled wordlessly .  he turned to theremon  impaled him with his sharp eyes  and began .     you realize  of course  that the history of civilization on lagash displays a cyclic character    but i mean cyclic .        i know     replied theremon cautiously     that that is the current archaeological theory .  has it been accepted as a fact .        just about .  in this last century it   s been generally agreed upon .  this cyclic character is    or rather  was    one of the great mysteries .  we   ve located series of civilizations  nine of them definitely  and indications of others as well  all of which have reached heights comparable to our own  and all of which  without exception  were destroyed by fire at the very height of their culture .     and no one could tell why .  all centers of culture were thoroughly gutted by fire  with nothing left behind to give a hint as to the cause .     theremon was following closely .     wasn   t there a stone age  too .        probably  but as yet practically nothing is known of it  except that men of that age were little more than rather intelligent apes .  we can forget about that .        i see .  go on .     there have been explanations of these recurrent catastrophes  all of a more or less fantastic nature .  some say that there are periodic rains of fire  some that lagash passes through a sun every so often  some even wilder things .  but there is one theory  quite different from all of these  that has been handed down over a period of centuries .        i know .  you mean this myth of the    stars    that the cultists have in their book of revelations .        exactly     rejoined sheerin with satisfaction .     the cultists said that every two thousand and fifty years lagash entered a huge cave  so that all the suns disappeared  and there came total darkness all over the world .  and then  they say  things called stars appeared  which robbed men of their souls and left them unreasoning brutes  so that they destroyed the civilization they themselves had built up .  of course they mix all this up with a lot of religio mystic notions  but that   s the central idea .     there was a short pause in which sheerin drew a long breath .     and now we come to the theory of universal gravitation .     he pronounced the phrase so that the capital letters sounded    and at that point aton turned from the window  snorted loudly  and stalked out of the room .  the two stared after him  and theremon said     what   s wrong .        nothing in particular     replied sheerin .     two of the men were due several hours ago and haven   t shown up yet .  he   s terrifically short handed  of course  because all but the really essential men have gone to the hideout .        you don   t think the two deserted  do you .        who .  faro and yimot .  of course not .  still  if they   re not back within the hour  things would be a little sticky .     he got to his feet suddenly  and his eyes twinkled .     anyway  as long as aton is gone        tiptoeing to the nearest window  he squatted  and from the low window box beneath withdrew a bottle of red liquid that gurgled suggestively when he shook it .     i thought aton didn   t know about this     he remarked as he trotted back to the table .     here .  we   ve only got one glass so  as the guest  you can have it .  i   ll keep the bottle .     and he filled the tiny cup with judicious care .  theremon rose to protest  but sheerin eyed him sternly .     respect your elders  young man .     the newsman seated himself with a look of anguish on his face .     go ahead  then  you old villain .     the psychologist   s adam   s apple wobbled as the bottle upended  and then  with a satisfied grunt and a smack of the lips  he began again .     but what do you know about gravitation .        nothing  except that it is a very recent development  not too well established  and that the math is so hard that only twelve men in lagash are supposed to understand it .        tcha .  nonsense .  baloney .  i can give you all the essential math in a sentence .  the law of universal gravitation states that there exists a cohesive force among all bodies of the universe  such that the amount of this force between any two given bodies is proportional to the product of their masses divided by the square of the distance between them .        is that all .        that   s enough .  it took four hundred years to develop it .        why that long .  it sounded simple enough  the way you said it .        because great laws are not divined by flashes of inspiration  whatever you may think .  it usually takes the combined work of a world full of scientists over a period of centuries .  after genovi    discovered that lagash rotated about the sun alpha rather than vice versa    and that was four hundred years ago    astronomers have been working .  the complex motions of the six suns were recorded and analyzed and unwoven .  theory after theory was advanced and checked and counterchecked and modified and abandoned and revived and converted to something else .  it was a devil of a job .     theremon nodded thoughtfully and held out his glass for more liquor .  sheerin grudgingly allowed a few ruby drops to leave the bottle .     it was twenty years ago     he continued after remoistening his own throat     that it was finally demonstrated that the law of universal gravitation accounted exactly for the orbital motions of the six suns .  it was a great triumph .     sheerin stood up and walked to the window  still clutching his bottle .     and now we   re getting to the point .  in the last decade  the motions of lagash about alpha were computed according to gravity  and if did not account for the orbit observed  not even when all perturbations due to the other suns were included .  either the law was invalid  or there was another  as yet unknown  factor involved .     theremon joined sheerin at the window and gazed out past the wooded slopes to where the spires of saro city gleamed bloodily on the horizon .  the newsman felt the tension of uncertainty grow within him as he cast a short glance at beta .  it glowered redly at zenith  dwarfed and evil .     go ahead  sir     he said softly .  sheerin replied     astronomers stumbled about for year  each proposed theory more untenable than the one before    until aton had the inspiration of calling in the cult .  the head of the cult  sor    had access to certain data that simplified the problem considerably .  aton set to work on a new track .     what if there were another nonluminous planetary body such as lagash .  if there were  you know  it would shine only by reflected light  and if it were composed of bluish rock  as lagash itself largely is  then  in the redness of the sky  the eternal blaze of the suns would make it invisible    drown it out completely .     theremon whistled .     what a screwy idea .        you think that   s screwy .  listen to this  suppose this body rotated about lagash at such a distance and in such an orbit and had such a mass that its attention would exactly account for the deviations of lagash   s orbit from theory    do you know what would happen .     the columnist shook his head .     well  sometimes this body would get in the way of a sun .     and sheerin emptied what remained in the bottle at a draft .     and it does  i suppose     said theremon flatly .     yes .  but only one sun lies in its plane of revolution .     he jerked a thumb at the shrunken sun above .     beta .  and it has been shown that the eclipse will occur only when the arrangement of the suns is such that beta is alone in its hemisphere and at maximum distance  at which time the moon is invariably at minimum distance .  the eclipse that results  with the moon seven times the apparent diameter of beta  covers all of lagash and lasts well over half a day  so that no spot on the planet escapes the effects .  that eclipse comes once every two thousand and forty nine years .     theremon   s face was drawn into an expressionless mask .     and that   s my story .     the psychologist nodded .     that   s all of it .  first the eclipse    which will start in three quarters of an hour    then universal darkness and  maybe  these mysterious stars    then madness  and end of the cycle .     he brooded .     we had two months    leeway    we at the observatory    and that wasn   t enough time to persuade lagash of the danger .  two centuries might not have been enough .  but our records are at the hideout  and today we photograph the eclipse .  the next cycle will start off with the truth  and when the next eclipse comes  mankind will at last be ready for it .  come to think of it  that   s part of your story too .     a thin wind ruffled the curtains at the window as theremon opened it and leaned out .  it played coldly with his hair as he stared at the crimson sunlight on his hand .  then he turned in sudden rebellion .     what is there in darkness to drive me mad .     sheerin smiled to himself as he spun the empty liquor bottle with abstracted motions of his hand .     have you ever experienced darkness  young man .     the newsman leaned against the wall and considered .     no .  can   t say i have .  but i know what it is .  just    uh        he made vague motions with his fingers and then brightened .     just no light .  like in caves .          have you ever been in a cave .        in a cave .  of course not .        i thought not .  i tried last week    just to see    but i got out in a hurry .  i went in until the mouth of the cave was just visible as a blur of light  with black everywhere else .  i never thought a person my weight could run that fast .     theremon   s lip curled .     well  if it comes to that  i guess i wouldn   t have run if i had been there .     the psychologist studied the young man with an annoyed frown .     my  don   t you talk big .  i dare you to draw the curtain .     theremon looked his surprise and said     what for .  if we had four or five suns out there  we might want to cut the light down a bit for comfort  but now we haven   t enough light as it is .        that   s the point .  just draw the curtain  then come here and sit down .        all right .     theremon reached for the tasseled string and jerked .  the red curtain slid across the wide window  the brass rings hissing their way along the crossbar  and a dusk red shadow clamped down on the room .  theremon   s footsteps sounded hollowly in the silence as he made his way to the table  and then they stopped halfway .     i can   t see you  sir     he whispered .     feel your way     ordered sheerin in a strained voice .     but i can   t see you  sir .     the newsman was breathing harshly .     i can   t see anything .        what did you expect .     came the grim reply .     come here and sit down .     the footsteps sounded again  waveringly  approaching slowly .  there was the sound of someone fumbling with a chair .  theremon   s voice came thinly     here i am .  i feel  .   .   .  ulp  .   .   .  all right .        you like it  do you .        n    no .  it   s pretty awful .  the walls seem to be        he paused .     they seem to be closing in on me .  i keep wanting to push them away .  but i   m not going mad .  in fact  the feeling isn   t as bad as it was .        all right .  draw the curtain back again .     there were cautious footsteps through the dark  the rustle of theremon   s body against the curtain as he felt for the tassel  and then the triumphant roo osh of the curtain slithering back .  red light flooded the room  and with a cry of joy theremon looked up at the sun .  sheerin wiped the moistness off his forehead with the back of a hand and said shakily     and that was just a dark room .        it can be stood     said theremon lightly .     yes  a dark room can .  but were you at the jonglor centennial exposition two years ago .        no  it so happens i never got around to it .  six thousand miles was just a bit too much to travel  even for the exposition .        well  i was there .  you remember hearing about the    tunnel of mystery    that broke all records in the amusement area    for the first month or so  anyway .        yes .  wasn   t there some fuss about it .        very little .  it was hushed up .  you see  that tunnel of mystery was just a mile long tunnel    with no lights .  you got into a little open car and jolted along through darkness for fifteen minutes .  it was very popular    while it lasted .        popular .        certainly .  there   s a fascination in being frightened when it   s part of a game .  a baby is born with three instinctive fears  of loud noises  of falling  and of the absence of light .  that   s why it   s considered so funny to jump at someone and shout    boo .     that   s why it   s such fun to ride a roller coaster .  and that   s why that tunnel of mystery started cleaning up .  people came out of that darkness shaking  breathless  half dead with fear  but they kept on paying to get in .        wait a while  i remember now .  some people came out dead  didn   t they .  there were rumors of that after it shut down .     the psychologist snorted .     bah .  two or three died .  that was nothing .  they paid off the families of the dead ones and argued the jonglor city council into forgetting it .  after all  they said  if people with weak hearts want to go through the tunnel  it was at their own risk    and besides  it wouldn   t happen again .  so they put a doctor in the front office and had every customer go through a physical examination before getting into the car .  that actually boosted ticket sales .        well  then .        but you see  there was something else .  people sometimes came out in perfect order  except that they refused to go into buildings    any buildings  including palaces  mansions  apartment houses  tenements  cottages  huts  shacks  lean tos  and tents .     theremon looked shocked .     you mean they refused to come in out of the open .  where   d they sleep .        in the open .        they should have forced them inside .        oh  they did  they did .  whereupon these people went into violent hysterics and did their best to bat their brains out against the nearest wall .  once you got them inside  you couldn   t keep them there without a strait jacket or a heavy dose of tranquilizer .        they must have been crazy .        which is exactly what they were .  one person out of every ten who went into that tunnel came out that way .  they called in the psychologists  and we did the only thing possible .  we closed down the exhibit .     he spread his hands .     what was the matter with these people .     asked theremon finally .     essentially the same thing that was the matter with you when you thought the walls of the room were crushing in on you in the dark .  there is a psychological term for mankind   s instinctive fear of the absence of light .  we call it    claustrophobia     because the lack of light is always tied up with enclosed places  so that fear of one is fear of the other .  you see .        and those people of the tunnel .        those people of the tunnel consisted of those unfortunates whose mentality did not quite possess the resiliency to overcome the claustrophobia that overtook them in the darkness .  fifteen minutes without light is a long time  you only had two or three minutes  and i believe you were fairly upset .     the people of the tunnel had what is called a    claustrophobic fixation    .  their latent fear of darkness and enclosed places had crystalized and become active  and  as far as we can tell  permanent .  that   s what fifteen minutes in the dark will do .     there was a long silence  and theremon   s forehead wrinkled slowly into a frown .     i don   t believe it   s that bad .        you mean you don   t want to believe     snapped sheerin .     you   re afraid to believe .  look out the window .     theremon did so  and the psychologist continued without pausing .     imagine darkness    everywhere .  no light  as far as you can see .  the houses  the trees  the fields  the earth  the sky    black .  and stars thrown in  for all i know    whatever they are .  can you conceive it .        yes  i can     declared theremon truculently .  and sheerin slammed his fist down upon the table in sudden passion .     you lie .  you can   t conceive that .  your brain wasn   t built for the conception any more than it was built for the conception of infinity or of eternity .  you can only talk about it .  a fraction of the reality upsets you  and when the real thing comes  your brain is going to be presented with the phenomenon outside its limits of comprehension .  you will go mad  completely and permanently .  there is no question of it .     he added sadly     and another couple of millennia of painful struggle comes to nothing .  tomorrow there won   t be a city standing unharmed in all lagash .     theremon recovered part of his mental equilibrium .     that doesn   t follow .  i still don   t see that i can go loony just because there isn   t a sun in the sky    but even if i did  and everyone else did  how does that harm the cities .  are we going to blow them down .     but sheerin was angry  too .     if you were in darkness  what would you want more than anything else  what would it be that every instinct would call for .  light  damn you  light .        well .        and how would you get light .        i don   t know     said theremon flatly .     what   s the only way to get light  short of a sun .        how should i know .     they were standing face to face and nose to nose .  sheerin said     you burn something  mister .  ever see a forest fire .  ever go camping and cook a stew over a wood fire .  heat isn   t the only thing burning wood gives off  you know .  it gives off light  and people know that .  and when it   s dark they want light  and they   re going to get it .        so they burn wood .        so they burn whatever they can get .  they   ve got to have light .  they   ve got to burn something  and wood isn   t handy    so they   ll burn whatever is nearest .  they   ll have their light    and every center of habitation goes up in flames .     eyes held each other as though the whole matter were a personal affair of respective will powers  and then theremon broke away wordlessly .  his breathing was harsh and ragged  and he scarcely noted the sudden hubbub that came from the adjoining room behind the closed door .  sheerin spoke  and it was with an effort that he made it sound matter of fact .     i think i heard yimot   s voice .  he and faro are probably back .  let   s go in and see what kept them .        might as well .     muttered theremon .  he drew a long breath and seemed to shake himself .  the tension was broken .   the room was in an uproar  with members of the staff clustering about two young men who were removing outer garments even as they parried the miscellany of questions being thrown at them .  aton bustled through the crowd and faced the newcomers angrily .     do you realize that it   s less than half an hour before deadline .  where have you two been .     faro    seated himself and rubbed his hands .  his cheeks were red with the outdoor chill .     yimot and i have just finished carrying through a little crazy experiment of our own .  we   ve been trying to see if we couldn   t construct an arrangement by which we could simulate the appearance of darkness and stars so as to get an advance notion as to how it looked .     there was a confused murmur from the listeners  and a sudden look of interest entered aton   s eyes .     there wasn   t anything said of this before .  how did you go about it .        well     said faro     the idea came to yimot and myself long ago  and we   ve been working it out in our spare time .  yimot knew of a low one story house down in the city with a domed roof    it had once been used as a museum  i think .  anyway  we bought it           where did you get the money .     interrupted aton peremptorily .     our bank accounts     grunted yimot    .     it cost two thousand credits .     then  defensively     well  what of it .  tomorrow  two thousand credits will be two thousand pieces of paper .  that   s all .        sure .     agreed faro .     we bought the place and rigged it up with black velvet from top to bottom so as to get as perfect a darkness as possible .  then we punched tiny holes in the ceiling and through the roof and covered them with little metal caps  all of which could be shoved aside simultaneously at the close of a switch .  at least we didn   t do that part ourselves  we got a carpenter and an electrician and some others    money didn   t count .  the point was that we could get the light to shine through those holes in the roof  so that we could get a starlike effect .     not a breath was drawn during the pause that followed .  aton said stiffly     you had no right to make a private        faro seemed abashed .     i know  sir    but frankly  yimot and i thought the experiment was a little dangerous .  if the effect really worked  we half expected to go mad    from what sheerin says about all this  we thought that would be rather likely .  we wanted to take the risk ourselves .  of course if we found we could retain sanity  it occurred to us that we might develop immunity to the real thing  and then expose the rest of you the same way .  but things didn   t work out at all           why  what happened .     it was yimot who answered .     we shut ourselves in and allowed our eyes to get accustomed to the dark .  it   s an extremely creepy feeling because the total darkness makes you feel as if the walls and ceiling are crushing in on you .  but we got over that and pulled the switch .  the caps fell away and the roof glittered all over with little dots of light           well .        well    nothing .  that was the whacky part of it .  nothing happened .  it was just a roof with holes in it  and that   s just what it looked like .  we tried it over and over again    that   s what kept us so late    but there just isn   t any effect at all .     there followed a shocked silence  and all eyes turned to sheerin  who sat motionless  mouth open .  theremon was the first to speak .     you know what this does to this whole theory you   ve built up  sheerin  don   t you .     he was grinning with relief .  but sheerin raised his hand .     now wait a while .  just let me think this through .     and then he snapped his fingers  and when he lifted his head there was neither surprise nor uncertainty in his eyes .     of course        he never finished .  from somewhere up above there sounded a sharp clang  and beenay  starting to his feet  dashed up the stairs with a    what the devil .     the rest followed after .  things happened quickly .  once up in the dome  beenay cast one horrified glance at the shattered photographic plates and at the man bending over them  and then hurled himself fiercely at the intruder  getting a death grip on his throat .  there was a wild threshing  and as others of the staff joined in  the stranger was swallowed up and smothered under the weight of half a dozen angry men .  aton came up last  breathing heavily .     let him up .     there was a reluctant unscrambling and the stranger  panting harshly  with his clothes torn and his forehead bruised  was hauled to his feet .  he had a short yellow beard curled elaborately in the style affected by the cultists .  beenay shifted his hold to a collar grip and shook the man savagely .     all right  rat  what   s the idea .  these plates           i wasn   t after them     retorted the cultist coldly .     that was an accident .     beenay followed his glowering stare and snarled     i see .  you were after the cameras themselves .  the accident with the plates was a stroke of luck for you  then .  if you had touched snapping bertha or any of the others  you would have died by slow torture .  as it is        he drew his fist back .  aton grabbed his sleeve .     stop that .  let him go .     the young technician wavered  and his arm dropped reluctantly .  aton pushed him aside and confronted the cultist .     you   re latimer  aren   t you .     the cultist bowed stiffly and indicated the symbol upon his hip .  i am latimer     adjutant of the third class to his serenity  sor   .        and       aton   s white eyebrows lifted       you were with his serenity when he visited me last week  weren   t you .     latimer bowed a second time .     now  then  what do you want .        nothing that you would give me of your own free will .        sor   sent you  i suppose    or is this your own idea .        i won   t answer that question .        will there be any further visitors .        i won   t answer that  either .     aton glanced at his timepiece and scowled .     now  man  what is it your master wants of me .  i have fulfilled my end of the bargain .     latimer smiled faintly  but said nothing .     i asked him     continued aton angrily     for data only the cult could supply  and it was given to me .  for that  thank you .  in return i promised to prove the essential truth of the creed of the cult .        there was no need to prove that     came the proud retort .  it stands proven by the book of revelations .        for the handful that constitute the cult  yes .  don   t pretend to mistake my meaning .  i offered to present scientific backing for your beliefs .  and i did .     the cultist   s eyes narrowed bitterly .     yes  you did    with a fox   s subtlety  for your pretended explanation backed our beliefs  and at the same time removed all necessity for them .  you made of the darkness and of the stars a natural phenomenon and removed all its real significance .  that was blasphemy .        if so  the fault isn   t mine .  the facts exist .  what can i do but state them .        your    facts    are a fraud and a delusion .     aton stamped angrily .     how do you know .     and the answer came with the certainty of absolute faith .     i know .     the director purpled and beenay whispered urgently .  aton waved him silent .     and what does sor   want us to do .  he still thinks .  i suppose  that in trying to warn the world to take measures against the menace of madness  we are placing innumerable souls in jeopardy .  we aren   t succeeding  if that means anything to him .        the attempt itself has done harm enough  and your vicious effort to gain information by means of your devilish instruments must be stopped .  we obey the will of the stars  and i only regret that my clumsiness prevented me from wrecking your infernal devices .        it wouldn   t have done you too much good     returned aton .     all our data  except for the direct evidence we intend collecting right now  is already safely cached and well beyond possibility of harm .     he smiled grimly .     but that does not affect your present status as an attempted burglar and criminal .     he turned to the men behind him .     someone call the police at saro city .     there was a cry of distaste from sheerin .     damn it  aton  what   s wrong with you .  there   s no time for that .  here       he hustled his way forward       let me handle this .     aton stared down his nose at the psychologist .     this is not the time for your monkeyshines  sheerin .  will you please let me handle this my own way .  right now you are a complete outsider here  and don   t forget it .     sheerin   s mouth twisted eloquently .     now why should we go to the impossible trouble of calling the police    with beta   s eclipse a matter of minutes from now    when this young man here is perfectly willing to pledge his word of honor to remain and cause no trouble whatsoever .     the cultist answered promptly     i will do no such thing .  you   re free to do what you want  but it   s only fair to warn you that just as soon as i get my chance i   m going to finish what i came out here to do .  if it   s my word of honor you   re relying on  you   d better call the police .     sheerin smiled in a friendly fashion .     you   re a determined cuss  aren   t you .  well  i   ll explain something .  do you see that young man at the window .  he   s a strong  husky fellow  quite handy with his fists  and he   s an outsider besides .  once the eclipse starts there will be nothing for him to do except keep an eye on you .  besides him  there will be myself    a little too stout for active fisticuffs  but still able to help .        well  what of it .     demanded latimer frozenly .     listen and i   ll tell you     was the reply .     just as soon as the eclipse starts  we   re going to take you  theremon and i  and deposit you in a little closet with one door  to which is attached one giant lock and no windows .  you will remain there for the duration .        and afterward     breathed latimer fiercely     there   ll be no one to let me out .  i know as well as you do what the coming of the stars means    i know it far better than you .  with all your minds gone  you are not likely to free me .  suffocation or slow starvation  is it .  about what i might have expected from a group of scientists .  but i don   t give my word .  it   s a matter of principle  and i won   t discuss it further .     aton seemed perturbed .  his faded eyes were troubled .     really  sheerin  locking him           please .     sheerin motioned him impatiently to silence .     i don   t think for a moment things will go that far .  latimer has just tried a clever little bluff  but i   m not a psychologist just because i like the sound of the word .     he grinned at the cultist .     come now  you don   t really think i   m trying anything as crude as slow starvation .  my dear latimer  if i lock you in the closet  you are not going to see the darkness  and you are not going to see the stars .  it does not take much knowledge of the fundamental creed of the cult to realize that for you to be hidden from the stars when they appear means the loss of your immortal soul .  now  i believe you to be an honorable man .  i   ll accept your word of honor to make no further effort to disrupt proceedings  if you   ll offer it .     a vein throbbed in latimer   s temple  and he seemed to shrink within himself as he said thickly     you have it .     and then he added with swift fury .     but it is my consolation that you will all be damned for your deeds of today .     he turned on his heel and stalked to the high three legged stool by the door .  sheerin nodded to the columnist .     take a seat next to him  theremon    just as a formality .  hey  theremon .     but the newspaperman didn   t move .  he had gone pale to the lips .     look at that .     the finger he pointed toward the sky shook  and his voice was dry and cracked .  there was one simultaneous gasp as every eye followed the pointing finger and  for one breathless moment  stared frozenly .  beta was chipped on one side .  the tiny bit of encroaching blackness was perhaps the width of a fingernail  but to the staring watchers it magnified itself into the crack of doom .  only for a moment they watched  and after that there was a shrieking confusion that was even shorter of duration and which gave way to an orderly scurry of activity    each man at his prescribed job .  at the crucial moment there was no time for emotion .  the men were merely scientists with work to do .  even aton had melted away .  sheerin said prosaically .     first contact must have been made fifteen minutes ago .  a little early  but pretty good considering the uncertainties involved in the calculation .     he looked about him and then tiptoed to theremon  who still remained staring out the window  and dragged him away gently .     aton is furious     he whispered     so stay away .  he missed first contact on account of this fuss with latimer  and if you get in his way he   ll have you thrown out the window .     theremon nodded shortly and sat down .  sheerin stared in surprise at him .     the devil  man     he exclaimed     you   re shaking .        eh .     theremon licked dry lips and then tried to smile .     i don   t feel very well  and that   s a fact .     the psychologist   s eyes hardened .     you   re not losing your nerve .        no .     cried theremon in a flash of indignation .     give me a chance  will you .  i haven   t really believed this rigmarole    not way down beneath  anyway    till just this minute .  give me a chance to get used to the idea .  you   ve been preparing yourself for two months or more .        you   re right  at that     replied sheerin thoughtfully .     listen .  have you got a family    parents  wife  children .     theremon shook his head .     you mean the hideout  i suppose .  no  you don   t have to worry about that .  i have a sister  but she   s two thousand miles away .  i don   t even know her exact address .        well  then  what about yourself .  you   ve got time to get there  and they   re one short anyway  since i left .  after all  you   re not needed here  and you   d make a darned fine addition        theremon looked at the other wearily .     you think i   m scared stiff  don   t you .  well  get this  mister .  i   m a newspaperman and i   ve been assigned to cover a story .  i intend covering it .     there was a faint smile on the psychologist   s face .     i see .  professional honor  is that it .        you might call it that .  but  man .  i   d give my right arm for another bottle of that sockeroo juice even half the size of the one you bogged .  if ever a fellow needed a drink  i do .     he broke off .  sheerin was nudging him violently .     do you hear that .  listen .     theremon followed the motion of the other   s chin and stared at the cultist  who  oblivious to all about him  faced the window  a look of wild elation on his face  droning to himself the while in singsong fashion .     what   s he saying .     whispered the columnist .     he   s quoting book of revelations  fifth chapter     replied sheerin .  then  urgently     keep quiet and listen  i tell you .     the cultist   s voice had risen in a sudden increase of fervor         and it came to pass that in those days the sun  beta  held lone vigil in the sky for ever longer periods asthe revolutions passed  until such time as for full half a revolution  it alone  shrunken and cold  shone down upon lagash .         and men did assemble in the public squares and in the highways  there to debate and to marvel at the sight  for a strange depression had seized them .  their minds were troubled and their speech confused  for the souls of men awaited the coming of the stars .         and in the city of trigon  at high noon  vendret   came forth and said unto the men of trigon     lo  ye sinners .  though ye scorn the ways of righteousness  yet will the time of reckoning come .  even now the cave approaches to swallow lagash  yea  and all it contains .            and even as he spoke the lip of the cave of darkness passed the edge of beta so that to all lagash it was hidden from sight .  loud were the cries of men as it vanished  and great the fear of soul that fell upon them .         it came to pass that the darkness of the cave fell upon lagash  and there was no light on all the surface of lagash .  men were even as blinded  nor could one man see his neighbor  though he felt his breath upon his face .         and in this blackness there appeared the stars  in countless numbers  and to the strains of music of such beauty that the very leaves of the trees cried out in wonder .         and in that moment the souls of men departed from them  and their abandoned bodies became even as beasts  yea  even as brutes of the wild  so that through the blackened streets of the cities of lagash they prowled with wild cries .         from the stars there then reached down the heavenly flame  and where it touched  the cities of lagash flamed to utter destruction  so that of man and of the works of man nought remained .         even then            there was a subtle change in latimer   s tone .  his eyes had not shifted  but somehow he had become aware of the absorbed attention of the other two .  easily  without pausing for breath  the timbre of his voice shifted and the syllables became more liquid .  theremon  caught by surprise  stared .  the words seemed on the border of familiarity .  there was an elusive shift in the accent  a tiny change in the vowel stress  nothing more    yet latimer had become thoroughly unintelligible .  sheerin smiled slyly .     he shifted to some old cycle tongue  probably their traditional second cycle .  that was the language in which the book of revelations was originally written  you know .        it doesn   t matter  i   ve heard enough .     theremon shoved his chair back and brushed his hair back with hands that no longer shook .     i feel much better now .        you do .     sheerin seemed mildly surprised .     i   ll say i do .  i had a bad case of jitters just a while back .  listening to you and your gravitation and seeing that eclipse start almost finished me .  but this       he jerked a contemptuous thumb at the yellow bearded cultist       this is the sort of thing my nurse used to tell me .  i   ve been laughing at that sort of thing all my life .  i   m not going to let it scare me now .     he drew a deep breath and said with a hectic gaiety     but if i expect to keep on the good side of myself .  i   m going to turn my chair away from the window .     sheerin said     yes  but you   d better talk lower .  aton just lifted his head out of that box he   s got it stuck into and gave you a look that should have killed you .     theremon made a mouth .     i forgot about the old fellow .     with elaborate care he turned the chair from the window  cast one distasteful look over his shoulder  and said     it has occurred to me that there must be considerable immunity against this star madness .     the psychologist did not answer immediately .  beta was past its zenith now  and the square of bloody sunlight that outlined the window upon the floor had lifted into sheerin   s lap .  he stared at its dusky color thoughtfully and then bent and squinted into the sun itself .  the chip in its side had grown to a black encroachment that covered a third of beta .  he shuddered  and when he straightened once more his florid cheeks did not contain quite as much color as they had had previously .  with a smile that was almost apologetic  he reversed his chair also .     there are probably two million people in saro city that are all trying to join the cult at once in one gigantic revival .     then  ironically .     the cult is in for an hour of unexampled prosperity .  i trust they   ll make the most of it .  now  what was it you said .        just this .  how did the cultists manage to keep the book of revelations going from cycle to cycle  and how on lagash did it get written in the first place .  there must have been some sort of immunity  for if everyone had gone mad  who would be left to write the book .     sheerin stared at his questioner ruefully .     well  now  young man  there isn   t any eyewitness answer to that  but we   ve got a few damned good notions as to what happened .  you see  there are three kinds of people who might remain relatively unaffected .  first  the very few who don   t see the stars at all  the seriously retarded or those who drink themselves into a stupor at the beginning of the eclipse and remain so to the end .  we leave them out    because they aren   t really witnesses .     then there are children below six  to whom the world as a whole is too new and strange for them to be too frightened at stars and darkness .  they would be just another item in an already surprising world .  you see that  don   t you .     the other nodded doubtfully .     i suppose so .        lastly  there are those whose minds are too coarsely grained to be entirely toppled .  the very insensitive would be scarcely affected    oh  such people as some of our older  work broken peasants .  well  the children would have fugitive memories  and that  combined with the confused  incoherent babblings of the half mad morons  formed the basis for the book of revelations .     naturally  the book was based  in the first place  on the testimony of those least qualified to serve as historians  that is  children and morons  and was probably edited and re edited through the cycles .        do you suppose     broke in theremon     that they carried the book through the cycles the way we   re planning on handing on the secret of gravitation .     sheerin shrugged .     perhaps  but their exact method is unimportant .  they do it  somehow .  the point i was getting at was that the book can   t help but be a mass of distortion  even if it is based on fact .  for instance  do you remember the experiment with the holes in the roof that faro and yimot tried    the one that didn   t work .        yes .        you know why it didn   t w        he stopped and rose in alarm  for aton was approaching  his face a twisted mask of consternation .     what   s happened .     aton drew him aside and sheerin could feel the fingers on his elbow twitching .     not so loud .     aton   s voice was low and tortured .     i   ve just gotten word from the hideout on the private line .     sheerin broke in anxiously .     they are in trouble .        not they .     aton stressed the pronoun significantly .     they sealed themselves off just a while ago  and they   re going to stay buried till day after tomorrow .  they   re safe .  but the city .  sheerin    it   s a shambles .  you have no idea        he was having difficulty in speaking .     well .     snapped sheerin impatiently .     what of it .  it will get worse .  what are you shaking about .     then  suspiciously     how do you feel .     aton   s eyes sparked angrily at the insinuation  and then faded to anxiety once more .     you don   t understand .  the cultists are active .  they   re rousing the people to storm the observatory    promising them immediate entrance into grace  promising them salvation  promising them anything .  what are we to do  sheerin .     sheerin   s head bent  and he stared in long abstraction at his toes .  he tapped his chin with one knuckle  then looked up and said crisply     do .  what is there to do .  nothing at all .  do the men know of this .        no  of course not .        good .  keep it that way .  how long till totality .        not quite an hour .        there   s nothing to do but gamble .  it will take time to organize any really formidable mob  and it will take more time to get them out here .  we   re a good five miles from the city        he glared out the window  down the slopes to where the farmed patches gave way to clumps of white houses in the suburbs  down to where the metropolis itself was a blur on the horizon    a mist in the waning blaze of beta .  he repeated without turning .     it will take time .  keep on working and pray that totality comes first .     beta was cut in half  the line of division pushing a slight concavity into the still bright portion of the sun .  it was like a gigantic eyelid shutting slantwise over the light of a world .  the faint clatter of the room in which he stood faded into oblivion  and he sensed only the thick silence of the fields outside .  the very insects seemed frightened mute .  and things were dim .  he jumped at the voice in his ear .  theremon said .     is something wrong .        eh .  er    no .  get back to the chair .  we   re in the way .     they slipped back to their comer  but the psychologist did not speak for a time .  he lifted a finger and loosened his collar .  he twisted his neck back and forth but found no relief .  he looked up suddenly .     are you having any difficulty in breathing .     the newspaperman opened his eyes wide and drew two or three long breaths .     no .  why .        i looked out the window too long  i suppose .  the dimness got me .  difficulty in breathing is one of the first symptoms of a claustrophobic attack .      theremon drew another long breath .     well  it hasn   t got me yet .  say  here   s another of the fellows .     beenay had interposed his bulk between the light and the pair in the corner  and sheerin squinted up at him anxiously .     hello  beenay .     the astronomer shifted his weight to the other foot and smiled feebly .     you won   t mind if i sit down awhile and join in the talk .  my cameras are set  and there   s nothing to do till totality .     he paused and eyed the cultist  who fifteen minutes earlier had drawn a small  skin bound book from his sleeve and had been poring intently over it ever since .     that rat hasn   t been making trouble  has he .     sheerin shook his head .  his shoulders were thrown back and he frowned his concentration as he forced himself to breathe regularly .  he said     have you had any trouble breathing  beenay .     beenay sniffed the air in his turn .     it doesn   t seem stuffy to me .        a touch of claustrophobia     explained sheerin apologetically .     ohhh .  it worked itself differently with me .  i get the impression that my eyes are going back on me .  things seem to blur and    well  nothing is clear .  and it   s cold  too .        oh  it   s cold  all right .  that   s no illusion .     theremon grimaced .     my toes feel as if i   ve been shipping them cross country in a refrigerating car .        what we need     put in sheerin     is to keep our minds busy with extraneous affairs .  i was telling you a while ago  theremon  why faro   s experiments with the holes in the roof came to nothing .        you were just beginning     replied theremon .  he encircled a knee with both arms and nuzzled his chin against it .     well  as i started to say  they were misled by taking the book of revelations literally .  there probably wasn   t any sense in attaching any physical significance to the stars .  it might be  you know  that in the presence of total darkness  the mind finds it absolutely necessary to create light .  this illusion of light might be all the stars there really are .        in other words     interposed theremon     you mean the stars arc the results of the madness and not one of the causes .  then  what good will beenay   s photographs be .        to prove that it is an illusion  maybe  or to prove the opposite  for all i know .  then again        but beenay had drawn his chair closer  and there was an expression of sudden enthusiasm on his face .     say  i   m glad you two got onto this subject .     his eyes narrowed and he lifted one finger .     i   ve been thinking about these stars and i   ve got a really cute notion .  of course it   s strictly ocean foam  and i   m not trying to advance it seriously  but i think it   s interesting .  do you want to hear it .     he seemed half reluctant  but sheerin leaned back and said     go ahead .  i   m listening .        well  then  supposing there were other suns in the universe .     he broke off a little bashfully .     i mean suns that are so far away that they   re too dim to see .  it sounds as if i   ve been reading some of that fantastic fiction  i suppose .        not necessarily .  still  isn   t that possibility eliminated by the fact that  according to the law of gravitation  they would make themselves evident by their attractive forces .        not if they were far enough off     rejoined beenay     really far off    maybe as much as four light years  or even more .  we   d never be able to detect perturbations then  because they   d be too small .  say that there were a lot of suns that far off  a dozen or two  maybe .     theremon whistled melodiously .     what an idea for a good sunday supplement article .  two dozen suns in a universe eight light years across .  wow .  that would shrink our world into insignificance .  the readers would eat it up .        only an idea     said beenay with a grin     but you see the point .  during an eclipse  these dozen suns would become visible because there   d be no real sunlight to drown them out .  since they   re so far off  they   d appear small  like so many little marbles .  of course the cultists talk of millions of stars  but that   s probably exaggeration .  there just isn   t any place in the universe you could put a million suns    unless they touch one another .     sheerin had listened with gradually increasing interest .     you   ve hit something there  beenay .  and exaggeration is just exactly what would happen .  our minds  as you probably know  can   t grasp directly any number higher than five  above that there is only the concept of    many    .  a dozen would become a million just like that .  a damn good idea .        and i   ve got another cute little notion     beenay said .     have you ever thought what a simple problem gravitation would be if only you had a sufficiently simple system .  supposing you had a universe in which there was a planet with only one sun .  the planet would travel in a perfect ellipse and the exact nature of the gravitational force would be so evident it could be accepted as an axiom .  astronomers on such a world would start off with gravity probably before they even invented the telescope .  naked eye observation would be enough .        but would such a system be dynamically stable .     questioned sheerin doubtfully .     sure .  they call it the    one and one    case .  it   s been worked out mathematically  but it   s the philosophical implications that interest me .        it   s nice to think about     admitted sheerin     as a pretty abstraction    like a perfect gas  or absolute zero .        of course     continued beenay     there   s the catch that life would be impossible on such a planet .  it wouldn   t get enough heat and light  and if it rotated there would be total darkness half of each day .  you couldn   t expect life    which is fundamentally dependent upon light    to develop under those conditions .  besides        sheerin   s chair went over backward as he sprang to his feet in a rude interruption .     aton   s brought out the lights .     beenay said     huh     turned to stare  and then grinned halfway around his head in open relief .  there were half a dozen foot long  inch thick rods cradled in aton   s arms .  he glared over them at the assembled staff members .     get back to work  all of you .  sheerin  come here and help me .     sheerin trotted to the older man   s side and  one by one  in utter silence  the two adjusted the rods in makeshift metal holders suspended from the walls .  with the air of one carrying through the most sacred item of a religious ritual  sheerin scraped a large  clumsy match into spluttering life and passed it to aton  who carried the flame to the upper end of one of the rods .  it hesitated there awhile  playing futilely about the tip  until a sudden  crackling flare cast aton   s lined face into yellow highlights .  he withdrew the match and a spontaneous cheer rattled the window .  the rod was topped by six inches of wavering flame .  methodically  the other rods were lighted  until six independent fires turned the rear of the room yellow .  the light was dim  dimmer even than the tenuous sunlight .  the flames reeled crazily  giving birth to drunken  swaying shadows .  the torches smoked devilishly and smelled like a bad day in the kitchen .  but they emitted yellow light .  there was something about yellow light  after four hours of somber  dimming beta .  even latimer had lifted his eyes from his book and stared in wonder .  sheerin warmed his hands at the nearest  regardless of the soot that gathered upon them in a fine  gray powder  and muttered ecstatically to himself .     beautiful .  beautiful .  i never realized before what a wonderful color yellow is .     but theremon regarded the torches suspiciously .  he wrinkled his nose at the rancid odor and said     what are those things .        wood     said sheerin shortly .     oh  no  they   re not .  they aren   t burning .  the top inch is charred and the flame just keeps shooting up out of nothing .        that   s the beauty of it .  this is a really efficient artificial light mechanism .  we made a few hundred of them  but most went to the hideout  of course .  you see       he turned and wiped his blackened hands upon his handkerchief       you take the pithy core of coarse water reeds  dry them thoroughly  and soak them in animal grease .  then you set fire to it and the grease burns  little by little .  these torches will burn for almost half an hour without stopping .  ingenious  isn   t it .  it was developed by one of our own young men at saro university .     after the momentary sensation  the dome had quieted .  latimer had carried his chair directly beneath a torch and continued reading  lips moving in the monotonous recital of invocations to the stars .  beenay had drifted away to his cameras once more  and theremon seized the opportunity to add to his notes on the article he was going to write for the saro city chronicle the next day    a procedure he had been following for the last two hours in a perfectly methodical  perfectly conscientious and  as he was well aware  perfectly meaningless fashion .  but  as the gleam of amusement in sheerin   s eyes indicated  careful note taking occupied his mind with something other than the fact that the sky was gradually turning a horrible deep purple red  as if it were one gigantic  freshly peeled beet  and so it fulfilled its purpose .  the air grew  somehow  denser .  dusk  like a palpable entity  entered the room  and the dancing circle of yellow light about the torches etched itself into ever sharper distinction against the gathering grayness beyond .  there was the odor of smoke and the presence of little chuckling sounds that the torches made as they burned  the soft pad of one of the men circling the table at which he worked  on hesitant tiptoes  the occasional indrawn breath of someone trying to retain composure in a world that was retreating into the shadow .  it was theremon who first heard the extraneous noise .  it was a vague  unorganized impression of sound that would have gone unnoticed but for the dead silence that prevailed within the dome .  the newsman sat upright and replaced his notebook .  he held his breath and listened  then  with considerable reluctance  threaded his way between the solarscope and one of beenay   s cameras and stood before the window .  the silence ripped to fragments at his startled shout     sheerin .     work stopped .  the psychologist was at his side in a moment .  aton joined him .  even yimot     high in his little lean back seat at the eyepiece of the gigantic solarscope  paused and looked downward .  outside  beta was a mere smoldering splinter  taking one last desperate look at lagash .  the eastern horizon  in the direction of the city  was lost in darkness  and the road from saro to the observatory was a dull red line bordered on both sides by wooded tracts  the trees of which had somehow lost individuality and merged into a continuous shadowy mass .  but it was the highway itself that held attention  for along it there surged another  and infinitely menacing  shadowy mass .  aton cried in a cracked voice     the madmen from the city .  they   ve come .        how long to totality .     demanded sheerin .     fifteen minutes  but  .   .   .  but they   ll be here in five .        never mind  keep the men working .  we   ll hold them off .  this place is built like a fortress .  aton  keep an eye on our young cultist just for luck .  theremon  come with me .     sheerin was out the door  and theremon was at his heels .  the stairs stretched below them in tight  circular sweeps about the central shaft  fading into a dank and dreary grayness .  the first momentum of their rush had carried them fifty feet down  so that the dim  flickering yellow from the open door of the dome had disappeared and both above and below the same dusky shadow crushed in upon them .  sheerin paused  and his pudgy hand clutched at his chest .  his eyes bulged and his voice was a dry cough .     i can   t  .   .   .  breathe  .   .   .  go down  .   .   .  yourself .  close all doors        theremon took a few downward steps  then turned .     wait .  can you hold out a minute .     he was panting himself .  the air passed in and out his lungs like so much molasses  and there was a little germ of screeching panic in his mind at the thought of making his way into the mysterious darkness below by himself .  theremon  after all  was afraid of the dark .     stay here     he said .  i   ll be back in a second .     he dashed upward two steps at a time  heart pounding    not altogether from the exertion    tumbled into the dome and snatched a torch from its holder .  it was foul smelling  and the smoke smarted his eyes almost blind  but he clutched that torch as if he wanted to kiss it for joy  and its flame streamed backward as he hurtled down the stairs again .  sheerin opened his eyes and moaned as theremon bent over him .  theremon shook him roughly .     all right  get a hold on yourself .  we   ve got light .     he held the torch at tiptoe height and  propping the tottering psychologist by an elbow  made his way downward in the middle of the protecting circle of illumination .  the offices on the ground floor still possessed what light there was  and theremon felt the horror about him relax .     here     he said brusquely  and passed the torch to sheerin .     you can hear them outside .     and they could .  little scraps of hoarse  wordless shouts .  but sheerin was right  the observatory was built like a fortress .  erected in the last century  when the neo gavottian style of architecture was at its ugly height  it had been designed for stability and durability rather than for beauty .  the windows were protected by the grillwork of inch thick iron bars sunk deep into the concrete sills .  the walls were solid masonry that an earthquake couldn   t have touched  and the main door was a huge oaken slab rein    forced with iron .  theremon shot the bolts and they slid shut with a dull clang .  at the other end of the corridor  sheerin cursed weakly .  he pointed to the lock of the back door which had been neatly jimmied into uselessness .     that must be how latimer got in     he said .     well  don   t stand there     cried theremon impatiently .     help drag up the furniture    and keep that torch out of my eyes .  the smoke   s killing me .     he slammed the heavy table up against the door as he spoke  and in two minutes had built a barricade which made up for what it lacked in beauty and symmetry by the sheer inertia of its massiveness .  somewhere  dimly  far off  they could hear the battering of naked fists upon the door  and the screams and yells from outside had a sort of half reality .  that mob had set off from saro city with only two things in mind  the attainment of cultist salvation by the destruction of the observatory  and a maddening fear that all but paralyzed them .  there was no time to think of ground cars  or of weapons  or of leadership  or even of organization .  they made for the observatory on foot and assaulted it with bare hands .  and now that they were there  the last flash of beta  the last ruby red drop of flame  flickered feebly over a humanity that had left only stark  universal fear .  theremon groaned     let   s get back to the dome .      in the dome  only yimot  at the solarscope  had kept his place .  the rest were clustered about the cameras  and beenay was giving his instructions in a hoarse  strained voice .     get it straight  all of you .  i   m snapping beta just before totality and changing the plate .  that will leave one of you to each camera .  you all know about  .   .   .  about times of exposure        there was a breathless murmur of agreement .  beenay passed a hand over his eyes .     are the torches still burning .  never mind  i see them .     he was leaning hard against the back of a chair .     now remember  don   t .   .   .  don   t try to look for good shots .  don   t waste time trying to get t two stars at a time in the scope field .  one is enough .  and  .   .   .  and if you feel yourself going  get away from the camera .     at the door  sheerin whispered to theremon     take me to aton .  i don   t see him .     the newsman did not answer immediately .  the vague forms of the astronomers wavered and blurred  and the torches overhead had become only yellow splotches .     it   s dark     he whimpered .  sheerin held out his hand .     aton .     he stumbled forward .     aton .     theremon stepped after and seized his arm .     wait  i   ll take you .     somehow he made his way across the room .  he closed his eyes against the darkness and his mind against the chaos within it .  no one heard them or paid attention to them .  sheerin stumbled against the wall .     aton .     the psychologist felt shaking hands touching him  then withdrawing  a voice muttering     is that you  sheerin .        aton .     he strove to breathe normally .     don   t worry about the mob .  the place will hold them off .     latimer  the cultist  rose to his feet  and his face twisted in desperation .  his word was pledged  and to break it would mean placing his soul in mortal peril .  yet that word had been forced from him and had not been given freely .  the stars would come soon .  he could not stand by and allow    and yet his word was pledged .  beenay   s face was dimly flushed as it looked upward at beta   s last ray  and latimer  seeing him bend over his camera  made his decision .  his nails cut the flesh of his palms as he tensed himself .  he staggered crazily as he started his rush .  there was nothing before him but shadows  the very floor beneath his feet lacked substance .  and then someone was upon him and he went down with clutching fingers at his throat .  he doubled his knee and drove it hard into his assailant .     let me up or i   ll kill you .     theremon cried out sharply and muttered through a blinding haze of pain .     you double crossing rat .     the newsman seemed conscious of everything at once .  he heard beenay croak     i   ve got it .  at your cameras  men .     and then there was the strange awareness that the last thread of sunlight had thinned out and snapped .  simultaneously he heard one last choking gasp from beenay  and a queer little cry from sheerin  a hysterical giggle that cut off in a rasp    and a sudden silence  a strange  deadly silence from outside .  and latimer had gone limp in his loosening grasp .  theremon peered into the cultist   s eyes and saw the blankness of them  staring upward  mirroring the feeble yellow of the torches .  he saw the bubble of froth upon latimer   s lips and heard the low animal whimper in latimer   s throat .  with the slow fascination of fear  he lifted himself on one arm and turned his eyes toward the blood curdling blackness of the window .  through it shone the stars .  not earth   s feeble thirty six hundred stars visible to the eye  lagash was in the center of a giant cluster .  thirty thousand mighty suns shone down in a soul searing splendor that was more frighteningly cold in its awful indifference than the bitter wind that shivered across the cold  horribly bleak world .  theremon staggered to his feet  his throat  constricting him to breathlessness  all the muscles of his body writhing in an intensity of terror and sheer fear beyond bearing .  he was going mad and knew it  and somewhere deep inside a bit of sanity was screaming  struggling to fight off the hopeless flood of black terror .  it was very horrible to go mad and know that you were going mad    to know that in a little minute you would be here physically and yet all the real essence would be dead and drowned in the black madness .  for this was the dark    the dark and the cold and the doom .  the bright walls of the universe were shattered and their awful black fragments were falling down to crush and squeeze and obliterate him .  he jostled someone crawling on hands and knees  but stumbled somehow over him .  hands groping at his tortured throat  he limped toward the flame of the torches that filled all his mad vision .     light .     he screamed .  aton  somewhere  was crying  whimpering horribly like a terribly frightened child .     stars    all the stars    we didn   t know at all .  we didn   t know anything .  we thought six stars in a universe is something the stars didn   t notice is darkness forever and ever and ever and the walls are breaking in and we didn   t know we couldn   t know and anything        someone clawed at the torch  and it fell and snuffed out .  in the instant  the awful splendor of the indifferent stars leaped nearer to them .  on the horizon outside the window  in the direction of saro city  a crimson glow began growing  strengthening in brightness  that was not the glow of a sun .  the long night had come again .   c chute  even from the cabin into which he and the other passengers had been herded  colonel anthony windham could still catch the essence of the battle   s progress .  for a while  there was silence  no jolting  which meant the spaceships were fighting at astronomical distance in a duel of energy blasts and powerful force field defenses .  he knew that could have only one end .  their earth ship was only an armed merchantman and his glimpse of the kloro enemy just before he had been cleared off deck by the crew was sufficient to show it to be a light cruiser .  and in less than half an hour  there came those hard little shocks he was waiting for .  the passengers swayed back and forth as the ship pitched and veered  as though it were an ocean liner in a storm .  but space was calm and silent as ever .  it was their pilot sending desperate bursts of steam through the steam tubes  so that by reaction the ship would be sent rolling and tumbling .  it could only mean that the inevitable had occurred .  the earth ship   s screens had been drained and it no longer dared withstand a direct hit .  colonel windham tried to steady himself with his aluminum cane .  he was thinking that he was an old man  that he had spent his life in the militia and had never seen a battle  that now  with a battle going on around him  he was old and fat and lame and had no men under his command .  they would be boarding soon  those kloro monsters .  it was their way of fighting .  they would be handicapped by spacesuits and their casualties would be high  but they wanted the earth ship .  windham considered the passengers .  for a moment  he thought  if they were armed and i could lead them   he abandoned the thought .  porter was in an obvious state of funk and the young boy  leblanc  was hardly better .  the polyorketes brothers  dash it  he couldn   t tell them apart  huddled in a corner speaking only to one another .  mullen was a different matter .  he sat perfectly erect  with no signs of fear or any other emotion in his face .  but the man was just about five feet tall and had undoubtedly never held a gun of any sort in his hands in all his life .  he could do nothing .  and there was stuart  with his frozen half smile and the high pitched sarcasm which saturated all he said .  windham looked sidelong at stuart now as stuart sat there  pushing his dead white hands through his sandy hair .  with those artificial hands he was useless  anyway .  windham felt the shuddering vibration of ship to ship contact  and in five minutes  there was the noise of the fight through the corridors .  one of the polyorketes brothers screamed and dashed for the door .  the other called     aristides .  wait .     and hurried after .  it happened so quickly .  aristides was out the door and into the corridor  running in brainless panic .  a carbonizer glowed briefly and there was never even a scream .  windham  from the doorway  turned in horror at the blackened stump of what was left .  strange  a lifetime in uniform and he had never before seen a man killed in violence .  it took the combined force of the rest to carry the other brother back struggling into the room .  the noise of battle subsided .  stuart said     that   s it .  they   ll put a prize crew of two aboard and take us to one of their home planets .  we   re prisoners of war  naturally .        only two of the kloros will stay aboard .     asked windham  astonished .  stuart said     it is their custom .  why do you ask  colonel .  thinking of leading a gallant raid to retake the ship .     windham flushed .     simply a point of information  dash it .     but the dignity and tone of authority he tried to assume failed him  he knew .  he was simply an old man with a limp .  and stuart was probably right .  he had lived among the kloros and knew their ways .  john stuart had claimed from the beginning that the kloros were gentlemen .  twenty four hours of imprisonment had passed  and now he repeated the statement as he flexed the fingers of his hands and watched the crinkles come and go in the soft artiplasm .  he enjoyed the unpleasant reaction it aroused in the others .  people were made to be punctured  windy bladders  all of them .  and they had hands of the same stuff as their bodies .  there was anthony windham  in particular .  colonel windham  he called himself  and stuart was willing to believe it .  a retired colonel who had probably drilled a home guard militia on a village green  forty years ago  with such lack of distinction that he was not called back to service in any capacity  even during the emergency of earth   s first interstellar war .     dashed unpleasant thing to be saying about the enemy  stuart .  don   t know that i like your attitude .     windham seemed to push the words through his clipped mustache .  his head had been shaven  too  in imitation of the current military style  but now a gray stubble was beginning to show about a centered bald patch .  his flabby cheeks dragged downward .  that and the fine red lines on his thick nose gave him a somewhat undone appearance  as though he had been wakened too suddenly and too early in the morning .  stuart said     nonsense .  just reverse the present situation .  suppose an earth warship had taken a kloro liner .  what do you think would have happened to any kloro civilians aboard .        i   m sure the earth fleet would observe all the interstellar rules of war     windham said stiffly .     except that there aren   t any .  if we landed a prize crew on one of their ships  do you think we   d take the trouble to maintain a chlorine atmosphere for the benefit of the survivors  allow them to keep their non contraband possessions  give them the use of the most comfortable stateroom  etcetera  etcetera  etcetera .     ben porter said     oh  shut up  for god   s sake .  if i hear your etcetera  etcetera once again  i   ll go nuts .     stuart said     sorry .     he wasn   t .  porter was scarcely responsible .  his thin face and beaky nose glistened with perspiration  and he kept biting the inside of his cheek until he suddenly winced .  he put his tongue against the sore spot  which made him look even more clownish .  stuart was growing weary of baiting them .  windham was too flabby a target and porter could do nothing but writhe .  the rest were silent .  demetrios polyorketes was off in a world of silent internal grief for the moment .  he had not slept the night before  most probably .  at least  whenever stuart woke to change his position  he himself had been rather restless  there had been poryorketes    thick mumble from the next cot .  it said many things  but the moan to which it returned over and over again was     oh  my brother .     he sat dumbly on his cot now  his red eyes rolling at the other prisoners out of his broad swarthy  unshaven face .  as stuart watched  his face sank into calloused palms so that only his mop of crisp and curly black hair could be seen .  he rocked gently  but now that they were all awake  he made no sound .  claude leblanc was trying very unsuccessfully  to read a letter .  he was the youngest of the six  scarcely out of college  returning to earth to get married .  stuart had found him that morning weeping quietly  his pink and white face flushed and blotched as though it were a heartbroken child   s .  he was very fair  with almost a girl   s beauty about his large blue eyes and full lips .  stuart wondered what kind of girl it was who had promised to be his wife .  he had seen her picture .  who on the ship had not .  she had the characterless prettiness that makes all pictures of fianc  es indistinguishable .  it seemed to stuart that if he were a girl  however  he would want someone a little more pronouncedly masculine .  that left only randolph mullen .  stuart frankly did not have the least idea what to make of him .  he was the only one of the six that had been on the arcturian worlds for any length of time .  stuart  himself  for instance  had been there only long enough to give a series of lectures on astronautical engineering at the provincial engineering institute .  colonel windham had been on a cook   s tour  porter was trying to buy concentrated alien vegetables for his canneries on earth  and the polyorketes brothers had attempted to establish themselves in arcturus as truck farmers and  after two growing seasons  gave it up  had somehow unloaded at a profit  and were returning to earth .  randolph mullen  however  had been in the arcturian system for seventeen years .  how did voyagers discover so much about one another so quickly .  as far as stuart knew  the little man had scarcely spoken aboard ship .  he was unfailingly polite  always stepped to one side to allow another to pass  but his entire vocabulary appeared to consist only of    thank you    and    pardon me .     yet the word had gone around that this was his first trip to earth in seventeen years .  he was a little man  very precise  almost irritatingly so .  upon awaking that morning  he had made his cot neatly  shaved  bathed and dressed .  the habit of years seemed not in the least disturbed by the fact that he was a prisoner of the kloros now .  he was unobtrusive about it  it had to be admitted  and gave no impression of disapproving of the sloppiness of the others .  he simply sat there  almost apologetic  trussed in his over conservative clothing  and hands loosely clasped in his lap .  the thin line of hair on his upper lip  far from adding character to his face  absurdly increased its primness .  he looked like someone   s idea of a caricature of a bookkeeper .  and the queer thing about it all  stuart thought  was that that was exactly what he was .  he had noticed it on the registry  randolph fluellen mullen  occupation  bookkeeper  employers  prime paper box co .      tobias avenue  new warsaw  arcturus ii .     mr .  stuart .     stuart looked up .  it was leblanc  his lower lip trembling slightly .  stuart tried to remember how one went about being gentle .  he said     what is it  leblanc .        tell me  when will they let us go .        how should i know .        everyone says you lived on a kloro planet  and just now you said they were gentlemen .        well  yes .  but even gentlemen fight wars in order to win .  probably  we   ll be interned for the duration .        but that could be years .  margaret is waiting .  she   ll think i   m dead .        i suppose they   ll allow messages to be sent through once we   re on their planet .     porter   s hoarse voice sounded in agitation .     look here  if you know so much about these devils  what will they do to us while we   re interned .  what will they feed us .  where will they get oxygen for us .  they   ll kill us  i tell you .     and as an afterthought     i   ve got a wife waiting for me  too     he added .  but stuart had heard him speaking of his wife in the days before the attack .  he wasn   t impressed .  porter   s nail bitten fingers were pulling and plucking at stuart   s sleeve .  stuart drew away in sharp revulsion .  he couldn   t stand those ugly hands .  it angered him to desperation that such monstrosities should be real while his own white and perfectly shaped hands were only mocking imitations grown out of an alien latex .  he said     they won   t kill us .  if they were going to  they would have done it before now .  look  we capture kloros too  you know  and it   s just a matter of common sense to treat your prisoners decently if you want the other side to be decent to your men .  they   ll do their best .  the food may not be very good  but they   re better chemists than we are .  it   s what they   re best at .  they   ll know exactly what food factors we   ll need and how many calories .  we   ll live .  they   ll see to that .     windham rumbled     you sound more and more like a blasted greenie sympathizer  stuart .  it turns my stomach to hear an earthman speak well of the green fellas the way you   ve been doing .  burn it  man  where   s your loyalty .        my loyalty   s where it belongs .  with honesty and decency  regardless of the shape of the being it appears in .     stuart held up his hands .     see these .  kloros made them .  i lived on one of their planets for six months .  my hands were mangled in the conditioning machinery of my own quarters .  i thought the oxygen supply they gave me was a little poor  it wasn   t  by the way   and i tried making the adjustments on my own .  it was my fault .  you should never trust yourself with the machines of another culture .  by the time someone among the kloros could put on an atmosphere suit and get to me  it was too late to save my hands .     they grew these artiplasm things for me and operated .  you know what that meant .  it meant designing equipment and nutrient solutions that would work in oxygen atmosphere .  it meant that their surgeons had to perform a delicate operation while dressed in atmosphere suits .  and now i   ve got hands again .     he laughed harshly  and clenched them into weak fists .     hands      windham said     and you   d sell your loyalty to earth for that .        sell my loyalty .  you   re mad .  for years  i hated the kloros for this .  i was a master pilot on the trans galactic spacelines before it happened .  now .  desk job .  or an occasional lecture .  it took me a long time to pin the fault on myself and to realize that the only role played by the kloros was a decent one .  they have their code of ethics  and it   s as good as ours .  if it weren   t for the stupidity of some of their people  and  by god  of some of ours  we wouldn   t be at war .  and after it   s over      polyorketes was on his feet .  his thick fingers curved inward before him and his dark eyes glittered .     i don   t like what you say  mister .        why don   t you .        because you talk too nice about these damned green bastards .  the kloros were good to you  eh .  well  they weren   t good to my brother .  they killed him .  i think maybe i kill you  you damned greenie spy .     and he charged .  stuart barely had time to raise his arms to meet the infuriated farmer .  he gasped out     what the hell      as he caught one wrist and heaved a shoulder to block the other which groped toward his throat .  his artiplasm hand gave way .  polyorketes wrenched free with scarcely an effort .  windham was bellowing incoherently  and leblanc was calling out in his reedy voice     stop it .  stop it .     but it was little mulkn who threw his arms about the farmer   s neck from behind and pulled with all his might .  he was not very effective  polyorketes seemed scarcely aware of the little man   s weight upon his back .  mullen   s feet left the floor so that he tossed helplessly to right and left .  but he held his grip and it hampered polyorketes sufficiently to allow stuart to break free long enough to grasp windham   s aluminum cane .  he said     stay away  polyorketes .     he was gasping for breath and fearful of another rush .  the hollow aluminum cylinder was scarcely heavy enough to accomplish much  but it was better than having only his weak hands to defend himself with .  mullen had loosed his hold and was now circling cautiously  his breathing roughened and his jacket in disarray .  polyorketes  for a moment  did not move .  he stood there  his shaggy head bent low .  then he said     it is no use .  i must kill kloros .  just watch your tongue  stuart .  if it keeps on rattling too much  you   re liable to get hurt .  really hurt  i mean .     stuart passed a forearm over his forehead and thrust the cane back at windham  who seized it with his left hand  while mopping his bald pate vigorously with a handkerchief in his right .  windham said     gentlemen  we must avoid this .  it lowers our prestige .  we must remember the common enemy .  we are earthmen and we must act what we are  the ruling race of the galaxy .  we dare not demean ourselves before the lesser breeds .        yes  colonel     said stuart  wearily .     give us the rest of the speech tomorrow .     he turned to mullen     i want to say thanks .     he was uncomfortable about it  but he had to .  the little accountant had surprised him completely .  but mullen said  in a dry voice that scarcely raised above a whisper     don   t thank me  mr .  stuart .  it was the logical thing to do .  if we are to be interned  we would need you as an interpreter  perhaps  one who would understand the kloros .     stuart stiffened .  it was  he thought  too much of the bookkeeper type of reasoning  too logical  too dry of juice .  present risk and ultimate advantage .  the assets and debits balanced neatly .  he would have liked mullen to leap to his defense out of  well  out of what .  out of pure  unselfish decency .  stuart laughed silently at himself .  he was beginning to expect idealism of human beings  rather than good  straight forward  self centered motivation .  polyorketes was numb .  his sorrow and rage were like acid inside him  but they had no words to get out .  if he were stuart  big mouth  white hands stuart  he could talk and talk and maybe feel better .  instead  he had to sit there with half of him dead  with no brother  no aristides   it had happened so quickly .  if he could only go back and have one second more warning  so that he might snatch aristides  hold him  save him .  but mostly he hated the kloros .  two months ago  he had hardly ever heard of them  and now he hated them so hard  he would be glad to die if he could kill a few .  he said  without looking up     what happened to start this war  eh .     he was afraid stuart   s voice would answer .  he hated stuart   s voice .  but it was windham  the bald one .  windham said     the immediate cause  sir  was a dispute over mining concessions in the wyandotte system .  the kloros had poached on earth property .        room for both  colonel .     polyorketes looked up at that  snarling .  stuart could not be kept quiet for long .  he was speaking again  the cripple hand  wiseguy  kloros lover .  stuart was saying     is that anything to fight over  colonel .  we can   t use one another   s worlds .  their chlorine planets are useless to us and our oxygen ones are useless to them .  chlorine is deadly to us and oxygen is deadly to them .  there   s no way we could maintain permanent hostility .  our races just don   t coincide .  is there reason to fight then because both races want to dig iron out of the same airless planetoids when there are millions like them in the galaxy .     windham said     there is the question of planetary honor         planetary fertilizer .  how can it excuse a ridiculous war like this one .  it can only be fought on outposts .  it has to come down to a series of holding actions and eventually be settled by negotiations that might just as easily have been worked out in the first place .  neither we nor the kloros will gain a thing .     grudgingly  polyorketes found that he agreed with stuart .  what did he and aristides care where earth or the kloros got their iron .  was that something for aristides to die over .  the little warning buzzer sounded .  polyorketes    head shot up and he rose slowly  his lips drawing back .  only one thing could be at the door .  he waited  arms tense  fists balled .  stuart was edging toward him .  polyorketes saw that and laughed to himself .  let the kloro come in  and stuart  along with all the rest  could not stop him .  wait  aristides  wait just a moment  and a fraction of revenge will be paid back .  the door opened and a figure entered  completely swathed in a shapeless  billowing travesty of a spacesuit .  an odd  unnatural  but not entirely unpleasant voice began     it is with some misgivings  earthmen  that my companion and myself      it ended abruptly as polyorketes  with a roar  charged once again .  there was no science in the lunge .  it was sheer bull momentum .  dark head low  burly arms spread out with the hair tufted fingers in choking position  he clumped on .  stuart was whirled to one side before he had a chance to intervene  and was spun tumbling across a cot .  the kloro might have  without undue exertion  straight armed polyorketes to a halt  or stepped aside  allowing the whirlwind to pass .  he did neither .  with a rapid movement  a hand weapon was up and a gentle pinkish line of radiance connected it with the plunging earthman .  polyorketes stumbled and crashed down  his body maintaining its last curved position  one foot raised  as though a lightning paralysis had taken place .  it toppled to one side and he lay there  eyes all alive and wild with rage .  the kloro said     he is not permanently hurt .     he seemed not to resent the offered violence .  then he began again     it is with some misgiving  earthmen  that my companion and myself were made aware of a certain commotion in this room .  are you in any need which we can satisfy .     stuart was angrily nursing his knee which he had scraped in colliding with the cot .  he said     no  thank you  kloro .        now  look here     puffed windham     this is a dashed outrage .  we demand that our release be arranged .     the kloro   s tiny  insectlike head turned in the fat old man   s direction .  he was not a pleasant sight to anyone unused to him .  he was about the height of an earthman  but the top of him consisted of a thin stalk of a neck with a head that was the merest swelling .  it consisted of a blunt triangular proboscis in front and two bulging eyes on either side .  that was all .  there was no brain pan and no brain .  what corresponded to the brain in a kloro was located in what would be an earthly abdomen  leaving the head as a mere sensory organ .  the kloro   s spacesuit followed the outlines of the head more or less faithfully  the two eyes being exposed by two clear semicircles of glass  which looked faintly green because of the chlorine atmosphere inside .  one of the eyes was now cocked squarely at windham  who quivered uncomfortably under the glance  but insisted     you have no right to hold us prisoner .  we are noncombatants .     the kloro   s voice  sounding thoroughly artificial  came from a small attachment of chromium mesh on what served as its chest .  the voice box was manipulated by compressed air under the control of one or two of the many delicate  forked tendrils that radiated from two circles about its upper body and were  mercifully enough  hidden by the suit .  the voice said     are you serious  earthman .  surely you have heard of war and rules of war and prisoners of war .     it looked about  shifting eyes with quick jerks of its head  staring at a particular object first with one  then with another .  it was stuart   s understanding that each eye transferred a separate message to the abdominal brain  which had to coordinate the two to obtain full information .  windham had nothing to say .  no one had .  the kloro  its four main limbs  roughly arms and legs in pairs  had a vaguely human appearance under the masking of the suit  if you looked no higher than its chest  but there was no way of telling what it felt .  they watched it turn and leave .  porter coughed and said in a strangled voice     god  smell that chlorine .  if they don   t do something  we   ll all die of rotted lungs .     stuart said     shut up .  there isn   t enough chlorine in the air to make a mosquito sneeze  and what there is will be swept out in two minutes .  besides  a little chlorine is good for you .  it may kill your cold virus .     windham coughed and said     stuart  i feel that you might have said something to your kloro friend about releasing us .  you are scarcely as bold in their presence  dash it  as you are once they are gone .        you heard what the creature said  colonel .  we   re prisoners of war  and prisoner exchanges are negotiated by diplomats .  we   ll just have to wait .     leblanc  who had turned pasty white at the entrance of the kloro  rose and hurried into the privy .  there was the sound of retching .  an uncomfortable silence fell while stuart tried to think of something to say to cover the unpleasant sound .  mullen filled in .  he had rummaged through a little box he had taken from under his pillow .  he said     perhaps mr .  leblanc had better take a sedative before retiring .  i have a few .  i   d be glad to give him one .     he explained his generosity immediately     otherwise he may keep the rest of us awake  you see .        very logical     said stuart  dryly .     you   d better save one for sir launcelot here  save half a dozen .     he walked to where polyorketes still sprawled and knelt at his side .     comfortable  baby .     windham said     deuced poor taste speaking like that  stuart .        well  if you   re so concerned about him  why don   t you and porter hoist him onto his cot .     he helped them do so .  polyorketes    arms were trembling erratically now .  from what stuart knew of the kloro   s nerve weapons  the man should be in an agony of pins and needles about now .  stuart said     and don   t be too gentle with him  either .  the damned fool might have gotten us all killed .  and for what .     he pushed polyorketes    stiff carcass to one side and sat at the edge of the cot .  he said     can you hear me  polyorketes .     polyorketes    eyes gleamed .  an arm lifted abortively and fell back .     okay then  listen .  don   t try anything like that again .  the next time it may be the finish for all of us .  if you had been a kloro and he had been an earthman  we   d be dead now .  so just get one thing through your skull .  we   re sorry about your brother and it   s a rotten shame  but it was his own fault .     polyorketes tried to heave and stuart pushed him back .     no  you keep on listening     he said .     maybe this is the only time i   ll get to talk to you when you have to listen .  your brother had no right leaving passenger   s quarters .  there was no place for him to go .  he just got in the way of our own men .  we don   t even know for certain that it was a kloro gun that killed him .  it might have been one of our own .        oh  i say  stuart     objected windham .  stuart whirled at him .     do you have proof it wasn   t .  did you see the shot .  could you tell from what was left of the body whether it was kloro energy or earth energy .     polyorketes found his voice  driving his unwilling tongue into a fuzzy verbal snarl .     damned stinking greenie bastard .        me .     said stuart .     i know what   s going on in your mind  polyorketes .  you think that  when the paralysis wears off  you   ll ease your feelings by slamming me around .  well  if you do  it will probably be curtains for all of us .     he rose  put his back against the wall .  for the moment  he was fighting all of them .     none of you know the kloros the way i do .  the physical differences you see are not important .  the differences in their temperament are .  they don   t understand our views on sex  for instance .  to them  it   s just a biological reflex like breathing .  they attach no importance to it .  but they do attach importance to social groupings .  remember  their evolutionary ancestors had lots in common with our insects .  they always assume that any group of earthmen they find together makes up a social unit .     that means just about everything to them .  i don   t understand exactly what it means .  no earthman can .  but the result is that they never break up a group  just as we don   t separate a mother and her children if we can help it .  one of the reasons they may be treating us with kid gloves right now is that they imagine we   re all broken up over the fact that they killed one of us  and they feel guilt about it .     but this is what you   ll have to remember .  we   re going to be interned together and kept together for duration .  i don   t like the thought .  i wouldn   t have picked any of you for co internees and i   m pretty sure none of you would have picked me .  but there it is .  the kloros could never understand that our being together on the ship is only accidental .     that means we   ve got to get along somehow .  that   s not just goodie goodie talk about birds in their little nest agreeing .  what do you think would have happened if the kloros had come in earlier and found polyorketes and myself trying to kill each other .  you don   t know .  well  what do you suppose you would think of a mother you caught trying to kill her children .     that   s it  then .  they would have killed every one of us as a bunch of kloro type perverts and monsters .  got that .  how about you  polyorketes .  have you got it .  so let   s call names if we have to  but let   s keep our hands to ourselves .  and now  if none of you mind  i   ll massage my hands back into shape  these synthetic hands that i got from the kloros and that one of my own kind tried to mangle again .     for claude leblanc  the worst was over .  he had been sick enough  sick with many things  but sick most of all over having ever left earth .  it had been a great thing to go to college off earth .  it had been an adventure and had taken him away from his mother .  somehow  he had been sneakingly glad to make that escape after the first month of frightened adjustment .  and then on the summer holidays  he had been no longer claude  the shy spoken scholar  but leblanc  space traveler .  he had swaggered the fact for all it was worth .  it made him feel such a man to talk of stars and jumps and the customs and environments of other worlds  it had given him corkage with margaret .  she had loved him for the dangers he had undergone   except that this had been the first one  really  and he had not done so well .  he knew it and was ashamed and wished he were like stuart .  he used the excuse of mealtime to approach .  he said     mr .  stuart .     stuart looked up and said shortly     how do you feel .     leblanc felt himself blush .  he blushed easily and the effort not to blush only made it worse .  he said     much better  thank you .  we are eating .  i thought i   d bring you your ration     stuart took the offered can  it was standard space ration  thoroughly synthetic  concentrated  nourishing and  somehow  unsatisfying .  it heated automatically when the can was opened  but could be eaten cold  if necessary .  though a combined fork spoon utensil was enclosed  the ration was of a consistency that made the use of fingers practical and not particularly messy .  stuart said     did you hear my little speech .        yes  sir .  i want you to know you can count on me .        well  good .  now go and eat .        may i eat here .        suit yourself .     for a moment  they ate in silence  and then leblanc burst out     you are so sure of yourself  mr .  stuart .  it must be very wonderful to be like that .        sure of myself .  thanks  but there   s your self assured one .     leblanc followed the direction of the nod in surprise .     mr .  mullen .  that little man .  oh  no .        you don   t think he   s self assured .     leblanc shook his head .  he looked at stuart intently to see if he could detect humor in his expression .     that one is just cold .  he has no emotion in him .  he   s like a little machine .  i find him repulsive .  you   re different  mr .  stuart .  you have it all inside  but you control it .  i would like to be like that .     and as though attracted by the magnetism of the mention  even though unheard  of his name  mullen joined them .  his can of ration was barely touched .  it was still steaming gently as he squatted opposite them .  his voice had its usual quality of furtively rustling underbrush .     how long  mr .  stuart  do you think the trip will take .        can   t say  mullen .  they   ll undoubtedly be avoiding the usual trade routes and they   ll be making more jumps through hyper space than usual to throw off possible pursuit .  i wouldn   t be surprised if it took as long as a week .  why do you ask .  i presume you have a very practical and logical reason .        why  yes .  certainly .     he seemed quite shellbacked to sarcasm .  he said     it occurred to me that it might be wise to ration the rations  so to speak .        we   ve got enough food and water for a month .  i checked on that first thing .        i see .  in that case  i will finish the can .     he did  using the all purpose utensil daintily and patting a handkerchief against his unstained lips from time to time .  polyorketes struggled to his feet some two hours later .  he swayed a bit  looking like the spirit of hangover .  he did not try to come closer to stuart  but spoke from where he stood .  he said     you stinking greenie spy  you watch yourself .        you heard what i said before  polyorketes .        i heard .  but i also heard what you said about aristides .  i won   t bother with you  because you   re a bag of nothing but noisy air .  but wait  someday you   ll blow your air in one face too many and it will be let out of you .        i   ll wait     said stuart .  windham hobbled over  leaning heavily on his cane .     now  now     he called with a wheezing joviality that overkid his sweating anxiety so thinly as to emphasize it .     we   re all earthmen  dash it .  got to remember that  keep it as a glowing light of inspiration .  never let down before the blasted kloros .  we   ve got to forget private feuds and remember only that we are earthmen united against alien blighters .     stuart   s comment was unprintable .  porter was right behind windham .  he had been in a close conference with the shaven headed colonel for an hour  and now he said with indignation     it doesn   t help to be a wiseguy  stuart .  you listen to the colonel .  we   ve been doing some hard thinking about the situation .     he had washed some of the grease off his face  wet his hair and slicked it back .  it did not remove the little tic on his right cheek just at the point where his lips ended  or make his hangnail hands more attractive in appearance .     all right  colonel     said stuart .     what   s on your mind .     windham said     i   d prefer to have all the men together .        okay  call them .     leblanc hurried over  mullen approached with greater deliberation .  stuart said     you want that fellow .     he jerked his head at polyorketes .     why  yes .  mr .  polyorketes  may we have you  old fella .        ah  leave me alone .        go ahead     said stuart     leave him alone .  i don   t want him .        no  no     said windham .     this is a matter for all earthmen .  mr .  polyorketes  we must have you .     polyorketes rolled off one side of his cot .     i   m close enough  i can hear you .     windham said to stuart     would they  the kloros  i mean  have this room wired .        no     said stuart .     why should they .        are you sure .        of course i   m sure .  they didn   t know what happened when polyorketes jumped me .  they just heard the thumping when it started rattling the ship .        maybe they were trying to give us the impression the room wasn   t wired .        listen  colonel  i   ve never known a kloro to tell a deliberate lie      polyorketes interrupted calmly     that lump of noise just loves the kloros .     windham said hastily     let   s not begin that .  look  stuart  porter and i have been discussing matters and we have decided that you know the kloros well enough to think of some way of getting us back to earth .        it happens that you   re wrong .  i can   t think of any way .        maybe there is some way we can take the ship back from the blasted green fellas     suggested windham .     some weakness they may have .  dash it  you know what i mean .        tell me  colonel  what are you after .  your own skin or earth   s welfare .        i resent that question .  i   ll have you know that while i   m as careful of my own life as anyone has a right to be  i   m thinking of earth primarily .  and i think that   s true of all of us .        damn right     said porter  instantly .  leblanc looked anxious  polyorketes resentful  and mullen had no expression at all .     good     said stuart .     of course  i don   t think we can take the ship .  they   re armed and we aren   t .  but there   s this .  you know why the kloros took this ship intact .  it   s because they need ships .  they may be better chemists than earthmen are  but earthmen are better astronautical engineers .  we have bigger  better and more ships .  in fact  if our crew had had a proper respect for military axioms in the first place  they would have blown the ship up as soon as it looked as though the kloros were going to board .     leblanc looked horrified .     and kill the passengers .        why not .  you heard what the good colonel said .  every one of us puts his own lousy little life after earth   s interests .  what good are we to earth alive right now .  none at all .  what harm will this ship do in kloro hands .  a hell of a lot  probably .        just why     asked mullen     did our men refuse to blow up the ship .  they must have had a reason .        they did .  it   s the firmest tradition of earth   s military men that there must never be an unfavorable ratio of casualties .  if we had blown ourselves up  twenty fighting men and seven civilians of earth would be dead as compared with an enemy casualty total of zero .  so what happens .  we let them board  kill twenty eight  i   m sure we killed at least that many  and let them have the ship .        talk  talk  talk     jeered polyorketes .     there   s a moral to this     said stuart .     we can   t take the ship away from the kloros .  we might be able to rush them  though  and keep them busy long enough to allow one of us enough time to short the engines .        what .     yelled porter  and windham shushed him in fright .     short the engines     stuart repeated .     that would destroy the ship  of course  which is what we want to do  isn   t it .     leblanc   s lips were white .     i don   t think that would work .        we can   t be sure till we try .  but what have we to lose by trying .        our lives  damn it .     cried porter .     you insane maniac  you   re crazy .        if i   m a maniac     said stuart     and insane to boot  then naturally i   m crazy .  but just remember that if we lose our lives  which is overwhelmingly probable  we lose nothing of value to earth  whereas if we destroy the ship  as we just barely might  we do earth a lot of good .  what patriot would hesitate .  who here would put himself ahead of his world .     he looked about in the silence .     surely not you  colonel windham .     windham coughed tremendously .     my dear man  that is not the question .  there must be a way to save the ship for earth without losing our lives  eh .        all right .  you name it .        let   s all think about it .  now there are only two of the kloros aboard ship .  if one of us could sneak up on them and         how .  the rest of the ship   s all filled with chlorine .  we   d have to wear a spacesuit .  gravity in their part of the ship is hopped up to kloro level  so whoever is patsy in the deal would be clumping around  metal on metal  slow and heavy .  oh  he could sneak up on them  sure  like a skunk trying to sneak downwind .        then we   ll drop it all     porter   s voice shook .     listen  windham  there   s not going to be any destroying the ship .  my life means plenty to me and if any of you try anything like that  i   ll call the kloros .  i mean it .        well     said stuart     there   s hero number one .     leblanc said     i want to go back to earth  but i      mullen interrupted     i don   t think our chances of destroying the ship are good enough unless         heroes number two and three .  what about you  polyorketes  you would have the chance of killing two kloros .        i want to kill them with my bare hands     growled the farmer  his heavy fists writhing .     on their planet  i will kill dozens .        that   s a nice safe promise for now .  what about you  colonel .  don   t you want to march to death and glory with me .        your attitude is very cynical and unbecoming  stuart .  it   s obvious that if the rest are unwilling  then your plan will fall through .        unless i do it myself  huh .        you won   t  do you hear .     said porter  instantly .     damn right i won   t     agreed stuart .     i don   t claim to be a hero .  i   m just an average patriot  perfectly willing to head for any planet they take me to and sit out the war .     mullen said  thoughtfully     of course  there is a way we could surprise the kloros .     the statement would have dropped flat except for polyorketes .  he pointed a black nailed  stubby forefinger and laughed harshly .     mr .  bookkeeper .     he said .     mr .  bookkeeper is a big shot talker like this damned greenie spy  stuart .  all right  mr .  bookkeeper  go ahead .  you make big speeches also .  let the words roll like an empty barrel .     he turned to stuart and repeated venomously     empty barrel .  cripple hand empty barrel .  no good for anything but talk .     mullen   s soft voice could make no headway until polyorketes was through  but then he said  speaking directly to stuart     we might be able to reach them from outside .  this room has a c chute i   m sure .        what   s a c chute .     asked leblanc .     well      began mullen  and then stopped  at a loss .  stuart said  mockingly     it   s a euphemism  my boy .  its full name is    casualty chute .     it doesn   t get talked about  but the main rooms on any ship would have them .  they   re just little airlocks down which you slide a corpse .  burial at space .  always lots of sentiment and bowed heads  with the captain making a rolling speech of the type polyorketes here wouldn   t like .     leblanc   s face twisted .     use that to leave the ship .        why not .  superstitious .    go on  mullen .     the little man had waited patiently .  he said     once outside  one could re enter the ship by the steam tubes .  it can be done  with luck .  and then you would be an unexpected visitor in the control room .     stuart stared at him curiously .     how do you figure this out .  what do you know about steam tubes .     mullen coughed .     you mean because i   m in the paper box business .  well      he grew pink  waited a moment  then made a new start in a colorless  unemotional voice .     my company  which manufactures fancy paper boxes and novelty containers  made a line of spaceship candy boxes for the juvenile trade some years ago .  it was designed so that if a string were pulled  small pressure containers were punctured and jets of compressed air shot out through the mock steam tubes  sailing the box across the room and scattering candy as it went .  the sales theory was that the youngsters would find it exciting to play with the ship and fun to scramble for the candy .     actually  it was a complete failure .  the ship would break dishes and sometimes hit another child in the eye .  worse still  the children would not only scramble for the candy but would fight over it .  it was almost our worst failure .  we lost thousands .     still  while the boxes were being designed  the entire office was extremely interested .  it was like a game  very bad for efficiency and office morale .  for a while  we all became steam tube experts .  i read quite a few books on ship construction .  on my own time  however  not the company   s .     stuart was intrigued .  he said     you know it   s a video sort of idea  but it might work if we had a hero to spare .  have we .        what about you .     demanded porter  indignantly .     you go around sneering at us with your cheap wisecracks .  i don   t notice you volunteering for anything .        that   s because i   m no hero  porter .  i admit it .  my object is to stay alive  and shinnying down steam tubes is no way to go about staying alive .  but the rest of you are noble patriots .  the colonel says so .  what about you  colonel .  you   re the senior hero here .     windham said     if i were younger  blast it  and if you had your hands  i would take pleasure  sir  in trouncing you soundly .        i   ve no doubt of it  but that   s no answer .        you know very well that at my time of life and with my leg      he brought the flat of his hand down upon his stiff knee      i am in no position to do anything of the sort  however much i should wish to .        ah  yes     said stuart     and i  myself  am crippled in the hands  as polyorketes tells me .  that saves us .  and what unfortunate deformities do the rest of us have .        listen     cried porter     i want to know what this is all about .  how can anyone go down the steam tubes .  what if the kloros use them while one of us is inside .        why  porter  that   s part of the sporting chance .  it   s where the excitement comes in .        but he   d be boiled in the shell like a lobster .        a pretty image  but inaccurate .  the steam wouldn   t be on for more than a very short time  maybe a second or two  and the suit insulation would hold that long .  besides  the jet comes scooting out at several hundred miles a minute  so that you would be blown clear of the ship before the steam could even warm you .  in fact  you   d be blown quite a few miles out into space  and after that you would be quite safe from the kloros .  of course  you couldn   t get back to the ship .     porter was sweating freely .     you don   t scare me for one minute  stuart .        i don   t .  then you   re offering to go .  are you sure you   ve thought out what being stranded in space means .  you   re all alone  you know  really all alone .  the steam jet will probably leave you turning or tumbling pretty rapidly .  you won   t feel that .  you   ll seem to be motionless .  but all the stars will be going around and around so that they   re just streaks in the sky .  they won   t ever stop .  they won   t even slow up .  then your heater will go off  your oxygen will give out  and you will die very slowly .  you   ll have lots of time to think .  or  if you are in a hurry  you could open your suit .  that wouldn   t be pleasant  either .  i   ve seen faces of men who had a torn suit happen to them accidentally  and it   s pretty awful .  but it would be quicker .  then      porter turned and walked unsteadily away .  stuart said  lightly     another failure .  one act of heroism still ready to be knocked down to the highest bidder with nothing offered yet .     polyorketes spoke up and his harsh voice roughed the words .     you keep on talking  mr .  big mouth .  you just keep banging that empty barrel .  pretty soon  we   ll kick your teeth in .  there   s one boy i think would be willing to do it now  eh  mr .  porter .     porter   s look at stuart confirmed the truth of polyorketes    remarks  but he said nothing .  stuart said     then what about you  polyorketes .  you   re the barehand man with guts .  want me to help you into a suit .            i   ll ask you when i want help .          what about you  leblanc .     the young man shrank away .     not even to get back to margaret .     but leblanc could only shake his head .     mullen .        well  i   ll try .        you   ll what .        i said  yes  i   ll try .  after all  it   s my idea .     stuart looked stunned .     you   re serious .  how come .     mullen   s prim mouth pursed .     because no one else will .        but that   s no reason .  especially for you .     mullen shrugged .  there was a thump of a cane behind stuart .  windham brushed past .  he said     do you really intend to go  mullen .        yes  colonel .        in that case  dash it  let me shake your hand .  i like you .  you   re an  an earthman  by heaven .  do this  and win or die  i   ll bear witness for you .     mullen withdrew his hand awkwardly from the deep and vibrating grasp of the other .  and stuart just stood there .  he was in a very unusual position .  he was  in fact  in the particular position of all positions in which he most rarely found himself .  he had nothing to say .  the quality of tension had changed .  the gloom and frustration had lifted a bit  and the excitement of conspiracy had replaced it .  even polyorketes was fingering the spacesuits and commenting briefly and hoarsely on which he considered preferable .  mullen was having a certain amount of trouble .  the suit hung rather limply upon him even though the adjustable joints had been tightened nearly to minimum .  he stood there now with only the helmet to be screwed on .  he wiggled his neck .  stuart was holding the helmet with an effort .  it was heavy  and his artiplasmic hands did not grip it well .  he said     better scratch your nose if it itches .  it   s your last chance for a while .     he didn   t add     maybe forever     but he thought it .  mullen said  tonelessly     i think perhaps i had better have a spare oxygen cylinder .        good enough .        with a reducing valve .     stuart nodded .     i see what you   re thinking of .  if you do get blown clear of the ship  you could try to blow yourself back by using the cylinder as an action reaction motor .     they clamped on the headpiece and buckled the spare cylinder to mullen   s waist .  polyorketes and leblanc lifted him up to the yawning opening of the c tube .  it was ominously dark inside  the metal lining of the interior having been painted a mournful black .  stuart thought he could detect a musty odor about it  but that  he knew  was only imagination .  he stopped the proceedings when mullen was half within the tube .  he tapped upon the little man   s faceplate .     can you hear me .     within  there was a nod .     air coming through all right .  no last minute troubles .     mullen lifted his armored arm in a gesture of reassurance .     then remember  don   t use the suit radio out there .  the kloros might pick up the signals .     reluctantly  he stepped away .  polyorketes    brawny hands lowered mullen until they could hear the thumping sound made by the steel shod feet against the outer valve .  the inner valve then swung shut with a dreadful finality  its beveled silicone gasket making a slight soughing noise as it crushed hard .  they clamped it into place .  stuart stood at the toggle switch that controlled the outer valve .  he threw it and the gauge that marked the air pressure within the tube fell to zero .  a little pinpoint of red light warned that the outer valve was open .  then the light disappeared  the valve closed  and the gauge climbed slowly to fifteen pounds again .  they opened the inner valve again and found the tube empty .  polyorketes spoke first .  he said     the little son of a gun .  he went .     he looked wonderingly at the others .     a little fellow with guts like that .     stuart said     look  we   d better get ready in here .  there   s just a chance that the kloros may have detected the valves opening and closing .  if so  they   ll be here to investigate and we   ll have to cover up .        how .     asked windham .     they won   t see mullen anywhere around .  we   ll say he   s in the head .  the kloros know that it   s one of the peculiar characteristics of earthmen that they resent intrusion on their privacy in lavatories  and they   ll make no effort to check .  if we can hold them off         what if they wait  or if they check the spacesuits .     asked porter .  stuart shrugged .     let   s hope they don   t .  and listen  polyorketes  don   t make any fuss when they come in .     polyorketes grunted     with that little guy out there .  what do you think i am .     he stared at stuart without animosity  then scratched his curly hair vigorously .     you know  i laughed at him .  i thought he was an old woman .  it makes me ashamed .     stuart cleared his throat .  he said     look  i   ve been saying some things that maybe weren   t too funny after all  now that i come to think of it .  i   d like to say i   m sorry if i have .     he turned away morosely and walked toward his cot .  he heard the steps behind him  felt the touch on his sleeve .  he turned  it was leblanc .  the youngster said softly     i keep thinking that mr .  mullen is an old man .        well  he   s not a kid .  he   s about forty five or fifty  i think .     leblanc said     do you think  mr .  stuart  that   should have gone  instead .  i   m the youngest here .  i don   t like the thought of having let an old man go in my place .  it makes me feel like the devil .        i know .  if he dies  it will be too bad .        but he volunteered .  we didn   t make him  did we .        don   t try to dodge responsibility  leblanc .  it won   t make you feel better .  there isn   t one of us without a stronger motive to run the risk than he had .     and stuart sat there silently  thinking .  mullen felt the obstruction beneath his feet yield and the walls about him slip away quickly  too quickly .  he knew it was the puff of air escaping  carrying him with it  and he dug arms and legs frantically against the wall to brake himself .  corpses were supposed to be flung well clear of the ship  but he was no corpse  for the moment .  his feet swung free and threshed .  he heard the clunk of one magnetic boot against the hull just as the rest of his body puffed out like a tight cork under air pressure .  he teetered dangerously at the lip of the hole in the ship   he had changed orientation suddenly and was looking down on it  then took a step backward as its lid came down of itself and fitted smoothly against the hull .  a feeling of unreality overwhelmed him .  surely  it wasn   t he standing on the outer surface of a ship .  not randolph f .  mullen .  so few human beings could ever say they had  even those who traveled in space constantly .  he was only gradually aware that he was in pain .  popping out of that hole with one foot clamped to the hull had nearly bent him in two .  he tried moving  cautiously  and found his motions to be erratic and almost impossible to control .  he thought nothing was broken  though the muscles of his left side were badly wrenched .  and then he came to himself and noticed that the wrist lights of his suit were on .  it was by their light that he had stared into the blackness of the c chute .  he stirred with the nervous thought that from within  the kloros might see the twin spots of moving light just outside the hull .  he flicked the switch upon the suit   s midsection .  mullen had never imagined that  standing on a ship  he would fail to see its hull .  but it was dark  as dark below as above .  there were the stars  hard and bright little non dimensional dots .  nothing more .  nothing more anywhere .  under his feet  not even the stars  not even his feet .  he bent back to look at the stars .  his head swam .  they were moving slowly .  or  rather  they were standing still and the ship was rotating  but he could not tell his eyes that .  they moved .  his eyes followed  down and behind the ship .  new stars up and above from the other side .  a black horizon .  the ship existed only as a region where there were no stars .  no stars .  why  there was one almost at his feet .  he nearly reached for it  then he realized that it was only a glittering reflection in the mirroring metal .  they were moving thousands of miles an hour .  the stars were .  the ship was .  he was .  but it meant nothing .  to his senses  there was only silence and darkness and that slow wheeling of the stars .  his eyes followed the wheeling   and his head in its helmet hit the ship   s hull with a soft bell like ring .  he felt about in panic with his thick  insensitive  spun silicate gloves .  his feet were still firmly magnetized to the hull  that was true  but the rest of his body bent backward at the knees in a right angle .  there was no gravity outside the ship .  if he bent back  there was nothing to pull the upper part of his body down and tell his joints they were bending .  his body stayed as he put it .  he pressed wildly against the hull and his torso shot upward and refused to stop when upright .  he fell forward .  he tried more slowly  balancing with both hands against the hull  until he squatted evenly .  then upward .  very slowly .  straight up .  arms out to balance .  he was straight now  aware of his nausea and lightheadedness .  he looked about .  my god  where were the steam tubes .  he couldn   t see them .  they were black on black  nothing on nothing .  quickly  he turned on the wrist lights .  in space  there were no beams  only elliptical  sharply defined spots of blue steel  winking light back at him .  where they struck a rivet  a shadow was cast  knife sharp and as black as space  the lighted region illuminated abruptly and without diffusion .  he moved his arms  his body swaying gently in the opposite direction  action and reaction .  the vision of a steam tube with its smooth cylindrical sides sprang at him .  he tried to move toward it .  his foot held firmly to the hull .  he pulled and it slogged upward  straining against quicksand that eased quickly .  three inches up and it had almost sucked free  six inches up and he thought it would fly away .  he advanced it and let it down  felt it enter the quicksand .  when the sole was within two inches of the hull  it snapped down  out of control  hitting the hull ringingly .  his spacesuit carried the vibrations  amplifying them in his ears .  he stopped in absolute terror .  the dehydrators that dried the atmosphere within his suit could not handle the sudden gush of perspiration that drenched his forehead and armpits .  he waited  then tried lifting his foot again  a bare inch  holding it there by main force and moving it horizontally .  horizontal motion involved no effort at all  it was motion perpendicular to the lines of magnetic force .  but he had to keep the foot from snapping down as he did so  and then lower it slowly .  he puffed with the effort .  each step was agony .  the tendons of his knees were cracking  and there were knives in his side .  mullen stopped to let the perspiration dry .  it wouldn   t do to steam up the inside of his faceplate .  he flashed his wrist lights  and the steam cylinder was right ahead .  the ship had four of them  at ninety degree intervals  thrusting out at an angle from the midgirdle .  they were the    fine adjustment    of the ship   s course .  the coarse adjustment was the powerful thrusters back and front which fixed final velocity by their accelerative and the decelerative force  and the hyperatomics that took care of the space swallowing jumps .  but occasionally the direction of flight had to be adjusted slightly and then the steam cylinders took over .  singly  they could drive the ship up  down  right  left .  by twos  in appropriate ratios of thrust  the ship could be turned in any desired direction .  the device had been unimproved in centuries  being too simple to improve .  the atomic pile heated the water content of a closed container into steam  driving it  in less than a second  up to temperatures where it would have broken down into a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen  and then into a mixture of electrons and ions .  perhaps the breakdown actually took place .  no one ever bothered testing  it worked  so there was no need to .  at the critical point  a needle valve gave way and the steam thrust madly out in a short but incredible blast .  and the ship  inevitably and majestically  moved in the opposite direction  veering about its own center of gravity .  when the degrees of turn were sufficient  an equal and opposite blast would take place and the turning would be canceled .  the ship would be moving at its original velocity  but in a new direction .  mullen had dragged himself out to the lip of the steam cylinder .  he had a picture of himself  a small speck teetering at the extreme end of a structure thrusting out of an ovoid that was tearing through space at ten thousand miles an hour .  but there was no air stream to whip him off the hull  and his magnetic soles held him more firmly than he liked .  with lights on  he bent down to peer into the tube and the ship dropped down precipitously as his orientation changed .  he reached out to steady himself  but he was not falling .  there was no up or down in space except for what his confused mind chose to consider up or down .  the cylinder was just large enough to hold a man  so that it might be entered for repair purposes .  his light caught the rungs almost directly opposite his position at the lip .  he puffed a sigh of relief with what breath he could muster .  some ships didn   t have ladders .  he made his way to it  the ship appearing to slip and twist beneath him as he moved .  he lifted an arm over the lip of the tube  feeling for the rung  loosened each foot  and drew himself within .  the knot in his stomach that had been there from the first was a convulsed agony now .  if they should choose to manipulate the ship  if the steam should whistle out now   he would never hear it  never know it .  one instant he would be holding a rung  feeling slowly for the next with a groping arm .  the next moment he would be alone in space  the ship a dark  dark nothingness lost forever among the stars .  there would be  perhaps  a brief glory of swirling ice crystals drifting with him  shining in his wrist lights and slowly approaching and rotating about him  attracted by his mass like infinitesimal planets to an absurdly tiny sun .  he was trickling sweat again  and now he was also conscious of thirst .  he put it out of his mind .  there would be no drinking until he was out of his suit  if ever .  up a rung  up another  and another .  how many were there .  his hand slipped and he stared in disbelief at the glitter that showed under his light .  ice .  why not .  the steam  incredibly hot as it was  would strike metal that was at nearly absolute zero .  in the few split seconds of thrust  there would not be time for the metal to warm above the freezing point of water .  a sheet of ice would condense that would sublime slowly into the vacuum .  it was the speed of all that happened that prevented the fusion of the tubes and of the original water container itself .  his groping hand reached the end .  again the wrist lights .  he stared with crawling horror at the steam nozzle  half an inch in diameter .  it looked dead  harmless .  but it always would  right up to the micro second before   around it was the outer steam lock .  it pivoted on a central hub that was springed on the portion toward space  screwed on the part toward the ship .  the springs allowed it to give under the first wild thrust of steam pressure before the ship   s mighty inertia could be overcome .  the steam was bled into the inner chamber  breaking the force of the thrust  leaving the total energy unchanged  but spreading it over time so that the hull itself was in that much less danger of being staved in .  mullen braced himself firmly against a rung and pressed against the outer lock so that it gave a little .  it was stiff  but it didn   t have to give much  just enough to catch on the screw .  he felt it catch .  he strained against it and turned it  feeling his body twist in the opposite direction .  it held tight  the screw taking up the strain as he carefully adjusted the small control switch that allowed the springs to fall free .  how well he remembered the books he had read .  he was in the interlock space now  which was large enough to hold a man comfortably  again for convenience in repairs .  he could no longer be blown away from the ship .  if the steam blast were turned on now  it would merely drive him against the inner lock hard enough to crush him to a pulp .  a quick death he would never feel  at least .  slowly  he unhooked his spare oxygen cylinder .  there was only an inner lock between himself and the control room now .  this lock opened outward into space so that the steam blast could only close it tighter  rather than blow it open .  and it fitted tightly and smoothly .  there was absolutely no way to open it from without .  he lifted himself above the lock  forcing his bent back against the inner surface of the interlock area .  it made breathing difficult .  the spare oxygen cylinder dangled at a queer angle .  he held its metal mesh hose and straightened it  forcing it against the inner lock so that vibration thudded .  again   again   it would have to attract the attention of the kloros .  they would have to investigate .  he would have no way of telling when they were about to do so .  ordinarily  they would first let air into the interlock to force the outer lock shut .  but now the outer lock was on the central screw  well away from its rim .  air would suck about it ineffectually  dragging out into space .  mullen kept on thumping .  would the kloros look at the air gauge  note that it scarcely lifted from zero  or would they take its proper working for granted .  porter said     he   s been gone an hour and a half .        i know     said stuart .  they were all restless  jumpy  but the tension among themselves had disappeared .  it was as though all the threads of emotion extended to the hull of the ship .  porter was bothered .  his philosophy of life had always been simple  take care of yourself because no one will take care of you for you .  it upset him to see it shaken .  he said     do you suppose they   ve caught him .        if they had  we   d hear about it     replied stuart  briefly .  porter felt  with a miserable twinge  that there was little interest on the part of the others in speaking to him .  he could understand it  he had not exactly earned their respect .  for the moment  a torrent of self excuse poured through his mind .  the others had been frightened  too .  a man had a right to be afraid .  no one likes to die .  at least  he hadn   t broken like aristides polyorketes .  he hadn   t wept like leblanc .  he   but there was mullen  out there on the hull .     listen     he cried     why did he do it .     they turned to look at him  not understanding  but porter didn   t care .  it bothered him to the point where it had to come out .     i want to know why mullen is risking his life .        the man     said windham     is a patriot         no  none of that .     porter was almost hysterical .     that little fellow has no emotions at all .  he just has reasons and i want to know what those reasons are  because      he didn   t finish the sentence .  could he say that if those reasons applied to a little middle aged bookkeeper  they might apply even more forcibly to himself .  polyorketes said     he   s one brave damn little fellow .     porter got to his feet .     listen      he said     he may be stuck out there .  whatever he   s doing  he may not be able to finish it alone .  i  i volunteer to go out after him .     he was shaking as he said it and he waited in fear for the sarcastic lash of stuart   s tongue .  stuart was staring at him  probably with surprise  but porter dared not meet his eyes to make certain .  stuart said  mildly     let   s give him another half hour .     porter looked up  startled .  there was no sneer on stuart   s face .  it was even friendly .  they all looked friendly .  he said     and then         and then all those who do volunteer will draw straws or something equally democratic .  who volunteers  besides porter .     they all raised their hands  stuart did  too .  but porter was happy .  he had volunteered first .  he was anxious for the half hour to pass .  it caught mullen by surprise .  the outer lock flew open and the long  thin  snakelike  almost headless neck of a kloro sucked out  unable to fight the blast of escaping air .  mullen   s cylinder flew away  almost tore free .  after one wild moment of frozen panic  he fought for it  dragging it above the airstream  waiting as long as he dared to let the first fury die down as the air of the control room thinned out  then bringing it down with force .  it caught the sinewy neck squarely  crushing it .  mullen  curled above the lock  almost entirely protected from the stream  raised the cylinder again and plunging it down again striking the head  mashing the staring eyes to liquid ruin .  in the near vacuum  green blood was pumping out of what was left of the neck .  mullen dared not vomit  but he wanted to .  with eyes averted  he backed away  caught the outer lock with one hand and imparted a whirl .  for several seconds  it maintained that whirl .  at the end of the screw  the springs engaged automatically and pulled it shut .  what was left of the atmosphere tightened it and the laboring pumps could now begin to fill the control room once again .  mullen crawled over the mangled kloro and into the room .  it was empty .  he had barely time to notice that when he found himself on his knees .  he rose with difficulty .  the transition from non gravity to gravity had taken him entirely by surprise .  it was klorian gravity  too  which meant that with this suit  he carried a fifty percent overload for his small frame .  at least  though  his heavy metal clogs no longer clung so exasperatingly to the metal underneath .  within the ship  floors and wall were of cork covered aluminum alloy .  he circled slowly .  the neckless kloro had collapsed and lay with only an occasional twitch to show it had once been a living organism .  he stepped over it  distastefully  and drew the steam tube lock shut .  the room had a depressing bilious cast and the lights shone yellow green .  it was the kloro atmosphere  of course .  mullen felt a twinge of surprise and reluctant admiration .  the kloros obviously had some way of treating materials so that they were impervious to the oxidizing effect of chlorine .  even the map of earth on the wall  printed on glossy plastic backed paper  seemed fresh and untouched .  he approached  drawn by the familiar outlines of the continents   there was a flash of motion caught in the corner of his eyes .  as quickly as he could in his heavy suit  he turned  then screamed .  the kloro he had thought dead was rising to its feet .  its neck hung limp  an oozing mass of tissue mash  but its arms reached out blindly  and the tentacles about its chest vibrated rapidly like innumerable snakes    tongues .  it was blind  of course .  the destruction of its neck stalk had deprived it of all sensory equipment  and partial asphyxiation had disorganized it .  but the brain remained whole and safe in the abdomen .  it still lived .  mullen backed away .  he circled  trying clumsily and unsuccessfully to tiptoe  though he knew that what was left of the kloro was also deaf .  it blundered on its way  struck a wall  felt to the base and began sidling along it .  mullen cast about desperately for a weapon  found nothing .  there was the kloro   s holster  but he dared not reach for it .  why hadn   t he snatched it at the very first .  fool .  the door to the control room opened .  it made almost no noise .  mullen turned  quivering .  the other kloro entered  unharmed  entire .  it stood in the doorway for a moment  chest tendrils stiff and unmoving  its neck stalk stretched forward  its horrible eyes flickering first at him and then at its nearly dead comrade .  and then its hand moved quickly to its side .  mullen  without awareness  moved as quickly in pure reflex .  he stretched out the hose of the spare oxygen cylinder  which  since entering the control room  he had replaced in its suit clamp  and cracked the valve .  he didn   t bother reducing the pressure .  he let it gush out unchecked so that he nearly staggered under the backward push .  he could see the oxygen stream .  it was a pale puff  billowing out amid the chlorine green .  it caught the kloro with one hand on the weapon   s holster .  the kloro threw its hands up .  the little beak on its head nodule opened alarmingly but noiselessly .  it staggered and fell  writhed for a moment  then lay still .  mullen approached and played the oxygen stream upon its body as though he were extinguishing a fire .  and then he raised his heavy foot and brought it down upon the center of the neck stalk and crushed it on the floor .  he turned to the first .  it was sprawled  rigid .  the whole room was pale with oxygen  enough to kill whole legions of kloros  and his cylinder was empty .  mullen stepped over the dead kloro  out of the control room and along the main corridor toward the prisoners    room .  reaction had set in .  he was whimpering in blind  incoherent fright .  stuart was tired .  false hands and all  he was at the controls of a ship once again .  two light cruisers of earth were on the way .  for better than twenty four hours he had handled the controls virtually alone .  he had discarded the chlorinating equipment  rerigged the old atmospherics  located the ship   s position in space  tried to plot a course  and sent out carefully guarded signals  which had worked .  so when the door of the control room opened  he was a little annoyed .  he was too tired to play conversational handball .  then he turned  and it was mullen stepping inside .  stuart said     for god   s sake  get back into bed  mullen .     mullen said     i   m tired of sleeping  even though i never thought i would be a while ago .        how do you feel .        i   m stiff all over .  especially my side .     he grimaced and stared involuntarily around .     don   t look for the kloros     stuart said .     we dumped the poor devils .     he shook his head .     i was sorry for them .  to themselves  they   re the human beings  you know  and we   re the aliens .  not that i   d rather they   d killed you  you understand .        i understand .     stuart turned a sidelong glance upon the little man who sat looking at the map of earth and went on     i owe you a particular and personal apology  mullen .  i didn   t think much of you .        it was your privilege     said mullen in his dry voice  there was no feeling in it .     no  it wasn   t .  it is no one   s privilege to despise another .  it is only a hard won right after long experience .        have you been thinking about this .        yes  all day .  maybe i can   t explain .  it   s these hands .     he held them up before him  spread out .     it was hard knowing that other people had hands of their own .  i had to hate them for it .  i always had to do my best to investigate and belittle their motives  point up their deficiencies  expose their stupidities .  i had to do anything that would prove to myself that they weren   t worth envying .     mullen moved restlessly .     this explanation is not necessary .        it is .  it is .     stuart felt his thoughts intently  strained to put them into words .     for years i   ve abandoned hope of finding any decency in human beings .  then you climbed into the c chute .        you had better understand     said mullen     that i was motivated by practical and selfish considerations .  i will not have you present me to myself as a hero .        i wasn   t intending to .  i know that you would do nothing without a reason .  it was what your action did to the rest of us .  it turned a collection of phonies and fools into decent people .  and not by magic either .  they were decent all along .  it was just that they needed something to live up to and you supplied it .  and  i   m one of them .  i   ll have to live up to you  too .  for the rest of my life  probably .     mullen turned away uncomfortably .  his hand straightened his sleeves  which were not in the least twisted .  his finger rested on the map .  he said     i was born in richmond  virginia  you know .  here it is .  i   ll be going there first .  where were you born .        toronto     said stuart .     that   s right here .  not very far apart on the map  is it .     stuart said     would you tell me something .        if i can .        just why did you go out there .     mullen   s precise mouth pursed .  he said  dryly     wouldn   t my rather prosaic reason ruin the inspirational effect .        call it intellectual curiosity .  each of the rest of us had such obvious motives .  porter was scared to death of being interned  leblanc wanted to get back to his sweetheart  polyorketes wanted to kill kloros  and windham was a patriot according to his lights .  as for me  i thought of myself as a noble idealist  i   m afraid .  yet in none of us was the motivation strong enough to get us into a spacesuit and out the c chute .  then what made you do it  you  of all people .        why the phrase     of all people    .        don   t be offended  but you seem devoid of all emotion .        do i .     mullen   s voice did not change .  it remained precise and soft  yet somehow a tightness had entered it .     that   s only training  mr .  stuart  and self discipline  not nature .  a small man can have no respectable emotions .  is there anything more ridiculous than a man like myself in a state of rage .  i   m five feet and one half inch tall  and one hundred and two pounds in weight  if you care for exact figures .  i insist on the half inch and the two pounds .     can i be dignified .  proud .  draw myself to my full height without inducing laughter .  where can i meet a woman who will not dismiss me instantly with a giggle .  naturally  i   ve had to learn to dispense with external display of emotion .     you talk about deformities .  no one would notice your hands or know they were different  if you weren   t so eager to tell people all about it the instant you meet them .  do you think that the eight inches of height i do not have can be hidden .  that it is not the first and  in most cases  the only thing about me that a person will notice .     stuart was ashamed .  he had invaded a privacy he ought not have .  he said     i   m sorry .        why .        i should not have forced you to speak of this .  i should have seen for myself that you  that you         that i what .  tried to prove myself .  tried to show that while i might be small in body  i held within it a giant   s heart .        i would not have put it mockingly .        why not .  it   s a foolish idea  and nothing like it is the reason i did what i did .  what would i have accomplished if that   s what was in my mind .  will they take me to earth now and put me up before the television cameras   pitching them low  of course  to catch my face  or standing me on a chair   and pin medals on me .        they are quite likely to do exactly that .        and what good would it do me .  they would say     gee  and he   s such a little guy .     and afterward  what .  shall i tell each man i meet     you know  i   m the fellow they decorated for incredible valor last month .     how many medals  mr .  stuart  do you suppose it would take to put eight inches and sixty pounds on me .     stuart said     put that way  i see your point .     mullen was speaking a trifle more quickly now  a controlled heat had entered his words  warming them to just a tepid room temperature .     there were days when i thought i would show them  the mysterious    them    that includes all the world .  i was going to leave earth and carve out worlds for myself .  i would be a new and even smaller napoleon .  so i left earth and went to arcturus .  and what could i do on arcturus that i could not have done on earth .  nothing .  i balance books .  so i am past the vanity  mr .  stuart  of trying to stand on tiptoe .        then why did you do it .        i left earth when i was twenty eight and came to the arcturian system .  i   ve been there ever since .  this trip was to be my first vacation  my first visit back to earth in all that time .  i was going to stay on earth for six months .  the kloros instead captured us and would have kept us interned indefinitely .  but i couldn   t  i couldn   t let them stop me from traveling to earth .  no matter what the risk  i had to prevent their interference .  it wasn   t love of woman  or fear  or hate  or idealism of any sort .  it was stronger than any of those .     he stopped  and stretched out a hand as though to caress the map on the wall .     mr .  stuart     mullen asked quietly     haven   t you ever been homesick .      the martian way  from the doorway of the short corridor between the only two  rooms in the travel head of the spaceship  mario esteban rioz watched sourly as ted long adjusted the video dials painstakingly .  long tried a touch clockwise  then a touch counter .  the picture was lousy .  rioz knew it would stay lousy .  they were too far from earth and at a bad position facing the sun .  but then long would not be expected to know that .  rioz remained standing in the doorway for an additional moment  head bent to clear the upper lintel  body turned half sidewise to fit the narrow opening .  then he jerked into the galley like a cork popping out of a bottle .     what are you after .     he asked .     i thought i   d get hilder     said long .  rioz propped his rump on the corner of a table shelf .  he lifted a conical can of milk from the companion shelf just above his head .  its point popped under pressure .  he swirled it gently as he waited for it to warm .     what for .     he said .  he upended the cone and sucked noisily .     thought i   d listen .        i think it   s a waste of power .     long looked up  frowning .     it   s customary to allow free use of personal video sets .        within reason     retorted rioz .  their eyes met challengingly .  rioz had the rangy body  the gaunt  cheek sunken face that was almost the hallmark of the martian scavenger  those spacers who patiently haunted the space routes between earth and mars pcrte blue eyes were set keenly in the brown  lined face which  in turn  stood darkly out against the white surrounding syntho fur that lined the upturned collar of his leathtic space jacket .  long was altogether paler and softer .  he bore some of the marks of the grounder  although no second generation martian could be a grounder in the sense that earthmen were .  his own collar was thrown back and his dark brown hair freely exposed .     what do you call within reason .     demanded long .  rioz   s thin lips grew thinner .  he said     considering that we   re not even going to make expenses this trip  the way it looks  any power drain at all is outside reason .     long said     if we   re losing money  hadn   t you better get back to your post .  it   s your watch .     rioz grunted and ran a thumb and forefinger over the stubble on his chin .  he got up and trudged to the door  his soft  heavy boots muting the sound of his steps .  he paused to look at the thermostat  then turned with a flare of fury .     i thought it was bot .  where do you think you are .     long said     forty degrees isn   t excessive .        for you it isn   t  maybe .  but this is space  not a heated office at the iron mines .     rioz swung the thermostat control down to minimum with a quick thumb movement .     sun   s warm enough .        the galley isn   t on sunside .        it   ll percolate through  damn it .     rioz stepped through the door and long stared after him for a long moment  then turned back to the video .  he did not turn up the thermostat .  the picture was still flickering badly  but it would have to do .  long folded a chair down out of the wall .  he leaned forward waiting through the formal announcement  the momentary pause before the slow dissolution of the curtain  the spotlight picking out the well known bearded figure which grew as it was brought forward until it filled the screen .  the voice  impressive even through the flutings and croakings induced by the electron storms of twenty millions of miles  began     friends .  my fellow citizens of earth .  .  .         rioz   s eye caught the flash of the radio signal as he stepped into the pilot room .  for one moment  the palms of his hands grew clammy when it seemed to him that it was a radar pip  but that was only his guilt speaking .  he should not have left the pilot room while on duty theoretically  though all scavengers did it .  still  it was the standard nightmare  this business of a strike turning up during just those five minutes when one knocked off for a quick coffee because it seemed certain that space was clear .  and the nightmare had been known to happen  too .  rioz threw in the multi scanner .  it was a waste of power  but while he was thinking about it  he might as well make sure .  space was clear except for the far distant echoes from the neighboring ships on the scavenging line .  he hooked up the radio circuit  and the blond  long nosed head of richard swenson  copilot of the next ship on the mars ward side  filled it .     hey  mario     said swenson .     hi .  what   s new .     there was a second and a fraction of pause between that and swenson   s next comment  since the speed of electromagnetic radiation is not infinite .     what a day i   ve had .        something happened .     rioz asked .     i had a strike .        well  good .        sure  if i   d roped it in     said swenson morosely .     what happened .        damn it  i headed in the wrong direction .     rioz knew better than to laugh .  he said     how did you do that .        it wasn   t my fault .  the trouble was the shell was moving way out of the ecliptic .  can you imagine the stupidity of a pilot that can   t work the release maneuver decently .  how was i to know .  i got the distance of the shell and let it go at that .  i just assumed its orbit was in the usual trajectory family .  wouldn   t you .  i started along what i thought was a good line of intersection and it was five minutes before i noticed the distance was still going up .  the pips were taking their sweet time returning .  so then i took the angular projections of the thing  and it was too late to catch up with it .        any of the other boys getting it .        no .  it   s way out of the ecliptic and   ll keep on going forever .  that   s not what bothers me so much .  it was only an inner shell .  but i hate to tell you how many tons of propulsion i wasted getting up speed and then getting back to station .  you should have heard canute .     canute was richard swenson   s brother and partner .     mad  huh .     said rioz .     mad .  like to have killed me .  but then we   ve been out five months now and it   s getting kind of sticky .  you know .        i know .        how are you doing  mario .     rioz made a spitting gesture .      about that much this trip .  two shells in the last two weeks and i had to chase each one for six hours .        big ones .        are you kidding .  i could have scaled them down to phobos by hand .  this is the worst trip i   ve ever had .        how much longer are you staying .        for my part  we can quit tomorrow .  we   ve only been out two months and it   s got so i   m chewing long out all the time .     there was a pause over and above the electromagnetic lag .  swenson said     what   s he like  anyway .  long  i mean .     rioz looked over his shoulder .  he could hear the soft  crackly mutter of the video in the galley .     i can   t make him out .  he says to me about a week after the start of the trip     mario  why are you a scavenger .     i just look at him and say     to make a living .  why do you suppose .     i mean  what the hell kind of a question is that .  why is anyone a scavenger .     anyway  he says     that   s not it  mario .     he   s telling me  you see .  he says     you   re a scavenger because this is part of the martian way .         swenson said     and what did he mean by that .     rioz shrugged .     i never asked him .  right now he   s sitting in there listening to the ultra microwave from earth .  he   s listening to some grounder called hilder .        hilder .  a grounder politician  an assemblyman or something  isn   t he .        that   s right .  at least  i think that   s right .  long is always doing things like that .  he brought about fifteen pounds of books with him  all about earth .  just plain dead weight  you know .        well  he   s your partner .  and talking about partners  i think i   ll get back on the job .  if i miss another strike  there   ll be murder around here .     he was gone and rioz leaned back .  he watched the even green line that was the pulse scanner .  he tried the multiscanner a moment .  space was still clear .  he felt a little better .  a bad spell is always worse if the scavengers all about you are pulling in shell after shell  if the shells go spiraling down to the phobos scrap forges with everyone   s brand welded on except your own .  then  too  he had managed to work off some of his resentment toward long .  it was a mistake teaming up with long .  it was always a mistake to team up with a tenderfoot .  they thought what you wanted was conversation  especially long  with his eternal theories about mars and its great new role in human progress .  that was the way he said it  human progress  the martian way  the new creative minority .  and all the time what rioz wanted wasn   t talk  but a strike  a few shells to call their own .  at that  he hadn   t any choice  really .  long was pretty well known down on mars and made good pay as a mining engineer .  he was a friend of commissioner sankov and he   d been out on one or two short scavenging missions before .  you can   t turn a fellow down flat before a tryout  even though it did look funny .  why should a mining engineer with a comfortable job and good money want to muck around in space .  rioz never asked long that question .  scavenger partners are forced too close together to make curiosity desirable  or    sometimes even safe .  but long talked so much that he answered the question .     i had to come out here  mario     he said .     the future of mars isn   t in the mines  it   s in space .     rioz wondered how it would it be to try a trip alone .  everyone said it was impossible .  even discounting lost opportunities when one man had to go off watch to sleep or attend to other things  it was well known that one man alone in space would become intolerably depressed in a relatively short while .  taking a partner along made a six month trip possible .  a regular crew would be better  but no scavenger could make money on a ship large enough to carry one .  the capital it would take in propulsion alone .  even two didn   t find it exactly fun in space .  usually you had to change partners each trip and you could stay out longer with some than with others .  look at richard and canute swenson .  they teamed up every five or six trips because they were brothers .  and yet whenever they did  it was a case of constantly mounting tension and antagonism after the first week .  oh well .  space was clear .  rioz would feel a little better if he went back in the galley and smoothed down some of the bickering with long .  he might as well show he was an old space hand who took the irritations of space as they came .  he stood up  walked the three steps necessary to reach the short  narrow corridor that tied together the two rooms of the spaceship .      once again rioz stood in the doorway for a moment  watching .  long was intent on the flickering screen .  rioz said gruffly     i   m shoving up the thermostat .  it   s all right  we can spare the power .     long nodded .     if you like .     rioz took a hesitant step forward .  space was clear  so to hell with sitting and looking at a blank  green  pipless line .  he said     what   s the grounder been talking about .        history of space travel mostly .  old stuff  but he   s doing it well .  he   s giving the whole works  color cartoons  trick photography  stills from old films  everything .     as if to illustrate long   s remarks  the bearded figure faded out of view  and a cross sectional view of a spaceship flitted onto the screen .  hilder   s voice continued  pointing out features of interest that appeared in schematic color .  the communications system of the ship outlined itself in red as he talked about it  the storerooms  the proton micropile drive  the cybernetic circuits .  .  .  then hilder was back on the screen .     but this is only the travel head of the ship .  what moves it .  what gets it off the earth .     everyone knew what moved a spaceship  but hilder   s voice was like a drug .  he made spaceship propulsion sound like the secret of the ages  like an ultimate revelation .  even rioz felt a slight tingling of suspense  though he had spent the greater part of his life aboard ship .  hilder went on .     scientists call it different names .  they call it the law of action and reaction .  sometimes they call it newton   s third law .  sometimes they call it conservation of momentum .  but we don   t have to call it any name .  we can just use our common sense .  when we swim  we push water backward and move forward ourselves .  when we walk  we push back against the ground and move forward .  when we fly a gyro flivver  we push air backward and move forward .     nothing can move forward unless something else moves backward .  it   s the old principle of    you can     get something for nothing .      now imagine a spaceship that weighs a hundred thousand tons lifting off earth .  to do that  something else must be moved downward .  since a spaceship is extremely heavy  a great deal of material must be moved downward .  so much material  in fact  that there is no place to keep it all aboard ship .  a special compartment must be built behind the ship to hold it .     again hilder faded out and the ship returned .  it shrank and a truncated cone appeared behind it .  in bright yellow  words appeared within it  material to be thrown away .     but now     said hilder     the total weight of the ship is much greater .  you need still more propulsion and still more .     the ship shrank enormously to add on another larger shell and still another immense one .  the ship proper  the travel head  was a little dot on the screen  a glowing red dot .  rioz said     hell  this is kindergarten stuff .        not to the people he   s speaking to  mario     replied long .     earth isn   t mars .  there must be billions of earth people who   ve never even seen a spaceship  don   t know the first thing about it .     hilder was saying     when the material inside the biggest shell is used up  the shell is detached .  it   s thrown away  too .     the outermost shell came loose  wobbled about the screen .     then the second one goes     said hilder     and then  if the trip is a long one  the last is ejected .     the ship was just a red dot now  with three shells shifting and moving  lost in space .  hilder said     these shells represent a hundred thousand tons of tungsten  magnesium  aluminum  and steel .  they are gone forever from earth .  mars is ringed by scavengers  waiting along the routes of space travel  waiting for the cast off shells  netting and branding them  saving them for mars .  not one cent of payment reaches earth for them .  they are salvage .  they belong to the ship that finds them .     rioz said     we risk our investment and our lives .  if we don   t pick them up  no one gets them .  what loss is that to earth .        look     said long     he   s been talking about nothing but the drain that mars  venus  and the moon put on earth .  this is just another item of loss .        they   ll get their return .  we   re mining more iron every year .        and most of it goes right back into mars .  if you can believe his figures  earth has invested two hundred billion dollars in mars and received back about five billion dollars    worth of iron .  it   s put five hundred billion dollars into the moon and gotten back a little over twenty five billion dollars of magnesium  titanium  and assorted light metals .  it   s put fifty billion dollars into venus and gotten back nothing .  and that   s what the taxpayers of earth are really interested  tax money out  nothing in .     the screen was filled  as he spoke  with diagrams of the scavengers on the route to mars  little  grinning caricatures of ships  reaching  out wiry  tenuous arms that groped for the tumbling  empty shells  seizing and snaking them in  branding them mars property in glowing letters  then scaling them down to phobos .  then it was hilder again .     they tell us eventually they will return it all to us .  eventually .  once they are a going concern .  we don   t know when that will be .  a century from now .  a thousand years .  a million .     eventually .     let   s take them at their word .  someday they will give us back all our metals .  someday they will grow their own food  use their own power  live their own lives .     but one thing they can never return .  not in a hundred million years .  water .     mars has only a trickle of water because it is too small .  venus has no water at all because it is too hot .  the moon has none because it is too hot and too small .  so earth must supply not only drinking water and washing water for the spacers  water to run their industries  water for the hydroponic factories they claim to be setting up  but even water to throwaway by the millions of tons .     what is the propulsive force that spaceships use .  what is it they throw out behind so that they can accelerate forward .  once it was the gases generated from explosives .  that was very expensive .  then the proton micropile was invented  a cheap power source that could heat up any liquid until it was a gas under tremendous pressure .  what is the cheapest and most plentiful liquid available .  why  water  of course .     each spaceship leaves earth carrying nearly a million tons  not pounds  tons  of water  for the sole purpose of driving it into space so that it may speed up or slow down .     our ancestors burned the oil of earth madly and willfully .  they destroyed its coal recklessly .  we despise and condemn them for that  but at least they had this  they thought that when the need arose  substitutes would be found .  and they were right .  we have our plankton farms and our proton micropiles .     but there is no substitute for water .  none .  there never can be .  and when our descendants view the desert we will have made of earth  what excuse will they find for us .  when the droughts come and grow      long leaned forward and turned off the set .  he said     that bothers me .  the damn fool is deliberately  what   s the matter .     rioz had risen uneasily to his feet .     i ought to be watching the pips .        the hell with the pips .     long got up likewise  followed rioz through the narrow corridor  and stood just inside the pilot room .     if hilder carries this through  if he   s got the guts to make a real issue out of it  wow .     he had seen it too .  the pip was a class a  racing after the outgoing signal like a greyhound after a mechanical rabbit .  rioz was babbling     space was clear  i tell you  clear .  for mars    sake  ted  don   t just freeze on me .  see if you can spot it visually .     rioz was working speedily and with an efficiency that was the result of nearly twenty years of scavenging .  he had the distance in two minutes .  then  remembering swenson   s experience  he measured the angle of declination and the radial velocity as well .  he yelled at long     once point seven six radians .  you can   t miss it  man .     long held his breath as he adjusted the vernier .     it   s only half a radian off the sun  it   ll only be crescent lit .     he increased magnification as rapidly as he dared  watching for the one    star    that changed position and grew to have a form  revealing itself to be no star .     i   m starting  anyway     said rioz .     we can   t wait .        i   ve got it .  i   ve got it .     magnification was still too small to give it a definite shape  but the dot long watched was brightening and dimming rhythmically as the shell rotated and caught sunlight on cross sections of different sizes .     hold on .     the first of many fine spurts of steam squirted out of the proper vents  leaving long trails of micro crystals of ice gleaming mistily in the pale beams of the distant sun .  they thinned out for a hundred miles or more .  one spurt  then another  then another  as the scavenger ship moved out of its stable trajectory and took up a course tangential to that of the shell .     it   s moving like a comet at perihelion .     yelled rioz .     those damned grounder pilots knock the shells off that way on purpose .  i   d like to      he swore his anger in a frustrated frenzy as he kicked steam backward and backward recklessly  till the hydraulic cushioning of his chair had sloughed back a full foot and long had found himself all but unable to maintain his grip on the guard rail .     have a heart     he begged .  but rioz had his eye on the pips .     if you can   t take it  man  stay on mars .     the steam spurts continued to boom distantly .  the radio came to life .  long managed to lean forward through what seemed like molasses and closed contact .  it was swenson  eyes glaring .  swenson yelled     where the hell are you guys going .  you    ll be in my sector in ten seconds .     rioz said     i   m chasing a shell .         in my sector .        it started in mine and you   re not in position to get it .  shut off that radio  ted .     the ship thundered through space  a thunder that could be heard only within the hull .  and then rioz cut the engines in stages large enough to make long flail forward .  the sudden silence was more ear shattering than the noise that had preceded it .  rioz said     all right .  let me have the    scope .     they both watched .  the shell was a definite truncated cone now  tumbling with slow solemnity as it passed along among the stars .     it   s a class a shell  all right     said rioz with satisfaction .  a giant among shells  he thought .  it would put them into the black .  long said     we   ve got another pip on the scanner .  i think it   s swenson taking after us .     rioz scarcely gave it a glance     he won   t catch us .     the shell grew larger still  filling the visiplate .  rioz   s hands were on the harpoon lever .  he waited  adjusted the angle microscopically twice  played out the length allotment .  then he yanked  tripping the release .  for a moment  nothing happened .  then a metal mesh cable snaked out onto the visiplate  moving toward the shell like a striking cobra .  it made contact  but it did not hold .  if it had  it would have snapped instantly like a cobweb strand .  the shell was turning with a rotational momentum amounting to thousands of tons .  what the cable did do was to set up a powerful magnetic field that acted as a brake on the shell .  another cable and another lashed out .  rioz sent them out in an almost heedless expenditure of energy .     i   ll get this one .  by mars  i   ll get this one .     with some two dozen cables stretching between ship and shell  he desisted .  the shell   s rotational energy  converted by breaking into heat  had raised its temperature to a point where its radiation could be picked up by the ship   s meters .  long said     do you want me to put our brand on .        suits me .  but you don   t have to if you don   t want to .  it   s my watch .        i don   t mind .     long clambered into his suit and went out the lock .  it was the surest sign of his newness to the game that he could count the number of times he had been out in space in a suit .  this was the fifth time .  he went out along the nearest cable  hand over hand  feeling the vibration of the mesh against the metal of his mitten .  he burned their serial number in the smooth metal of the shell .  there was nothing to oxidize the steel in the emptiness of space .  it simply melted and vaporized  condensing some feet away from the energy beam  turning the surface it touched into gray  powdery dullness .  long swung back toward the ship .  inside again  he took off his helmet  white and thick with frost that collected as soon as he had entered .  the first thing he heard was swenson   s voice coming over the radio in this almost unrecognizable rage      .  .  . straight to the commissioner .  damn it  there are rules to this game .     rioz sat back  unbothered .     look  it hit my sector .  i was late spotting it and i chased it into yours .  you couldn   t have gotten it with mars for a backstop .  that   s all there is to it  you back  long .     he cut contact .  the signal button raged at him  but he paid no attention .     he   s going to the commissioner .     long asked .     not a chance .  he just goes on like that because it breaks the monotony .  he doesn   t mean anything by it .  he knows it   s our shell .  and how do you like that hunk of stuff  ted .        pretty good .        pretty good .  it   s terrific .  hold on .  i   m setting it swinging .     the side jets spat steam and the ship started a slow rotation about the shell .  the shell followed it .  in thirty minutes  they were a gigantic bolo spinning in emptiness .  long checked the ephemeris for the position of deimos .  at a precisely calculated moment  the cables released their magnetic field and the shell went streaking off tangentially in a trajectory that would  in a day or so  bring it within pronging distance of the shell stores on the martian satellite .  rioz watched it go .  he felt good .  he turned to long .     this is one fine day for us .        what about hilder   s speech .     asked long .     what .  who .  oh  that .  listen  if i had to worry about every thing some damned grounder said  i   d never get any sleep .  forget it .        i don   t think we should forget it .        you   re nuts .  don   t bother me about it  will you .  get some sleep instead .         ted long found the breadth and height of the city   s main thoroughfare exhilarating .  it had been two months since the commissioner had declared a moratorium on scavenging and had pulled all ships out of space  but this feeling of a stretched out vista had not stopped thrilling long .  even the thought that the moratorium was called pending a decision on the part of earth to enforce its new insistence on water economy  by deciding upon a ration limit for scavenging  did not cast him entirely down .  the roof of the avenue was painted a luminous light blue  perhaps as an old fashioned imitation of earth   s sky .  ted wasn   t sure .  the walls were lit with the store windows that pierced it .  off in the distance  over the hum of traffic and the sloughing noise of people   s feet passing him  he could hear the intermittent blasting as new channels were being bored into mars    crust .  all his life he remembered such blastings .  the ground he walked on had been part of solid  unbroken rock when he was born .  the city was growing and would keep on growing  if earth would only let it .  he turned off at a cross street  narrower  not quite as brilliantly lit  shop windows giving way to apartment houses  each with its row of lights along the front facade .  shoppers and traffic gave way to slower paced individuals and to squalling youngsters who had as yet evaded the maternal summons to the evening meal .  at the last minute  long remembered the social amenities and stopped off at a corner water store .  he passed over his canteen .     fill    er up .     the plump storekeeper unscrewed the cap  cocked an eye into the opening .  he shook it a little and let it gurgle .     not much left     he said cheerfully .     no     agreed long .  the storekeeper trickled water in  holding the neck of the canteen close to the hose tip to avoid spillage .  the volume gauge whirred .  he screwed the cap back on .  long passed over the coins and took his canteen .  it clanked against his hip now with a pleasing heaviness .  it would never do to visit a family without a full canteen .  among the boys  it didn   t matter .  not as much  anyway .  he entered the hallway of no .      climbed a short flight of stairs  and paused with his thumb on the signal .  the sound of voices could be heard quite plainly .  one was a woman   s voice  somewhat shrill .     it   s all right for you to have your scavenger friends here  isn   t it .  i   m supposed to be thankful you manage to get home two months a year .  oh  it   s quite enough that you spend a day or two with me .  after that  it   s the scavengers again .     i   ve been home for a long time now     said a male voice     and this is business .  for mars    sake  let up  dora .  they   ll be here soon .     long decided to wait a moment before signaling .  it might give them a chance to hit a more neutral topic .     what do i care if they come .     retorted dora .     let them hear me .  and i   d just as soon the commissioner kept the moratorium on permanently .  you hear me .        and what would we live on .     came the male voice hotly .     you tell me that .        i   ll tell you .  you can make a decent  honorable living right here on mars  just like everybody else .  i   m the only one in this apartment house that   s a scavenger widow .  that   s what i am  a widow .  i   m worse than a widow  because if i were a widow  i   d at least have a chance to marry someone else  what did you say .        nothing .  nothing at all .        oh  i know what you said .  now listen here  dick swenson         i only said     cried swenson     that now i know why scavengers usually don   t marry .        you shouldn   t have either .  i   m tired of having every person in the neighborhood pity me and smirk and ask when you   re coming home .  other people can be mining engineers and administrators and even tunnel borers .  at least tunnel borers    wives have a decent home life and their children don   t grow up like vagabonds .  peter might as well not have a father      a thin boy soprano voice made its way through the door .  it was somewhat more distant  as though it were in another room .     hey  mom  what   s a vagabond .     dora   s voice rose a notch .     peter .  you keep your mind on your homework .     swenson said in a low voice     it   s not right to talk this way in front of the kid .  what kind of notions will he get about me .        stay home then and teach him better notions .     peter   s voice called out again .     hey  mom  i   m going to be a scavenger when i grow up .     footsteps sounded rapidly .  there was a momentary hiatus in the sounds  then a piercing     mom .  hey  mom .  leggo my ear .  what did i do .     and a snuffling silence .  long seized the chance .  he worked the signal vigorously .  swenson opened the door  brushing down his hair with both hands .     hello  ted     he said in a subdued voice .  then loudly     ted   s here  dora .  where   s mario  ted .     long said     he   ll be here in a while .     dora came bustling out of the next room  a small  dark woman with a pinched nose  and hair  just beginning to show touches of gray  combed off the forehead .     hello  ted .  have you eaten .        quite well  thanks .  i haven   t interrupted you  have i .        not at all .  we finished ages ago .  would you like some coffee .        i think so .     ted unslung his canteen and offered it .     oh  goodness  that   s all right .  we   ve plenty of water .        i insist .        well then      back into the kitchen she went .  through the swinging door  long caught a glimpse of dishes sitting in secoterg  the    waterless cleaner that soaks up and absorbs grease and dirt in a twinkling .  one ounce of water will rinse eight square feet of dish surface clean as clean .  buy secoterg .  secoterg just cleans it right  makes your dishes shiny bright  does away with water waste      the tune started whining through his mind and long crushed it with speech .  he said     how   s pete .        fine  fine .  the kid   s in the fourth grade now .  you know i don   t get to see him much .  well sir  when i came back last time  he looked at me and said .  .  .     it went on for a while and wasn   t too bad as bright sayings of bright children as told by dull parents go .  the door signal burped and mario rioz came in  frowning and red .  swenson stepped to him quickly .     listen  don   t say anything about shell snaring .  dora still remembers the time you fingered a class a shell out of my territory and she   s in one of her moods now .        who the hell wants to talk about shells .     rioz slung off a fur lined jacket  threw it over the back of the chair and sat down .  dora came through the swinging door  viewed the newcomer with a synthetic smile  and said     hello  mario .  coffee for you  too .     .     yeah     he said  reaching automatically for his canteen .     just use some more of my water  dora     said long quickly .     he   ll owe it to me .        yeah     said rioz .     what   s wrong  mario .     asked long .  rioz said heavily     go on .  say you told me so .  a year ago when hilder made that speech  you told me so .  say it .     long shrugged .  rioz said     they   ve set up the quota .  fifteen minutes ago the news came out .        well .        fifty thousand tons of water per trip .        what .     yelled swenson  burning .     you can   t get off mars with fifty thousand .        that   s the figure .  it   s a deliberate piece of gutting .  no more scavenging .     dora came out with the coffee and set it down all around .     what   s all this about no more scavenging .     she sat down very firmly and swenson looked helpless .     it seems     said long     that they   re rationing us at fifty thousand tons and that means we can   t make any more trips .        well  what of it .     dora sipped her coffee and smiled gaily .     if you want my opinion  it   s a good thing .  it   s time all you scavengers found yourselves a nice  steady job here on mars .  i mean it .  it   s no life to be running all over space         please  dora     said swenson .  rioz came close to a snort .  dora raised her eyebrows .     i   m just giving my opinions .     long said     please feel free to do so .  but i would like to say something .  fifty thousand is just a detail .  we know that earth  or at least hilder   s party  wants to make political capital out of a campaign for water economy  so we   re in a bad hole .  we   ve got to get water somehow or they   ll shut us down altogether  right .        well  sure     said swenson .     but the question is how  right .        if it   s only getting water     said rioz in a sudden gush of words     there   s only one thing to do and you know it .  if the grounders won   t give us water  we   ll take it .  the water doesn   t belong to them just because their fathers and grandfathers were too damned sick yellow ever to leave their fat planet .  water belongs to people wherever they are .  we   re people and the water   s ours  too .  we have a right to it .        how do you propose taking it .     asked long .     easy .  they   ve got oceans of water on earth .  they can   t post a guard over every square mile .  we can sink down on the night side of the planet any time we want  fill our shells  then get away .  how can they stop us .        in half a dozen ways  mario .  how do you spot shells in space up to distances of a hundred thousand miles .  one thin metal shell in all that space .  how .  by radar .  do you think there   s no radar on earth .  do you think that if earth ever gets the notion we   re engaged in waterlegging  it won   t be simple for them to set up a radar network to spot ships coming in from space .     dora broke in indignantly .     i   ll tell you one thing  mario rioz .  my husband isn   t going to be part of any raid to get water to keep up his scavenging with .        it isn   t just scavenging     said mario .     next they   ll be cutting down on everything else .  we   ve got to stop them now .        but we don   t need their water  anyway     said dora .     we   re not the moon or venus .  we pipe enough water down from the polar caps for all we need .  we have a water tap right in this apartment .  there   s one in every apartment on this block .     long said     home use is the smallest part of it .  the mines use water .  and what do we do about the hydroponic tanks .        that   s right     said swenson .     what about the hydroponic tanks  dora .  they   ve got to have water and it   s about time we arranged to grow our own fresh food instead of having to live on the condensed crud they ship us from earth .        listen to him     said dora scornfully .     what do you know about fresh food .  you   ve never eaten any .        i   ve eaten more than you think .  do you remember those carrots i picked up once .        well  what was so wonderful about them .  if you ask me  good baked protomeal is much better .  and healthier  too .  it just seems to be the fashion now to be talking fresh vegetables because they   re increasing taxes for these hydroponics .  besides  all this will blow over .     long said     i don   t think so .  not by itself  anyway .  hilder will probably be the next coordinator  and then things may really get bad .  if they cut down on food shipments  too         well  then     shouted rioz     what do we do .  i still say take it .  take the water .        and i say we can   t do that  mario .  don   t you see that what you    re suggesting is the earth way  the grounder way .  you   re trying to hold on to the umbilical cord that ties mars to earth .  can   t you get away from that .  can   t you see the martian way .        no  i can   t .  suppose you tell me .        i will  if you   ll listen .  when we think about the solar system  what do we think about .  mercury  venus  earth  moon  mars  phobos  and deimos .  there you are  seven bodies  that   s all .  but that doesn   t represent one percent of the solar system .  we martians are right at the edge of the other ninety nine percent .  out there  farther from the sun  there   s unbelievable amounts of water .     the others stared .  swenson said uncertainly     you mean the layers of ice on jupiter and saturn .        not that specifically  but it is water  you   ll admit .  a thousand mile thick layer of water is a lot of water .        but it   s all covered up with layers of ammonia or  or something  isn   t it .     asked swenson .     besides  we can   t land on the major planets .        i know that     said long     but i haven   t said that was the answer .  the major planets aren   t the only objects out there .  what about the asteroids and the satellites .  vesta is a two hundred mile diameter asteroid that   s hardly more than a chunk of ice .  one of the moons of saturn is mostly ice .  how about that .     rioz said     haven   t you ever been in space  ted .        you know i have .  why do you ask .        sure  i know you have  but you still talk like a grounder .  have you thought of the distances involved .  the average asteroid is a hundred twenty million miles from mars at the closest .  that   s twice the venus mars hop and you know that hardly any liners do even that in one jump .  they usually stop off at earth or the moon .  after all  how long do you expect anyone to stay in space  man .        i don   t know .  what   s your limit .        you know the limit .  you don   t have to ask me .  it   s six months .  that   s handbook data .  after six months  if you   re still in space  you   re psychotherapy meat .  right  dick .     swenson nodded .     and that   s just the asteroids     rioz went on .     from mars to jupiter is three hundred thirty million miles  and to saturn it   s seven hundred million .  how can anyone handle that kind of distance .  suppose you hit standard velocity or  to make it even  say you get up to a good two hundred kilomiles an hour .  it would take you  let   s see  allowing time for acceleration and deceleration  about six or seven months to get to jupiter and nearly a year to get to saturn .  of course  you could hike the speed to a million miles an hour  theoretically  but where would you get the water to do that .        gee     said a small voice attached to a smutty nose and round eyes     saturn .     dora whirled in her chair .     peter  march right back into your room .        aw  ma .        don   t    aw ma    me .     she began to get out of the chair  and peter scuttled away .  swenson said     say  dora  why don   t you keep him company for a while .  it   s hard to keep his mind on homework if we   re all out here talking .     dora sniffed obstinately and stayed put     i   ll sit right here until i find out what ted long is thinking of .  i tell you right now i don   t like the sound of it .     swenson said nervously     well  never mind jupiter and saturn .  i   m sure ted isn   t figuring on that .  but what about vesta .  we could make it in ten or twelve weeks there and the same back .  and two hundred miles in diameter .  that   s four million cubic miles of ice .        so what .     said rioz .     what do we do on vesta .  quarry the ice .  set up mining machinery .  say  do you know how long that would take .     long said     i   m talking about saturn  not vesta .     rioz addressed an unseen audience .     i tell him seven hundred million miles and he keeps on talking .        all right     said long     suppose you tell me how you know we can only stay in spa    e six months  mario .        it   s common knowledge  damn it .        because it   s in the handbook of space flight .  it   s data compiled by earth scientists from experience with earth pilots and spacemen .  you   re still thinking grounder style .  you won   t think the martian way .        a martian may be a martian  but he   s still a man .        but how can you be so blind .  how many times have you fellows been out for over six months without a break .     rioz said     that   s different .        because you   re martians .  because you   re professional scavengers .        no .  because we   re not on a flight .  we can put back for mars any time we want to .        but you don   t want to .  that   s my point .  earthmen have tremendous ships with libraries of films  with a crew of fifteen plus passengers .  still  they can only stay out six months maximum .  martian scavengers have a two room ship with only one partner .  but we can stick it out more than six months .     dora said     i suppose you want to stay in a ship for a year and go to saturn .        why not  dora .     said long .     we can do it .  don   t you see we can .  earthmen can   t .  they   ve got a real world .  they   ve got open sky and fresh food  all the air and water they want .  getting into a ship is a terrible change for them .  more than six months is too much for them for that very reason .  martians are been living on a ship our entire lives .     that   s all mars is  a ship .  it   s just a big ship forty five hundred miles across with one tiny room in it occupied by fifty thousand people .  it   s closed in like a ship .  we breathe packaged air and drink packaged water  which we repurify over and over .  we eat the same food rations we eat aboard ship .  when we get into a ship  it   s the same thing we   ve known all our lives .  we can stand it for a lot more than a year if we have to .     dora said     dick  too .        we all can .        well  dick can   t .  it   s all very well for you  ted long  and this shell stealer here  this mario  to talk about jaunting off for a year .  you   re not married .  dick is .  he has a wife and he has a child and that   s enough for him .  he can just get a regular job right here on mars .  why  my goodness  suppose you go to saturn and find there   s no water there .  how   ll you get back .  even if you had water left  you   d be out of food .  it   s the most ridiculous thing i ever heard of .        no .  now listen     said long tightly .     i   ve thought this thing out .  i   ve talked to commissioner sankov and he   ll help .  but we   ve got to have ships and men .  i can   t get them .  the men won   t listen to me .  i   m green .  you two are known and respected .  you   re veterans .  if you back me  even if you don   t go yourselves  if you   ll just help me sell this thing to the rest  get volunteers         first     said rioz grumpily     you   ll have to do a lot more explaining .  once we get to saturn  where   s the water .        that   s the beauty of it     said long .     that   s why it   s got to be saturn .  the water there is just floating around in space for the taking .             when hamish sankov had come to mars  there was no such thing as a native martian .  now there were two hundred odd babies whose grandfathers had been born on mars  native in the third generation .  when he had come as a boy in his teens  mars had been scarcely more than a huddle of grounded spaceships connected by sealed underground tunnels .  through the years  he had seen buildings grow and burrow widely  thrusting blunt snouts up into the thin  unbreathable atmosphere .  he had seen huge storage depots spring up into which spaceships and their loads could be swallowed whole .  he had seen the mines grow from nothing to a huge gouge in the martian crust  while the population of mars grew from fifty to fifty thousand .  it made him feel old  these long memories  they and the even dimmer memories induced by the presence of this earthman before him .  his visitor brought up those long forgotten scraps of thought about a soft warm world that was as kind and gentle to mankind as the mother   s womb .  the earthman seemed fresh from that womb .  not very tall  not very lean  in fact  distinctly plump .  dark hair with a neat little wave in it  a neat little mustache  and neatly scrubbed skin .  his clothing was right in style and as fresh and neatly turned as plastek could be .  sankov   s own clothes were of martian manufacture  serviceable and clean  but many years behind the times .  his face was craggy and lined  his hair was pure white  and his adam   s apple wobbled when he talked .  the earthman was myron digby  member of earth   s general assembly .  sankov was martian commissioner .  sankov said     this all hits us hard  assemblyman .        it   s hit most of us hard  too  commissioner .        uh huh .  can   t honestly say then that i can make it out .  of course  you understand  i don   t make out that i can understand earth ways  for all that i was born there .  mars is a hard place to live  assemblyman  and you have to understand that .  it takes a lot of shipping space just to bring us food  water  and raw materials so we can live .  there   s not much room left for books and news films .  even video programs can   t reach mars  except for about a month when earth is in conjunction  and even then nobody has much time to listen .     my office gets a weekly summary film from planetary press .  generally  i don   t have time to pay attention to it .  maybe you   d call us provincial  and you   d be right .  when something like this happens  all we can do is kind of helplessly look at each other .     digby said slowly     you can   t mean that your people on mars haven   t heard of hilder   s anti waster campaign .        no  can   t exactly say that .  there   s a young scavenger  son of a good friend of mine who died in space     sankov scratched the side of his neck doubtfully     who makes a hobby out of reading up on earth history and things like that .  he catches video broadcasts when he   s out in space and he listened to this man hilder .  near as i can make out that was the first talk hilder made about wasters .     the young fellow came to me with that .  naturally  i didn   t take him very serious .  i kept an eye on the planetary press films for a while after that  but there wasn   t much mention of hilder and what there was made him out to look pretty funny .        yes  commissioner     said digby     it all seemed quite a joke when it started .     sankov stretched out a pair of long legs to one side of his desk and crossed them at the ankles .     seems to me it   s still pretty much of a joke .  what   s his argument .  we   re using up water .  has he tried looking at some figures .  i got them all here .  had them brought to me when this committee arrived .     seems that earth has four hundred million cubic miles of water in its oceans and each cubic mile weighs four and a half billion tons .  that   s a lot of water .  now we use some of that heap in space flight .  most of the thrust is inside earth   s gravitational field  and that means the water thrown out finds its way back to the oceans .  hilder doesn   t figure that in .  when he says a million tons of water is used up per flight  he   s a liar .  it   s less than a hundred thousand tons .     suppose  now  we have fifty thousand flights a year .  we don   t  of course  not even fifteen hundred .  but let   s say there are fifty thousand .  i figure there   s going to be considerable expansion as time goes on .  with fifty thousand flights  one cubic mile of water would be lost to space each year .  that means that in a million years  earth would lose one quarter of one percent of its total water supply .     digby spread his hands  palms upward  and let them drop .     commissioner  interplanetary alloys has used figures like that in their campaign against hilder  but you can   t fight a tremendous  emotion filled drive with cold mathematics .  this man hilder has invented a name     wasters .     slowly he has built this name up into a gigantic conspiracy  a gang of brutal  profit seeking wretches raping earth for their own immediate benefit .     he has accused the government of being riddled with them  the assembly of being dominated by them  the press of being owned by them .  none of this  unfortunately  seems ridiculous to the average man .  he knows all too well what selfish men can do to earth   s resources .  he knows what happened to earth   s oil during the time of troubles  for instance  and the way topsoil was ruined .     when a farmer experiences a drought  he doesn   t care that the amount of water lost in space flight isn   t a droplet in a fog as far as earth   s overall water supply is concerned .  hilder has given him something to blame and that   s the strongest possible consolation for disaster .  he isn   t going to give that up for a diet of figures .     sankov said     that   s where i get puzzled .  maybe it   s because i don   t know how things work on earth  but it seems to me that there aren   t just droughty farmers there .  as near as i could make out from the news summaries  these hilder people are a minority .  why is it earth goes along with a few farmers and some crackpots that  egg them on .        because  commissioner  there are such things as worried human beings .  the steel industry sees that an era of space flight will stress increasingly the light  nonferrous alloys .  the various miners    unions worry about extraterrestrial competition .  any earthman who can   t get aluminum to build a prefab is certain that it is because the aluminum is going to mars .  i know a professor of archaeology who   s an anti waster because he can   t get a government grant to cover his excavations .  he   s convinced that all government money is going into rocketry research and space medicine and he resents it .     sankov said     that doesn   t sound like earth people are much different from us here on mars .  but what about the general assembly .  why do they have to go along with hilder .     digby smiled sourly .     politics isn   t pleasant to explain .  hilder introduced this bill to set up a committee to investigate waste in space flight .  maybe three fourths or more of the general assembly was against such an investigation as an intolerable and useless extension of bureaucracy  which it is .  but then how could any legislator be against a mere investigation of waste .  it would sound as though he had something to fear or to conceal .  it would sound as though he were himself profiting from waste .  hilder is not in the least afraid of making such accusations  and whether true or not  they would be a powerful factor with the voters in the next election .  the bill passed .     and then there came the question of appointing the members of the committee .  those who were against hilder shied away from membership  which would have meant decisions that would be continually embarrassing .  remaining on the side lines would make that one that much less a target for hilder .  the result is that i am the only member of the committee who is outspokenly anti hilder and it may cost me reelection .     sankov said     i   d be sorry to hear that  assemblyman .  it looks as though mars didn   t have as many friends as we thought we had .  we wouldn   t like to lose one .  but if hilder wins out  what   s he after  anyway .        i should think     said digby     that that is obvious .  he wants to be the next global coordinator .        think he   ll make it .        if nothing happens to stop him  he will .        and then what .  will he drop this waster campaign then .        i can   t say .  i don   t know if he   s laid his plans past the co ordinacy .  still  if you want my guess  he couldn   t abandon the campaign and maintain his popularity .  it   s gotten out of hand .     sankov scratched the side of his neck .     all right .  in that case  i   ll ask you for some advice .  what can we folks on mars do .  you know earth .  you know the situation .  we don   t .  tell us what to do .     digby rose and stepped to the window .  he looked out upon the low domes of other buildings  red  rocky  completely desolate plain in between  a purple sky and a shrunken sun .  he said  without turning     do you people really like it on mars .     sankov smiled .     most of us don   t exactly know any other world  assemblyman .  seems to me earth would be something queer and uncomfortable to them .        but wouldn   t martians get used to it .  earth isn   t hard to take after this .  wouldn   t your people learn to enjoy the privilege of breathing air under an open sky .  you once lived on earth .  you remember what it was like .        i sort of remember .  still  it doesn   t seem to be easy to explain .  earth is just there .  it fits people and people fit it .  people take earth the way they find it .  mars is different .  it   s sort of raw and doesn   t fit people .  people got to make something out of it .  they got to build a world  and not take what they find .  mars isn   t much yet  but we   re building  and when we   re finished  we   re going to have just what we like .  it   s sort of a great feeling to know you   re building a world .  earth would be kind of unexciting after that .     the assemblyman said     surely the ordinary martian isn   t such a philosopher that he   s content to live this terribly hard life for the .  sake of a future that must be hundreds of generations away .        no o  not just like that .     sankov put his right ankle on his left knee and cradled it as he spoke .     like i said  martians are a lot like earthmen  which means they   re sort of human beings  and human beings don   t go in for philosophy much .  just the same  there   s something to living in a growing world  whether you think about it much or not .     my father used to send me letters when i first came to mars .  he was an accountant and he just sort of stayed an accountant .  earth wasn   t much different when he died from what it was when he was born .  he didn   t see anything happen .  every day was like every other day  and living was just a way of passing time until he died     on mars  it   s different .  every day there   s something new  the city   s bigger  the ventilation system gets another kick  the water lines from the poles get slicked up .  right now  we   re planning to set up a news film association of our own .  we   re going to call it mars press .  if you haven   t lived when things are growing all about you  you   ll never understand how wonderful it feels .     no  assemblyman  mars is hard and tough and earth is a lot more comfortable  but seems to me if you take our boys to earth  they   ll be unhappy .  they probably wouldn   t be able to figure out why  most of them  but they   d feel lost  lost and useless .  seems to me lots of them would never make the adjustment .     digby turned away from the window and the smooth  pink skin of his forehead was creased into a frown .     in that case  commissioner  i am sorry for you .  for all of you .        why .        because i don   t think there   s anything your people on mars can do .  or the people on the moon or venus .  it won   t happen now  maybe it won   t happen for a year or two  or even for five years .  but pretty soon you   ll all have to come back to earth  unless      sankov   s white eyebrows bent low over his eyes .     well .        unless you can find another source of water besides the planet earth .     sankov shook his head .     don   t seem likely  does it .        not very .        and except for that  seems to you there   s no chance .        none at all .     digby said that and left  and sankov stared for a long time at nothing before he punched a combination of the local communiline .  after a while  ted long looked out at him .  sankov said     you were right  son .  there   s nothing they can do .  even the ones that mean well see no way out .  how did you know .        commissioner     said long     when you   ve read all you can about the time of troubles  particularly about the twentieth century  nothing political can come as a real surprise .        well  maybe .  anyway  son  assemblyman digby is sorry for us  quite a piece sorry  you might say  but that   s all .  he says we   ll have to leave mars  or else get water somewhere else .  only he thinks that we can   t get water somewhere else .        you know we can  don   t you  commissioner .        i know we might  son .  it   s a terrible risk .        if i find enough volunteers  the risk is our business .         how is it going .        not bad .  some of the boys are on my side right now .  i talked mario rioz into it  for instance  and you know he   s one of the best .        that   s just it  the volunteers will be the best men we have .  i hate to allow it .        if we get back  it will be worth it .        if .  it   s a big word  son .        and a big thing we   re trying to do .        well  i gave my word that if there was no help on earth  i   ll see that the phobos water hole lets you have all the water you   ll need .  good luck .         half a million miles above saturn  mario rioz was cradled on nothing and sleep was delicious .  he came out of it slowly and for a while  alone in his suit  he counted the stars and traced lines from one to another .  at first  as the weeks flew past  it was scavenging all over again  except for the gnawing feeling that every minute meant an additional number of thousands of miles away from all humanity .  that made it worse .  they had aimed high to pass out of the ecliptic while moving through the asteroid belt .  that had used up water and had probably been unnecessary .  although tens of thousands of worldlets look as thick as vermin in two dimensional projection upon a photographic plate  they are nevertheless scattered so thinly through the quadrillions of cubic miles that make up their conglomerate orbit that only the most ridiculous of coincidences would have brought about a collision .  still  they passed over the belt and someone calculated the chances of collision with a fragment of matter large enough to do damage .  the value was so low  so impossibly low  that it was perhaps inevitable that the notion of the    space float    should occur to someone .  the days were long and many  space was empty  only one man was needed at the controls at anyone time .  the thought was a natural .  first  it was a particularly daring one who ventured out for fifteen minutes or so .  then another who tried half an hour .  eventually  before the asteroids were entirely behind  each ship regularly had its off watch member suspended in space at the end of a cable .  it was easy enough .  the cable  one of those intended for operations at the conclusion of their journey  was magnetically attached at both ends  one to the space suit to start with .  then you clambered out the lock onto the ship   s hull and attached the other end there .  you paused awhile  clinging to the metal skin by the electromagnets in your boots .  then you neutralized those and made the slightest muscular effort .  slowly  ever so slowly  you lifted from the ship and even more slowly the ship   s larger mass moved an equivalently shorter distance downward .  you floated incredibly  weightlessly  in solid  speckled black .  when the ship had moved far enough away from you  your gauntleted hand  which kept touch upon the cable  tightened its grip slightly .  too tightly  and you would begin moving back toward the ship and it toward you .  just tightly enough  and friction would halt you .  because your motion was equivalent to that of the ship  it seemed as motionless below you as though it had been painted against an impossible background while the cable between you hung in coils that had no reason to straighten out .  it was a half ship to your eye .  one half was lit by the light of the feeble sun  which was still too bright to look at directly without the heavy protection of the polarized space suit visor .  the other half was black on black  invisible .  space closed in and it was like sleep .  your suit was warm  it renewed its air automatically  it had food and drink in special containers from which it could be sucked with a minimal motion of the head  it took care of wastes appropriately .  most of all  more than anything else  there was the delightful euphoria of weightlessness .  you never felt so well in your life .  the days stopped being too long  they weren   t long enough  and there weren   t enough of them .  they had passed jupiter   s orbit at a spot some thirty degrees from its then position .  for months  it was the brightest object in the sky  always excepting the glowing white pea that was the sun .  at its brightest  some of the scavengers insisted they could make out jupiter as a tiny sphere  one side squashed out of true by the night shadow .  then over a period of additional months it faded  while another dot of light grew until it was brighter than jupiter .  it was saturn  first as a dot of brilliance  then as an oval  glowing splotch .      why oval .     someone asked  and after a while  someone else said     the rings  of course     and it was obvious .   everyone space floated at all possible times toward the end  watching saturn incessantly .      hey  you jerk  come on back in  damn it .  you   re on duty .        who   s on duty .  i   ve got fifteen minutes more by my watch .        you set your watch back .  besides  i gave you twenty minutes yesterday .        you wouldn   t give two minutes to your grandmother .        come on in  damn it  or i   m coming out anyway .        all right  i   m coming .  holy howlers  what a racket over a lousy minute .     but no quarrel could possibly be serious  not in space .  it felt too good .    saturn grew until at last it rivaled and then surpassed the sun .  the rings  set at a broad angle to their trajectory of approach  swept grandly about the planet  only a small portion being eclipsed .  then  as they approached  the span of the rings grew still wider  yet narrower as the angle of approach constantly decreased .  the larger moons showed up in the surrounding sky like serene fireflies .  mario rioz was glad he was awake so that he could watch again .  saturn filled half the sky  streaked with orange  the night shadow cutting it fuzzily nearly one quarter of the way in from the right .  two round little dots in the brightness were shadows of two of the moons .  to the left and behind him  he could look over his left shoulder to see  and as he did so  the rest of his body inched slightly to the right to conserve angular momentum  was the white diamond of the sun .  most of all he liked to watch the rings .  at the left  they emerged from behind saturn  a tight  bright triple band of orange light .  at the right  their beginnings were hidden in the night shadow  but showed up closer and broader .  they widened as they came  like the flare of a horn  growing hazier as they approached  until  while the eye followed them  they seemed to fill the sky and lose themselves .  from the position of the scavenger fleet just inside the outer rim of the outermost ring  the rings broke up and assumed their true identity as a phenomenal cluster of solid fragments rather than the tight  solid band of light they seemed .  below him  or rather in the direction his feet pointed  some twenty miles away  was one of the ring fragments .  it looked like a large  irregular splotch  marring the symmetry of space  three quarters in brightness and the night shadow cutting it like a knife .  other fragments were farther off  sparkling like star dust  dimmer and thicker  until  as you followed them down  they became rings once more .  the fragments were motionless  but that was only because the ships had taken up an orbit about saturn equivalent to that of the outer edge of the rings .  the day before  rioz reflected  he had been on that nearest fragment  working along with more than a score of others to mold it into the desired shape .  tomorrow he would be at it again .  today  today he was space floating .     mario .     the voice that broke upon his earphones was questioning .  momentarily rioz was flooded with annoyance .  damn it  he wasn   t in the mood for company .     speaking     he said .     i thought i had your ship spotted .  how are you .        fine .  that you  ted .        that   s right     said long .     anything wrong on the fragment .        nothing .  i   m out here floating .         you .        it gets me  too  occasionally .  beautiful  isn   t it .        nice     agreed rioz .     you know  i   ve read earth books         grounder books  you mean .     rioz yawned and found it difficult under the circumstances to use the expression with the proper amount of resentment .       and sometimes i read descriptions of people lying on grass     continued long .     you know  that green stuff like thin  long pieces of paper they have all over the ground down there  and they look up at the blue sky with clouds in it .  did you ever see any films of that .        sure .  it didn   t attract me .  it looked cold .        i suppose it isn   t  though .  after all  earth is quite close to the sun  and they say their atmosphere is thick enough to hold the heat .  i must admit that personally i would hate to be caught under open sky with nothing on but clothes .  still  i imagine they like it .        grounders are nuts .        they talk about the trees  big brown stalks  and the winds  air movements  you know .        you mean drafts .  they can keep that  too .        it doesn   t matter .  the point is they describe it beautifully  almost passionately .  many times i   ve wondered     what   s it really like .  will i ever feel it or is this something only earthmen can possibly feel .     i   ve felt so often that i was missing something vital .  now i know what it must be like .  it   s this .  complete peace in the middle of a beauty drenched universe .     rioz said     they wouldn   t like it .  the grounders  i mean .  they   re so used to their own lousy little world they wouldn   t appreciate what it   s like to float and look down on saturn .      he flipped his body slightly and began swaying back and forth about his center of mass  slowly  soothingly .  long said     yes  i think so too .  they   re slaves to their planet .  even if they come to mars  it will only be their children that are free .  there   ll be starships someday  great  huge things that can carry thousands of people and maintain their self contained equilibrium for decades  maybe centuries .  mankind will spread through the whole galaxy .  but people will have to live their lives out on shipboard until new methods of interstellar travel are developed  so it will be martians  not planetbound earthmen  who will colonize the universe .  that   s inevitable .  it   s got to be .  it   s the martian way .     but rioz made no answer .  he had dropped off to sleep again  rocking and swaying gently  half a million miles above saturn .      the work shift of the ring fragment was the tail of the coin .  the weightlessness  peace  and privacy of the space float gave place to something that had neither peace nor privacy  even the weightlessness  which continued  became more a purgatory than a paradise under the new conditions .  .  try to manipulate an ordinary nonportable heat projector .  it could be lifted despite the fact that it was six feet high and wide and almost solid metal  since it weighed only a fraction of an ounce .  but its inertia was exactly what it had always been  which meant that if it wasn   t moved into position very slowly  it would just keep going  taking you with it .  then you would have to hike the pseudo grav field of your suit and come down with a jar .  keralski had hiked the field a little too high and he came down a little too roughly  with the projector coming down with him at a dangerous angle .  his crushed ankle had been the first casualty of the expedition .  rioz was swearing fluently and nearly continuously .  he continued to have the impulse to drag the back of his hand across his forehead in order to wipe away the accumulating sweat .  the few times that he had succumbed to the impulse  metal had met silicone with a clash that rang loudly inside his suit  but served no useful purpose .  the desiccators within the suit were sucking at maximum and  of course  recovering the water and restoring ion exchanged liquid  containing a careful proportion of salt  into the appropriate receptacle .  rioz yelled     damn it  dick  wait till i give the word  will you .     and swenson   s voice rang in his ears     well  how long am i supposed to sit here .        till i say     replied rioz .  he strengthened pseudo grav and lifted the projector a bit .  he released pseudo grav  insuring that the projector would stay in place for minutes even if he withdrew support altogether .  he kicked the cable out of the way  it stretched beyond the close    horizon    to a power source that was out of sight  and touched the release .  the material of which the fragment was composed bubbled and vanished under its touch .  a section of the lip of the tremendous cavity he had already carved into its substance melted away and a roughness in its contour had disappeared .     try it now     called rioz .  swenson was in the ship that was hovering nearly over rioz   s head .  swenson called      all clear .        i told you to go ahead .     it was a feeble flicker of steam that issued from one of the ship   s forward vents .  the ship drifted down toward the ring fragment .  another flicker adjusted a tendency to drift sidewise .  it came down straight .  a third flicker to the rear slowed it to a feather rate .  rioz watched tensely .     keep    her coming .  you   ll make it .  you   ll make it .     the rear of the ship entered the hole  nearly filling it .  the bellying walls came closer and closer to its rim .  there was a grinding vibration as the ship   s motion halted .  it was swenson   s turn to curse .     it doesn   t fit     he said .  rioz threw the projector groundward in a passion and went flailing up into space .  the projector kicked up a white crystalline dust all about it  and when rioz came down under pseudo grav  he did the same .  he said     you went in on the bias  you dumb grounder .        i hit it level  you dirt eating farmer .     backward pointing side jets of the ship were blasting more strongly than before  and rioz hopped to get out of the way .  the ship scraped up from the pit  then shot into space half a mile before forward jets could bring it to a halt .  swenson said tensely     we   ll spring half a dozen plates if we do this once again .  get it right  will you .        i   ll get it right .  don   t worry about it .  just you come in right .     rioz jumped upward and allowed himself to climb three hundred yards to get an overall look at the cavity .  the gouge marks of the ship were plain enough .  they were concentrated at one point halfway down the pit .  he would get that .  it began to melt outward under the blaze of the projector .  half an hour later the ship snuggled neatly into its cavity  and swenson  wearing his space suit  emerged to join rioz .  swenson said     if you want to step in and climb out of the suit  i   ll take care of the icing .        it   s all right     said rioz .     i   d just as soon sit here and watch saturn .     he sat down at the lip of the pit .  there was a six foot gap between it and the ship .  in some places about the circle  it was two feet  in a few places  even merely a matter of inches .  you couldn   t expect a better fit out of handwork .  the final adjustment would be made by steaming ice gently and letting it freeze into the cavity between the lip and the ship .  saturn moved visibly across the sky  its vast bulk inching below the horizon .     rioz said     how many ships are left to put in place .     swenson said     last i heard  it was eleven .  we   re in now  so that means only ten .  seven of the ones that are placed are iced in .  two or three are dismantled .        we   re coming along fine .        there   s plenty to do yet .  don   t forget the main jets at the other end .  and the cables and the power lines .  sometimes i wonder if we   ll make it .  on the way out  it didn   t bother me so much  but just now i was sitting at the controls and i was saying     we won   t make it .  we   ll sit out here and starve and die with nothing but saturn over us .     it makes me feel      he didn   t explain how it made him feel .  he just sat there .  rioz said     you think too damn much .        it   s different with you     said swenson .     i keep thinking of pete  and dora .        what for .  she said you could go  didn   t she .  the commissioner gave her that talk on patriotism and how you   d be a hero and set for life once you got back  and she said you could go .  you didn   t sneak out the way adams did .        adams is different .  that wife of his should have been shot when she was born .  some women can make hell for a guy  can   t they .  she didn   t want him to go  but she   d probably rather he didn   t come back if she can get his settlement pay .        what   s your kick  then .  dora wants you back  doesn   t she .     swenson sighed .     i never treated her right .        you turned over your pay  it seems to me .  i wouldn   t do that for any woman .  money for value received  not a cent more .        money isn   t it .  i get to thinking out here .  a woman likes company .  a kid needs his father .  what am i doing way out here .        getting set to go home .        ah h  you don   t understand .         ted long wandered over the ridged surface of the ring fragment with his spirits as icy as the ground he walked on .  it had all seemed perfectly logical back on mars  but that was mars .  he had worked it out carefully in his mind in perfectly reasonable steps .  he could still remember exactly how it went .  .  it didn   t take a ton of water to move a ton of ship .  it was not mass equals mass  but mass time .  .  velocity equals mass times velocity .  it didn   t matter  in other words  whether you shot out a ton of water at a mile a second or a hundred pounds of water .  at twenty miles a second .  you got the same final velocity out of the ship .  that meant the jet nozzles had to be made narrower and the steam hotter .  but then drawbacks appeared .  the narrower the nozzle  the more energy was lost in friction and turbulence .  the hotter the steam  the more refractory the nozzle had to be and the shorter its life .  the limit in that direction was quickly reached .  then  since a given weight of water could move considerably more than its own weight under the narrow nozzle conditions  it paid to be big .  the bigger the water  storage space  the larger the size of the actual travel head  even in proportion .  so they started to make liners heavier and bigger .  but then the larger the shell  the heavier the bracings  the more difficult the weldings  the more exacting the engineering requirements .  at the moment  the limit in that direction had been reached also .  and then he had put his finger on what had seemed to him to be the basic flaw  the original unswervable conception that the fuel had to be placed inside the ship  the metal had to be built to encircle a million tons of water .  why .  water did not have to be water .  it could be ice  and ice could be shaped .  holes could be melted into it .  travelheads and jets could be fitted into it .  cables could hold travelheads and jets stiffly together under the influence of magnetic field force grips .  long felt the trembling of the ground he walked on .  he was at the head of the fragment .  a dozen ships were blasting in and out of sheaths carved in its substance  and the fragment shuddered under the continuing impact .   the ice didn   t have to be quarried .  it existed in proper chunks in the rings of saturn .  that   s all the rings were  pieces of nearly pure ice  circling saturn .  so spectroscopy stated and so it had turned out to be .  he was standing on one such piece now  over two miles long  nearly one mile thick .  it was almost half a billion tons of water  all in one piece  and he was standing on it .  but now he was face to face with the realities of life .  he had never told the men just how quickly he had expected to set up the fragment as a ship  but in his heart  he had imagined it would be two days .  it was a week now and he didn   t dare to estimate the remaining time .  he no longer even had any confidence that the task was a possible one .  would they be able to control jets with enough delicacy through leads slung across two miles of ice to manipulate out of saturn   s dragging gravity .  drinking water was low  though they could always distill more out of the ice .  still  the food stores were not in a good way either .  he paused  looked up into the sky  eyes straining .  was the object growing larger .  he ought to measure its distance .  actually  he lacked the spirit to add that trouble to the others .  his mind slid back to greater immediacies .  morale  at least  was high .  the men seemed to enjoy being out saturn way .  they were the first humans to penetrate this far  the first to pass the asteroids  the first to see jupiter like a glowing pebble to the naked eye  the first to see saturn like that .  he didn   t think fifty practical  case hardened  shell snatching scavengers would take time to feel that sort of emotion .  but they did .  and they were proud .  two men and a half buried ship slid up the moving horizon as he walked .  he called crisply     hello  there .     rioz answered     that you  ted .        you bet .  is that dick with you .        sure .  come on  sit down .  we were just getting ready to ice in and we were looking for an excuse to delay .        i   m not     said swenson promptly .     when will we be leaving  ted .        as soon as we get through .  that   s no answer  is it .     swenson said dispiritedly     i suppose there isn   t any other answer .     long looked up  staring at the irregular bright splotch in the sky .  rioz followed his glance .     what   s the matter .     for a moment  long did not reply .  the sky was black otherwise and the ring fragments were an orange dust against it .  saturn was more than three fourths below the horizon and the rings were going with it .  half a mile away a ship bounded past the icy rim of the planetoid into the sky  was orange  lit by saturn  light  and sank down again .  the ground trembled gently .  rioz said     something bothering you about the shadow .     they called it that .  it was the nearest fragment of the rings  quite close considering that they were at the outer rim of the rings  where the pieces spread themselves relatively thin .  it was perhaps twenty miles off  a jagged mountain  its shape clearly visible .     how does it look to you .     asked long .  rioz shrugged .     okay  i guess .  i don   t see anything wrong .        doesn   t it seem to be getting larger .        why should it .        well  doesn   t it .     long insisted .  rioz and swenson stared at it thoughtfully .     it does look bigger     said swenson .     you   re just putting the notion into our minds     rioz argued .     if it were getting bigger  it would be coming closer .        what   s impossible about that .        these things are stable orbits .        they were when we came here     said long .     there  did you feel that .     the ground had trembled again .  long said     we   ve been blasting this thing for a week now .  first  twenty five ships landed on it  which changed its momentum right there .  not much  of course .  then we   ve been melting parts of it away and our ships have been blasting in and out of it  all at one end  too .  in a week  we may have changed its orbit just a bit .  the two fragments  this one and the shadow  might be converging .        it   s got plenty of room to miss us in .     rioz watched it thoughtfully .     besides  if we can   t even tell for sure that it   s getting bigger  how quickly can it be moving .  relative to us  i mean .        it doesn   t have to be moving quickly .  its momentum is as large as ours  so that  however gently it hits  we   ll be nudged completely out of our orbit  maybe in toward saturn  where we don   t want to go .  as a matter of fact  ice has a very low tensile strength  so that both planetoids might break up into gravel .     swenson rose to his feet .     damn it  if i can tell you a shell is moving a thousand miles away  i can tell what a mountain is doing twenty miles away .     he turned toward the ship .  long didn   t stop him .  rioz said     there   s a nervous guy .     the neighboring planetoid rose to zenith  passed overhead  began sinking .  twenty minutes later  the horizon opposite that portion behind which saturn had disappeared burst into orange flame as its bulk began lifting again .  rioz called into his radio     hey  dick  are you dead in there .        i   m checking     came the muffled response .     is it moving .     asked long .     yes .        toward us .     there was a pause .  swenson   s voice was a sick one .     on the nose  ted .  intersection of orbits will take place in three days .        you   re crazy .     yelled rioz .     i checked four times     said swenson .  long thought blankly  what do we do now .      some of the men were having trouble with the cables .  they had to be laid precisely  their geometry had to be very nearly perfect for the magnetic field to attain maximum strength .  in space  or even in air  it wouldn   t have mattered .  the cables would have lined up automatically once the juice went on .  here it was different .  a gouge had to be plowed along the planetoid   s surface and into it the cable had to be laid .  if it were not lined up within a few minutes of arc of the calculated direction  a torque would be applied to the entire planetoid  with consequent loss of energy  none of which could be spared .  the gouges then had to be redriven  the cables shifted and iced into the new positions .  the men plodded wearily through the routine .  and then the word reached them     all hands to the jets .     scavengers could not be said to be the type that took kindly to discipline .  it was a grumbling  growling  muttering group that set about disassembling the jets of the ships that yet remained intact  carrying them to the tail end of the planetoid  grubbing them into position  and stringing the leads along the surface .  it was almost twenty four hours before one of them looked into the sky and said     holy jeepers .     followed by something less printable .  his neighbor looked and said     i   ll be damned .     once they noticed  all did .  it became the most astonishing fact in the universe .     look at the shadow .     it was spreading across the sky like an infected wound .  men looked at it  found it had doubled its size  wondered why they hadn   t noticed that sooner .  work came to a virtual halt .  they besieged ted long .  he said     we can   t leave .  we don   t have the fuel to see us back to mars and we don   t have the equipment to capture another planetoid .  so we   ve got to stay .  now the shadow is creeping in on us because our blasting has thrown us out of orbit .  we   ve got to change that by continuing the blasting .  since we can   t blast the front end any more without endangering the ship we   re building  let   s try another way .     they went back to work on the jets with a furious energy that received impetus every half hour when the shadow rose again over the horizon  bigger and more menacing than before .  long had no assurance that it would work .  even if the jets would respond to the distant controls  even if the supply of water  which depended upon a storage chamber opening directly into the icy body of the planetoid  with built in heat projectors steaming the propulsive fluid directly into the driving cells  were adequate  there was still no certainty that the body of the planetoid without a magnetic cable sheathing would hold together under the enormously disruptive stresses .     ready .     came the signal in long   s receiver .  long called     ready .     and depressed the contact .  the vibration grew about him .  the star field in the visiplate trembled .  in the rearview  there was a distant gleaming spume of swiftly moving ice crystals .     it   s blowing .     was the cry .  it kept on blowing .  long dared not stop .  for six hours  it blew  hissing  bubbling  steaming into space  the body of the planetoid converted to vapor and hurled away .  the shadow came closer until men did nothing but stare at the mountain in the sky  surpassing saturn itself in spectacularity .  its every groove and valley was a plain scar upon its face .  but when it passed through the planetoid   s orbit  it crossed more than half a mile behind its then position .  the steam jet ceased .  long bent in his seat and covered his eyes .  he hadn   t eaten in two days .  he could eat now  though .  not another planetoid was close enough to interrupt them  even if it began an approach that very moment .  back on the planetoid   s surface  swenson said      all the time i watched that damned rock coming down  i kept saying to myself     this can   t happen .  we can   t let it happen .           hell     said rioz     we were all nervous .  did you see jim davis .  he was green .  i was a little jumpy myself .        that   s not it .  it wasn   t just  dying  you know .  i was thinking  i know it   s funny  but i can   t help it  i was thinking that dora warned me i   d get myself killed  she   ll never let me hear the last of it .  isn   t that a crummy sort of attitude at a time like that .        listen     said rioz     you wanted to get married  so you got married .  why come to me with your troubles .          the flotilla  welded into a single unit  was returning over its mighty course from saturn to mars .  each day it flashed over a length of space it had taken nine days outward .  ted long had put the entire crew on emergency .  with twenty five ships embedded in the planetoid taken out of saturn   s rings and unable to move or maneuver independently  the coordination of their power sources into unified blasts was a ticklish problem .  the jarring that took place on the first day of travel nearly shook them out from under their hair .  that  at least  smoothed itself out as the velocity raced upward under the steady thrust from behind .  they passed the one hundred thousand mile an hour mark late on the second day  and climbed steadily toward the million mile mark and beyond .  long   s ship  which formed the needle point of the frozen fleet  was the only one which possessed a five way view of space .  it was an uncomfortable position under the circumstances .  long found himself watching tensely  imagining somehow that the stars would slowly begin to slip backward  to whizz past them  under the influence of the multi ship   s tremendous rate of travel .  they didn   t  of course .  they remained nailed to the black backdrop  their distance scorning with patient immobility any speed mere man could achieve .  the men complained bitterly after the first few days .  it was not only that they were deprived of the space float .  they were burdened by much more than the ordinary pseudo gravity field of the ships  by the effects of the fierce acceleration under which they were living .  long himself was weary to death of the relentless pressure against hydraulic cushions .  they took to shutting off the jet thrusts one hour out of every four and long fretted .  it had been just over a year that he had last seen mars shrinking in an observation window from this ship  which had then been an independent entity .  what had happened since then .  was the colony still there .  in something like a growing panic  long sent out radio pulses toward mars daily  with the combined power of twenty five ships behind it .  there was no answer .  he expected none .  mars and saturn were on opposite sides of the sun now  and until he mounted high enough above the ecliptic to get the sun well beyond the line connecting himself and mars  solar interference would prevent any signal from getting through .  high above the outer rim of the asteroid belt  they reached maximum velocity .  with short spurts of power from first one side jet  then another  the huge vessel reversed itself .  the composite jet in the rear began its mighty roaring once again  but now the result was deceleration .  they passed a hundred million miles over the sun  curving down to intersect the orbit of mars .   a week out of mars  answering signals were heard for the first time  fragmentary  ether torn  and incomprehensible  but they were coming from mars .  earth and venus were at angles sufficiently different to leave no doubt of that .  long relaxed .  there were still humans on mars  at any rate .  two days out of mars  the signal was strong and clear and sankov was at the other end .  sankov said     hello  son .  it   s three in the morning here .  seems like people have no consideration for an old man .  dragged me right out of bed .        i   m sorry  sir .        don   t be .  they were following orders .  i   m afraid to ask  son .  anyone hurt .  maybe dead .        no deaths  sir .  not one .        and  and the water .  any left .     long said with an effort at nonchalance     enough .        in that case  get home as fast as you can .  don   t take any chances  of course .        there   s trouble  then .        fair to middling .  when will you come down .        two days .  can you hold out that long .        i   ll hold out .     forty hours later mars had grown to a ruddy orange ball that filled the ports and they were in the final planet landing spiral .     slowly     long said to himself     slowly .     under these conditions  even the thin atmosphere of mars could do dreadful damage if they moved through it too quickly .  since they came in from well above the ecliptic  their spiral passed from north to south .  a polar cap shot whitely below them  then the much smaller one of the summer hemisphere  the large one again  the small one  at longer and longer intervals .  the planet approached closer  the landscape began to show features .     prepare for landing .     called long .       sankov did his best to look placid  which was difficult considering how closely the boys had shaved their return .  but it had worked out well enough .  until a few days before  he had no sure knowledge that they had survived .  it seemed more likely  inevitable  almost  that they were nothing but frozen corpses somewhere in the trackless stretches from mars to saturn  new planetoids that had once been alive .  the committee had been dickering with him for weeks before the news had come .  they had insisted on his signature to the paper for the sake of appearances .  it would look like an agreement  voluntarily and mutually arrived at .  but sankov knew well that  given complete obstinacy on his part  they would act unilaterally and be damned with appearances .  it seemed fairly certain that hilder   s election was secure now and they would take the chance of arousing a reaction of sympathy for mars .  so he dragged out the negotiations  dangling before them always the possibility of surrender .  and then he heard from long and concluded the deal quickly .  the papers had lain before him and he had made a last statement for the benefit of the reporters who were present .  he said     total imports of water from earth are twenty million tons a year .  this is declining as we develop our own piping system .  if i sign this paper agreeing to an embargo  our industry will be paralyzed  any possibilities of expansion will halt .  it looks to me as if that can   t be what   s in earth   s mind  can it .     their eyes met his and held only a hard glitter .  assemblyman digby had already been replaced and they were unanimous against him .  the committee chairman impatiently pointed out     you have said all this before .        i know  but right now i   m kind of getting ready to sign and i want it clear in my head .  is earth set and determined to bring us to an end here .        of course not .  earth is interested in conserving its irreplaceable water supply  nothing else .        you have one and a half quintillion tons of water on earth .     the committee chairman said     we cannot spare water .     and sankov had signed .  that had been the final note he wanted .  earth had one and a half quintillion tons of water and could spare none of it .  now  a day and a half later  the committee and the reporters waited in the spaceport dome .  through thick  curving windows  they could see the bare and empty grounds of mars spaceport .  the committee chairman asked with annoyance     how much longer do we have to wait .  and  if you don   t mind  what are we waiting for .     sankov said     some of our boys have been out in space  out past the asteroids .     the committee chairman removed a pair of spectacles and cleaned them with a snowy white handkerchief .      and they   re returning .        they are .     the chairman shrugged  lifted his eyebrows in the direction of the reporters .  in the smaller room adjoining  a knot of women and children clustered about another window .  sankov stepped back a bit to cast a glance toward them .  he would much rather have been with them  been part of their excitement and tension .  he  like them  had waited over a year now .  he  like them  had thought  over and over again  that the men must be dead .     you see that .     said sankov  pointing .     hey .     cried a reporter .     it   s a ship .     a confused shouting came from the adjoining room .  it wasn   t a ship so much as a bright dot obscured by a drifting white cloud .  the cloud grew larger and began to have form .  it was a double streak against the sky  the lower ends billowing out and upward again .  as it dropped still closer  the bright dot at the upper end took on a crudely cylindrical form .  it was rough and craggy  but where the sunlight hit  brilliant highlights bounced back .  the cylinder dropped toward the ground with the ponderous slowness characteristic of space vessels .  it hung suspended on those blasting jets and settled down upon the recoil of tons of matter hurling downward like a tired man dropping into his easy chair .  and as it did so  a silence fell upon all within the dome .  the women and children in one room  the politicians and reporters in the other remained frozen  heads craned incredulously upward .  the cylinder   s landing flanges  extending far below the two rear jets  touched ground and sank into the pebbly morass .  and then the ship was motionless and the jet action ceased .  but the silence continued in the dome .  it continued for a long time .  men came clambering down the sides of the immense vessel  inching down  down the two mile trek to the ground  with spikes on their shoes and ice axes in their hands .  they were gnats against the blinding surface .  one of the reporters croaked     what is it .        that     said sankov calmly     happens to be a chunk of matter that spent its time scooting around saturn as part of its rings .  our boys fitted it out with travel head and jets and ferried it home .  it just turns out the fragments in saturn   s rings are made up out of ice .     he spoke into a continuing deathlike silence .     that thing that looks like a spaceship is just a mountain of hard water .  if it were standing like that on earth  it would be melting into a puddle and maybe it would break under its own weight .  mars is colder and has less gravity  so there   s no such danger .     of course  once we get this thing really organized  we can have water stations on the moons of saturn and jupiter and on the asteroids .  we can scale in chunks of saturn   s rings and pick them up and send them on at the various stations .  our scavengers are good at that sort of thing .     we   ll have all the water we need .  that one chunk you see is just under a cubic mile  or about what earth would send us in two hundred years .  the boys used quite a bit of it coming back from saturn .  they made it in five weeks  they tell me  and used up about a hundred million tons .  but  lord  that didn   t make any dent at all in that mountain .  are you getting all this  boys .     he turned to the reporters .  there was no doubt they were getting it .  he said     then get this  too .  earth is worried about its water supply .  it only has one and a half quintillion tons .  it can   t spare us a single ton out of it .  write down that we folks on mars are worried about earth and don   t want anything to happen to earth people .  write down that we   ll sell water to earth .  write down that we   ll let them have million ton lots for a reasonable fee .  write down that in ten years  we figure we can sell it in cubic mile lots .  write down that earth can quit worrying because mars can sell it all the water it needs and wants .     the committee chairman was past hearing .  he was feeling the future rushing in .  dimly he could see the reporters grinning as they wrote furiously .  grinning .  he could hear the grin become laughter on earth as mars turned the tables so neatly on the anti wasters .  he could hear the laughter thunder from every continent when word of the fiasco spread .  and he could see the abyss  deep and black as space  into which would drop forever the political hopes of john hilder and of every opponent of space flight left on earth  his own included  of course .  in the adjoining room  dora swenson screamed with joy  and peter  grown two inches  jumped up and down  calling     daddy .  daddy .     richard swenson had just stepped off the extremity of the flange and  face showing clearly through the clear silicone of the headpiece  marched toward the dome .     did you ever see a guy look so happy .     asked ted long .     maybe there   s something in this marriage business .        ah  you   ve just been out in space too long     rioz said .   the deep  in the end  any particular planet must die .  it may be a quick death as its sun explodes .  it may be a slow death  as its sun sinks into decay and its oceans lock in ice .  in the latter case  at least  intelligent life has a chance of survival .  the direction of survival may be outward into space  to a planet closer to the cooling sun or to a planet of another sun altogether .  this particular avenue is closed if the planet is unfortunate enough to be the only significant body rotating about its primary and if  at the time  no other star is within half a thousand light years .  the direction of survival may be inward  into the crust of the planet .  this is always available .  a new home can be built underground and the heat of the planet   s core can be tapped for energy .  thousands of years may be necessary for the task  but a dying sun cools slowly .  but planetary warmth dies  too  with time .  burrows must be dug deeper and deeper until the planet is dead through and through .  the time was coming .  on the surface of the planet  wisps of neon blew listlessly  barely able to stir the pools of oxygen that collected in the lowlands .  occasionally  during the long day  the crusted sun would flare briefly into a dull red glow and the oxygen pools would bubble a little .  during the long .  night  a blue white oxygen frost formed over the pools and on the bare rock  a neon dew formed .  eight hundred miles below the surface  a last bubble of warmth and life existed .      wenda   s relationship to roi was as close as one could imagine  closer by far than it was decent for her to know .  she had been allowed to enter the ovarium only once in her life and it had been made quite clear to her that it was to be only that once .  the raceologist had said     you don   t quite meet the standards  wenda  but you are fertile and we   ll try you once .  it may work out .     she wanted it to work out .  she wanted it desperately .  quite early in her life she had known that she was deficient in intelligence  that she would never be more than a manual .  it embarrassed her that she should fail the race and she longed for even a single chance to help create another being .  it became an obsession .  she secreted her egg in an angle of the structure and then returned to watch .  the    randoming    process that moved the eggs gently about during mechanical insemination  to insure even gene distribution  did not  by some good fortune  do more than make her own wedged in egg wobble a bit .  unobtrusively she maintained her watch during the period of maturation  observed the little one who emerged from the particular egg that was hers  noted his physical markings  watched him grow .  he was a healthy youngster and the raceologist approved of him .  she had said once  very casually     look at that one  the one sitting there .  is he sick .        which one .     the raceologist was startled .  visibly sick infants at this stage would be a strong reflection upon his own competence .     you mean roi .     nonsense .  i wish all our young were like that one .     at first  she was only pleased with herself  then frightened  finally horrified .  she found herself haunting the youngster  taking an interest in his schooling  watching him at play .  she was happy when he was near  dull and unhappy otherwise .  she had never heard of such a thing  and she was ashamed .  she should have visited the mentalist  but she knew better .  she was not so dull as not to know that this was not a mild aberration to be cured at the twitch of a brain cell .  it was a truly psychotic manifestation .  she was certain of that .  they would confine her if they found out .  they would euthanase her  perhaps  as a useless drain on the strictly limited energy available to the race .  they might even euthanase the    offspring of her egg if they found out who it was .  she fought the abnormality through the years and  to a measure  succeeded .  then she first heard the news that roi had been chosen for the long trip and was filled with aching misery .  she followed him to one of the empty corridors of the cavern  some miles from the city center .  the city .  there was only one .  this particular cavern had been closed down within wenda   s own memory .  the elders had paced its length  considered its population and the energy necessary to keep it powered  then decided to darken it .  the population  not many to be sure  had been moved closer toward the center and the quota for the next session at the ovarium had been cut .  wenda found roi   s conversational level of thinking shallow  as though most of his mind had drawn inward contemplatively .  are you afraid .  she thought at him .  because i come out here to think .  he hesitated a little  then said     yes  i am .  it   s the race   s last chance .  if i fail      are you afraid for yourself .  he looked at her in astonishment and wenda   s thought stream fluttered with shame at her indecency .  she said     i wish i were going instead .     roi said     do you think you can do a better job .        oh  no .  but if i were to fail and  and never come back  it would be a smaller loss to the race .        the loss is all the same     he said stolidly     whether it   s you or i .  the loss is racial existence .     racial existence at the moment was in the background of wenda   s mind  if anywhere .  she sighed .     the trip is such a long one .        how long .     he asked with a smile .     do you know .     she hesitated .  she dared not appear stupid to him .  she said primly     the common talk is that it is to the first level .     when wenda had been little and the heated corridors had extended further out of the city  she had wandered out  exploring as youngsters will .  one day  a long distance out  where the chill in the air nipped at her  she came to a hall that slanted upward but was blocked almost instantly by a tremendous plug  wedged tightly from top to bottom and side to side .  on the other side and upward  she had learned a long time later  lay the seventy ninth level  above that the seventy eighth and so on .     we   re going past the first level  wenda .        but there   s nothing past the first level .        you   re right .  nothing .  all the solid matter of the planet comes to an end .        but how can there be anything that   s nothing .  you mean air .        no  i mean nothing .  vacuum .  you know what vacuum is  don   t your       yes .  but vacuums have to be pumped and kept airtight .        that   s good for maintenance .  still  past the first level is just an indefinite amount of vacuum stretching everywhere .     wenda thought awhile .  she said     has anyone ever been there .        of course not .  but we have the records .        maybe the records are wrong .        they can   t be .  do you know how much space i   m going to cross .     wenda   s thought stream indicated an overwhelming negative .  roi said     you know the speed of light  i suppose .        of course     she replied readily .  it was a universal constant .  infants knew it .     one thousand nine hundred and fifty four times the length of the cavern and back in one second .        right     said roi     but if light were to travel along the distance i   m to cross  it would take it ten years .     wenda said     you   re making fun of me .  you   re trying to frighten me .        why should it frighten you .     he rose .     but i   ve been moping here long enough      for a moment  one of his six grasping limbs rested lightly in one of hers  with an objective  impassive friendship .  an irrational impulse urged wenda to seize it tightly  prevent him from leaving .  she panicked for a moment in fear that he might probe her mind past the conversational level  that he might sicken and never face her again  that he might even report her for treatment .  then she relaxed .  roi was normal  not sick like herself .  he would never dream of penetrating a friend   s mind any deeper than the conversational level  whatever the provocation .  he was very handsome in her eyes as he walked away .  his grasping limbs were straight and strong  his prehensile  manipulative vibrissae were numerous and delicate and his optic patches were more beautifully opalescent than any she had ever seen .      laura settled down in her seat .  how soft and comfortable they made them .  how pleasing and unfrightening airplanes were on the inside  how different from the hard  silvery  inhuman luster of the outside .  the bassinet was on the seat beside her .  she peeped in past the blanket and the tiny  ruffled cap .  walter was sleeping .  his face was the blank  round softness of infancy and his eyelids were two fringed half moons pulled down over his eyes .  a tuft of light brown hair straggled across his forehead  and with infinite delicacy  laura drew it back beneath his cap .  it would soon be walter   s feeding time and she hoped he was still too young to be upset by the strangeness of his surroundings .  the stewardess was being very kind .  she even kept his bottles in a little l efrigerator .  imagine  a refrigerator on board an airplane .  the people .  in the seat across the aisle had been watching her in that peculiar way that meant they would love to talk to her if only they could think of an excuse .  the moment came when she lifted walter out of his bassinet and placed him  a little lump of pink flesh encased in a white cocoon of cotton  upon her lap .  a baby is always legitimate as an opening for conversation between strangers .  the lady across the way said  her words were predictable      what a lovely child .  how old is he  my dear .     laura said  through the pins in her mouth  she had spread a blanket across her knees and was changing walter      he   ll be four months old next week .     walter   s eyes were open and he simpered across at the woman  opening his mouth in a wet  gummy grin .   he always enjoyed being changed .      look at him smile  george     said the lady .  her husband smiled back and twiddled fat fingers .     goo     he said .  walter laughed in a high pitched  hiccupy way .     what   s his name  dear .     said the woman .     he   s walter michael     laura said  then added     after his father .     the floodgates were quite down .  laura learned that the couple were george and eleanor ellis  that they were on vacation  that they had three children  two girls and one boy  all grown up .  both girls had married and one had two children of her own .  laura listened with a pleased expression on her thin face .  walter  senior  that is  had always said that it was because she was such a good listener that he had first grown interested in her .  walter was getting restless .  laura freed his arms in order to let some of his feelings evaporate in muscular effort .     would you warm the bottle  please .     she asked the stewardess .  under strict but friendly questioning  laura explained the number of feedings walter was currently enjoying  the exact nature of his formula  and whether he suffered from diaper rash .     i hope his little stomach isn   t upset today     she worried .     i mean the plane motion  you know .        oh  lord     said mrs .  ellis     he   s too young to be bothered by that .  besides  these large planes are wonderful .  unless i look out the window  i wouldn   t believe we were in the air .  don   t you feel that way  george .     but mr .  ellis  a blunt  straightforward man  said     i   m surprised you take a baby that age on a plane .     mrs .  ellis turned to frown at him .  laura held walter over her shoulder and patted his back gently .  the beginnings of a soft wail died down as his little fingers found themselves in his mother   s smooth  blond hair and began grubbing into the loose bun that lay at the back of her neck .  she said     i   m taking him to his father .  walter   s never seen his son  yet .     mr .  ellis looked perplexed and began a comment  but mrs .  ellis put in quickly     your husband is in the service  i suppose .        yes  he is .      mr .  ellis opened his mouth in a soundless    oh    and subsided .   laura went on     he   s stationed just outside of davao and he   s going to be meeting me at nichols field .     before the stewardess returned with the bottle  they had discovered that her husband was a master sergeant with the quartermaster corps  that he had been in the army for four years  that they had been married for two  that he was about to be discharged  and that they would spend a long honeymoon there before returning to san francisco .  then she had the bottle .  she cradled walter in the crook of her left arm and put the bottle to his face .  it slid right past his lips and his gums seized upon the nipple .  little bubbles began to work upward through the milk  while his hands batted ineffectively at the warm glass and his blue eyes stared fixedly at her .  laura squeezed little walter ever so slightly and thought how  with all the petty difficulties and annoyances that were involved  it yet remained such a wonderful thing to have a little baby all one   s own .      theory  thought gan  always theory .  the folk of the surface  a million or more years ago  could see the universe  could sense it directly .  now  with eight hundred miles of rock above their heads  the race could only make deductions from the trembling needles of their instruments  it was only theory that brain cells  in addition to their ordinary electric potentials  radiated another sort of energy altogether .  energy that was not electromagnetic and hence not condemned to the creeping pace of light .  energy that was associated only with the highest functions of the brain and hence characteristic only of intelligent  reasoning creatures .  it was only a jogging needle that detected such an energy field leaking into their cavern  and other needles that pinpointed the origin of the field in such and such a direction ten light years distant .  at least one star must have moved quite close in the time since the surface folk had placed the nearest at five hundred light years .  or was theory wrong .     are you afraid .     gan burst into the conversational level of thought without warning and impinged sharply on the humming surface of roi   s mind .  roi said     it   s a great responsibility .     gan thought     others speak of responsibility .     for generations  head tech after head tech had been working on the resonizer and the receiving station and it was in his time that the final step had to be taken .  what did others know of responsibility .  he said     it is .  we talk about racial extinction glibly enough  but we always assume it will come someday but not now  not in our time .  but it will  do you understand .  it will .  what we are to do today will consume two thirds of our total energy supply .  there will not be enough left to try again .  there will not be enough for this generation to live out its life .  but that will not matter if you follow orders .  we have thought of everything .  we have spent generations thinking of everything        i will do what i am told     said roi .     your thought field will be meshed against those coming from space .  all thought fields are characteristic of the individual  and ordinarily the probability of any duplication is very low .  but the fields from space number billions by our best estimate .  your field is very likely to be like one of theirs  and in that case  a resonance will be set up as long as our resonizer is in operation .  do you know the principles involved .        yes  sir .        then you know that during resonance  your mind will be on planet x in the brain of the creature with a thought field identical to yours .  that is not the energy consuming process .  in resonance with your mind  we will also place the mass of the receiving station .  the method of transferring mass in that manner was the last phase of the problem to be solved  and it will take all the energy the race would ordinarily use in a hundred years .     gan picked up the black cube that was the receiving station and looked at it somberly .  three generations before it had been thought impossible to manufacture one with all the required properties in a space less than twenty cubic yards .  they had it now  it was the size of his fist .  gan said     the thought field of intelligent brain cells can only follow certain well defined patterns .  all living creatures  on whatever planet they develop  must possess a protein base and an oxygen water chemistry .  if their world is livable for them  it is livable for us .     theory  thought gan on a deeper level  always theory .  he went on     this does not mean that the body you find yourself in  its mind and its emotions  may not be completely alien .  so we have arranged for three methods of activating the receiving station .  if you are strong limbed  you need only exert five hundred pounds of pressure on any face of the cube .  if you are delicate limbed  you need only press a knob  which you can reach through this single opening in the cube .  if you are no limbed  if your host body is paralyzed or in any other way helpless  you can activate the station by mental energy alone .  once the station is activated  we will have two points of reference  not one  and the race can be transferred to planet x by ordinary teleportation .        that     said roi     will mean we will use electromagnetic energy .         and so .        it will take us ten years to transfer .        we will not be aware of duration .        i realize that  sir  but it will mean the station will remain on planet x for ten years .  what if it is destroyed in the meantime .        we have thought of that  too .  we have thought of everything .  once the station is activated  it will generate a paramass field .  it will move in the direction of gravitational attraction  sliding through ordinary matter  until such time as a continuous medium of relatively high density exerts sufficient friction to stop it .  it will take twenty feet of rock to do that .  anything of lower density won   t affect it .  it will remain twenty feet underground for ten years  at which time a counterfield will bring it to the surface .  then one by one  the race will appear .        in that case  why not make the activation of the station automatic .  it has so many automatic attributes already         you haven   t thought it through  roi .  we have .  not all spots on the surface of planet x may be suitable .  if the inhabitants are powerful and advanced  you may have to find an unobtrusive place for the station .  it won   t do for us to appear in a city square .  and you will have to be certain that the immediate environment is not dangerous in other ways .        what other ways  sir .        i don   t know .  the ancient records of the surface record many things we no longer understand .  they don   t explain because they took those items for granted  but we have been away from the surface for almost a hundred thousand generations and we are puzzled .  our techs aren   t even in agreement on the physical nature of stars  and that is something the records mention and discuss frequently .  but what are    storms        earthquakes        volcanoes        tornadoes        sleet        landslides        floods        lightning     and so on .  these are all terms which refer to surface phenomena that are dangerous  but we don   t know what they are  we don   t know how to guard against them .  through your host   s mind  you may be able to learn what is needful and take appropriate action .        how much time will i have  sir .        the resonizer cannot be kept in continuous operation for longer than twelve hours .  i would prefer that you complete your job in two .  you will return here automatically as soon as the station is activated .  are you ready .        i   m ready     said roi .  gan led the way to the clouded glass cabinet .  roi took his seat  arranged his limbs in the appropriate depressions .  his vibrissae dipped in mercury for good contact .  roi said     what if i find myself in a body on the point of death .     gan said as he adjusted the controls     the thought field is distorted when a person is near death .  no normal thought field such as yours would be in resonance .     roi said      and if it is on the point of accidental death .     gan said     we have thought of that  too .  we can   t guard against it  but the chances of death following so quickly that you have no time to activate the station mentally are estimated as less than one in twenty trillion  unless the mysterious surface dangers are more deadly than we expect .  .  .  . you have one minute .     for some strange reason  roi   s last thought before translation was of wenda .      laura awoke with a sudden start .  what happened .  she felt as though she had been jabbed with a pin .  the afternoon sun was shining in her face and its dazzle made her blink .  she lowered the shade and simultaneously bent to look at walter .  she was a little surprised to find his eyes open .  this wasn   t one of his waking periods .  she looked at her wrist watch .  no  it wasn   t .  and it was a good hour before feeding time  too .  she followed the demand  feeding system or the    if you want it holler and you   ll get it    routine  but ordinarily walter followed the clock quite conscientiously .  she wrinkled her nose at him .     hungry  duckier    walter did not respond at all and laura was disappointed .  she would have liked to have him smile .  actually  she wanted him to laugh and throw his pudgy arms about her neck and nuzzle her and say     mommie     but she knew he couldn   t do any of that .  but he could smile .  she put a light finger to his chin and tapped it a bit .     goo goo goo goo .     he always smiled when you did that .  but he only blinked at her .  she said     i hope he isn   t sick .     she looked at mrs .  ellis in distress .  mrs .  ellis put down a magazine .      is anything wrong  my dear .        i don   t know .  walter just lies there .        poor little thing .  he   s tired  probably .        shouldn   t he be sleeping  then .        he   s in strange surroundings .  he   s probably wondering what it   s all about .     she rose  stepped across the aisle  and leaned across laura to bring her own face close to walter   s .     you   re wondering what   s going on  you tiny little snookums .  yes  you are .  you   re saying     where   s my nice little crib and all my nice little funnies on the wall paper .     then she made little squeaking sounds at him .  walter turned his eyes away from his mother and watched mrs .  ellis somberly .  mrs .  ellis straightened suddenly and looked pained .  she put a hand to her head for a moment and murmured     goodness .  the queerest pain .        do you think he   s hungry .     asked laura .     lord     said mrs .  ellis  the trouble in her face fading     they let you know when they   re hungry soon enough .  there   s nothing wrong with him .  i   ve had three children  my dear .  i know .        i think i   ll ask the stewardess to warm up another bottle .        well  if it will make you feel better .  .  .     the stewardess brought the bottle and laura lifted walter out of his bassinet .  she said     you have your bottle and then i   ll change you and then      she adjusted his head in the crook of her elbow  leaned over to peck him quickly on the cheek  then cradled him close to her body as she brought the bottle to his lips   walter screamed .  his mouth yawned open  his arms pushed before him with his fingers spread wide  his whole body as stiff and hard as though in tetany  and he screamed .  it rang through the whole compartment .  laura screamed too .  she dropped the bottle and it smashed whitely .  mrs .  ellis jumped up .  half a dozen others did .  mr .  ellis snapped out of a light doze .     what   s the matter .     asked mrs .  ellis blankly .     i don   t know .  i don   t know .     laura was shaking walter frantically  putting him over her shoulder  patting his back .     baby  baby  don   t cry .  baby  what   s the matter .  baby      the stewardess was dashing down the aisle .  her foot came within an inch of the cube that sat beneath laura   s seat .  walter was threshing about furiously now  yelling with calliope intensity .          roi   s mind flooded with shock .  one moment he had been strapped in his chair in contact with the clear mind of gan  the next  there was no consciousness of separation in time  he was immersed in a medley of strange  barbaric  and broken thought .  he closed his mind completely .  it had been open wide to increase the effectiveness of resonance  and the first touch of the alien had been not painful  no .  dizzying  nauseating .  no  not that  either .  there was no word .  he gathered resilience in the quiet nothingness of mind closure and considered his position .  he felt the small touch of the receiving station  with which he was in mental liaison .  that had come with him .  good .  he ignored his host for the moment .  he might need him for drastic operations later  so it would be wise to raise no suspicions for the moment .  he explored .  he entered a mind at random and took stock first to the sense impressions that permeated it .  the creature was sensitive to parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and to vibrations of the air  and  of course  to bodily contact .  it possessed localized chemical senses that was about all .  he looked again in astonishment .  not only was there no direct mass sense  no electro potential sense  none of the really refined interpreters of the universe  but there was no mental contact whatever .  the creature   s mind was completely isolated .  then how did they communicate .  he looked further .  they had a complicated code of controlled air vibrations .  were they intelligent .  had he chosen a maimed mind .  no  they were all like that .  he filtered the group of surrounding minds through his mental tendrils  searching for a tech  or whatever passed for such among these crippled semi intelligences .  he found a mind which thought of itself as a controller of vehicles .  a piece of information flooded roi .  he was on an air borne vehicle .  then even without mental contact  they would build a rudimentary mechanical civilization .  or were they animal tools of real intelligences elsewhere on the planet .  no .  .  .  their minds said no .  he plumbed the tech .  what about the immediate environment .  were the bugbears of the ancients to be feared .  it was a matter of interpretation .  dangers in the environment existed .  movements of air .  changes of temperature .  water falling in the air  either as liquid or solid .  electrical discharges .  there were code vibrations of each phenomenon but that meant nothing .  the connection of any of these with the names given to phenomena by the ancestral surface folk was a matter of conjecture .  no matter .  was there danger now .  was there danger here .  was there any cause for fear or uneasiness .  no .  the tech   s mind said no .  that was enough .  he returned to his host mind and rested a moment  then cautiously expanded .  .  .  nothing .  his host mind was blank .  at most  there was a vague sense of warmth  and a dull flicker of undirected response to basic stimuli .  was his host dying after all .  aphasic .  decerebrate .  he moved quickly to the mind nearest  dredging it for information about his host and finding it .  his host was an infant of species .  an infant .  a normal infant .  and so undeveloped .  he allowed his mind to sink into and coalesce for a moment with what existed in his host .  he searched for the motor areas of the brain and found them with difficulty .  a cautious stimulus was followed by an erratic motion of his host   s extremities .  he attempted finer control and failed .  he felt anger .  had they thought of everything after all .  had they thought of intelligences without mental contact .  had they thought of young creatures as completely undeveloped as though they were still in the egg .  it meant  of course  that he could not  in the person of his host  activate the receiving station .  the muscles and mind were far too weak  far too uncontrolled for any of the three methods outlined by gan .  he thought intensely .  he could scarcely expect to influence much mass through the imperfect focusing of his host   s material brain cells  but what about an indirect influence through an adult   s brain .  direct physical influence would be minute  it would amount to the breakdown of the appropriate molecules of adenosine triphosphate and acetylcholine .  thereafter the creature would act on its own .  he hesitated to try this  afraid of failure  then cursed himself for a coward .  he entered the closest mind once more .  it was a female of the species and it was in the state of temporary inhibition he had noticed in others .  it didn   t surprise him .  minds as rudimentary as these would need periodic respites .  he considered the mind before him now  fingering mentally the areas that might respond to stimulation .  he chose one  stabbed at it  and the conscious areas flooded with life almost simultaneously .  sense impressions poured in and the level of thought rose steeply .  good .  but not good enough .  that was a mere prod  a pinch .  it was no order for specific action .  he stirred uncomfortably as emotion cascaded over him .  it came from the mind he had just stimulated and was directed  of course  at his host and not at him .  nevertheless  its primitive crudities annoyed him and he closed his mind against the unpleasant warmth of her uncovered feelings .  a second mind centered about his host  and had he been material or had he controlled a satisfactory host  he would have struck out in vexation .  great caverns  weren   t they going to allow him to concentrate on his serious business .  he thrust sharply at the second mind  activating centers of discomfort  and it moved away .  he was pleased .  that had been more than a simple  undefined stimulation  and it had worked nicely .  he had cleared the mental atmosphere .  he returned to the tech who controlled the vehicle .  he would know the details concerning the surface over which they were passing .  water .  he sorted the data quickly .  water .  and more water .  by the everlasting levels  the word    ocean    made sense .  the old  traditional word    ocean .     who would dream that so much water could exist .  but then  if this was    ocean     then the traditional word    island    had an obvious significance .  he thrust his whole mind into the quest for geographical information .  the    ocean    was speckled with dots of land but he needed exact he was interrupted by a short stab of surprise as his host moved through space and was held against the neighboring female   s body .  roi   s mind  engaged as it was  lay open and unguarded .  in full intensity  the female   s emotions piled in upon him .  roi winced .  in an attempt to remove the distracting animal passions  he clamped down upon the host   s brain cells  through which the rawness was funneling .  he did that too quickly  too energetically .  his host   s mind flooded with a diffuse pain  and instantly almost every mind he could reach reacted to the air vibrations that resulted .  in vexation  he tried to blanket the pain and succeeded only in stimulating it further .  through the clinging mental mist of his host   s pain .  he rimed the techs    minds  striving to prevent contact from slipping out of focus .  his mind went icy .  the best chance was almost now .  he had perhaps twenty minutes .  there would be other chances afterward  but not as good .  yet he dared not attempt to direct the actions of another while his host   s mind was in such complete disorganization .  he retired  withdrew into mind closure  maintaining only the most tenuous connection with his host   s spinal cells  and waited .  minutes passed  and little by little he returned to fuller liaison .  he had five minutes left .  he chose a subject .      the stewardess said     i think he   s beginning to feel a little better  poor little thing .        he never acted like this before     insisted laura tearfully .     never .        he just had a little colic  i guess     said the stewardess .     maybe he   s bundled up too much     suggested mrs .  ellis .     maybe     said the stewardess .     it   s quite warm .     she unwrapped the blanket and lifted the nightgown to expose a heaving abdomen  pink and bulbous .  walter was still whimpering .  she stewardess said     shall i change him for you .  he   s quite wet .        would you please .     most of the dearer passengers had returned to their seats .  the more distant ceased craning their necks .  mr .  ellis remained in the aisle with his wife .  he said     say  look .     laura and the stewardess were too busy to pay him attention and mrs .  ellis ignored him out of sheer custom .  mr .  ellis was used to that .  his remark was purely rhetorical  anyway .  he bent down and tugged at the box beneath the seat .  mrs .  ellis looked down impatiently .  she said     goodness  george  don   t be dragging at other people   s luggage like that .  sit down .  you   re in the way .     mr .  ellis straightened in confusion .  laura  with eyes still red and weepy  said     it isn   t mine .  i didn   t even know it was under the seat .     the stewardess  looking up from the whining baby  said     what is it .     mr .  ellis shrugged .     it   s a box .     his wife said     well  what do you want with it  for heaven   s sake .     mr .  ellis groped for a reason .  what did he want with it .  he mumbled     i was just curious .     the stewardess said     there .  the little boy is all nice and dry  and i   ll bet in two minutes he   ll just be as happy as anything .  hmm .  won   t you  little funny face .     but little funny face was still sobbing .  he turned his head away sharply as a bottle was once more produced .  the stewardess said     let me warm it a bit .     she took it and went back down the aisle .  mr .  ellis came to a decision .  firmly he lifted the box and balanced it on the arm of his seat .  he ignored his wife   s frown .  he said     i   m not doing it any harm .  i   m just looking .  what   s it made of  anyway .     he rapped it with his knuckles .  none of the other passengers seemed interested .  they paid no attention to either mr .  ellis or the box .  it was as though something had switched off that particular line of interest among them .  even mrs .  ellis  in conversation with laura  kept her back to him .  mr .  ellis tipped the box up and found the opening .  he knew it had to have an opening .  it was large enough for him to insert a finger  though there was no reason  of course  why he should want to put a finger into a strange box .  carefully he reached in .  there was a black knob  which he longed to touch .  he pressed it .  the box shuddered and was suddenly out of his bands and passed through the arm of the chair .  he caught a glimpse of it moving through the floor  and then there was unbroken flooring and nothing more .  slowly he spread out his hands and stared at his palms .  then  dropping to his knees  he felt the floor .  the stewardess  returning with the bottle  said politely     have you lost something  sir .     mrs .  ellis  looking down  said     george .     mr .  ellis heaved himself upward .  he was flushed and flustered .  he said     the box  it slipped out and went down      the stewardess said     what box  sir .     laura said     may i have the bottle  miss .  he   s stopped crying .        certainly .  here it is .     walter opened his mouth eagerly  accepting the nipple .  air bubbles moved upward through the milk and there were little swallowing sounds .  laura looked up radiantly .     he seems fine now .  thank you  stewardess .  thank you  mrs .  ellis .  for a while there  it almost seemed as though he weren   t my little boy .        he   ll be all right     said mrs .  ellis .     maybe it was just a bit of airsickness .  sit down  george .     the stewardess said     just call me if you need me .        thank you     said laura .  mr .  ellis said     the box      and stopped .  what box .  he didn   t remember any box .  but one mind aboard plane could follow the black cube as it dropped in a parabola unimpeded by wind or air resistance  passing through the molecules of gas that lay in its way .  below it  the atoll was a tiny bull   s eye in a huge target .  once  during a time of war  it had boasted an air strip and barracks .  the barracks had collapsed  the air strip was a vanishing ragged line  and the atoll was empty .  the cube struck the feathery foliage of a palm and not a frond was disturbed .  it passed through the trunk and down to the coral .  it sank into the planet itself without the smallest fog of dust kicked up to tell of its entrance .  twenty feet below the surface of the soil  the cube passed into stasis and remained motionless  mingled intimately with the atoms of the rock  yet remaining distinct .  that was all .  it was night  then day .  it rained  the wind blew  and the pacific waves broke whitely on the white coral .  nothing had happened .  nothing would happen  for ten years .         we have broadcast the news     said gan     that you have succeeded .  i think you ought to rest now .     roi said     rest .  now .  when i   m back with complete minds .  thank you  but no .  the enjoyment is too keen .        did it bother you so much .  intelligence without mental contact .        yes     said roi shortly .  gan tactfully refrained from attempting to follow the line of retreating thought .  instead  he said      and the surface .     roi said     entirely horrible .  what the ancients called    sun    is an unbearable pat  . h of brilliance overhead .  it is apparently a source of light and varies periodically     day    and    night     in other words .  there is also unpredictable variation .            clouds    perhaps     said gan .     why    clouds    .        you know the traditional phrase     clouds hid the sun .            you think so .  yes  it could be .        well  go on .        let   s see .     ocean    and    island    i   ve explained .     storm    involves wetness in the air  falling in drops .     wind    is a movement of air on a huge scale .     thunder    is either a spontaneous  static discharge in the air or a great spontaneous noise .     sleet    is falling ice .      gan said     that   s a curious one .  where would ice fall from .  how .  why .        i haven   t the slightest idea .  it   s all very variable .  it will storm at one time and not at another .  there are apparently regions on the surface where it is always cold  others where it is always hot  still others where it is both at different times .        astonishing .  how much of this do you suppose is misinterpretation of alien minds .        none .  i   m sure of that .  it was all quite plain .  i had sufficient time to plumb their queer minds .  too much time .     again his thoughts drifted back into privacy .  gan said     this is well .  i   ve been afraid all along of our tendency to romanticize the so called golden age of our surface ancestors .  i felt that there would be a strong impulse among our group in favor of a new surface life .        no     said roi vehemently .     obviously no .  i doubt if the hardiest among us would consider even a day of life in an environment such as you describe  with its storms  days  nights  its indecent and unpredictable variations in environment .     gan   s thoughts were contented ones .     tomorrow we begin the process of transfer .  once on the island  an uninhabited one  you say .        entirely uninhabited .  it was the only one of that type the vessel passed over .  the tech   s information was detailed .        good .  we will begin operations .  it will take generations  roi  but in the end  we will be in the deep of a new  warm world  in pleasant caverns where the controlled environment will be conducive to the growth of every culture and refinement .         and     added roi     no contact whatever with the surface creatures .     gan said     why that .  primitive though they are  they could be of help to us once we establish our base .  a race that can build aircraft must have some abilities .        it isn   t that .  they   re a belligerent lot  sir .  they would attack with animal ferocity at all occasions and      gan interrupted .     i am disturbed at the psychopenumbra that surrounds your references to the aliens .  there   s something you are concealing .     roi said     i thought at first we could make use of them .  if they wouldn   t allow us to be friends  at least  we could control them .  i made one of them close contact inside the cube and that was difficult .  very difficult .  their minds are basically different .        in what way .        if i could describe it  the difference wouldn   t be basic .  but i can give you an example .  i was in the mind of an infant .  they don   t have maturation chambers .  the infants are in the charge of individuals .  the creature who was in charge of my host         yes .        she  it was a female  felt a special tie to the young one .  there was a sense of ownership  of a relationship that excluded the remainder of their society .  i seemed to detect  dimly  something of the emotion that binds a man to an associate or friend  but it was far more intense and unrestrained .        well     said gan     without mental contact  they probably have no real conception of society and subrelationships may build up .  or was this one pathological .        no  no .  it   s universal .  the female in charge was the infant   s mother .        impossible .  its own mother .        of necessity .  the infant had passed the first part of its existence inside its mother .  physically inside .  the creature   s eggs remain within the body .  they are inseminated within the body .  they grow within the body and emerge alive .        great caverns     gan said weakly .  distaste was strong within him .     each creature would know the identity of its own child .  each child would have a particular father         and he would be known  too .  my host was being taken five thousand miles  as nearly as i could judge the distance  to be seen by its father .        unbelievable .        do you need more to see that there can never be any meeting of minds .  the difference is so fundamental  so innate .     the yellowness of regret tinged and roughened gan   s thought train .  he said     it would be too bad .  i had thought         what  sir .        i had thought that for the first time there would be two intelligences helping one another .  i had thought that together we might progress more quickly than either could alone .  even if they were primitive technologically  as they are  technology isn   t everything .  i had thought we might still be able to learn of them .        learn what .     asked roi brutally .     to know our parents and make friends of our children .     gan said     no .  no  you   re quite right .  the barrier between us must remain forever complete .  they will have the surface and we the deep  and so it will be .     outside the laboratories roi met wenda .  her thoughts were concentrated pleasure .     i   m glad you   re back .     roi   s thoughts were pleasurable too .  it was very restful to make clean mental contact with a friend .   the fun they had  margie even wrote about it that night in her diary .  on the page headed may           she wrote     today tommy found a real book .     it was a very old book .  margie   s grandfather once said that when he was a little boy his grandfather told him that there was a time when all stories were printed on paper .  they turned the pages  which were yellow and crinkly  and it was awfully funny to read words that stood still instead of moving the way they were supposed to  on a screen  you know .  and then  when they turned back to the page before  it had the same words on it that it had had when they read it the first time .     gee     said tommy     what a waste .  when you   re through with the book  you just throw it away  i guess .  our television screen must have had a million books on it and it   s good for plenty more .    wouldn   t throw it away .        same with mine     said margie .  she was eleven and hadn   t seen as many telebooks as tommy had .  he was thirteen .  she said     where did you find it .        in my house .     he pointed without looking  because he was busy reading .     in the attic .        what   s it about .        school .     margie was scornful .     school .  what   s there to write about school .  i hate school .     margie always hated school  but now she hated it more than ever .  the mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her mother had shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the county inspector .  he was a round little man with a red face and a whole box of tools with dials and wires .  he smiled at margie and gave her an apple  then took the teacher apart .  margie had hoped he wouldn   t know how to put it together again  but he knew how all right  and  after an hour or so  there it was again  large and black and ugly  with a big screen on which all the lessons were shown and the questions were asked .  that wasn   t so bad .  the part margie hated most was the slot where she had to put homework and test papers .  she always had to write them out in a punch code they made her leam when she was six years old  and the mechanical teacher calculated the mark in no time .  the inspector had smiled after he was finished and patted margie   s head .  he said to her mother     it   s not the little girl   s fault  mrs .  jones .  i think the geography sector was geared a little too quick .  those things happen sometimes .  i   ve slowed it up to an average ten year level .  actually  the over all pattern of her progress is quite satisfactory .     and he patted margie   s head again .  margie was disappointed .  she had been hoping they would take the teacher away altogether .  they had once taken tommy   s teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out completely .  so she said to tommy     why would anyone write about school .     tommy looked at her with very superior eyes .     because it   s not our kind of school  stupid .  this is the old kind of school that they had hundreds and hundreds of years ago .     he added loftily  pronouncing the word carefully     centuries ago .     margie was hurt .     well  i don   t know what kind of school they had all that time ago .     she read the book over his shoulder for a while  then said     anyway  they had a teacher .        sure they had a teacher  but it wasn   t a regular teacher .  it was a man .        a man .  how could a man be a teacher .        well  he just told the boys and girls things and gave them homework and asked them questions .        a man isn   t smart enough .        sure he is .  my father knows as much as my teacher .        he can   t .  a man can   t know as much as a teacher .        he knows almost as much  i betcha .     margie wasn   t prepared to dispute that .  she said     i wouldn   t want a strange man in my house to teach me .     tommy screamed with laughter .     you don   t know much  margie .  the teachers didn   t live in the house .  they had a special building and all the kids went there .        and all the kids learned the same thing .        sure  if they were the same age .        but my mother says a teacher has to be adjusted to fit the mind of each boy and girl it teaches and that each kid has to be taught differently .        just the same they didn   t do it that way then .  if you don   t like it  you don   t have to read the book .        i didn   t say i didn   t like it     margie said quickly .  she wanted to read about those funny schools .  they weren   t even half finished when margie   s mother called     margie .  school .     margie looked up .     not yet  mamma .        now .     said mrs .  jones .     and it   s probably time for tommy  too .     margie said to tommy     can i read the book some more with you after school .        maybe     he said nonchalantly .  he walked away whistling  the dusty old book tucked beneath his arm .  margie went into the schoolroom .  it was right next to her bedroom  and the mechanical teacher was on and waiting for her .  it was always on at the same time every day except saturday and sunday  because her mother said little girls learned better if they learned at regular hours .  the screen was lit up  and it said     today   s arithmetic lesson is on the addition of proper fractions .  please insert yesterday   s homework in the proper slot .     margie did so with a sigh .  she was thinking about the old schools they had when her grandfather   s grandfather was a little boy .  all the kids from the whole neighborhood came  laughing and shouting in the schoolyard  sitting together in the schoolroom  going home together at the end of the day .  they learned the same things  so they could help one another on the homework and talk about it .  and the teachers were people .   .   .   .  the mechanical teacher was flashing on the screen     when we add the fractions     and l        margie was thinking about how the kids must have loved it in the old days .  she was thinking about the fun they had .   the last question  the last question was asked for the first time  half in jest  on may           at a time when humanity first stepped into the light .  the question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs  and it happened this way  alexander adell and bertram lupov were two of the faithful attendants of multivac .  as well as any human beings could  they knew what lay behind the cold  clicking  flashing face  miles and miles of face  of that giant computer .  they had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole .  multivac was self adjusting and self correcting .  it had to be  for nothing human could adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough .  so adell and lupov attended the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially  yet as well as any men could .  they fed it data  adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued .  certainly they  and all others like them  were fully entitled to share in the glory that was multivac   s .  for decades  multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to reach the moon  mars  and venus  but past that  earth   s poor resources could not support the ships .  too much energy was needed for the long trips .  earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency  but there was only so much of both .  but slowly multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally  and on may           what had been theory  became fact .  the energy of the sun was stored  converted  and utilized directly on a planet wide scale .  all earth turned off its burning coal  its fissioning uranium  and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station  one mile in diameter  circling the earth at half the distance of the moon .  all earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower .  seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and adell and lupov finally managed to escape from the public function  and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them  in the deserted underground chambers  where portions of the mighty buried body of multivac showed .  unattended  idling  sorting data with contented lazy clickings  multivac  too  had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that .  they had no intention  originally  of disturbing it .  they had brought a bottle with them  and their only concern at the moment was to relax in the company of each other and the bottle .     it   s amazing when you think of it     said adell .  his broad face had lines of weariness in it  and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod  watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about .     all the energy we can possibly ever use for free .  enough energy  if we wanted to draw on it  to melt all earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron  and still never miss the energy so used .  all the energy we could ever use  forever and forever and forever .     lupov cocked his head sideways .  he had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary  and he wanted to be contrary now  partly because he had had to carry the ice and glassware .     not forever     he said .     oh  hell  just about forever .  till the sun runs down  bert .        that   s not forever .        all right  then .  billions and billions of years .  twenty billion  maybe .  are you satisfied .     lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink .     twenty billion years isn   t forever .        well  it will last our time  won   t it .        so would the coal and uranium .        all right  but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the solar station  and it can go to pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel .  you can   t do that on coal and uranium .  ask multivac  if you don   t believe me .        i don   t have to ask multivac .  i know that .        then stop running down what multivac   s done for us     said adell  blazing up .     it did all right .        who says it didn   t .  what i say is that a sun won   t last forever .  that   s all i   m saying .  we   re safe for twenty billion years  but then what .     lupov pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other .     and don   t say we   ll switch to another sun .     there was silence for a while .  adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally  and lupov   s eyes slowly closed .  they rested .  then lupov   s eyes snapped open .     you   re thinking we   ll switch to another sun when ours is done  aren   t you .        i   m not thinking .        sure you are .  you   re weak on logic  that   s the trouble with you .  you   re like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one .  he wasn   t worried  you see  because he figured when one tree got wet through  he would just get under another one .        i get it     said adell .     don   t shout .  when the sun is done  the other stars will be gone  too .        darn right they will     muttered lupov .     it all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion  whatever that was  and it   ll all have an end when all the stars run down .  some run down faster than others .  hell  the giants won   t last a hundred million years .  the sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are .  but just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark .  entropy has to increase to maximum  that   s all .        i know all about entropy     said adell  standing on his dignity .     the hell you do .        i know as much as you do .        then you know everything   s got to run down someday .        au right .  who says they won   t .        you did  you poor sap .  you said we had all the energy we needed  forever .  you said    forever .         it was adell   s turn to be contrary .     maybe we can build things up again someday     he said .     never .        why not .  someday .        never .        ask multivac .        you ask multivac .  i dare you .  five dollars says it can   t be done .     adell was just drunk enough to try  just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which  in words  might have corresponded to this  will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age .  or maybe it could be put more simply like this  how can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased .  multivac fell dead and silent .  the slow flashing of lights ceased  the distant sounds of clicking relays ended .  then  just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath no longer  there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to that portion of multivac .  five words were printed  insufficient data for meaningful answer .     not yet     whispered lupov .  they left hurriedly .  by next morning  the two  plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth  had forgotten the incident .   jerrodd  jerrodine  and jerrodette i and ii watched the starry picture in the visiplate change as the passage through hyperspace was completed in its non time lapse .  at once  the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble disk  centered .     that   s x        said jerrodd confidently .  his thin hands clamped tightly behind his back and the knuckles whitened .  the little jerrodettes  both girls  had experienced the hyperspace passage for the first time in their lives and were self conscious over the momentary sensation of inside outness .  they buried their giggles and chased one another wildly about their mother  screaming     we   ve reached x     we   ve reached x     we   ve         quiet  children     said jerrodine sharply .     are you sure  jerrodd .        what is there to be but sure .     asked jerrodd  glancing up at the bulge of featureless metal just under the ceiling .  it ran the length of the room  disappearing through the wall at either end .  it was as long as the ship .  jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a microvac  that one asked it questions if one wished  that if one did not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination  of feeding on energies from the various sub galactic power stations  of computing the equations for the hyperspatial jumps .  jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship .  someone had once told jerrodd that the    ac    at the end of    microvac    stood for    analog computer    in ancient english  but he was on the edge of forgetting even that .  jerrodine   s eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate .     i can   t help it .  i feel funny about leaving earth .        why  for pete   s sake .     demanded jerrodd .     we had nothing there .  we   ll have everything on x    .  you won   t be alone .  you won   t be a pioneer .  there are over a million people on the planet already .  good lord  our great grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because x    will be overcrowded .     then  after a reflective pause     i tell you  it   s a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing .        i know  i know     said jerrodine miserably .  jerrodette i said promptly     our microvac is the best microvac in the world .        i think so  too     said jerrodd  tousling her hair .  it was a nice feeling to have a microvac of your own and jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other .  in his father   s youth  the only computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of land .  there was only one to a planet .  planetary acs they were called .  they had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then  all at once  came refinement .  in place of transistors had come molecular valves so that even the largest planetary ac could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship .  jerrodd felt uplifted  as he always did when he thought that his own personal microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive multivac that had first tamed the sun  and almost as complicated as earth   s planetary ac  the largest  that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had made trips to the stars possible .     so many stars  so many planets     sighed jerrodine  busy with her own thoughts .     i suppose families will be going out to new planets forever  the way we are now .        not forever     said jerrodd  with a smile .     it will all stop someday  but not for billions of years .  many billions .  even the stars run down  you know .  entropy must increase .        what   s entropy  daddy .     shrilled jerrodette ii .     entropy  little sweet  is just a word which means the amount of running down of the universe .  everything runs down  you know  like your little walkie talkie robot  remember .        can   t you just put in a new power unit  like with my robot .        the stars are the power units  dear .  once they   re gone  there are no more power units .     jerrodette i at once set up a howl .     don   t let them  daddy .  don   t let the stars run down .        now look what you   ve done     whispered jerrodine  exasperated .     how was i to know it would frighten them .     jerrodd whispered back .     ask the microvac     wailed jerrodette i .     ask him how to turn the stars on again .        go ahead     said jerrodine .     it will quiet them down .      jerrodette ii was beginning to cry  also .   jerrodd shrugged .     now  now  honeys .  i   ll ask microvac .  don   t worry  he   ll tell us .     he asked the microvac  adding quickly     print the answer .     jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully     see now  the microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don   t worry .     jerrodine said     and now  children  it   s time for bed .  we   ll be in our new home soon .     jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it  insufficient data for a meaningful answer .  he shrugged and looked at the visiplate .  x    was just ahead .   vj   x of lameth stared into the black depths of the three dimensional  small scale map of the galaxy and said     are we ridiculous  i wonder  in being so concerned about the matter .     mq   j of nicron shook his head .     i think not .  you know the galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion .     both seemed in their early twenties  both were tall and perfectly formed .     still     said vj   x     i hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the galactic council .        i wouldn   t consider any other kind of report .  stir them up a bit .  we   ve got to stir them up .     vj   x sighed .     space is infinite .  a hundred billion galaxies are there for the taking .  more .        a hundred billion is not infinite and it   s getting less infinite all the time .  consider .  twenty thousand years ago  mankind first solved the problem of utilizing stellar energy  and a few centuries later  interstellar travel became possible .  it took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the galaxy .  now the population doubles every ten years      vj   x interrupted .     we can thank immortality for that .        very well .  immortality exists and we have to take it into account .  i admit it has its seamy side  this immortality .  the galactic ac has solved many problems for us  but in solving the problem of preventing old age and death  it has undone all its other solutions .        yet you wouldn   t want to abandon life  i suppose .        not at all     snapped mq   j  softening it at once to     not yet .  i   m by no means old enough .  how old are you .        two hundred twenty three .  and you .        i   m still under two hundred .    but to get back to my point .  population doubles every ten years .  once this galaxy is filled  we   ll have filled another in ten years .  another ten years and we   ll have filled two more .  another decade  four more .  in a hundred years  we   ll have filled a thousand galaxies .  in a thousand years  a million galaxies .  in ten thousand years  the entire known universe .  then what .     vj   x said     as a side issue  there   s a problem of transportation .  i wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move galaxies of individuals from one galaxy to the next .        a very good point .  already  mankind consumes two sunpower units per year .        most of it   s wasted .  after all  our own galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those .        granted  but even with a hundred per cent efficiency  we only stave off the end .  our energy requirements are going up in a geometric progression even faster than our population .  we   ll run out of energy even sooner than we run out of galaxies .  a good point .  a very good point .        we   ll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas .        or out of dissipated heat .     asked mq   j  sarcastically .     there may be some way to reverse entropy .  we ought to ask the galactic ac .     vj   x was not really serious  but mq   j pulled out his ac contact from his pocket and placed it on the table before him .     i   ve half a mind to     he said .     it   s something the human race will have to face someday .     he stared somberly at his small ac contact .  it was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself  but it was connected through hyperspace with the great galactic ac that served all mankind .  hyperspace considered  it was an integral part of the galactic ac .  mq   j paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the galactic ac .  it was on a little world of its own  a spider webbing of force beams holding the matter within which surges of sub mesons took the place of the old clumsy molecular valves .  yet despite its sub etheric workings  the galactic ac was known to be a full thousand feet across .  mq   j asked suddenly of his ac contact     can entropy ever be reversed .     vj   x looked startled and said at once     oh  say  i didn   t really mean to have you ask that        why not .        we both know entropy can   t be reversed .  you can   t turn smoke and ash back into a tree .        do you have trees on your world .     asked mq   j .  the sound of the galactic ac startled them into silence .  its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small ac contact on the desk .  it said  there is insufficient data for a meaningful answer .  vj   x said     see .     the two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the galactic council .   zee prime   s mind spanned the new galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it .  he had never seen this one before .  would he ever see them all .  so many of them  each with its load of humanity .    but a load that was almost a dead weight .  more and more  the real essence of men was to be found out here  in space .  minds  not bodies .  the immortal bodies remained back on the planets  in suspension over the eons .  sometimes they roused for material activity but that was growing rarer .  few new individuals were coming into existence to join the incredibly mighty throng  but what matter .  there was little room in the universe for new individuals .  zee prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind .     i am zee prime     said zee prime .     and you .        i am dee sub wun .  your galaxy .        we call it only the galaxy .  and you .        we call ours the same .  all men call their galaxy their galaxy and nothing more .  why not .        true .  since all galaxies are the same .        not all galaxies .  on one particular galaxy the race of man must have originated .  that makes it different .     zee prime said     on which one .        i cannot say .  the universal ac would know .        shall we ask him .  i am suddenly curious .     zee prime   s perceptions broadened until the galaxies themselves shrank and became a new  more diffuse powdering on a much larger background .  so many hundreds of billions of them  all with their immortal beings  all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space .  and yet one of them was unique among them all in being the original galaxy .  one of them had  in its vague and distant past  a period when it was the only galaxy populated by man .  zee prime was consumed with curiosity to see this galaxy and he called out     universal ac .  on which galaxy did mankind originate .     the universal ac heard  for on every world and throughout space  it had its receptors ready  and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the universal ac kept itself aloof .  zee prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of universal ac  and he reported only a shining globe  two feet across  difficult to see .     but how can that be all of universal ac .     zee prime had asked .     most of it     had been the answer     is in hyperspace .  in what form it is there i cannot imagine .     nor could anyone  for the day had long since passed  zee prime knew  when any man had any part of the making of a universal ac .  each universal ac designed and constructed its successor .  each  during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate  more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged .  the universal ac interrupted zee prime   s wandering thoughts  not with  words  but with guidance .  zee prime   s mentality was guided into the dim sea of galaxies and one in particular enlarged into stars .  a thought came  infinitely distant  but infinitely clear .     this is the original galaxy of man .     but it was the same after all  the same as any other  and zee prime stifled his disappointment .  dee sub wun  whose mind had accompanied the other  said suddenly     and is one of these stars the original star of man .     the universal ac said     man   s original star has gone nova .  it is a white dwarf .        did the men upon it die .     asked zee prime  startled and without thinking .  the universal ac said     a new world  as in such cases  was constructed for their physical bodies in time .        yes  of course     said zee prime  but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so .  his mind released its hold on the original galaxy of man  let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points .  he never wanted to see it again .  dee sub wun said     what is wrong .        the stars are dying .  the original star is dead .        they must all die .  why not .        but when all energy is gone  our bodies will finally die  and you and i with them .        it will take billions of years .        i do not wish it to happen even after billions of years .  universal ac .  how may stars be kept from dying .     dee sub wun said in amusement     you   re asking how entropy might be reversed in direction .     and the universal ac answered     there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .     zee prime   s thoughts fled back to his own galaxy .  he gave no further thought to dee sub wun  whose body might be waiting on a galaxy a trillion light years away  or on the star next to zee prime   s own .  it didn   t matter .  unhappily  zee prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to build a small star of his own .  if the stars must someday die  at least some could yet be built .   man considered with himself  for in a way  man  mentally  was one .  he consisted of a trillion  trillion  trillion ageless bodies  each in its place  each resting quiet and incorruptible  each cared for by perfect automatons  equally incorruptible  while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other  indistinguishable .  man said     the universe is dying .     man looked about at the dimming galaxies .  the giant stars  spendthrifts  were gone long ago  back in the dimmest of the dim far past .  almost all stars were white dwarfs  fading to the end .  new stars had been built of the dust between the stars  some by natural processes  some by man himself  and those were going  too .  white dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released  new stars built  but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed  and those would come to an end  too .  man said     carefully husbanded  as directed by the cosmic ac  the energy that is even yet left in all the universe will last for billions of years .        but even so     said man     eventually it will all come to an end .  however it may be husbanded  however stretched out  the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored .  entropy must increase forever to the maximum .     man said     can entropy not be reversed .  let us ask the cosmic ac .     the cosmic ac surrounded them but not in space .  not a fragment of it was in space .  it was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy .  the question of its size and nature no longer had meaning in any terms that man could comprehend .     cosmic ac     said man     how may entropy be reversed .     the cosmic ac said     there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .     man said     collect additional data .     the cosmic ac said     i will do so .  i have been doing so for a hundred billion years .  my predecessors and i have been asked this question many times .  all the data i have remains insufficient .        will there come a time     said man     when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances .     the cosmic ac said     no problem is insoluble in all conceivable circumstances .     man said     when will you have enough data to answer the question .     the cosmic ac said     there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .        will you keep working on it .     asked man .  the cosmic ac said     i will .     man said     we shall wait .      the stars and galaxies died and snuffed out  and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down .  one by one man fused with ac  each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain .  man   s last mind paused before fusion  looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter  agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out  asymptotically  to the absolute zero .  man said     ac  is this the end .  can this chaos not be reversed into the universe once more .  can that not be done .     ac said     there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer .     man   s last mind fused and only ac existed  and that in hyperspace .   matter and energy had ended and with it space and time .  even ac existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to ac far less than was a man to man .  all other questions had been answered  and until this last question was answered also  ac might not release his consciousness .  all collected data had come to a final end .  nothing was left to be collected .  but all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships .  a timeless interval was spent in doing that .  and it came to pass that ac learned how to reverse the direction of entropy .  but there was now no man to whom ac might give the answer of the last question .  no matter .  the answer  by demonstration  would take care of that  too .  for another timeless interval  ac thought how best to do this .  carefully  ac organized the program .  the consciousness of ac encompassed all of what had once been a universe and brooded over what was now chaos .  step by step  it must be done .  and ac said     let there be light .     and there was light    the dead past  arnold potterley  ph . d .   was a professor of ancient history .  that  in itself  was not dangerous .  what changed the world beyond all dreams was the fact that he looked like a professor of ancient history .  thaddeus araman  department head of the division of chronoscopy  might have taken proper action if dr .  potterley had been owner  . of a large  square chin  flashing eyes  aquiline nose and broad shoulders .  as it was  thaddeus araman found himself staring over his desk at a mild mannered individual  whose faded blue eyes looked at him wistfully from either side of a low bridged button nose  whose small  neatly dressed figure seemed stamped    milk and water    from thinning brown hair to the neatly brushed shoes that completed a conservative middle class costume .  araman said pleasantly     and now what can i do for you  dr .  potterley .     dr .  potterley said in a soft voice that went well with the rest of him     mr .  araman  i came to you because you   re top man in chronoscopy .     araman smiled .     not exactly .  above me is the world commissioner of research and above him is the secretary general of the united nations .  and above both of them  of course  are the sovereign peoples of earth .     dr .  potterley shook his head .     they   re not interested in chronoscopy .  i   ve come to you  sir  because for two years i have been trying to obtain permission to do some time viewing  chronoscopy  that is  in connection with my researches on ancient carthage .  i can   t obtain such permission .  my research grants are all proper .  there is no irregularity in any of my intellectual endeavors and yet         i   m sure there is no question of irregularity     said araman soothingly .  he flipped the thin reproduction sheets in the folder to which potterley   s name had been attached .  they had been produced by multivac  whose vast analogical mind kept all the department records .  when this was over  the sheets could be destroyed  then reproduced on demand in a matter of minutes .  and while araman turned the pages  dr .  potterley   s voice continued in a soft monotone .  the historian was saying     i must explain that my problem is quite an important one .  carthage was ancient commercialism brought to its zenith .  pre roman carthage was the nearest ancient analogue to pre atomic america  at least insofar as its attachment to trade  commerce and business in general was concerned .  they were the most daring seamen and explorers before the vikings  much better at it than the overrated greeks .     to know carthage would be very rewarding  yet the only knowledge we have of it is derived from the writings of its bitter enemies  the greeks and romans .  carthage itself never wrote in its own defense or  if it did  the books did not survive .  as a result  the carthaginians have been one of the favorite sets of villains of history and perhaps unjustly so .  time viewing may set the record straight .     he said much more .  araman said  still turning the reproduction sheets before him     you must realize  dr .  potterley  that chronoscopy  or time viewing  if you prefer  is a difficult process .     dr .  potterley  who had been interrupted  frowned and said     i am asking for only certain selected views at times and places i would indicate .     araman sighed .     even a few views  even one  .  .  .  it is an unbelievably delicate art .  there is the question of focus  getting the proper scene in view and holding it .  there is the synchronization of sound  which calls for completely independent circuits .        surely my problem is important enough to justify considerable effort .        yes  sir .  undoubtedly     said araman at once .  to deny the importance of someone   s research problem would be unforgivably bad manners .     but you must understand how long drawn out even the simplest view is .  and there is a long waiting line for the chronoscope and an even longer waiting line for the use of multivac which guides us in our use of the controls .     potterley stirred unhappily .     but can nothing be done .  for two years         a matter of priority  sir .  i   m sorry .   .   .   .  cigarette .     the historian started back at the suggestion  eyes suddenly widening as he stared at the pack thrust out toward him .  araman looked surprised  withdrew the pack  made a motion as though to take a cigarette for himself and thought better of it .  potterley drew a sigh of unfeigned relief as the pack was put out of sight .  he said     is there any way of reviewing matters  putting me as far forward as possible .  i don   t know how to explain      araman smiled .  some had offered money under similar circumstances which  of course  had gotten them nowhere  either .  he said     the decisions on priority are computer processed .  i could in no way alter those decisions arbitrarily .     potterley rose stiffly to his feet .  he stood five and a half feet tall .     then  good day  sir .        good day  dr .  potterley .  and my sincerest regrets .     he offered his hand and potterley touched it briefly .  the historian left  and a touch of the buzzer brought araman   s secretary into the room .  he handed her the folder .     these     he said     may be disposed of .     alone again  he smiled bitterly .  another item in his quarter century   s service to the human race .  service through negation .  at least this fellow had been easy to dispose of .  sometimes academic pressure had to be applied and even withdrawal of grants .  five minutes later  he had forgotten dr .  potterley .  nor  thinking back on it later  could he remember feeling any premonition of danger .  during the first year of his frustration  arnold potterley had experienced only that  frustration .  during the second year  though  his frustration gave birth to an idea that first frightened and then fascinated him .  two things stopped him from trying to translate the idea into action  and neither barrier was the undoubted fact that his notion was a grossly unethical one .  the first was merely the continuing hope that the government would finally give its permission and make it unnecessary for him to do anything more .  that hope had perished finally in the interview with araman just completed .  the second barrier had been not a hope at all but a dreary realization of his own incapacity .  he was not a physicist and he knew no physicists from whom he might obtain help .  the department of physics at the university consisted of men well stocked with grants and well immersed in specialty .  at best  they would not listen to him .  at worst  they would report him for intellectual anarchy and even his basic carthaginian grant might easily be withdrawn .  that he could not risk .  and yet chronoscopy was the only way to carry on his work .  without it  he would be no worse off if his grant were lost .  the first hint that the second barrier might be overcome had come a week earlier than his interview with araman  and it had gone unrecognized at the time .  it had been at one of the faculty teas .  potterley attended these sessions unfailingly because he conceived attendance to be a duty  and he took his duties seriously .  once there  however  he conceived it to be no responsibility of his to make light conversation or new friends .  he sipped abstemiously at a drink or two  exchanged a polite word with the dean or such department heads as happened to be present  bestowed a narrow smile on others and finally left early .  ordinarily  he would have paid no attention  at that most recent tea  to a young man standing quietly  even diffidently  in one corner .  he would never have dreamed of speaking to him .  yet a tangle of circumstance persuaded him this once to behave in a way contrary to his nature .  that morning at breakfast  mrs .  potterley had announced somberly that once again she had dreamed of laurel  but this time a laurel grown up  yet retaining the three year old face that stamped her as their child .  potterley had let her talk .  there had been a time when he fought her too frequent preoccupation with the past and death .  laurel would not come back to them  either through dreams or through talk .  yet if it appeased caroline potterley  let her dream and talk .  but when potterley went to school that morning  he found himself for once affected by caroline   s inanities .  laurel grown up .  she had died nearly twenty years ago  their only child  then and ever .  in all that time  when he thought of her  it was as a three year old .  now he thought  but if she were alive now  she wouldn   t be three  she   d be nearly twenty three .  helplessly  he found himself trying to think of laurel as growing progressively older  as finally becoming twenty three .  he did not quite succeed .  yet he tried .  laurel using make up .  laurel going out with boys .  laurel   getting married .  so it was that when he saw the young man hovering at the outskirts of the coldly circulating group of faculty men  it occurred to him quixotically that  for all he knew  a youngster just such as this might have married laurel .  that youngster himself  perhaps .   .   .   .  laurel might have met him  here at the university  or some evening when he might be invited to dinner at the potterleys    .  they might grow interested in one another .  laurel would surely have been pretty and this youngster looked well .  he was dark in coloring  with a lean intent face and an easy carriage .  the tenuous daydream snapped  yet potterley found himself staring foolishly at the young man  not as a strange face but as a possible son in law in the might have been .  he found himself threading his way toward the man .  it was almost a form of autohypnotism .  he put out his hand .     i am arnold potterley of the history department .  you   re new here  i think .     the youngster looked faintly astonished and fumbled with his drink  shifting it to his left hand in order to shake with his right .     jonas foster is my name  sir .  i   m a new instructor in physics .  i   m just starting this semester .     potterley nodded .     i wish you a happy stay here and great success .     that was the end of it  then .  potterley had come uneasily to his senses  found himself embarrassed and moved off .  he stared back over his shoulder once  but the illusion of relationship had gone .  reality was quite real once more and he was angry with himself for having fallen prey to his wife   s foolish talk about laurel .  but a week later  even while araman was talking  the thought of that young man had come back to him .  an instructor in physics .  a new instructor .  had he been deaf at the time .  was there a short circuit between ear and brain .  or was it an automatic self censorship because of the impending interview with the head of chronoscopy .  but the interview failed  and it was the thought of the young man with whom he had exchanged two sentences that prevented potterley from elaborating his pleas for consideration .  he was almost anxious to get away .  and in the autogiro express back to the university  he could almost wish he were superstitious .  he could then console himself with the thought that the casual meaningless meeting had really been directed by a knowing and purposeful fate .  jonas foster was not new to academic life .  the long and rickety struggle for the doctorate would make anyone a veteran .  additional work as a postdoctorate teaching fellow acted as a booster shot .  but now he was instructor jonas foster .  professorial dignity lay ahead .  and he now found himself in a new sort of relationship toward other professors .  for one thing  they would be voting on future promotions .  for another  he was in no position to tell so early in the game which particular member of the faculty might or might not have the ear of the dean or even of the university president .  he did not fancy himself as a campus politician and was sure he would make a poor one  yet there was no point in kicking his own rear into blisters just to prove that to himself .  so foster listened to this mild mannered historian who  in some vague way  seemed nevertheless to radiate tension  and did not shut him up abruptly and toss him out .  certainly that was his first impulse .  he remembered potterley well enough .  potterley had approached him at that tea  which had been a grizzly affair  .  the fellow had spoken two sentences to him stiffly  somehow glassy eyed  had then come to himself with a visible start and hurried off .  it had amused foster at the time  but now  .   .   .  potterley might have been deliberately trying to make his acquaintance  or  rather  to impress his own personality on foster as that of a queer sort of duck  eccentric but harmless .  he might now be probing foster   s views  searching for unsettling opinions .  surely  they ought to have done so before granting him his appointment .  still  .   .   .  potterley might be serious  might honestly not realize what he was doing .  or he might realize quite well what he was doing  he might be nothing more or less than a dangerous rascal .  foster mumbled     well  now      to gain time  and fished out a package of cigarettes  intending to offer one to potterley and to light it and one for himself very slowly .  but potterley said at once     please  dr .  foster .  no cigarettes .     foster looked startled .     i   m sorry  sir .        no .  the regrets are mine .  i cannot stand the odor .  an idiosyncrasy .  i   m sorry .     he was positively pale .  foster put away the cigarettes .  foster  feeling the absence of the cigarette  took the easy way out .     i   m flattered that you ask my advice and all that  dr .  potterley  but i   m not a neutrinics man .  i can   t very well do anything professional in that direction .  even stating an opinion would be out of line  and  frankly  i   d prefer that you didn   t go into any particulars .     the historian   s prim face set hard .     what do you mean  you   re not a neutrinics man .  you   re not anything yet .  you haven   t received any grant  have you .        this is only my first semester .        i know that .  i imagine you haven   t even applied for any grant yet .     foster half smiled .  in three months at the university  he had not succeeded in putting his initial requests for research grants into good enough shape to pass on to a professional science writer  let alone to the research commission .   his department head  fortunately  took it quite well .     take your time now  foster     he said     and get your thoughts well organized .  make sure you know your path and where it will lead  for  once you receive a grant  your specialization will be formally recognized and  for better or for worse  it will be yours for the rest of your career .     the advice was trite enough  but triteness has often the merit of truth  and foster recognized that .   foster said     by education and inclination  dr .  potterley  i   m a hyperoptics man with a gravities minor .  it   s how i described myself in applying for this position .  it may not be my official specialization yet  but it   s going to be .  it can   t be anything else .  as for neutrinics  i never even studied the subject .        why not .     demanded potterley at once .  foster stared .  it was the kind of rude curiosity about another man   s professional status that was always irritating .  he said  with the edge of his own politeness just a trifle blunted     a course in neutrinics wasn   t given at my university .        good lord  where did you go .        m . i . t .      said foster quietly .     and they don   t teach neutrinics .        no  they don   t .     foster felt himself flush and was moved to a defense .     it   s a highly specialized subject with no great value .  chronoscopy  perhaps  has some value  but it is the only practical application and that   s a dead end .     the historian stared at him earnestly .     tell me this .  do you know where i can find a neutrinics man .        no  i don   t     said foster bluntly .     well  then  do you know a school which teaches neutrinics .        no  i don   t .     potterley smiled tightly and without humor .  foster resented that smile  found he detected insult in it and grew sufficiently annoyed to say     i would like to point out  sir  that you   re stepping out of line .        what .        i   m saying that  as a historian  your interest in any sort of physics  your professional interest  is      he paused  unable to bring himself quite to say the word .     unethical .        that   s the word  dr .  potterley .        my researches have driven me to it     said potterley in an intense whisper .     the research commission is the place to go .  if they permit         i have gone to them and have received no satisfaction .        then obviously you must abandon this .     foster knew he was sounding stuffily virtuous  but he wasn   t going to let this man lure him into an expression of intellectual anarchy .  it was too early in his career to take stupid risks .  apparently  though  the remark had its effect on potterley .  without any warning  the man exploded into a rapid fire verbal storm of irresponsibility .  scholars  he said  could be free only if they could freely follow their own free swinging curiosity .  research  he said  forced into a predesigned pattern by the powers that held the purse strings became slavish and had to stagnate .  no man  he said  had the right to dictate the intellectual interests of another .  foster listened to all of it with disbelief .  none of it was strange to him .  he had heard college boys talk so in order to shock their professors and he had once or twice amused himself in that fashion  too .  anyone who studied the history of science knew that many men had once thought so .  yet it seemed strange to foster  almost against nature  that a modern man of science could advance such nonsense .  no one would advocate running a factory by allowing each individual worker to do whatever pleased him at the moment  or of running a ship according to the casual and conflicting notions of each individual crewman .  it would be taken for granted that some sort of centralized supervisory agency must exist in each case .  why should direction and order benefit a factory and a ship but not scientific research .  people might say that the human mind was somehow qualitatively different from a ship or factory but the history of intellectual endeavor proved the opposite .  when science was young and the intricacies of all or most of the known was within the grasp of an individual mind  there was no need for direction  perhaps .  blind wandering over the uncharted tracts of ignorance could lead to wonderful finds by accident .  but as knowledge grew  more and more data had to be absorbed before worthwhile journeys into ignorance could be organized .  men had to specialize .  the researcher needed the resources of a library he himself could not gather  then of instruments he himself could not afford .  more and more  the individual researcher gave way to the research team and the research institution .  the funds necessary for research grew greater as tools grew more numerous .  what college was so small today as not to require at least one nuclear micro reactor and at least one three stage computer .  centuries before  private individuals could no longer subsidize research .  by       only the government  large industries and large universities or research institutions could properly subsidize basic research .  by       even the largest universities depended entirely upon government grants  while research institutions could not exist without tax concessions and public subscriptions .  by       the industrial combines had become a branch of the world government and  thereafter  the financing of research and therefore its direction naturally became centralized under a department of the government .  it all worked itself out naturally and well .  every branch of science was fitted neatly to the needs of the public  and the various branches of science were co ordinated decently .  the material advance of the last half century was argument enough for the fact that science was not falling into stagnation .  foster tried to say a very little of this and was waved aside impatiently by potterley who said     you are parroting official propaganda .  you   re sitting in the middle of an example that   s squarely against the official view .  can you believe that .        frankly  no .        well  why do you say time viewing is a dead end .  why is neutrinics unimportant .  you say it is .  you say it categorically .  yet you   ve never studied it .  you claim complete ignorance of the subject .  it   s not even given in your school         isn   t the mere fact that it isn   t given proof enough .        oh  i see .  it   s not given because it   s unimportant .  and it   s unimportant because it   s not given .  are you satisfied with that reasoning .     foster felt a growing confusion .     it   s in the books .        that   s all .  the books say neutrinics is unimportant .  your professors tell you so because they read it in the books .  the books say so because professors write them .  who says it from personal experience and knowledge .  who does research in it .  do you know of anyone .     foster said     i don   t see that we   re getting anywhere  dr .  potterley .  i have work to do         one minute .  i just want you to try this on .  see how it sounds to you .  i say the government is actively suppressing basic research in neutrinics and chronoscopy .  they   re suppressing application of chronoscopy .        oh  no .        why not .  they could do it .  there   s your centrally directed research .  if they refuse grants for research in any portion of science  that portion dies .  they   ve killed neutrinics .  they can do it and have done it .        but why .        i don   t know why .  i want you to find out .  i   d do it myself if i knew enough .  i came to you because you   re a young fellow with a brand new education .  have your intellectual arteries hardened already .  is there no curiosity in you .  don   t you want to know .  don   t you want answers .     the historian was peering intently into foster   s face .  their noses were only inches apart  and foster was so lost that he did not think to draw back .  he should  by rights  have ordered potterley out .  if necessary  he should have thrown potterley out .  it was not respect for age and position that stopped him .  it was certainly not that potterley   s arguments had convinced him .  rather  it was a small point of college pride .  why didn   t m . i . t .  give a course in neutrinics .  for that matter  now that he came to think of it  he doubted that there was a single book on neutrinics in the library .  he could never recall having seen one .  he stopped to think about that .  and that was ruin .  caroline potterley had once been an attractive woman .  there were occasions  such as dinners or university functions  when  by considerable effort  remnants of the attraction could be salvaged .  on ordinary occasions  she sagged .  it was the word she applied to herself in moments of self abhorrence .  she had grown plumper with the years  but the flaccidity about her was not a matter of fat entirely .  it was as though her muscles had given up and grown limp so that she shuffled when she walked  while her eyes grew baggy and her cheeks jowly .  even her graying hair seemed tired rather than merely stringy .  its straightness seemed to be the result of a supine surrender to gravity  nothing else .  caroline potterley looked at herself in the mirror and admitted this was one of her bad days .  she knew the reason  too .  it had been the dream of laurel .  the strange one  with laurel grown up .  she had been wretched ever since .  still  she was sony she had mentioned it to arnold .  he didn   t say anything  he never did any more  but it was bad for him .  he was particularly withdrawn for days afterward .  it might have been that he was getting ready for that important conference with the big government official  he kept saying he expected no success   but it might also have been her dream .  it was better in the old days when he would cry sharply at her     let the dead past go  caroline .  talk won   t bring her back  and dreams won   t either .     it had been bad for both of them .  horribly bad .  she had been away from home and had lived in guilt ever since .  if she had stayed at home  if she had not gone on an unnecessary shopping expedition  there would have been two of them available .  one would have succeeded in saving laurel .  poor arnold had not managed .  heaven knew he tried .  he had nearly died himself .  he had come out of the burning house  staggering in agony  blistered  choking  half blinded  with the dead laurel in his arms .  the nightmare of that lived on  never lifting entirely .  arnold slowly grew a shell about himself afterward .  he cultivated a low voiced mildness through which nothing broke  no lightning struck .  he grew puritanical and even abandoned his minor vices  his cigarettes  his penchant for an occasional profane exclamation .  he obtained his grant for the preparation of a new history of carthage and subordinated everything to that .  she tried to help him .  she hunted up his references  typed his notes and microfilmed them .  then that ended suddenly .  she ran from the desk suddenly one evening  reaching the bathroom in bare time and retching abominably .  her husband followed her in confusion and concern .     caroline  what   s wrong .     it took a drop of brandy to bring her around .  she said     is it true .  what they did .        who did .        the carthaginians .     he stared at her and she got it out by indirection .  she couldn   t say it right out .  the carthaginians  it seemed  worshiped moloch  in the form of a hollow  brazen idol with a furnace in its belly .  at times of national crisis  the priests and the people gathered  and infants  after the proper ceremonies and invocations  were dextrously hurled  alive  into the flames .  they were given sweetmeats just before the crucial moment  in order that the efficacy of the sacrifice not be ruined by displeasing cries of panic .  the drums rolled just after the moment  to drown out the few seconds of infant shrieking .  the parents were present  presumably gratified  for the sacrifice was pleasing to the gods .   .   .   .  arnold potterley frowned darkly .  vicious lies  he told her  on the part of carthage   s enemies .  he should have warned her .  after all  such propagandistic lies were not uncommon .  according to the greeks  the ancient hebrews worshiped an ass   s head in their holy of holies .  according to the romans  the primitive christians were haters of all men who sacrificed pagan children in the catacombs .     then they didn   t do it .     asked caroline .     i   m sure they didn   t .  the primitive phoenicians may have .  human sacrifice is commonplace in primitive cultures .  but carthage in her great days was not a primitive culture .  human sacrifice often gives way to symbolic actions such as circumcision .  the greeks and romans might have mistaken some carthaginian symbolism for the original full rite  either out of ignorance or out of malice .        are you sure .        i can   t be sure yet  caroline  but when i   ve got enough evidence  i   ll apply for permission to use chronoscopy  which will settle the matter once and for all .        chronoscopy .        time viewing .  we can focus on ancient carthage at some time of crisis  the landing of scipio africanus in     b . c .   for instance  and see with our own eyes exactly what happens .  and you   ll see  i   ll be right .     he patted her and smiled encouragingly  but she dreamed of laurel every night for two weeks thereafter and she never helped him with his carthage project again .  nor did he ever ask her to .  but now she was bracing herself for his coming .  he had called her after arriving back in town  told her he had seen the government man and that it had gone as expected .  that meant failure  and yet the little telltale sign of depression had been absent from his voice and his features had appeared quite composed in the teleview .  he had another errand to take care of  he said  before coming home .  it meant he would be late  but that didn   t matter .  neither one of them was particular about eating hours or cared when packages were taken out of the freezer or even which packages or when the selfwarming mechanism was activated .  when he did arrive  he surprised her .  there was nothing untoward about him in any obvious way .  he kissed her dutifully and smiled  took off his hat and asked if all had been well while he was gone .  it was all almost perfectly normal .  almost .  she had learned to detect small things  though  and his pace in all this was a trifle hurried .  enough to show her accustomed eye that he was under tension .  she said     has something happened .     he said     we   re going to have a dinner guest night after next  caroline .  you don   t mind .        well  no .  is it anyone i know .        no .  a young instructor .  a newcomer .  i   ve spoken to him .     he suddenly whirled toward her and seized her arms at the elbow  held them a moment  then dropped them in confusion as though disconcerted at having shown emotion .  he said     i almost didn   t get through to him .  imagine that .  terrible  terrible  the way we have all bent to the yoke  the affection we have for the harness about us .     mrs .  potterley wasn   t sure she understood  but for a year she had been watching him grow quietly more rebellious  little by little more daring in his criticism of the government .  she said     you haven   t spoken foolishly to him  have you .        what do you mean  foolishly .  he   ll be doing some neutrinics for me .        neutrinics    was trisyllabic nonsense to mrs .  potterley  but she knew it had nothing to do with history .  she said faintly     arnold  i don   t like you to do that .  you   ll lose your position .  it   s         it   s intellectual anarchy  my dear     he said .     that   s the phrase you want .  very well .  i am an anarchist .  if the government will not allow me to push my researches  i will push them on my own .  and when i show the way  others will follow .   .   .   .  and if they don   t  it makes no difference .  it   s carthage that counts and human knowledge  not you and i .        but you don   t know this young man .  what if he is an agent for the commission of research .        not likely and i   ll take that chance .     he made a fist of his right hand and rubbed it gently against the palm of his left .     he   s on my side now .  i   m sure of it .  he can   t help but be .  i can recognize intellectual curiosity when i see it in a man   s eyes and face and attitude  and it   s a fatal disease for a tame scientist .  even today it takes time to beat it out of a man and the young ones are vulnerable .   .   .   .  oh  why stop at anything .  why not build our own chronoscope and tell the government to go to      he stopped abruptly  shook his head and turned away .     i hope everything will be all right     said mrs .  potterley  feeling helplessly certain that everything would not be  and frightened  in advance  for her husband   s professorial status and the security of their old age .  it was she alone  of them all  who had a violent presentiment of trouble .  quite the wrong trouble  of course .  jonas foster was nearly half an hour late in arriving at the potterleys    off campus house .  up to that very evening  he had not quite decided he would go .  then  at the last moment  he found he could not bring himself to commit the social enormity of breaking a dinner appointment an hour before the appointed time .  that  and the nagging of curiosity .  the dinner itself passed interminably .  foster ate without appetite .  mrs .  potterley sat in distant absent mindedness  emerging out of it only once to ask if he were married and to make a deprecating sound at the news that he was not .  dr .  potterley himself asked neutrally after his professional history and nodded his head primly .  it was as staid  stodgy  boring  actually  as anything could be .  foster thought  he seems so harmless .  foster had spent the last two days reading up on dr .  potterley .  very casually  of course  almost sneakily .  he wasn   t particularly anxious to be seen in the social science library .  to be sure  history was one of those borderline affairs and historical works were frequently read for amusement or edification by the general public .  still  a physicist wasn   t quite the    general public .     let foster take to reading histories and he would be considered queer  sure as relativity  and after a while the head of the department would wonder if his new instructor were really    the man for the job .     so he had been cautious .  he sat in the more secluded alcoves and kept his head bent when he slipped in and out at odd hours .  dr .  potterley  it turned out  had written three books and some dozen articles on the ancient mediterranean worlds  and the later articles  all in    historical reviews     had all dealt with pre roman carthage from a sympathetic viewpoint .  that  at least  checked with potterley   s story and had soothed foster   s suspicions somewhat .   .   .   .  and yet foster felt that it would have been much wiser  much safer  to have scotched the matter at the beginning .  a scientist shouldn   t be too curious  he thought in bitter dissatisfaction with himself .  it   s a dangerous trait .  after dinner  he was ushered into potterley   s study and he was brought up sharply at the threshold .  the walls were simply lined with books .  not merely films .  there were films  of course  but these were far outnumbered by the books  print on paper .  he wouldn   t have thought so many books would exist in usable condition .  that bothered foster .  why should anyone want to keep so many books at home .  surely all were available in the university library  or  at the very worst  at the library of congress  if one wished to take the minor trouble of checking out a microfilm .  there was an element of secrecy involved in a home library .  it breathed of intellectual anarchy .  that last thought  oddly  calmed foster .  he would rather potterley be an authentic anarchist than a play acting agent provocateur .  and now the hours began to pass quickly and astonishingly .     you see     potterley said  in a clear  unflurried voice     it was a matter of finding  if possible  anyone who had ever used chronoscopy in his work .  naturally    couldn   t ask baldly  since that would be unauthorized research .        yes     said foster dryly .  he was a little surprised such a small consideration would stop the man .     i used indirect methods      he had .  foster was amazed at the volume of correspondence dealing with small disputed points of ancient mediterranean culture which somehow managed to elicit the casual remark over and over again     of course  having never made use of chronoscopy      or     pending approval of my request for chronoscopic data  which appear unlikely at the moment         now these aren   t blind questionings     said potterley .     there   s a monthly booklet put out by the institute for chronoscopy in which items concerning the past as determined by time viewing are printed .  just one or two items .     what impressed me first was the triviality of most of the items  their insipidity .  why should such researches get priority over my work .  so i wrote to people who would be most likely to do research in the directions described in the booklet .  uniformly  as i have shown you  they did not make use of the chronoscope .  now let   s go over it point by point .     at last foster  his head swimming with potterley   s meticulously gathered details  asked     but why .        i don   t know why     said potterley     but i have a theory .  the original invention of the chronoscope was by sterbinski  you see  i know that much   and it was well publicized .  but then the government took over the instrument and decided to suppress further research in the matter or any use of the machine .  but then  people might be curious as to why it wasn   t being used .  curiosity is such a vice  dr .  foster .     yes  agreed the physicist to himself .     imagine the effectiveness  then     potterley went on     of pretending that the chronoscope was being used .  it would then be not a mystery  but a commonplace .  it would no longer be a fitting object for legitimate curiosity or an attractive one for illicit curiosity .        you were curious     pointed out foster .  potterley looked a trifle restless .     it was different in my case     he said angrily .     i have something that must be done  and i wouldn   t submit to the ridiculous way in which they kept putting me off .     a bit paranoid  too  thought foster gloomily .  yet he had ended up with something  paranoid or not .  foster could no longer deny that something peculiar was going on in the matter of neutrinics .  but what was potterley after .  that still bothered foster .  if potterley didn   t intend this as a test of foster   s ethics  what did he want .  foster put it to himself logically .  if an intellectual anarchist with a touch of paranoia wanted to use a chronoscope and was convinced that the powers that be were deliberately standing in his way  what would he do .  supposing it were i  he thought .  what would i do .  he said slowly     maybe the chronoscope doesn   t exist at all .     potterley started .  there was almost a crack in his general calmness .  for an instant  foster found himself catching a glimpse of something not at all calm .  but the historian kept his balance and said     oh  no  there must be a chronoscope .        why .  have you seen it .  have i .  maybe that   s the explanation of everything .  maybe they   re not deliberately holding out on a chronoscope they   ve got .  maybe they haven   t got it in the first place .        but sterbinski lived .  he built a chronoscope .  that much is a fact .        the books say so     said foster coldly .     now listen .     potterley actually reached over and snatched at foster   s jacket sleeve .     i need the chronoscope .  i must have it .  don   t tell me it doesn   t exist .  what we   re going to do is find out enough about neutrinics to be able to      potterley drew himself up short .  foster drew his sleeve away .  he needed no ending to that sentence .  he supplied it himself .  he said     build one of our own .     potterley looked sour as though he would rather not have said it point blank .  nevertheless  he said     why not .        because that   s out of the question     said foster .     if what i   ve read is correct  then it took sterbinski twenty years to build his machine and several millions in composite grants .  do you think you and i can duplicate that illegally .  suppose we had the time  which we haven   t  and suppose i could learn enough out of books  which i doubt  where would we get the money and equipment .  the chronoscope is supposed to fill a five story building  for heaven   s sake .        then you won   t help me .        well  i   ll tell you what .  i have one way in which i may be able to find out something         what is that .     asked potterley at once .     never mind .  that   s not important .  but i may be able to find out enough to tell you whether the government is deliberately suppressing research by chronoscope .  i may confirm the evidence you already have or i may be able to prove that your evidence is misleading .  i don   t know what good it will do you in either case  but it   s as far as i can go .  it   s my limit .     potterley watched the young man go finally .  he was angry with himself .  why had he allowed himself to grow so careless as to permit the fellow to guess that he was thinking in terms of a chronoscope of his own .  that was premature .  but then why did the young fool have to suppose that a chronoscope might not exist at all .  it had to exist .  it had to .  what was the use of saying it didn   t .  and why couldn   t a second one be built .  science had advanced in the fifty years since sterbinski .  all that was needed was knowledge .  let the youngster gather knowledge .  let him think a small gathering would be his limit .  having taken the path to anarchy  there would be no limit .  if the boy were not driven onward by something in himself  the first steps would be error enough to force the rest .  potterley was quite certain he would not hesitate to use blackmail .  potterley waved a last good by and looked up .  it was beginning to rain .  certainly .  blackmail if necessary  but he would not be stopped .  foster steered his car across the bleak outskirts of town and scarcely noticed the rain .  he was a fool  he told himself  but he couldn   t leave things as they were .  he had to know .  he damned his streak of undisciplined curiosity  but he had to know .  but he would go no further than uncle ralph .  he swore mightily to himself that it would stop there .  in that way  there would be no evidence against him  no real evidence .  uncle ralph would be discreet .  in a way  he was secretly ashamed of uncle ralph .  he hadn   t mentioned him to potterley partly out of caution and partly because he did not wish to witness the lifted eyebrow  the inevitable half smile .  professional science writers  however useful  were a little outside the pale  fit only for patronizing contempt .  the fact that  as a class  they made more money than did research scientists only made matters worse  of course .  still  there were times when a science writer in the family could be a convenience .  not being really educated  they did not have to specialize .  consequently  a good science writer knew practically everything .   .   .   .  and uncle ralph was one of the best .  ralph nimmo had no college degree and was rather proud of it .     a degree     he once said to jonas foster  when both were considerably younger     is a first step down a ruinous highway .  you don   t want to waste it so you go on to graduate work and doctoral research .  you end up a thoroughgoing ignoramus on everything in the world except for one subdivisional sliver of nothing .     on the other hand  if you guard your mind carefully and keep it blank of any clutter of information till maturity is reached  filling it only with intelligence and training it only in clear thinking  you then have a powerful instrument at your disposal and you can become a science writer .     nimmo received his first assignment at the age of twenty five  after he had completed his apprenticeship and been out in the field for less than three months .  it came in the shape of a clotted manuscript whose language would impart no glimmering of understanding to any reader  however qualified  without careful study and some inspired guesswork .  nimmo took it apart and put it together again  after five long and exasperating interviews with the authors  who were biophysicists   making the language taut and meaningful and smoothing the style to a pleasant gloss .     why not .     he would say tolerantly to his nephew  who countered his strictures on degrees by berating him with his readiness to hang on the fringes of science .     the fringe is important .  your scientists can   t write .  why should they be expected to .  they aren   t expected to be grand masters at chess or virtuosos at the violin  so why expect them to know how to put words together .  why not leave that for specialists  too .        good lord  jonas  read your literature of a hundred years ago .  discount the fact that the science is out of date and that some of the expressions are out of date .  just try to read it and make sense out of it .  it   s just jaw cracking  amateurish .  pages are published uselessly  whole articles which are either noncomprehensible or both .        but you don   t get recognition  uncle ralph     protested young foster  who was getting ready to start his college career and was rather starry eyed about it .     you could be a terrific researcher .        i get recognition     said nimmo .     don   t think for a minute i don   t .  sure  a biochemist or a strato meteorologist won   t give me the time of day  but they pay me well enough .  just find out what happens when some first class   chemist finds the commission has cut his year   s allowance for science writing .  he   ll fight harder for enough funds to afford me  or someone like me    than to get a recording ionograph .     he grinned broadly and foster grinned back .  actually  he was proud of his paunchy  round faced  stub fingered uncle  whose vanity made him brush his fringe of hair futilely over the desert on his pate and made him dress like an unmade haystack because such negligence was his trademark .  ashamed  but proud  too .  and now foster entered his uncle   s cluttered apartment in no mood at all for grinning .  he was nine years older now and so was uncle ralph .  for nine more years  papers in every branch of science had come to him for polishing and a little of each had crept into his capacious mind .  nimmo was eating seedless grapes  popping them into his mouth one at a time .  he tossed a bunch to foster who caught them by a hair  then bent to retrieve individual grapes that had torn loose and fallen to the floor .     let them be .  don   t bother     said nimmo carelessly .     someone comes in here to clean once a week .  what   s up .  having trouble with your grant application write up .        i haven   t really got into that yet .        you haven   t .  get a move on  boy .  are you waiting for me to offer to do the final arrangement .        i couldn   t afford you  uncle .        aw  come on .  it   s all in the family .  grant me all popular publication rights and no cash need change hands .     foster nodded .     if you   re serious  it   s a deal .        it   s a deal .     it was a gamble  of course  but foster knew enough of nimmo   s science writing to realize it could pay off .  some dramatic discovery of public interest on primitive man or on a new surgical technique  or on any branch of spationautics could mean a very cash attracting article in any of the mass media of communication .  it was nimmo  for instance  who had written up  for scientific consumption  the series of papers by bryce and co workers that elucidated the fine structure of two cancer viruses  for which job he asked the picayune payment of fifteen hundred dollars  provided popular publication rights were included .  he then wrote up  exclusively  the same work in semidramatic form for use in trimensional video for a twenty thousand dollar advance plus rental royalties that were still coming in after five years .  foster said bluntly     what do you know about neutrinics  uncle .        neutrinics .     nimmo   s small eyes looked surprised .     are you working in that .  i thought it was pseudo gravitic optics .        it is p . g . o .  i just happen to be asking about neutrinics .        that   s a devil of a thing to be doing .  you   re stepping out of line .  you know that  don   t you .        i don   t expect you to call the commission because i   m a little curious about things .        maybe i should before you get into trouble .  curiosity is an occupational danger with scientists .  i   ve watched it work .  one of them will be moving quietly along on a problem  then curiosity leads him up a strange creek .  next thing you know they   ve done so little on their proper problem  they can   t justify for a project renewal .  i   ve seen more         all i want to know     said foster patiently     is what   s been passing through your hands lately on neutrinics .     nimmo leaned back  chewing at a grape thoughtfully .     nothing .  nothing ever .  i don   t recall ever getting a paper on neutrinics .        what .     foster was openly astonished .     then who does get the work .        now that you ask     said nimmo     i don   t know .  don   t recall anyone talking about it at the annual conventions .  i don   t think much work is being done there .        why not .        hey  there  don   t bark .  i   m not doing anything .  my guess would be      foster was exasperated .     don   t you know .        hmp .  i   ll tell you what i know about neutrinics .  it concerns the applications of neutrino movements and the forces involved         sure .  sure .  just as electronics deals with the applications of electron movements and the forces involved  and pseudo gravities deals with the applications of artificial gravitational fields .  i didn   t come to you for that .  is that all you know .        and     said nimmo with equanimity     neutrinics is the basis of time viewing and that is all i know .     foster slouched back in his chair and massaged one lean cheek with great intensity .  he felt angrily dissatisfied .  without formulating it explicitly in his own mind  he had felt sure  somehow  that nimmo would come up with some late reports  bring up interesting facets of modern neutrinics  send him back to potterley able to say that the elderly historian was mistaken  that his data was misleading  his deductions mistaken .  then he could have returned to his proper work .  but now  .   .   .  he told himself angrily  so they   re not doing much work in the field .  does that make it deliberate suppression .  what if neutrinics is a sterile discipline .  maybe it is .  i don   t know .  potterley doesn   t .  why waste the intellectual resources of humanity on nothing .  or the work might be secret for some legitimate reason .  it might be  .  .  .  the trouble was  he had to know .  he couldn   t leave things as they were now .  he couldn   t .  he said     is there a text on neutrinics  uncle ralph .  i mean a clear and simple one .  an elementary one .     nimmo thought  his plump cheeks puffing out with a series of sighs .     you ask the damnedest questions .  the only one i ever heard of was sterbinski and somebody .  i   ve never seen it  but i viewed something about it once .   .   .   .  sterbinski and lamarr  that   s it .        is that the sterbinski who invented the chronoscope .     i    i think so .  proves the book ought to be good .            is there a recent edition .  sterbinski died thirty years ago .     nimmo shrugged and said nothing .     can you find out .     they sat in silence for a moment  while nimmo shifted his bulk to the creaking tune of the chair he sat on .  then the science writer said     are you going to tell me what this is all about .        i can   t .  will you help me anyway  uncle ralph .  will you get me a copy of the text .        well  you   ve taught me all i know on pseudo gravities .  i should be grateful .  tell you what  i   ll help you on one condition .        which is .     the older man was suddenly very grave .     that you be careful  jonas .  you   re obviously way out of line whatever you   re doing .  don   t blow up your career just because you   re curious about something you haven   t been assigned to and which is none of your business .  understand .     foster nodded  but he hardly heard .  he was thinking furiously .  a full week later  ralph nimmo eased his rotund figure into jonas foster   s on campus two room combination and said  in a hoarse whisper     i   ve got something .        what .     foster was immediately eager .     a copy of sterbinski and lamarr .     he produced it  or rather a corner of it  from his ample topcoat .  foster almost automatically eyed door and windows to make sure they were closed and shaded respectively  then held out his hand .  the film case was flaking with age  and when he cracked it the film was faded and growing brittle .  he said sharply     is this all .        gratitude  my boy  gratitude .     nimmo sat down with a grunt  and reached into a pocket for an apple .     oh  i   m grateful  but it   s so old .        and lucky to get it at that .    tried to get a film run from the congressional library .  no go .  the book was restricted .        then how did you get this .        stole it .     he was biting crunchingly around the core .     new york public .        what .        simple enough .  i had access to the stacks  naturally .  so i stepped over a chained railing when no one was around  dug this up  and walked out with it .  they   re very trusting out there .  meanwhile  they won   t miss it in years .   .   .   .  only you   d better not let anyone see it on you  nephew .     foster stared at the film as though it were literally hot .  nimmo discarded the core and reached for a second apple .     funny thing  now .  there   s nothing more recent in the whole field of neutrinics .  not a monograph  not a paper  not a progress note .  nothing since the chrono scope .        uh huh     said foster absently .  foster worked evenings in the potterley home .  he could not trust his own on campus rooms for the purpose .  the evening work grew more real to him than his own grant applications .  sometimes he worried about it but then that stopped  too .  his work consisted  at first  simply in viewing and reviewing the text film .  later it consisted in thinking  sometimes while a section of the book ran itself off through the pocket projector  disregarded  .  sometimes potterley would come down to watch  to sit with prim  eager eyes  as though he expected thought processes to solidify and become visible in all their convolutions .  he interfered in only two ways .  he did not allow foster to smoke and sometimes he talked .  it wasn   t conversation talk  never that .  rather it was a low voiced monologue with which  it seemed  he scarcely expected to command attention .  it was much more as though he were relieving a pressure within himself .  carthage .  always carthage .  carthage  the new york of the ancient mediterranean .  carthage  commercial empire and queen of the seas .  carthage  all that syracuse and alexandria pretended to be .  carthage  maligned by her enemies and inarticulate in her own defense .  she had been defeated once by rome and then driven out of sicily and sardinia  but came back to more than recoup her losses by new dominions in spain  and raised up hannibal to give the romans sixteen years of terror .  in the end  she lost again a second time  reconciled herself to fate and built again with broken tools a limping life in shrunken territory  succeeding so well that jealous rome deliberately forced a third war .  and then carthage  with nothing but bare hands and tenacity  built weapons and forced rome into a two year war that ended only with complete destruction of the city  the inhabitants throwing themselves into their flaming houses rather than surrender .     could people fight so for a city and a way of life as bad as the ancient writers painted it .  hannibal was a better general than any roman and his soldiers were absolutely faithful to him .  even his bitterest enemies praised him .  there was a carthaginian .  it is fashionable to say that he was an atypical carthaginian  better than the others  a diamond placed in garbage .  but then why was he so faithful to carthage  even to his death after years of exile .  they talk of moloch      foster didn   t always listen but sometimes he couldn   t help himself and he shuddered and turned sick at the bloody tale of child sacrifice .  but potterley went on earnestly     just the same  it isn   t true .  it   s a twenty five hundred year old canard started by the greeks and romans .  they had their own slaves  their crucifixions and torture  their gladiatorial contests .  they weren   t holy .  the moloch story is what later ages would have called war propaganda  the big lie .  i can prove it was a lie .  i can prove it and  by heaven  i will  i will      he would mumble that promise over and over again in his earnestness .  mrs .  potterley visited him also  but less frequently  usually on tuesdays and thursdays when dr .  potterley himself had an evening course to take care of and was not present .  she would sit quietly  scarcely talking  face slack and doughy  eyes blank  her whole attitude distant and withdrawn .  the first time  foster tried  uneasily  to suggest that she leave .  she said tonelessly     do i disturb you .        no  of course not     lied foster restlessly .     it   s just that  that      he couldn   t complete the sentence .  she nodded  as though accepting an invitation to stay .  then she opened a cloth bag she had brought with her and took out a quire of vitron sheets which she proceeded to weave together by rapid  delicate movements of a pair of slender  tetra faceted depolarizers  whose battery fed wires made her look as though she were holding a large spider .  one evening  she said softly     my daughter  laurel  is your age .     foster started  as much at the sudden unexpected sound of speech as at the words .  he said     i didn   t know you had a daughter  mrs .  potterley .        she died .  years ago .     the vitron grew under the deft manipulations into the uneven shape of some garment foster could not yet identify .  there was nothing left for him to do but mutter inanely     i   m sorry .     mrs .  potterley sighed .     i dream about her often .     she raised her blue  distant eyes to him .  foster winced and looked away .  another evening she asked  pulling at one of the vitron sheets to loosen its gentle clinging to her dress     what is time viewing anyway .     that remark broke into a particularly involved chain of thought  and foster said snappishly     dr .  potterley can explain .        he   s tried to .  oh  my  yes .  but i think he   s a little impatient with me .  he calls it chronoscopy most of the time .  do you actually see things in the past  like the trimensionals .  or does it just make little dot patterns like the computer you use .     foster stared at his hand computer with distaste .  it worked well enough  but every operation had to be manually controlled and the answers were obtained in code .  now if he could use the school computer  .   .   .  well  why dream  he felt conspicuous enough  as it was  carrying a hand computer under his arm every evening as he left his office .  he said     i   ve never seen the chronoscope myself  but i   m under the impression that you actually see pictures and hear sound .        you can hear people talk  too .        i think so .     then  half in desperation     look here  mrs .  potterley  this must be awfully dull for you .  i realize you don   t like to leave a guest all to himself  but really  mrs .  potterley  you mustn   t feel compelled         i don   t feel compelled     she said .     i   m sitting here  waiting .        waiting .  for what .     she said composedly     i listened to you that first evening .  the time you first spoke to arnold .  i listened at the door .     he said     you did .        i know i shouldn   t have  but i was awfully worried about arnold .  i had a notion he was going to do something he oughtn   t and i wanted to hear what .  and then when i heard      she paused  bending close over the vitron and peering at it .     heard what  mrs .  potterley .        that you wouldn   t build a chronoscope .        well  of course not .        i thought maybe you might change your mind .     foster glared at her .     do you mean you   re coming down here hoping i   ll build a chronoscope  waiting for me to build one .     i    i hope you do  dr .  foster .  oh  i hope you do .     it was as though  all at once  a fuzzy veil had fallen off her face  leaving all her features clear and sharp  putting color into her cheeks  life into her eyes  the vibrations of something approaching excitement into her voice .     wouldn   t it be wonderful     she whispered     to have one .  people of the past could live again .  pharaohs and kings and  just people .  i hope you build one  dr .  foster .  i really  hope      she choked  it seemed  on the intensity of her own words and let the vitron sheets slip off her lap .  she rose and ran up the basement stairs  while foster   s eyes followed her awkwardly fleeing body with astonishment and distress .  it cut deeper into foster   s nights and left him sleepless and painfully stiff with thought .  it was almost a mental indigestion .  his grant requests went limping in  finally  to ralph nimmo .  he scarcely had any hope for them .  he thought numbly  they won   t be approved .  if they weren   t  of course  it would create a scandal in the department and probably mean his appointment at the university would not be renewed  come the end of the academic year .  he scarcely worried .  it was the neutrino  the neutrino  only the neutrino .  its trail curved and veered sharply and led him breathlessly along uncharted pathways that even sterbinski and lamarr did not follow .  he called nimmo .     uncle ralph  i need a few things .  i   m calling from off the campus .     nimmo   s face in the video plate was jovial  but his voice was sharp .  he said     what you need is a course in communication .  i   m having a hell of a time pulling your application into one intelligible piece .  if that   s what you   re calling about      foster shook his head impatiently .     that   s not what i   m calling about .  i need these .     he scribbled quickly on a piece of paper and held it up before the receiver .  nimmo yiped .     hey  how many tricks do you think i can wangle .        you can get them  uncle .  you know you can .     nimmo reread the list of items with silent motions of his plump lips and looked grave .     what happens when you put those things together .     he asked .  foster shook his head .     you   ll have exclusive popular publication rights to whatever turns up  the way it   s always been .  but please don   t ask any questions now .        i can   t do miracles  you know .        do this one .  you   ve got to .  you   re a science writer  not a research man .  you don   t have to account for anything .  you   ve got friends and connections .  they can look the other way  can   t they  to get a break from you next publication time .        your faith  nephew  is touching .  i   ll try .     nimmo succeeded .  the material and equipment were brought over late one evening in a private touring car .  nimmo and foster lugged it in with the grunting of men unused to manual labor .  potterley stood at the entrance of the basement after nimmo had left .  he asked softly     what   s this for .     foster brushed the hair off his forehead and gently massaged a sprained wrist .  he said     i want to conduct a few simple experiments .        really .     the historian   s eyes glittered with excitement .  foster felt exploited .  he felt as though he were being led along a dangerous highway by the pull of pinching fingers on his nose  as though he could see the ruin clearly that lay in wait at the end of the path  yet walked eagerly and determinedly .  worst of all  he felt the compelling grip on his nose to be his own .  it was potterley who began it  potterley who stood there now  gloating  but the compulsion was his own .  foster said sourly     i   ll be wanting privacy now  potterley .  i can   t have you and your wife running down here and annoying me .     he thought  if that offends him  let him kick me out .  let him put an end to this .  in his heart  though  he did not think being evicted would stop anything .  but it did not come to that .  potterley was showing no signs of offense .  his mild gaze was unchanged .  he said     of course  dr .  foster  of course .  all the privacy you wish .     foster watched him go .  he was left still marching along the highway  perversely glad of it and hating himself for being glad .  he took to sleeping over on a cot in potterley   s basement and spending his weekends there entirely .  during that period  preliminary word came through that his grants  as doctored by nimmo  had been approved .  the department head brought the word and congratulated him .  foster stared back distantly and mumbled     good .  i   m glad     with so little conviction that the other frowned and turned away without another word .  foster gave the matter no further thought .  it was a minor point  worth no notice .  he was planning something that really counted  a climactic test for that evening .  one evening  a second and third and then  haggard and half beside himself with excitement  he called in potterley .  potterley came down the stairs and looked about at the homemade gadgetry .  he said  in his soft voice     the electric bills are quite high .  i don   t mind the expense  but the city may ask questions .  can anything be done .     it was a warm evening  but potterley wore a tight collar and a semijacket .  foster  who was in his undershirt  lifted bleary eyes and said shakily     it won   t be for much longer  dr .  potterley .  i   ve called you down to tell you something .  a chronoscope can be built .  a small one  of course  but it can be built .     potterley seized the railing .  his body sagged .  he managed a whisper .     can it be built here .        here in the basement     said foster wearily .     good lord .  you said         i know what i said     cried foster impatiently .     i said it couldn   t be done .  i didn   t know anything then .  even sterbinski didn   t know anything .     potterley shook his head .     are you sure .  you   re not mistaken  dr .  foster .  i couldn   t endure it if      foster said     i   m not mistaken .  damn it  sir  if just theory had been enough  we could have had a time viewer over a hundred years ago  when the neutrino was first postulated .  the trouble was  the original investigators considered it only a mysterious particle without mass or charge that could not be detected .  it was just something to even up the bookkeeping and save the law of conservation of mass energy .     he wasn   t sure potterley knew what he was talking about .  he didn   t care .  he needed a breather .  he had to get some of this out of his clotting thoughts .   .   .   .  and he needed background for what he would have to tell potterley next .  he went on .     it was sterbinski who first discovered that the neutrino broke through the space time cross sectional barrier  that it traveled through time as well as through space .  it was sterbinski who first devised a method for stopping neutrinos .  he invented a neutrino recorder and learned how to interpret the pattern of the neutrino stream .  naturally  the stream had been affected and deflected by all the matter it had passed through in its passage through time  and the deflections could be analyzed and converted into the images of the matter that had done the deflecting .  time viewing was possible .  even air vibrations could be detected in this way and converted into sound .     potterley was definitely not listening .  he said     yes .  yes .  but when can you build a chronoscope .     foster said urgently     let me finish .  everything depends on the method used to detect and analyze the neutrino stream .  sterbinski   s method was difficult and roundabout .  it required mountains of energy .  but i   ve studied pseudo gravities  dr .  potterley  the science of artificial gravitational fields .  i   ve specialized in the behavior of light in such fields .  it   s a new science .  sterbinski knew nothing of it .  if he had  he would have seen  anyone would have  a much better and more efficient method of detecting neutrinos using a pseudo gravitic field .  if i had known more neutrinics to begin with  i would have seen it at once .     potterley brightened a bit .     i knew it     he said .     even if they stop research in neutrinics there is no way the government can be sure that discoveries in other segments of science won   t reflect knowledge on neutrinics .  so much for the value of centralized direction of science .    thought this long ago  dr .  foster  before you ever came to work here .        i congratulate you on that     said foster     but there   s one thing         oh  never mind all this .  answer me .  please .  when can you build a chronoscope .        i   m trying to tell you something  dr .  potterley .  a chronoscope won   t do you any good .      this is it  foster thought .   slowly  potterley descended the stairs .  he stood facing foster .     what do you mean .  why won   t it help me .        you won   t see carthage .  it   s what i   ve got to tell you .  it   s what i   ve been leading up to .  you can never see carthage .     potterley shook his head slightly .     oh  no  you   re wrong .  if you have the chronoscope  just focus it properly         no  dr .  potterley .  it   s not a question of focus .  there are random factors affecting the neutrino stream  as they affect all subatomic particles .  what we call the uncertainty principle .  when the stream is recorded and interpreted  the random factor comes out as fuzziness  or    noise    as the communications boys speak of it .  the further back in time you penetrate  the more pronounced the fuzziness  the greater the noise .  after a while  the noise drowns out the picture .  do you understand .        more power     said potterley in a dead kind of voice .     that won   t help .  when the noise blurs out detail  magnifying detail magnifies the noise  too .  you can   t see anything in a sun burned film by enlarging it  can you .  get this through your head  now .  the physical nature of the universe sets limits .  the random thermal motions of air molecules set limits to how weak a sound can be detected by any instrument .  the length of a light wave or of an electron wave sets limits to the size of objects that can be seen by any instrument .  it works that way in chronoscopy  too .  you can only time view so far .        how far .  how far .     foster took a deep breath .     a century and a quarter .  that   s the most .        but the monthly bulletin the commission puts out deals with ancient history almost entirely .     the historian laughed shakily .     you must be wrong .  the government has data as far back as      b . c .        when did you switch to believing them .     demanded foster  scornfully .     you began this business by proving they were lying  that no historian had made use of the chronoscope .  don   t you see why now .  no historian  except one interested in contemporary history  could .  no chronoscope can possibly see back in time further than      under any conditions .        you   re wrong .  you don   t know everything     said potterley .     the truth won   t bend itself to your convenience either .  face it .  the government   s part in this is to perpetuate a hoax .        why .        i don   t know why .     potterley   s snubby nose was twitching .  his eyes were bulging .  he pleaded     it   s only theory  dr .  foster .  build a chronoscope .  build one and try .     foster caught potterley   s shoulders in a sudden  fierce grip .     do you think i haven   t .  do you think i would tell you this before i had checked it every way i knew .  i have built one .  it   s all around you .  look .     he ran to the switches at the power leads .  he flicked them on  one by one .  he turned a resistor  adjusted other knobs  put out the cellar lights .     wait .  let it warm up .     there was a small glow near the center of one wall .  potterley was gibbering incoherently  but foster only cried again     look .     the light sharpened and brightened  broke up into a light and dark pattern .  men and women .  fuzzy .  features blurred .  arms and legs mere streaks .  an old fashioned ground car  unclear but recognizable as one of the kind that had once used gasoline powered internal combustion engines  sped by .  foster said     mid twentieth century  somewhere .  i can   t hook up an audio yet so this is soundless .  eventually  we can add sound .  anyway  mid twentieth is almost as far back as you can go .  believe me  that   s the best focusing that can be done .     potterley said     build a larger machine  a stronger one .  improve your circuits .        you can   t lick the uncertainty principle  man  any more than you can live on the sun .  there are physical limits to what can be done .        you   re lying .  i won   t believe you .  i      a new voice sounded  raised shrilly to make itself heard .     arnold .  dr .  foster .     the young physicist turned at once .  dr .  potterley froze for a long moment  then said  without turning     what is it  caroline .  leave us .        no .     mrs .  potterley descended the stairs .     i heard .  i couldn   t help hearing .  do you have a time viewer here  dr .  foster .  here in the basement .        yes  i do  mrs .  potterley .  a kind of time viewer .  not a good one .  i can   t get sound yet and the picture is darned blurry  but it works .     mrs .  potterley clasped her hands and held them tightly against her breast .     how wonderful .  how wonderful .        it   s not at all wonderful     snapped potterley .     the young fool can   t reach further back than         now  look     began foster in exasperation .   .   .   .     please .     cried mrs .  potterley .     listen to me .  arnold  don   t you see that as long as we can use it for twenty years back  we can see laurel once again .  what do we care about carthage and ancient times .  it   s laurel we can see .  she   ll be alive for us again .  leave the machine here  dr .  foster .  show us how to work it .     foster stared at her then at her husband .  dr .  potterley   s face had gone white .  though his voice stayed low and even  its calmness was somehow gone .  he said     you   re a fool .     caroline said weakly     arnold .        you   re a fool  i say .  what will you see .  the past .  the dead past .  will laurel do one thing she did not do .  will you see one thing you haven   t seen .  will you live three years over and over again  watching a baby who   ll never grow up no matter how you watch .     his voice came near to cracking  but held .  he stopped closer to her  seized her shoulder and shook her roughly .     do you know what will happen to you if you do that .  they   ll come to take you away because you   ll go mad .  yes  mad .  do you want mental treatment .  do you want to be shut up  to undergo the psychic probe .     mrs .  potterley tore away .  there was no trace of softness or vagueness about her .  she had twisted into a virago .     i want to see my child  arnold .  she   s in that machine and i want her .        she   s not in the machine .  an image is .  can   t you understand .  an image .  something that   s not real .        i want my child .  do you hear me .     she flew at him  screaming  fists beating .     i want my child .     the historian retreated at the fury of the assault  crying out .  foster moved to step between  when mrs .  potterley dropped  sobbing wildly  to the floor .  potterley turned  eyes desperately seeking .  with a sudden heave  he snatched at a lando rod  tearing it from its support  and whirling away before foster  numbed by all that was taking place  could move to stop him .     stand back .     gasped potterley     or i   ll kill you .  i swear it .     he swung with force  and foster jumped back .  potterley turned with fury on every part of the structure in the cellar  and foster  after the first crash of glass  watched dazedly .  potterley spent his rage and then he was standing quietly amid shards and splinters  with a broken lando rod in his hand .  he said to foster in a whisper     now get out of here .  never come back .  if any of this cost you anything  send me a bill and i   ll pay for it .  i   ll pay double .     foster shrugged  picked up his shirt and moved up the basement stairs .  he could hear mrs .  potterley sobbing loudly  and  as he turned at the head of the stairs for a last look  he saw dr .  potterley bending over her  his face convulsed with sorrow .  two days later  with the school day drawing to a close  and foster looking wearily about to see if there were any data on his newly approved projects that he wished to take home  dr .  potterley appeared once more .  he was standing at the open door of foster   s office .  the historian was neatly dressed as ever .  he lifted his hand in a gesture that was too vague to be a greeting  too abortive to be a plea .  foster stared stonily .  potterley said     i waited till five  till you were  .   .   .  may i come in .     foster nodded .  potterley said     i suppose i ought to apologize for my behavior .  i was dreadfully disappointed  not quite master of myself .  still  it was inexcusable .        i accept your apology     said foster .     is that all .        my wife called you  i think .        yes  she has .        she has been quite hysterical .  she told me she had but i couldn   t be quite sure         could you tell me  would you be so kind as to tell me what she wanted .        she wanted a chronoscope .  she said she had some money of her own .  she was willing to pay .        did you  make any commitments .        i said i wasn   t in the manufacturing business .        good     breathed potterley  his chest expanding with a sigh of relief .        please don   t take any calls from her .  she   s not  quite         look  dr .  potterfey     said foster     i   m not getting into any domestic quarrels  but you   d better be prepared for something .  chronoscopes can be built by anybody given a few simple parts that can be bought through some etherics sales center  it can be built in the home workshop .  the video part  anyway .        but no one else will think of it beside you  will they .  no one has .        i don   t intend to keep it secret .        but you can   t publish .  it   s illegal research .        that doesn   t matter any more  dr .  potterley .  if i lose my grants  i lose them .  if the university is displeased  i   ll resign .  it just doesn   t matter .        but you can   t do that .        till now     said foster     you didn   t mind my risking loss of grants and position .  why do you turn so tender about it now .  now let me explain something to you .  when you first came to me  i believed in organized and directed research  the situation as it existed  in other words .  i considered you an intellectual anarchist  dr .  potterley  and dangerous .  but  for one reason or another  i   ve been an anarchist myself for months now and i have achieved great things .     those things have been achieved not because i am a brilliant scientist .  not at all .  it was just that scientific research had been directed from above and holes were left that could be filled in by anyone who looked in the right direction .  and anyone might have if the government hadn   t actively tried to prevent it .     now understand me .  i still believe directed research can be useful .  i   m not in favor of a retreat to total anarchy .  but there must be a middle ground .  directed research can retain flexibility .  a scientist must be allowed to follow his curiosity  at least in his spare time .     potterley sat down .  he said ingratiatingly     let   s discuss this  foster .  i appreciate your idealism .  you   re young .  you want the moon .  but you can   t destroy yourself through fancy notions of what research must consist of .  i got you into this .  i am responsible and i blame myself bitterly .  i was acting emotionally .  my interest in carthage blinded me and i was a damned fool .     foster broke in .     you mean you   ve changed completely in two days .  carthage is nothing .  government suppression of research is nothing .        even a damned fool like myself can learn  foster .  my wife taught me something .  i understand the reason for government suppression of neutrinics now .  i didn   t two days ago .  and  understanding  i approve .  you saw the way my wife reacted to the news of a chronoscope in the basement .  i had envisioned a chronoscope used for research purposes .  all she could see was the personal pleasure of returning neurotically to a personal past  a dead past .  the pure researcher  foster  is in the minority .  people like my wife would outweigh us .     for the government to encourage chronoscopy would have meant that everyone   s past would be visible .  the government officers would be subjected to blackmail and improper pressure  since who on earth has a past that is absolutely clean .  organized government might become impossible .     foster licked his lips .     maybe .  maybe the government has some justification in its own eyes .  still  there   s an important principle involved here .  who knows what other scientific advances are being stymied because scientists are being stifled into walking a narrow path .  if the chronoscope becomes the terror of a few politicians  it   s a price that must be paid .  the public must realize that science must be free and there is no more dramatic way of doing it than to publish my discovery  one way or another  legally or illegally .     potterley   s brow was damp with perspiration  but his voice remained even .     oh  not just a few politicians  dr .  foster .  don   t think that .  it would be my terror  too .  my wife would spend her time living with our dead daughter .  she would retreat further from reality .  she would go mad living the same scenes over and over .  and not just my terror .  there would be others like her .  children searching for their dead parents or their own youth .  we   ll have a whole world living in the past .  midsummer madness .     foster said     moral judgments can   t stand in the way .  there isn   t one advance at any time in history that mankind hasn   t had the ingenuity to pervert .  mankind must also have the ingenuity to prevent .  as for the chronoscope  your delvers into the dead past will get tired soon enough .  they   ll catch their loved parents in some of the things their loved parents did and they   ll lose their enthusiasm for it all .  but all this is trivial .  with me  it   s a matter of important principle .     potterley said     hang your principle .  can   t you understand men and women as well as principle .  don   t you understand that my wife will live through the fire that killed our baby .  she won   t be able to help herself .  i know her .  she   ll follow through each step  trying to prevent it .  she   ll live it over and over again  hoping each time that it won   t happen .  how many times do you want to kill laurel .     a huskiness had crept into his voice .  a thought crossed foster   s mind .     what are you really afraid she   ll find out  dr .  potterley .  what happened the night of the fire .     the historian   s hands went up quickly to cover his face and they shook with his dry sobs .  foster turned away and stared uncomfortably out the window .  potterley said after a while     it   s a long time since i   ve had to think of it .  caroline was away .  i was baby sitting .  i went into the baby   s bedroom midevening to see if she had kicked off the bedclothes .  i had my cigarette with me  .  .  .  i smoked in those days .  i must have stubbed it out before putting it in the ashtray on the chest of drawers .  i was always careful .  the baby was all right .  i returned to the living room and fell asleep before the video .  i awoke  choking  surrounded by fire .  i don   t know how it started .        but you think it may have been the cigarette  is that it .     said foster .     a cigarette which  for once  you forgot to stub out .        i don   t know .  i tried to save her  but she was dead in my arms when i got out .        you never told your wife about the cigarette  i suppose .     potterley shook his head .     but i   ve lived with it .        only now  with a chronoscope  she   ll find out .  maybe it wasn   t the cigarette .  maybe you did stub it out .  isn   t that possible .     the scant tears had dried on potterley   s face .  the redness had subsided .  he said     i can   t take the chance .   .   .   .  but it   s not just myself  foster .  the past has its terrors for most people .  don   t loose those terrors on the human race .     foster paced the floor .  somehow  this explained the reason for potterley   s rabid  irrational desire to boost the carthaginians  deify them  most of all disprove the story of their fiery sacrifices to moloch .  by freeing them of the guilt of infanticide by fire  he symbolically freed himself of the same guilt .  so the same fire that had driven him on to causing the construction of a chronoscope was now driving him on to the destruction .  foster looked sadly at the older man .     i see your position  dr .  potterley  but this goes above personal feelings .  i   ve got to smash this throttling hold on the throat of science .     potterley said  savagely     you mean you want the fame and wealth that goes with such a discovery .        i don   t know about the wealth  but that  too  i suppose .  i   m no more than human .        you won   t suppress your knowledge .        not under any circumstances .        well  then      and the historian got to his feet and stood for a moment  glaring .  foster had an odd moment of terror .  the man was older than he  smaller  feebler  and he didn   t look armed .  still  .   .   .  foster said     if you   re thinking of killing me or anything insane like that  i   ve got the information in a safety deposit vault where the proper people will find it in case of my disappearance or death .     potterley said     don   t be a fool     and stalked out .  foster closed the door  locked it and sat down to think .  he felt silly .  he had no information in any safety deposit vault  of course .  such a melodramatic action would not have occurred to him ordinarily .  but now it had .  feeling even sillier  he spent an hour writing out the equations of the application of pseudo gravitic optics to neutrinic recording  and some diagrams for the engineering details of construction .  he sealed it in an envelope and scrawled ralph nimmo   s name over the outside .  he spent a rather restless night and the next morning  on the way to school  dropped the envelope off at the bank  with appropriate instructions to an official  who made him sign a paper permitting the box to be opened after his death .  he called nimmo to tell him of the existence of the envelope  refusing querulously to say anything about its contents .  he had never felt so ridiculously self conscious as at that moment .  that night and the next  foster spent in only fitful sleep  finding himself face to face with the highly practical problem of the publication of data unethically obtained .  the proceedings of the society for pseudo gravities  which was the journal with which he was best acquainted  would certainly not touch any paper that did not include the magic footnote     the work described in this paper was made possible by grant no .  so and so from the commission of research of the united nations .     nor  doubly so  would the journal of physics .  there were always the minor journals who might overlook the nature of the article for the sake of the sensation  but that would require a little financial negotiation on which he hesitated to embark .  it might  on the whole  be better to pay the cost of publishing a small pamphlet for general distribution among scholars .  in that case  he would even be able to dispense with the services of a science writer  sacrificing polish for speed .  he would have to find a reliable printer .  uncle ralph might know one .  he walked down the corridor to his office and wondered anxiously if perhaps he ought to waste no further time  give himself no further chance to lapse into indecision and take the risk of calling ralph from his office phone .  he was so absorbed in his own heavy thoughts that he did not notice that his room was occupied until he turned from the clothes closet and approached his desk .  dr .  potterley was there and a man whom foster did not recognize .  foster stared at them .     what   s this .     potterley said     i   m sorry  but i had to stop you .     foster continued staring .     what are you talking about .     the stranger said     let me introduce myself .     he had large teeth  a little uneven  and they showed prominently when he smiled .     i am thaddeus araman  department head of the division of chronoscopy .  i am here to see you concerning information brought to me by professor arnold potterley and confirmed by our own sources      potterley said breathlessly     i took all the blame  dr .  foster .  i explained that it was i who persuaded you against your will into unethical practices .  i have offered to accept full responsibility and punishment .  i don   t wish you harmed in any way .  it   s just that chronoscopy must not be permitted .     araman nodded .     he has taken the blame as he says  dr .  foster  but this thing is out of his hands now .     foster said     so .  what are you going to do .  blackball me from all consideration for research grants .        that is in my power     said araman .     order the university to discharge me .        that  too  is in my power .        all right  go ahead .  consider it done .  i   ll leave my office now  with you .  i can send for my books later .  if you insist  i   ll leave my books .  is that all .        not quite     said araman .     you must engage to do no further research in chronoscopy  to publish none of your findings in chronoscopy and  of course  to build no chronoscope .  you will remain under surveillance indefinitely to make sure you keep that promise .        supposing i refuse to promise .  what can you do .  doing research out of my field may be unethical  but it isn   t a criminal offense .        in the case of chronoscopy  my young friend     said araman patiently     it is a criminal offense .  if necessary  you will be put in jail and kept there .        why .     shouted foster .     what   s magic about chronoscopy .     araman said     that   s the way it is .  we cannot allow further developments in the field .  my own job is  primarily  to make sure of that  and i intend to do my job .  unfortunately  i had no knowledge  nor did anyone in the department  that the optics of pseudo gravity fields had such immediate application to chronoscopy .  score one for general ignorance  but henceforward research will be steered properly in that respect  too .     foster said     that won   t help .  something else may apply that neither you nor i dream of .  all science hangs together .  it   s one piece .  if you want to stop one part  you   ve got to stop it all .        no doubt that is true     said araman     in theory .  on the practical side  however  we have managed quite well to hold chronoscopy down to the original sterbinski level for fifty years .  having caught you in time  dr .  foster  we hope to continue doing so indefinitely .  and we wouldn   t have come this close to disaster  either  if i had accepted dr .  potterley at something more than face value .     he turned toward the historian and lifted his eyebrows in a kind of humorous self deprecation .     i   m afraid  sir  that i dismissed you as a history professor and no more on the occasion of our first interview .  had i done my job properly and checked on you  this would not have happened .     foster said abruptly     is anyone allowed to use the government chrono scope .        no one outside our division under any pretext .  i say that since it is obvious to me that you have already guessed as much .  i warn you  though  that any repetition of that fact will be a criminal  not an ethical  offense .        and your chronoscope doesn   t go back more than a hundred twenty five years or so  does it .        it doesn   t .        then your bulletin with its stories of time viewing ancient times is a hoax .     araman said coolly     with the knowledge you now have  it is obvious you know that for a certainty .  however  i confirm your remark .  the monthly bulletin is a hoax .        in that case     said foster     i will not promise to suppress my knowledge of chronoscopy .  if you wish to arrest me  go ahead .  my defense at the trial will be enough to destroy the vicious card house of directed research and bring it tumbling down .  directing research is one thing  suppressing it and depriving mankind of its benefits is quite another .     araman said     oh  let   s get something straight  dr .  foster .  if you do not co operate  you will go to jail directly .  you will not see a lawyer  you will not be charged  you will not have a trial .  you will simply stay in jail .        oh  no     said foster     you   re bluffing .  this is not the twentieth century  you know .     there was a stir outside the office  the clatter of feet  a high pitched shout that foster was sure he recognized .  the door crashed open  the lock splintering  and three intertwined figures stumbled in .  as they did so  one of the men raised a blaster and brought its butt down hard on the skull of another .  there was a whoosh of expiring air  and the one whose head was struck went limp .     uncle ralph .     cried foster .  araman frowned .     put him down in that chair     he ordered     and get some water .     ralph nimmo  rubbing his head with a gingerly sort of disgust  said     there was no need to get rough  araman .     araman said     the guard should have been rough sooner and kept you out of here  nimmo .  you   d have been better off .        you know each other .     asked foster .     i   ve had dealings with the man     said nimmo  still rubbing .     if he   s here in your office  nephew  you   re in trouble .        and you  too     said araman angrily .     i know dr .  foster consulted you on neutrinics literature .     nimmo corrugated his forehead  then straightened it with a wince as though the action had brought pain .     so .     he said .     what else do you know about me .        we will know everything about you soon enough .  meanwhile  that one item is enough to implicate you .  what are you doing here .        my dear dr .  araman     said nimmo  some of his jauntiness restored     day before yesterday  my jackass of a nephew called me .  he had placed some mysterious information         don   t tell him .  don   t say anything .     cried foster .  araman gknced at him coldly .     we know all about it  dr .  foster .  the safety deposit box has been opened and its contents removed .        but how can you know      foster   s voice died away in a kind of furious frustration .     anyway     said nimmo     i decided the net must be closing around him and  after i took care of a few items  i came down to tell him to get off this thing he   s doing .  it   s not worth his career .        does that mean you know what he   s doing .     asked araman .     he never told me     said nimmo     but i   m a science writer with a hell of a lot of experience .  i know which side of an atom is electronified .  the boy  foster  specializes in pseudo gravitic optics and coached me on the stuff himself .  he got me to get him a textbook on neutrinics and i kind of ship viewed it myself before handing it over .  i can put the two together .  he asked me to get him certain pieces of physical equipment  and that was evidence  too .  stop me if i   m wrong  but my nephew has built a semiportable  low power chronoscope .  yes  or  yes .        yes .     araman reached thoughtfully for a cigarette and paid no attention to dr .  potterley  watching silently  as though all were a dream  who shied away  gasping  from the white cylinder .     another mistake for me .  i ought to resign .  i should have put tabs on you  too  nimmo  instead of concentrating too hard on potterley and foster .  i didn   t have much time of course and you   ve ended up safely here  but that doesn   t excuse me .  you   re under arrest  nimmo .        what for .     demanded the science writer .     unauthorized research .        i wasn   t doing any .  i can   t  not being a registered scientist .  and even if i did  it   s not a criminal offense .     foster said savagely     no use  uncle ralph .  this bureaucrat is making his own laws .        like what .     demanded nimmo .     like life imprisonment without trial .        nuts     said nimmo .     this isn   t the twentieth cen         i tried that     said foster .     it doesn   t bother him .        well  nuts     shouted nimmo .     look here  araman .  my nephew and i have relatives who haven   t lost touch with us  you know .  the professor has some also  i imagine .  you can   t just make us disappear .  there   ll be questions and a scandal .  this isn   t the twentieth century .  so if you   re trying to scare us  it isn   t working .     the cigarette snapped between araman   s fingers and he tossed it away violently .  he said     damn it  i don   t know what to do .  it   s never been like this before .   .   .   .  look .  you three fools know nothing of what you   re trying to do .  you understand nothing .  will you listen to me .        oh  we   ll listen     said nimmo grimly .   foster sat silently  eyes angry  lips compressed .  potterley   s hands writhed like two intertwined snakes .   araman said     the past to you is the dead past .  if any of you have discussed the matter  it   s dollars to nickels you   ve used that phrase .  the dead past .  if you knew how many times i   ve heard those three words  you   d choke on them  too .     when people think of the past  they think of it as dead  far away and gone  long ago .  we encourage them to think so .  when we report time viewing  we always talk of views centuries in the past  even though you gentlemen know seeing more than a century or so is impossible .  people accept it .  the past means greece  rome  carthage  egypt  the stone age .  the deader the better .     now you three know a century or a little more is the limit  so what does the past mean to you .  your youth .  your first girl .  your dead mother .  twenty years ago .  thirty years ago .  fifty years ago .  the deader the better .   .   .   .  but when does the past really begin .     he paused in anger .  the others stared at him and nimmo stirred uneasily .     well     said araman     when did it begin .  a year ago .  five minutes ago .  one second ago .  isn   t it obvious that the past begins an instant ago .  the dead past is just another name for the living present .  what if you focus the chronoscope in the past of one hundredth of a second ago .  aren   t you watching the present .  does it begin to sink in .     nimmo said     damnation .        damnation     mimicked araman .     after potterley came to me with his story night before last  how do you suppose i checked up on both of you .  i did it with the chronoscope  spotting key moments to the very instant of the present .        and that   s how you knew about the safety deposit box .     said foster .     and every other important fact .  now what do you suppose would happen if we let news of a home chronoscope get out .  people might start out by watching their youth  their parents and so on  but it wouldn   t be long before they   d catch on to the possibilities .  the housewife will forget her poor  dead mother and take to watching her neighbor at home and her husband at the office .  the businessman will watch his competitor  the employer his employee .     there will be no such thing as privacy .  the party line  the prying eye behind the curtain will be nothing compared to it .  the video stars will be closely watched at all times by everyone .  every man his own peeping tom and there   ll be no getting away from the watcher .  even darkness will be no escape because chronoscopy can be adjusted to the infrared and human figures can be seen by their own body heat .  the figures will be fuzzy  of course  and the surroundings will be dark  but that will make the titillation of it all the greater  perhaps .   .   .   .  hmp  the men in charge of the machine now experiment sometimes in spite of the regulations against it .     nimmo seemed sick .     you can always forbid private manufacture      araman turned on him fiercely .     you can  but do you expect it to do good .  can you legislate successfully against drinking  smoking  adultery or gossiping over the back fence .  and this mixture of nosiness and prurience will have a worse grip on humanity than any of those .  good lord  in a thousand years of trying we haven   t even been able to wipe out the heroin traffic and you talk about legislating against a device for watching anyone you please at any time you please that can be built in a home workshop .     foster said suddenly     i won   t publish .     potterley burst out  half in sobs     none of us will talk .  i regret      nimmo broke in .     you said you didn   t tab me on the chronoscope  araman .        no time     said araman wearily .     things don   t move any faster on the chronoscope than in real life .  you can   t speed it up like the film in a book viewer .  we spent a full twenty four hours trying to catch the important moments during the last six months of potterley and foster .  there was no time for anything else and it was enough .        it wasn   t     said nimmo .     what are you talking about .     there was a sudden infinite alarm on araman   s face .     i told you my nephew  jonas  had called me to say he had put important information in a safety deposit box .  he acted as though he were in trouble .  he   s my nephew .  i had to try to get him off the spot .  it took a while  then i came here to tell him what i had done .  i told you when i got here  just after your man conked me that i had taken care of a few items .        what .  for heaven   s sake         just this  i sent the details of the portable chronoscope off to half a dozen of my regular publicity outlets .     not a word .  not a sound .  not a breath .  they were all past any demonstration .     don   t stare like that     cried nimmo .     don   t you see my point .  i had popular publication rights .  jonas will admit that .  i knew he couldn   t publish scientifically in any legal way .  i was sure he was planning to publish illegally and was preparing the safety deposit box for that reason  i thought if i put through the details prematurely  all the responsibility would be mine .  his career would be saved .  and if   were deprived of my science writing license as a result  my exclusive possession of the chronometric data would set me up for life .  jonas would be angry  i expected that  but i could explain the motive and we would split the take fifty fifty .   .   .  don   t stare at me like that .  how did i know         nobody knew anything     said araman bitterly     but you all just took it for granted that the government was stupidly bureaucratic  vicious  tyrannical  given to suppressing research for the hell of it .  it never occurred to any of you that we were trying to protect mankind as best we could .        don   t sit there talking     wailed potterley .     get the names of the people who were told         too late     said nimmo  shrugging .     they   ve had better than a day .  there   s been time for the word to spread .  my outfits will have called any number of physicists to check my data before going on with it and they   ll call one another to pass on the news .  once scientists put neutrinics and pseudo gravities together  home chronoscopy becomes obvious .  before the week is out  five hundred people will know how to build a small chronoscope and how will you catch them all .     his plum cheeks sagged .     i suppose there   s no way of putting the mushroom cloud back into that nice  shiny uranium sphere .     araman stood up .     we   ll try  potterley  but i agree with nimmo .  it   s too late .  what kind of a world we   ll have from now on  i don   t know  i can   t tell  but the world we know has been destroyed completely .  until now  every custom  every habit  every tiniest way of life has always taken a certain amount of privacy for granted  but that   s all gone now .     he saluted each of the three with elaborate formality .     you have created a new world among the three of you .  i congratulate you .  happy goldfish bowl to you  to me  to everyone  and may each of you fry in hell forever .  arrest rescinded .      the dying night  part    it was almost a class reunion  and though it was marked by joylessness  there was no reason as yet to think it would be marred by tragedy .  edward talliaferro  fresh from the moon and without his gravity legs yet  met the other two in stanley kaunas   s room .  kaunas rose to greet him in a subdued manner .  battersley ryger merely sat and nodded .  talliaferro lowered his large body carefully to the couch  very aware of its unusual weight .  he grimaced a little  his plump lips twisting inside the rim of hair that surrounded his mouth on lip  chin  and cheek .  they had seen one another earlier that day under more formal conditions .  now for the first time they were alone  and talliaferro said     this is a kind of occasion .  we   re meeting for the first time in ten years .  first time since graduation  in fact .     ryger   s nose twitched .  it had been broken shortly before that same graduation and he had received his degree in astronomy with a bandage disfiguring his face .  he said grumpily      anyone ordered  champagne .  or something .     talliaferro said     come on .  first big interplanetary astronomical convention in history is no place for glooming .  and among friends  too .     kaunas said suddenly     it   s earth .  it doesn   t feel right .  i can   t get used to it .     he shook his head but his look of depression was not detachable .  it remained .  talliaferro said     i know .  i   m so heavy .  it takes all the energy out of me .  at that  you   re better off than i am  kaunas .  mercurian gravity is   .   normal .  on the moon  it   s only   .    .     he interrupted ryger   s beginning of a sound by saying      and on ceres they use pseudo grav fields adjusted to   .   .  you have no problem at all  ryger .     the cerian astronomer looked annoyed     it   s the open air .  going outside without a suit gets me .        right     agreed kaunas     and letting the sun beat down on you .  just letting it .     talliaferro found himself insensibly drifting back in time .  they had not changed much .  nor  he thought  had he himself .  they were all ten years older  of course .  ryger had put on some weight and kaunas   s thin face had grown a bit leathery  but he would have recognized either if he had met him without warning .  he said     i don   t think it   s earth getting us .  let   s face it .     kaunas looked up sharply .  he was a little fellow with quick  nervous movements of his hands .  he habitually wore clothes that looked a shade too large for him .  he said     villiers .  i know .  i think about him sometimes .     then  with an air of desperation     i got a letter from him .     ryger sat upright  his olive complexion darkening further and said with energy     you did .  when .         a month ago .     ryger turned to talliaferro .     how about you .     talliaferro blinked placidly and nodded .  ryger said     he   s gone crazy .  he claims he   s discovered a practical method of mass transference through space .    he told you two also .   that   s it  then .  he was always a little bent .  now he   s broken .     he rubbed his nose fiercely and talliaferro thought of the day villiers had broken it .  for ten years  villiers had haunted them like the vague shadow of a guilt that wasn   t really theirs .  they had gone through their graduate work together  four picked and dedicated men being trained for a profession that had reached new heights in this age of interplanetary travel .  the observatories were opening on the other worlds  surrounded by vacuum  unblurred by air .  there was the lunar observatory  from which earth and the inner planets could be studied  a silent world in whose sky the home planet hung suspended .  mercury observatory  closest to the sun  perched at mercury   s north pole  where the terminator moved scarcely at all  and the sun was fixed on the horizon and could be studied in the minutest detail .  ceres observatory  newest  most modern  with its range extending from jupiter to the outermost galaxies .  there were disadvantages  of course .  with interplanetary travel still difficult  leaves would be few  anything like normal life virtually impossible  but this was a lucky generation .  coming scientists would find the fields of knowledge well reaped and  until the invention of an interstellar drive  no new horizon as capacious as this one would be opened .  each of these lucky four  talliaferro  ryger  kaunas  and villiers  was to be in the position of a galileo  who by owning the first real telescope  could not point it anywhere in the sky without making a major discovery .  but then romero villiers had fallen sick and it was rheumatic fever .  whose fault was that .  his heart had been left leaking and limping .  he was the most brilliant of the four  the most hopeful  the most intense  and he could not even finish his schooling and get his doctorate .  worse than that  he could never leave earth  the acceleration of a spaceship   s take off would kill him .  talliaferro was marked for the moon  ryger for ceres  kaunas for mercury .  only villiers stayed behind  a life prisoner of earth .  they had tried telling their sympathy and villiers had rejected it with something approaching hate .  he had railed at them and cursed them .  when ryger lost his temper and lifted his fist  villiers had sprung at him  screaming  and had broken ryger   s nose .  obviously ryger hadn   t forgotten that  as he caressed his nose gingerly with one finger .  kaunas   s forehead was an uncertain washboard of wrinkles .     he   s at the convention  you know .  he   s got a room in the hotel      .        i won   t see him     said ryger .     he   s coming up here .  he said he wanted to see us .  i thought  he said nine .  he   ll be here any minute .        in that case     said ryger     if you don   t mind  i   m leaving .     he rose .  talliaferro said     oh  wait a while .  what   s the harm in seeing him .        because there   s no point .  he   s mad .        even so .  let   s not be petty about it .  are you afraid of him .         afraid .     ryger looked contemptuous .     nervous  then .  what is there to be so nervous about .        i   m not nervous     said ryger .     sure you are .  we all feel guilty about him  and without real reason .  nothing that happened was our fault .     but he was speaking defensively and he knew it .  and then  at that point  the door signal sounded  all three jumped and turned to stare uneasily at the barrier that stood between themselves and villiers .   the door opened and romero villiers walked in .  the others rose stiffly to greet him  then remained standing in embarrassment  without one hand being raised .  he stared them down sardonically .  he   s changed  thought talliaferro .  he had .  he had shrunken in almost every dimension .  a gathering stoop made him seen even shorter .  the skin of his scalp glistened through thinning hair  the skin on the back of his hands was ridged crookedly with bluish veins .  he looked ill .  there seemed nothing to link him to the memory of the past except for his trick of shading his eyes with one hand when he stared intently and  when he spoke  the even  controlled baritone of his voice .  he said     my friends .  my space trotting friends .  we   ve lost touch .     talliaferro said     hello  villiers .     villiers eyed him .     are you well .        well enough .         and you two .     kaunas managed a weak smile and a murmur .  ryger snapped     all right  villiers .  what   s up .        ryger  the angry man     said villiers .     how   s ceres .        it was doing well when i left how   s earth .        you can see for yourself     but villiers tightened as he said that .  he went on     i am hoping that the reason all three of you have come to the convention is to hear my paper day after tomorrow .        your paper .  what paper .     asked talliaferro .     i wrote you all about it .  my method of mass transference .     ryger smiled with one corner of his mouth .     yes  you did .  you didn   t say anything about a paper  though  and i don   t recall that you   re listed as one of the speakers .  i would have noticed it if you had been .        you   re right .  i   m not listed .  nor have i prepared an abstract for publication .     villiers had flushed and talliaferro said soothingly     take it easy  villiers .  you don   t look well .     villiers whirled on him  lips contorted .     my heart   s holding out  thank you .     kaunas said     listen  villiers  if you   re not listed or abstracted         you listen .  i   ve waited ten years .  you have the jobs in space and i have to teach school on earth  but i   m a better man than any of you or all of you .        granted      began talliaferro .     and i don   t want your condescension either .  mandel witnessed it .  i suppose you   ve heard of mandel .  well  he   s chairman of the astronautics division at the convention and i demonstrated mass transference for him .  it was a crude device and it burnt out after one use but  are you listening .        we   re listening     said ryger coldly     for what that counts .        he   ll let me talk about it my way .  you bet he will .  no warning .  no advertisement .  i   m going to spring it at them like a bombshell .  when i give them the fundamental relationships involved it will break up the convention .  they   ll scatter to their home labs to check on me and build devices .  and they   ll find it works .  i made a live mouse disappear at one spot in my lab and appear in another .  mandel witnessed it .     he stared at them  glaring first at one face  then at another .  he said     you don   t believe me  do you .     ryger said     if you don   t want advertisement  why do you tell us .        you   re different .  you   re my friends  my classmates .  you went out into space and left me behind .        that wasn   t a matter of choice     objected kaunas in a thin  high voice .  villiers ignored that .  he said     so i want you to know now .  what will work for a mouse will work for a human .  what will move something ten feet across a lab will move it a million miles across space .  i   ll be on the moon  and on mercury  and on ceres and anywhere i want to go .  i   ll match every one of you and more .  and i   ll have done more for astronomy just teaching school and thinking  than all of you with your observatories and telescopes and cameras and spaceships .        well     said talliaferro     i   m pleased .  more power to you .  may i see a copy of the paper .        oh  no .     villiers    hands clenched close to his chest as though he were holding phantom sheets and shielding them from observation .     you wait like everyone else .  there   s only one copy and no one will see it till i   m ready .  not even mandel .        one copy     cried talliaferro .     if you misplace it         i won   t .  and if i do  it   s all in my head .        if you      talliaferro almost finished that sentence with    die    but stopped himself .  instead  he went on after an almost imperceptible pause       have any sense  you   ll scan it at least .  for safety   s sake .        no     said villiers  shortly .     you   ll hear me day after tomorrow .  you   ll see the human horizon expanded at one  troke as it never has been before .     again he stared intently at each face .     ten years     he said .     good by .         he   s mad     said ryger explosively  staring at the door as though villiers were still standing before it .     is he .     said talliaferro thoughtfully .     i suppose he is  in a way .  he hates us for irrational reasons .  and  then  not even to scan his paper as a precaution      talliaferro fingered his own small scanner as he said that .  it was just a neutrally colored  undistinguished cylinder  somewhat thicker and somewhat shorter than an ordinary pencil .  in recent years  it had become the hallmark of the scientist  much as the stethoscope was that of the physician and the micro computer that of the statistician .  the scanner was worn in a jacket pocket  or clipped to a sleeve  or slipped behind the ear  or swung at the end of a string .  talliaferro sometimes  in his more philosophical moments  wondered how it was in the days when research men had to make laborious notes of the literature or file away fullsized reprints .  how unwieldy .  now it was only necessary to scan anything printed or written to have a micro negative which could be developed at leisure .  talliaferro had already recorded every abstract included in the program booklet of the convention .  the other two  he assumed with full confidence  had done like .  .  wise .  talliaferro said     under the circumstances  refusal to scan is mad .        space .     said ryger hotly .     there is no paper .  there is no discovery .  scoring one on us would be worth any lie to him .        but then what will he do day after tomorrow .     asked kaunas .     how do i know .  he   s a madman .     talliaferro still played with his scanner and wondered idly if he ought to remove and develop some of the small slivers of film that lay stored away in its vitals .  he decided against it .  he said     don   t underestimate villiers .  he   s a brain .        ten years ago  maybe     said ryger .     now he   s a nut .  i propose we forget him .     he spoke loudly  as though to drive away villiers and all that concerned him by the sheer force with which he discussed other things .  he talked about ceres and his work  the radio plotting of the milky way with new radioscopes capable of the resolution of single stars .  kaunas listened and nodded  then chimed in with information concerning the radio emissions of sunspots and his own paper  in press  on the association of proton storms with the gigantic hydrogen flares on the sun   s surface .  talliaferro contributed little .  lunar work was unglamorous in comparison .  the latest information on long scale weather forecasting through direct observation of terrestrial jet streams would not compare with radioscopes and proton storms .  more than that  his thoughts could not leave villiers .  villiers was the brain .  they all knew it .  even ryger  for all his bluster  must feel that if mass transference were at all possible then villiers was a logical discoverer .  the discussion of their own work amounted to no more than an uneasy admission that none of them had come to much .  talliaferro had followed the literature and knew .  his own papers had been minor .  the others had authored nothing of great importance .  none of them  face the fact  had developed into space shakers .  the colossal dreams of school days had not come true and that was that .  they were competent routine workmen .  no less .  unfortunately  no more .  they knew that .  villiers would have been more .  they knew that  too .  it was that knowledge  as well as guilt  which kept them antagonistic .  talliaferro felt uneasily that villiers  despite everything  was yet to be more .  the others must be thinking so  too  and mediocrity could grow quickly unbearable .  the mass transference paper would come to pass and villiers would be the great man after all  as he was always fated to be apparently  while his classmates  with all their advantages  would be forgotten .  their role would be no more than to applaud from the crowd .  he felt his own envy and chagrin and was ashamed of it  but felt it none the less .  conversation died  and kaunas said  his eyes turning away     listen  why don   t we drop in on old villiers .     there was a false heartiness about it  a completely unconvincing effort at casualness .  he added     no use leaving bad feelings  unnecessarily      talliaferro thought  he wants to make sure about the mass transference .  he   s hoping it is only a madman   s nightmare so he can sleep tonight .  but he was curious himself  so he made no objection  and even ryger shrugged with ill grace and said     hell  why not .     it was a little before eleven then .   talliaferro was awakened by the insistent ringing of his door signal .  he hitched himself to one elbow in the darkness and felt distinctly outraged .  the soft glow of the ceiling indicator showed it to be not quite four in the morning .  he cried out     who is it .     the ringing continued in short  insistent spurts .  growling  talliaferro slipped into his bathrobe .  he opened the door and blinked in the corridor light .  he recognized the man who faced him from the trimensionals he had seen often enough .  nevertheless  the man said in an abrupt whisper     my name is hubert mandel .        yes  sir     said talliaferro .  mandel was one of the names in astronomy  prominent enough to have an important executive position with the world astronomical bureau  active enough to be chairman of the astronautics section here at the convention .  it suddenly struck talliaferro that it was mandel for whom villiers claimed to have demonstrated mass transference .  the thought of villiers was somehow a sobering one .  mandel said     you are dr .  edward talliaferro .        yes  sir .        then dress and come with me .  it is very important .  it concerns a mutual acquaintance .        dr .  villiers .     mandel   s eyes flickered a bit .  his brows and lashes were so fair as to give those eyes a naked  unfringed appearance .  his hair was silky thin  his age about fifty .  he said     why villiers .        he mentioned you last evening .  i don   t know any other mutual acquaintance .     mandel nodded  waited for talliaferro to finish slipping into his clothes  then turned and led the way .  ryger and kaunas were waiting in a room one floor above talliaferro   s .  kaunas   s eyes were red and troubled .  ryger was smoking a cigarette with impatient puffs .  talliaferro said     we   re all here .  another reunion .     it fell flat .  he took a seat and the three stared at one another .  ryger shrugged .  mandel paced the floor  hands deep in his pockets .  he said        i apologize for any inconvenience  gentlemen  and i thank you for your co operation .  i would like more of it .  our friend  romero villiers  is dead .  about an hour ago  his body was removed from the hotel .  the medical judgment is heart failure .     there was a stunned silence .  ryger   s cigarette hovered halfway to his lips  then sank slowly without completing its journey .     poor devil     said talliaferro .     horrible     whispered kaunas hoarsely .     he was      his voice played out .  ryger shook himself .     well  he had a bad heart .  there   s nothing to be done .        one little thing     corrected mandel quietly .     recovery .        what does that mean .     asked ryger sharply .  mandel said     when did you three see him last .     talliaferro spoke     last evening .  it turned out to be a reunion .  we all met for the first time in ten years .  it wasn   t a pleasant meeting  i   m sorry to say .  villiers felt he had cause for anger with us  and he was angry .        that was  when .         about nine  the first time .        the first time .        we saw him again later in the evening .     kaunas looked troubled .     he had left angrily .  we couldn   t leave it at that .  we had to try .  it wasn   t as if we hadn   t all been friends at one time .  so we went to his room and      mandel pounced on that .     you were all in his room .        yes     said kaunas  surprised .     about when .        eleven  i think .     he looked at the others .  talliaferro nodded .     and how long did you stay .        two minutes     put in ryger .     he ordered us out as though we were after his paper .     he paused as though expecting mandel to ask what paper  but mandel said nothing .  he went on .     i think he kept it under his pillow .  at least he lay across the pillow as he yelled at us to leave .        he may have been dying then     said kaunas  in a sick whisper .     not then     said mandel shortly .     so you probably all left fingerprints .        probably     said talliaferro .  he was losing some of his automatic respect for mandel and a sense of impatience was returning .  it was four in the morning  mandel or no .  he said     now what   s all this about .        well  gentlemen     said mandel     there   s more to villiers    death than the fact of death .  villiers    paper  the only copy of it as far as i know  was stuffed into the cigarette flash disposal unit and only scraps of it were left .  i   ve never seen or read the paper  but i knew enough about the matter to be willing to swear in court if necessary that the remnants of unflashed paper in the disposal unit were of the paper he was planning to give at this convention .    you seem doubtful  dr .  ryger .     ryger smiled sourly .     doubtful that he was going to give it .  if you want my opinion  sir  he was mad .  for ten years he was a prisoner of earth and he fantasied mass transference as escape .  it was all that kept him alive probably .  he rigged up some sort of fraudulent demonstration .  i don   t say it was deliberate fraud .  he was probably madly sincere  and sincerely mad .  last evening was the climax .  he came to our rooms  he hated us for having escaped earth  and triumphed over us .  it was what he had lived for for ten years .  it may have shocked him back to some form of sanity .  he knew he couldn   t actually give the paper  there was nothing to give .  so he burnt it and his heart gave out .  it is too bad .     mandel listened to the cerian astronomer  wearing a look of sharp disapproval .  he said     very glib  dr .  ryger  but quite wrong .  i am not as easily fooled by fraudulent demonstrations as you may believe .  now according to the registration data  which i have been forced to check rather hastily  you three were his classmates at college .  is that right .     they nodded .     are there any other classmates of yours present at the convention .        no     said kaunas .     we were the only four qualifying for a doctorate in astronomy that year .  at least he would have qualified except         yes  i understand     said mandel .     well  then  in that case one of you three visited villiers in his room one last time at midnight .     there was a short silence .  then ryger said coldly     not i .     kaunas  eyes wide  shook his head .  talliaferro said     what are you implying .        one of you came to him at midnight and insisted on seeing his paper .  i don   t know the motive .  conceivably  it was with the deliberate intention of forcing him into heart failure .  when villiers collapsed  the criminal  if i may call him so  was ready .  he snatched the paper which .  i might add  probably was kept under his pillow and scanned it .  then he destroyed the paper itself in the flash disposal  but he was in a hurry and destruction wasn   t complete .     ryger interrupted .     how do you know all this .  were you a witness .         almost     said mandel .     villiers was not quite dead at the moment of his first collapse .  when the criminal left  he managed to reach the phone and call my room .  he choked out a few phrases  enough to outline what had occurred .  unfortunately i was not in my room  a late conference kept me away .  however  my recording attachment taped it .  i always play the recording tape back whenever i return to my room or office .  bureaucratic habit .  i called back .  he was dead .        well  then     said ryger     who did he say did it .        he didn   t .  or if he did  it was unintelligible .  but one word rang out clearly .  it was    classmate .         talliaferro detached his scanner from its place in his inner jacket pocket and held it out toward mandel .  quietly he said     if you would like to develop the film in my scanner  you are welcome to do so .  you will not find villiers    paper there .     at once  kaunas did the same  and ryger  with a scowl  joined .  mandel took all three scanners and said dryly     presumably  whichever one of you has done this has already disposed of the piece of exposed film with the paper on it .  however      talliaferro raised his eyebrows .     you may search my person or my room .     but ryger was still scowling .     now wait a minute  wait one bloody minute .  are you the police .     mandel stared at him .     do you want the police .  do you want a scandal and a murder charge .  do you want the convention disrupted and the system press to make a holiday out of astronomy and astronomers .  villiers    death might well have been accidental .  he did have a bad heart .  whichever one of you was there may well have acted on impulse .  it may not have been a premeditated crime .  if whoever it is will return the negative  we can avoid a great deal of trouble .        even for the criminal .     asked talliaferro .  mandel shrugged .     there may be trouble for him .  i will not promise immunity .  but whatever the trouble  it won   t be public disgrace and life imprisonment  as it might be if the police are called in .     silence .  mandel said     it is one of you three .     silence .  mandel went on     i think i can see the original reasoning of the guilty person .  the paper would be destroyed .  only we four knew of the mass transference and only i had ever seen a demonstration .  moreover you had only his word  a madman   s word perhaps  that i had seen it .  with villiers dead of heart failure and the paper gone  it would be easy to believe dr .  ryger   s theory that there was no mass transference and never had been .  a year or two might pass and our criminal  in possession of the mass transference data  could reveal it little by little  rig experiments  publish careful papers  and end as the apparent discoverer with all that would imply in terms of money and renown .  even his own classmates would suspect nothing .  at most they would believe that the long past affair with villiers had inspired him to begin investigations in the field .  no more .     mandel looked sharply from one face to another .     but none of that will work now .  any of the three of you who comes through with mass transference is proclaiming himself the criminal .  i   ve seen the demonstration  i know it is legitimate  i know that one of you possesses a record of the paper .  the information is therefore useless to you .  give it up then .     silence .  mandel walked to the door and turned again     i   d appreciate it if you would stay here till i return .  i won   t be long .  i hope the guilty one will use the interval to consider .  if he   s afraid a confession will lose him his job  let him remember that a session with police may lose him his liberty and cost him the psychic probe .     he hefted the three scanners  looked grim and somewhat in need of sleep .     i   ll develop these .     kaunas tried to smile .     what if we make a break for it while you   re gone .        only one of you has reason to try     said mandel .     i think i can rely on the two innocent ones to control the third  if only out of self protection .     he left .   it was five in the morning .  ryger looked at his watch indignantly .      a hell of a thing .  i want to sleep .        we can curl up here     said talliaferro philosophically .     is anyone planning a confession .     kaunas looked away and ryger   s lip lifted .     i didn   t think so .     talliaferro closed his eyes  leaned his large head back against the chair and said in a tired voice     back on the moon  they   re in the slack season .  we   ve got a two week night and then it   s busy  busy .  then there   s two weeks of sun and there   s nothing but calculations  correlations and bull sessions .  that   s the hard time .  i hate it .  if there were more women  if i could arrange something permanent      in a whisper  kaunas talked about the fact that it was still impossible to get the entire sun above the horizon and in view of the telescope on mercury .  but with another two miles of track soon to be laid down for the observatory  move the whole thing  you know  tremendous forces involved  solar energy used directly  it might be managed .  it would be managed .  even ryger consented to talk of ceres after listening to the low murmur of the other voices .  there was the problem there of the two hour rotation period  which meant the stars whipped across the sky at an angular velocity twelve times that in earth   s sky .  a net of three light scopes  three radio scopes  three of everything  caught the fields of study from one another as they whirled past .     could you use one of the poles .     asked kaunas .     you   re thinking of mercury and the sun     said ryger impatiently .     even at the poles  the sky would still twist  and half of it would be forever hidden .  now if ceres showed only one face to the sun  the way mercury does  we could have a permanent night sky with the stars rotating slowly once in three years .      the sky lightened and it dawned slowly .  talliaferro was half asleep  but he kept hold of half consciousness firmly .  he would not fall asleep and leave the others awake .  each of the three  he thought  was wondering     who .  who .      except the guilty one  of course .  talliaferro   s eyes snapped open as mandel entered again .  the sky  as seen from the window  had grown blue .  talliaferro was glad the window was closed .  the hotel was air conditioned  of course  but windows could be opened during the mild season of the year by those earthmen who fancied the illusion of fresh air .  talliaferro  with moon vacuum on his mind  shuddered at the thought with real discomfort .  mandel said     have any of you anything to say .     they looked at him steadily .  ryger shook his head .  mandel said     i have developed the film in your scanners  gentlemen  and viewed the results .     he tossed scanners and developed slivers of film on to the bed .     nothing .    you   ll have trouble sorting out the film  i   m afraid .  for that i   m sorry .  and now there is still the question of the missing film .        if any     said ryger  and yawned prodigiously .  mandel said     i would suggest we come down to villiers    room  gentlemen .     kaunas looked startled .     why .     talliaferro said     is this psychology .  bring the criminal to the scene of the crime and remorse will wring a confession from him .     mandel said      a less melodramatic reason is that i would like to have the two of you who are innocent help me find the missing film of villiers    paper .        do you think it   s there .     asked ryger challengingly .     possibly .  it   s a beginning .  we can then search each of your rooms .  the symposium on astronautics doesn   t start till tomorrow at    a . m .  we have till then .        and after that .        it may have to be the police .      they stepped gingerly into villiers    room .  ryger was red  kaunas pale .  talliaferro tried to remain calm .  last night they had seen it under artificial lighting with a scowling  disheveled villiers clutching his pillow  staring them down  ordering them away .  now there was the scentless odor of death about it .  mandel fiddled with the window polarizer to let more light in  and adjusted it too far  so that the eastern sun slipped in .  kaunas threw his arm up to shade his eyes and screamed     the sun .     so that all the others froze .  kaunas   s face showed a kind of terror  as though it were his mercurian sun that he had caught a blinding glimpse of .  talliaferro thought of his own reaction to the possibility of open air and his teeth gritted .  they were all bent crooked by their ten years away from earth .  kaunas ran to the window  fumbling for the polarizer  and then the breath came out of him in a huge gasp .  mandel stepped to his side .     what   s wrong .     and the other two joined them .  the city lay stretched below them and outward to the horizon in broken stone and brick  bathed in the rising sun  with the shadowed portions toward them .  talliaferro cast it all a furtive and uneasy glance .  kaunas  his chest seemingly contracted past the point where he could cry out  stared at something much closer .  there  on the outer window sill  one corner secured in a trifling imperfection  a crack in the cement  was an inch long strip of milky gray film  and on it were the early rays of the rising sun .  mandel  with an angry  incoherent cry  threw up the window and snatched it away .  he shielded it in one cupped hand  staring out of hot and reddened eyes .  he said     wait here .     there was nothing to say .  when mandel left  they sat down and stared stupidly at one another .   mandel was back in twenty minutes .  he said quietly  in a voice that gave the impression  somehow  that it was quiet only because its owner had passed far beyond the raving stage      the corner in the crack wasn   t overexposed .  i could make out a few words .  it is villiers    paper .  the rest is ruined  nothing can be salvaged .  it   s gone .        what next .     said talliaferro .  mandel shrugged wearily .     right now  i don   t care .  mass transference is gone until someone as brilliant as villiers works it out again .  i shall work on it but i have no illusions as to my own capacity .  with it gone  i suppose you three don   t matter  guilty or not .  what   s the difference .     his whole body seemed to have loosened and sunk into despair .  but talliaferro   s voice grew hard .     now  hold on .  in your eyes  any of the three of us might be guilty .  i  for instance .  you are a big man in the field and you will never have a good word to say for me .  the general idea may arise that i am incompetent or worse .  i will not be ruined by the shadow of guilt .  now let   s solve this thing .        i am no detective     said mandel wearily .     then call in the police  damn it .     ryger said     wait a while  tal .  are you implying that i   m guilty .        i   m saying that i   m innocent .     kaunas raised his voice in fright .     it will mean the psychic probe for each of us .  there may be mental damage      mandel raised both arms high in the air .     gentlemen .  gentlemen .  please .  there is one thing we might do short of the police  and you are right  dr .  talliaferro  it would be unfair to the innocent to leave this matter here .     they turned to him in various stages of hostility .  ryger said     what do you suggest .        i have a friend named wendell urth .  you may have heard of him  or you may not  but perhaps i can arrange to see him tonight .        what if you can .     demanded talliaferro .     where does that get us .        he   s an odd man     said mandel hesitantly     very odd .  and very brilliant in his way .  he has helped the police before this and he may be able to help us now .      part    edward talliaferro could not forbear staring at the room and its occupant with the greatest astonishment .  it and he seemed to exist in isolation  and to be part of no recognizable world .  the sounds of earth were absent in this well padded  windowless nest .  the light and air of earth had been blanked out in artificial illumination and conditioning .  it was a large room  dim and cluttered .  they had picked their way across a littered floor to a couch from which book films had been brusquely cleared and dumped to one side in a tangle .  the man who owned the room had a large  round face on a stumpy  round body .  he moved quickly about on his short legs  jerking his head as he spoke until his thick glasses all but bounced off the thoroughly inconspicuous nubble that served as a nose .  his thick lidded  somewhat protuberant eyes gleamed in myopic good nature at them all  as he seated himself in his own chair desk combination  lit directly by the one bright light in the room .     so good of you to come  gentlemen .  pray excuse the condition of my room .     he waved stubby fingers in a wide sweeping gesture .     i am engaged in cataloguing the many objects of extraterrological interest i have accumulated .  it is a tremendous job .  for instance      he dodged out of his seat and burrowed in a heap of objects beside the desk till he came up with a smoky gray object  semi translucent and roughly cylindrical .     this     he said     is a callistan object that may be a relic of intelligent nonhuman entities .  it is not decided .  not more than a dozen have been discovered and this is the most perfect single specimen i know of .     he tossed it to one side and talliaferro jumped .  the plump man stared in his direction and said     it   s not breakable .     he sat down again  clasped his pudgy fingers tightly over his abdomen and let them pump slowly in and out as he breathed .      and now what can i do for your    hubert mandel had carried through the introductions and talliaferro was considering deeply .  surely it was a man named wendell urth who had written a recent book entitled comparative evolutionary processes on water oxygen planets  and surely this could not be the man .  he said      are you the author of comparative evolutionary processes  dr .  urth .     a beatific smile spread across urth   s face     you   ve read it .        well  no  i haven   t  but      urth   s expression grew instantly censorious .     then you should .  right now .  here  i have a copy      he bounced out of his chair again and mandel cried at once     now wait  urth  first things first .  this is serious .     he virtually forced urth back into his chair and began speaking rapidly as though to prevent any further side issues from erupting .  he told the whole story with admirable word economy .  urth reddened slowly as he listened .  he seized his glasses and shoved them higher up on his nose .     mass transference .     he cried .     i saw it with my own eyes     said mandel .     and you never told me .        i was sworn to secrecy .  the man was  peculiar .  i explained that .     urth pounded the desk .     how could you allow such a discovery to remain the property of an eccentric  mandel .  the knowledge should have been forced from him by psychic probe  if necessary .        it would have killed him     protested mandel .  but urth was rocking back and forth with his hands clasped tightly to his cheeks .     mass transference .  the only way a decent  civilized man should travel .  the only possible way .  the only conceivable way .  if i had known it .  if i could have been there .  but the hotel is nearly thirty miles away .     ryger  who listened with an expression of annoyance on his face  interposed     i understand there   s a flitter line direct to convention hall .  it could have gotten you there in ten minutes .     urth stiffened and looked at ryger strangely .  his cheeks bulged .  he jumped to his feet and scurried out of the room .  ryger said     what the devil .     mandel muttered     damn it .  i should have warned you .        about what .        dr .  urth doesn   t travel on any sort of conveyance .  it   s a phobia .  he moves about only on foot .     kaunas blinked about in the dimness .     but he   s an extraterrologist  isn   t he .  an expert on life forms of other planets .     talliaferro had risen and now stood before a galactic lens on a pedestal .  he stared at the inner gleam of the star systems .  he had never seen a lens so large or so elaborate .  mandel said     he   s an extraterrologist  yes  but he   s never visited any of the planets on which he is expert and he never will .  in thirty years  i doubt if he   s ever been more than a mile from this room .     ryger laughed .  mandel flushed angrily .     you may find it funny  but i   d appreciate your being careful what you say when dr .  urth comes back .     urth sidled in a moment later .     my apologies  gentlemen     he said in a whisper .     and now let us approach our problem .  perhaps one of you wishes to confess .     talliaferro   s lips quirked sourly .  this plump  self imprisoned extraterrologist was scarcely formidable enough to force a confession from anyone .  fortunately  there would be no need of his detective talents  if any  after all .  talliaferro said     dr .  urth  are you connected with the police .     a certain smugness seemed to suffuse urth   s ruddy face .     i have no official connection  dr .  talliaferro  but my unofficial relationships are very good indeed .        in that case  i will give you some information which you can carry to the police .     urth drew in his abdomen and hitched at his shirttail .  it came free  and slowly he polished his glasses with it .  when he was quite through and had perched them precariously on his nose once more  he said      and what is that .        i will tell you who was present when villiers died and who scanned his paper .        you have solved the mystery .        i   ve thought about it all day .  i think i   ve solved it .     talliaferro rather enjoyed the sensation he was creating .     well  then .     talliaferro took a deep breath .  this was not going to be easy to do  though he had been planning it for hours .     the guilty man     he said     is obviously dr .  hubert mandel .          mandel stared at talliaferro in sudden  hard breathing indignation .     look here  doctor     he began  loudly     if you have any basis for such a ridiculous      urth   s tenor voice soared above the interruption .     let him talk  hubert  let us hear him .  you suspected him and there is no law that forbids him to suspect you .     mandel fell angrily silent .  talliaferro  not allowing his voice to falter  said     it is more than just suspicion  dr .  urth .  the evidence is perfectly plain .  four of us knew about mass transference  but only one of us  dr .  mandel  had actually seen a demonstration .  he knew it to be a fact .  he knew a paper on the subject existed .  we three knew only that villiers was more or less unbalanced .  oh  we might have thought there was just a chance .  we visited him at eleven  i think  just to check on that  though none of us actually said so  but he just acted crazier than ever .     check special knowledge and motive then on dr .  mandel   s side .  now  dr .  urth  picture something else .  whoever it was who confronted villiers at midnight  saw him collapse  and scanned his paper  let   s keep him anonymous for a moment  must have been terribly startled to see villiers apparently come to life again and to hear him talking into the telephone .  our criminal  in the panic of the moment  realized one thing  he must get rid of the one piece of incriminating material evidence .     he had to get rid of the undeveloped film of the paper and he had to do it in such a way that it would be safe from discovery so that he might pick it up once more if he remained unsuspected .  the outer window sill was ideal .  quickly he threw up villiers    window  placed the strip of film outside  and left .  now  even if villiers survived or if his telephoning brought results  it would be merely villiers    word against his own and it would be easy to show that villiers was unbalanced .     talliaferro paused in something like triumph .  this would be irrefutable .  wendell urth blinked at him and    wiggled the thumbs of his clasped hands so that they slapped against his ample shirt front .  he said      and the significance of all that .        the significance is that the window was thrown open and the film placed in open air .  now ryger has lived for ten years on ceres  kaunas on mercury  ion the moon  barring short leaves and not many of them .  we commented to one another several times yesterday on the difficulty of growing acclimated to earth .     our work worlds are each airless objects .  we never go out in the open without a suit .  to expose ourselves to unenclosed space is unthinkable .  none of us could have opened the window without a severe inner struggle .  dr .  mandel  however  has lived on earth exclusively .  opening a window to him is only a matter of a bit of muscular exertion .  he could do it .  we couldn   t ergo  he did it .     talliaferro sat back and smiled a bit .     space  that   s it .     cried ryger  with enthusiasm .     that   s not it at all     roared mandel  half rising as though tempted to throw himself at talliaferro .     i deny the whole miserable fabrication .  what about the record i have of villiers    phone call .  he used the word    classmate .     the entire tape makes it obvious         he was a dying man     said talliaferro .     much of what he said you admitted was incomprehensible .  i ask you  dr .  mandel  without having heard the tape  if it isn   t true that villiers    voice is distorted past recognition .        well      said mandel in confusion .     i   m sure it is .  there is no reason to suppose  then  that you might not have rigged up the tape in advance  complete with the damning word    classmates .         mandel said     good lord  how would i know there were classmates at the convention .  how would i know they knew about the mass transference .        villiers might have told you .  i presume he did .        now  look     said mandel     you three saw villiers alive at eleven .  the medical examiner  seeing villiers    body shortly after   a . m .  declared he had been dead at least two hours .  that was certain .  the time of death  therefore  was between    p . m .  and   a . m .  i was at a late conference last night .  i can prove my whereabouts  miles from the hotel  between       and      by a dozen witnesses no one of whom anyone can possibly question .  is that enough for you .     talliaferro paused a moment .  then he went on stubbornly     even so .  suppose you got back to the hotel by      .  you went to villiers    room to discuss his talk .  you found the door open  or you had a duplicate key .  anyway  you found him dead .  you seized the opportunity to scan the paper         and if he were already dead  and couldn   t make phone calls  why should i hide the film .        to remove suspicion .  you may have a second copy of the film safe in your possession .  for that matter  we have only your own word that the paper itself was destroyed .        enough .  enough     cried urth .     it is an interesting hypothesis  dr .  talliaferro  but it falls to the ground of its own weight .     talliaferro frowned .     that   s your opinion  perhaps         it would be anyone   s opinion .  anyone  that is  with the power of human thought .  don   t you see that hubert mandel did too much to be the criminal .        no     said talliaferro .  wendell urth smiled benignly .     as a scientist  dr .  talliaferro  you undoubtedly know better than to fall in love with your own theories to the exclusion of facts and reasoning .  do me the pleasure of behaving similarly as a detective .     consider that if dr .  mandel had brought about the death of villiers and faked an alibi  or if he had found villiers dead and taken advantage of that  how little he would really have had to do .  why scan the paper or even pretend that anyone had done so .  he could simply have taken the paper .  who else knew of its existence .  nobody  really .  there is no reason to think villiers told anyone else about it .  villiers was pathologically secretive .  there would have been every reason to think that he told no one .     no one knew villiers was giving a talk  except dr .  mandel .  it wasn   t announced .  no abstract was published .  dr .  mandel could have walked off with the paper in perfect confidence .     even if he had discovered that villiers had talked to his classmates about the matter  what of it .  what evidence would his classmates have except the word of one whom they are themselves half willing to consider a madman .     by announcing instead that villiers    paper had been destroyed  by declaring his death to be not entirely natural  by searching for a scanned copy of the film  in short by everything dr .  mandel has done  he has aroused a suspicion that only he could possibly have aroused when he need only have remained quiet to have committed a perfect crime .  if he were the criminal  he would be more stupid  more colossally obtuse than anyone i have ever known .  and dr .  mandel  after all  is none of that .     talliaferro thought hard but found nothing to say .  ryger said     then who did do it .        one of you three .  that   s obvious .        but which .        oh  that   s obvious  too .  i knew which of you was guilty the moment dr .  mandel had completed his description of events .      talliaferro stared at the plump extraterrologist with distaste .  the bluff did not frighten him  but it was affecting the other two .  ryger   s lips were thrust out and kaunas   s lower jaw had relaxed moronically .  they looked like fish  both of them .  he said     which one  then .  tell us .     urth blinked .     first  i want to make it perfectly plain that the important thing is mass transference .  it can still be recovered .     mandel  scowling still  said querulously     what the devil are you talking about  urth .        the man who scanned the paper probably looked at what he was scanning .  i doubt that he had the time or presence of mind to read it  and if he did  i doubt if he could remember it  consciously .  however  there is the psychic probe .  if he even glanced at the paper  what impinged on his retina could be probed .     there was an uneasy stir .  urth said at once     no need to be afraid of the probe .  proper handling is safe  particularly if a man offers himself voluntarily .  when damage is done  it is usually because of unnecessary resistance  a kind of mental tearing  you know .  so if the guilty man will voluntarily confess  place himself in my hands      talliaferro laughed .  the sudden noise rang out sharply in the dim quiet of the room .  the psychology was so transparent and artless .  wendell urth looked almost bewildered at the reaction and stared earnestly at talliaferro over his glasses .  he said     i have enough influence with the police to keep the probing entirely confidential .     ryger said savagely     i didn   t do it .     kaunas shook his head .  talliaferro disdained any answer .  urth sighed .     then i will have to point out the guilty man .  it will be traumatic .  it will make things harder .     he tightened the grip on his belly and his fingers twitched .     dr .  talliaferro pointed out that the film was hidden on the outer window sill so that it might remain safe from discovery and from harm .  i agree with him .        thank you     said talliaferro dryly .     however  why should anyone think that an outer window sill is a particularly safe hiding place .  the police would certainly look there .  even in the absence of the police it was discovered .  who would tend to consider anything outside a building as particularly safe .  obviously  some person who has lived a long time on an airless world and has had it drilled into him that no one goes outside an enclosed place without detailed precautions .     to someone on the moon  for instance  anything hidden outside a lunar dome would be comparatively safe .  men venture out only rarely and then only on specific business .  so he would overcome the hardship of opening a window and exposing himself to what he would subconsciously consider a vacuum for the sake of a safe hiding place .  the reflex thought  outside an inhabited structure is safe     would do the trick .     talliaferro said between clenched teeth     why do you mention the moon  dr .  urth .     urth said blandly     only as an example .  what i   ve said so far applies to all three of you .  but now comes the crucial point  the matter of the dying night .     talliaferro frowned .     you mean the night villiers died .        i mean any night .  see here  even granted that an outer window sill was a safe hiding place  which of you would be mad enough to consider it a safe hiding place for a piece of unexposed film .  scanner film isn   t very sensitive  to be sure  and is made to be developed under all sorts of hit and miss conditions .  diffuse nighttime illumination wouldn   t seriously affect it  but diffuse daylight would ruin it in a few minutes  and direct sunlight would ruin it at once .  everyone knows that .     mandel said     go ahead  urth .  what is this leading to .        you   re trying to rush me     said urth  with a massive pout .     i want you to see this clearly .  the criminal wanted  above all  to keep the film safe .  it was his only record of something of supreme value to himself and to the world .  why would he put it where it would inevitably be ruined by the morning sun .    only because he did not expect the morning sun ever to come .  he thought the night  so to speak  was immortal .     but nights aren   t immortal .  on earth  they die and give way to daytime .  even the six month polar night is a dying night eventually .  the nights on ceres last only two hours  the nights on the moon last two weeks .  they are dying nights  too  and dr .  talliaferro and ryger know that day must always come .     kaunas was on his feet .     but wait      wendell urth faced him full .     no longer any need to wait  dr .  kaunas .  mercury is the only sizable object in the solar system that turns only one face to the sun .  even taking libration into account  fully three eighths of its surface is true dark side and never sees the sun .  the polar observatory is at the rim of that dark side .  for ten years  you have grown used to the fact that nights are immortal  that a surface in darkness remains eternally in darkness  and so you entrusted unexposed film to earth   s night  forgetting in your excitement that night must die      kaunas stumbled forward .     wait      urth was inexorable .     i am told that when mandel adjusted the polarizer in villiers    room  you screamed at the sunlight .  was that your ingrained fear of mercurian sun  or your sudden realization of what sunlight meant to your plans .  you rushed forward .  was that to adjust the polarizer or to stare at the ruined film .     kaunas fell to his knees .     i didn   t mean it .  i wanted to speak to him  only to speak to him  and he screamed and collapsed .  i thought he was dead and the paper was under his pillow and it all just followed .  one thing led on to another and before i knew it  i couldn   t get out of it anymore .  but i meant none of it .  i swear it .     they had formed a semicircle about him and wendell urth stared at the moaning kaunas with pity in his eyes .   an ambulance had come and gone .  talliaferro finally brought himself to say stiffly to mandel     i hope  sir  there will be no hard feelings for anything said here .     and mandel had answered  as stiffly     i think we had all better forget as much as possible of what has happened during the last twenty four hours .     they were standing in the doorway  ready to leave  and wendell urth ducked his smiling head  and said     there   s the question of my fee  you know .     mandel looked startled .     not money     said urth at once .     but when the first mass transference setup for humans is established  i want a trip arranged for me .     mandel continued to look anxious .     now  wait .  trips through outer space are a long way off .     urth shook his head rapidly .     not outer space .  not at all .  i would like to step across to lower falls  new hampshire .         all right .  but why .     urth looked up .  to talliaferro   s outright surprise  the extraterrologist   s face wore an expression compounded of shyness and eagerness .  urth said     i once  quite a long time ago  knew a girl there .  it   s been many years  but i sometimes wonder       afterword  some readers may realize that this story  first published in       has been overtaken by events .  in       astronomers discovered that mercury does not keep one side always to the sun  but has a period of rotation of about fifty four days  so that all parts of it are exposed to sunlight at one time or another .  well  what can i do except say that i wish astronomers would get things right to begin with .  and i certainly refuse to change the story to suit their whims .   anniversary  the annual ritual was all set .  it was the turn of moore   s house this year  of course  and mrs .  moore and the children had resignedly gone to her mother   s for the evening .  warren moore surveyed the room with a faint smile .  only mark brandon   s enthusiasm kept it going at the first  but he himself had come to like this mild remembrance .  it came with age  he supposed  twenty additional years of it .  he had grown paunchy  thin haired  soft jowled  and  worst of all  sentimental .  so all the windows were polarized into complete darkness and the drapes were drawn .  only occasional stipples of wall were illuminated  thus celebrating the poor lighting and the terrible isolation of that day of wreckage long ago .  there were spaceship rations in sticks and tubes on the table and  of course  in the center an unopened bottle of sparkling green jabra water  the potent brew that only the chemical activity of martian fungi could supply .  moore looked at his watch .  brandon would be here soon  he was never late for this occasion .  the only thing that disturbed him was the memory of brandon   s voice on the tube     warren  i have a surprise for you this time .  wait and see .  wait and see .     brandon  it always seemed to moore  aged little .  the younger man had kept his slimness  and the intensity with which he greeted all in life  to the verge of his fortieth birthday .  he retained the ability to be in high excitement over the good and in deep despair over the bad .  his hair was going gray  but except for that  when brandon walked up and down  talking rapidly at the top of his voice about anything at all  moore didn   t even have to close his eyes to see the panicked youngster on the wreck of the silver queen .  the door signal sounded and moore kicked the release without turning around .     come  mark .     it was a strange voice that answered  though  softly  tentatively     mr .  moore .     moore turned quickly .  brandon was there  to be sure  but only in the background  grinning with excitement .  someone else was standing before him  short  squat  quite bald  nut brown and with the feel of space about him .  moore said wonderingly     mike shea  mike shea  by all space .     they pounded hands together  laughing .  brandon said     he got in touch with me through the office .  he remembered i was with atomic products         it   s been years     said moore .     let   s see  you were on earth twelve years ago         he   s never been here on an anniversary     said brandon .     how about that .  he   s retiring now .  getting out of space to a place he   s buying in arizona .  he came to say hello before he left  stopped off at the city just for that  and i was sure he came for the anniversary .     what anniversary .     says the old jerk .     shea nodded  grinning .     he said you made a kind of celebration out of it every year .     .     you bet     said brandon enthusiastically     and this will be the first one with all three of us here  the first real anniversary .  it   s twenty years  mike  twenty years since warren scrambled over what was left of the wreck and brought us down to vesta .     shea looked about .     space ration  eh .  that   s old home week to me .  and jabra .  oh  sure  i remember .  .  . twenty years .  i never give it a thought and now  all of a sudden  it   s yesterday .  remember when we got back to earth finally .        do i .     said brandon .     the parades  the speeches .  warren was the only real hero of the occasion and we kept saying so  and they kept paying no attention .  remember .        oh  well     said moore .     we were the first three men ever to survive a spaceship crash .  we were unusual and anything unusual is worth a celebration .  these things are irrational .        hey     said shea .     any of you remember the songs they wrote .  that marching one .     you can sing of routes through space and the weary maddened pace of the          brandon joined in with his clear tenor and even moore added his voice to the chorus so that the last line was loud enough to shake the drapes .     on the wreck of the silver que e en     they roared out  and ended laughing wildly .  brandon said     let   s open the jabra for the first little sip .  this one bottle has to last all of us all night .     moore said     mark insists on complete authenticity .  i   m surprised he doesn   t expect me to climb out the window and human fly my way around the building .        well  now  that   s an idea     said brandon .     remember the last toast we made .     shea held his empty glass before him and intoned         gentlemen  i give you the year   s supply of good old h o we used to have .     three drunken bums when we landed .  well  we were kids .  i was thirty and i thought i was old .  and now     his voice was suddenly wistful     they   ve retired me .        drink .     said brandon .     today you   re thirty again  and we remember the day on the silver queen even if no one else does .  dirty  fickle public .     moore laughed .     what do you expect .  a national holiday every year with space ration and jabra  the ritual food and drink .        listen  we   re still the only men ever to survive a spaceship crash and now look at us .  we   re in oblivion .        it   s pretty good oblivion .  we had a good time to begin with and the publicity gave us a healthy boost up the ladder .  we are doing well  mark .  and so would mike shea be if he hadn   t wanted to return to space .     shea grinned and shrugged his shoulder .     that   s where i like to be .  i   m not sorry  either .  what with the insurance compensation i got  i have a nice piece of cash now to retire on .     brandon said reminiscently     the wreck set back transspace .  insurance a real packet just the same  there   s still something missing .  you say    silver queen    to anyone these days and he can only think of quentin  if he can think of anyone .        who .     said shea .     quentin .  dr .  horace quentin  he was one of the nonsurvivors on the ship .  you say to anyone     what about the three men who survived .     and they   ll just stare at you .     huh .     they   ll say .     moore said calmly     come  mark  face it .  dr .  quentin was one of the world   s great scientists and we three are just three of the world   s nothings .        we survived .  we   re still the only men on record to survive .        so .  look  john hester was on the ship  and he was an important scientist too .  not in quentin   s league  but important .  as a matter of fact  i was next to him at the last dinner before the rock hit us .  well  just because quentin died in the same wreck  hester   s death was drowned out .  no one ever remembers hester died on the silver queen .  they only remember quentin .  we may be forgotten too  but at least we   re alive .        i tell you what     said brandon after a period of silence during which moore   s rationale had obviously failed to take     we   re marooned again .  twenty years ago today  we were marooned off vesta .  today  we   re marooned in oblivion .  now here are the three of us back together again at last  and what happened before can happen again .  twenty years ago  warren pulled us down to vesta .  now let   s solve this new problem .        wipe out the oblivion  you mean .     said moore .     make ourselves famous .        sure .  why not .  do you know of any better way of celebrating a twentieth anniversary .        no  but i   d be interested to know where you expect to start .  i don   t think people remember the silver queen at all  except for quentin  so you   ll have to think of some way of bringing the wreck back to mind .  that   s just to begin with .     shea stirred uneasily and a thoughtful expression crossed his blunt countenance .     some people remember the silver queen .  the insurance company does  and you know that   s a funny thing  now that you bring up the matter .  i was on vesta about ten eleven years ago  and i asked if the piece of wreck we brought down was still there and they said sure  who would cart it away .  so i thought i   d take a look at it and shot over by reaction motor strapped to my back .  with vestan gravity  you know  a reaction motor is all you need .  anyway  i didn   t get to see it except from a distance .  it was circled off by force field .     brandon   s eyebrows went sky high .     our silver queen .  for what reason .        i went back and asked how come .  they didn   t tell me and they said they didn   t know i was going there .  they said it belonged to the insurance company .     moore nodded .     surely .  they took over when they paid off .  i signed a release  giving up my salvage rights when i accepted the compensation check .  you did too  i   m sure .     brandon said     but why the force field .  why all the privacy .        i don   t know .        the wreck isn   t worth anything even as scrap metal .  it would cost too much to transport it .     shea said     that   s right .  funny thing  though  they were bringing pieces back from space .  there was a pile of it there .  i could see it and it looked like just junk  twisted pieces of frame  you know .  i asked about it and they said ships were always landing and unloading more scrap  and the insurance company had a standard price for any piece of the silver queen brought back  so ships in the neighborhood of vesta were always looking .  then  on my last voyage in  i went to see the silver queen again and that pile was a lot bigger .        you mean they   re still looking .     brandon   s eyes glittered .     i don   t know .  maybe they   ve stopped .  but the pile was bigger than it was ten eleven years ago so they were still looking then .     brandon leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs .     well  now  that   s very queer .  a hard headed insurance company is spending all kinds of money  sweeping space near vesta  trying to find pieces of a twenty year old wreck .        maybe they   re trying to prove sabotage     said moore .     after twenty years .  they won   t get their money back even if they do .  it   s a dead issue .        they may have quit looking years ago .     brandon stood up with decision .     let   s ask .  there   s something funny here and i   m just jabrified enough and anniversaried enough to want to find out .        sure     said shea     but ask who .        ask multivac     said brandon .  shea   s eyes opened wide .     multivac .  say  mr .  moore  do you have a multivac outlet here .        yes .        i   ve never seen one  and i   ve always wanted to .        it   s nothing to look at  mike .  it looks just like a typewriter .  don   t confuse a multivac outlet with multivac itself .  i don   t know anyone who   s seen multivac .     moore smiled at the thought .  he doubted if ever in his life he would meet any of the handful of technicians who spent most of their working days in a hidden spot in the bowels of earth tending a mile long super computer that was the repository of all the facts known to man  that guided man   s economy  directed his scientific research  helped make his political decisions  and had millions of circuits left over to answer individual questions that did not violate the ethics of privacy .  brandon said as they moved up the power ramp to the second floor     i   ve been thinking of installing a multivac  jr .   outlet for the kids .  homework and things  you know .  and yet i don   t want to make it just a fancy and expensive crutch for them .  how do you work it  warren .     moore said tersely .     they show me the questions first .  if i don   t pass them  multivac does not see them .     the multivac outlet was indeed a simple typewriter arrangement and little more .  moore set up the co ordinates that opened his portion of the planet wide network of circuits and said     now listen .  for the record  i   m against this and i   m only going along because it   s the anniversary and because i   m just jackass enough to be curious .  now how ought i to phrase the question .     brandon said     just ask  are pieces of the wreck of the silver queen still being searched for in the neighborhood of vesta by trans space insurance .  it only requires a simple yes or no .     moore shrugged and tapped it out  while shea watched with awe .  the spaceman said     how does it answer .  does it talk .     moore laughed gently     oh  no .  i don   t spend that kind of money .  this model just prints the answer on a slip of tape that comes out that slot .     a short strip of tape did come out as he spoke .  moore removed it and  after a glance  said     well  multivac says yes .        hah .     cried brandon .     told you .  now ask why .        now that   s silly .  a question like that would obviously be against privacy .  you   ll just get a yellow state your reason .        ask and find out .  they haven   t made the search for the pieces secret .  maybe they   re not making the reason secret .     moore shrugged .  he tapped out  why is trans space insurance conducting its silver queen search project to which reference was made in the previous question .  a yellow slip clicked out almost at once  state your reason for requiring the information requested .     all right     said brandon unabashed .     you tell it we   re the three survivors and have a right to know .  go ahead .  tell it .     moore tapped that out in unemotional phrasing and another yellow slip was pushed out at them  your reason is insufficient .  no answer can be given .  brandon said     i don   t see they have a right to keep that secret .        that   s up to multivac     said moore .     it judges the reasons given it and if it decides the ethics of privacy is against answering  that   s it .  the government itself couldn   t break those ethics without a court order  and the courts don   t go against multivac once in ten years .  so what are you going to do .     brandon jumped to his feet and began the rapid walk up and down the room that was so characteristic of him    all right  then let   s figure it out for ourselves .  it   s something important to justify all their trouble .  we   re agreed they   re not trying to find evidence of sabotage  not after twenty years .  but trans space must be looking for something  something so valuable that it   s worth looking for all this time .  now what could be that valuable .        mark  you   re a dreamer     said moore .  brandon obviously didn   t hear him .     it can   t be jewels or money or securities .  there just couldn   t be enough to pay them back for what the search has already cost them .  not if the silver queen were pure gold .  what would be more valuable .        you can   t judge value  mark     said moore .     a letter might be worth a hundredth of a cent as wastepaper and yet make a difference of a hundred million dollars to a corporation  depending on what   s in the letter .     brandon nodded his head vigorously .     right .  documents .  valuable papers .  now who would be most likely to have papers worth billions in his possession on that trip .        how could anyone possibly say .        how about dr .  horace quentin .  how about that  warren .  he   s the one people remember because he was so important .  what about the papers he might have had with him .  details of a new discovery  maybe .  damn it  if i had only seen him on that trip  he might have told me something  just in casual conversation  you know .  did you ever see him  warren .        not that i recall .  not to talk to .  so casual conversation with me is out too .  of course  i might have passed him at some time without knowing it .        no  you wouldn   t have     said shea  suddenly thoughtful .     i think i remember something .  there was one passenger who never left his cabin .  the steward was talking about it .  he wouldn   t even come out for meals .        and that was quentin .     said brandon  stopping his pacing and staring at the spaceman eagerly .     it might have been  mr .  brandon .  it might have been him .  i don   t know that anyone said it was .  i don   t remember .  but it must have been a big shot  because on a spaceship you don   t fool around bringing meals to a man   s cabin unless he is a big shot .        and quentin was the big shot on the trip     said brandon  with satisfaction .     so he had something in his cabin .  something very important .  something he was concealing .        he might just have been space sick     said moore     except that      he frowned and fell silent .     go ahead     said brandon urgently .     you remember something too .        maybe .  i told you i was sitting next to dr .  hester at the last dinner .  he was saying something about hoping to meet dr .  quentin on the trip and not having any luck .        sure     cried brandon     because quentin wouldn   t come out of his cabin .        he didn   t say that .  we got to talking about quentin  though .  now what was it he said .     moore put his hands to his temples as though trying to squeeze out the memory of twenty years ago by main force .     i can   t give you the exact words  of course  but it was something about quentin being very theatrical or a slave of drama or something like that  and they were heading out to some scientific conference on ganymede and quentin wouldn   t even announce the title of his paper .        it all fits .     brandon resumed his rapid pacing .     he had a new  great discovery  which he was keeping absolutely secret  because he was going to spring it on the ganymede conference and get maximum drama out of it .  he wouldn   t come out of his cabin because he probably thought hester would pump him  and hester would  i   ll bet .  and then the ship hit the rock and quentin was killed .  trans space insurance investigated  got rumors of this new discovery and figured that if they gained control of it they could make back their losses and plenty more .  so they took ownership of the ship and have been hunting for .  quentin   s papers among the pieces ever since .     moore smiled  in absolute affection for the other man .     mark  that   s a beautiful story .  the whole evening is worth it  just watching you make something out of nothing .        oh  yeah .  something out of nothing .  let   s ask multivac again .  i   ll pay the bill for it this month .        it   s all right .  be my guest .  if you don   t mind  though  i   m going to bring up the bottle of jabra .  i want one more little shot to catch up with you .        me  too     said shea .  brandon took his seat at the typewriter .  his fingers trembled with eagerness as he tapped out  what was the nature of dr .  horace quentin   s final investigations .  moore had returned with the bottle and glasses  when the answer came back  on white paper this time .  the answer was long and the print was fine  consisting for the most part of references to scientific papers in journals twenty years old .  moore went over it .     i   m no physicist  but it looks to me as though he was interested in optics .     brandon shook his head impatiently .     but all that is published .  we want something he had not published yet .        we   ll never find out anything about that .        the insurance company did .        that   s just your theory .     brandon was kneading his chin with an unsteady hand .     let me ask multivac one more question .     he sat down again and tapped out  give me the name and tube number of the surviving colleagues of dr .  horace quentin from among those associated with him at the university on whose faculty he served .     how do you know he was on a university faculty .     asked moore .     if not  multivac will tell us .      a slip popped out .  it contained only one name .  moore said      are you planning to call the man .        i sure am     said brandon .     otis fitzsimmons  with a detroit tube number .  warren  may i         be my guest  mark .  it   s still part of the game .     brandon set up the combination on moore   s tube keyboard .  a woman   s voice answered .  brandon asked for dr .  fitzsimmons and there was a short wait .  then a thin voice said     hello .     it sounded old .  brandon said     dr .  fitzsimmons  i   m representing transspace insurance in the matter of the late dr .  horace quentin         for heaven   s sake  mark     whispered moore  but brandon held up a sharply restraining hand .  there was a pause so long that a tube breakdown began to seem possible and then the old voice said      after all these years .  again .     brandon snapped his fingers in an irrepressible gesture of triumph .  but he said smoothly  almost glibly     we   re still trying to find out  doctor  if you have remembered further details about what dr .  quentin might have had with him on that last trip that would pertain to his last unpublished discovery .        well     there was an impatient clicking of the tongue     i   ve told you  i don   t know .  i don   t want to be bothered with this again .  i don   t know that there was anything .  the man hinted  but he was always hinting about some gadget or other .        what gadget  sir .        i tell you i don   t know .  he used a name once and i told you about that .  i don   t think it   s significant .        we don   t have the name in our records  sir .        well  you should have .  uh  what was that name .  an optikon  that   s it .        with a k .        c or k .  i don   t know or care .  now  please  i do not wish to be disturbed again about this .  good bye .     he was still mumbling querulously when the line went dead .  brandon was pleased .  moore said     mark  that was the stupidest thing you could have done .  claiming a fraudulent identity on the tube is illegal .  if he wants to make trouble for you         why should he .  he   s forgotten about it already .  but don   t you see  warren .  trans space has been asking him about this .  he kept saying he   d explained all this before .        all right .  but you   d assumed that much .  what else do you know .        we also know     said brandon     that quentin   s gadget was called an optikon .         fitzsimmons didn   t sound certain about that .  and even so  since we already know he was specializing in optics toward the end  a name like optikon does not push us any further forward .         and trans space insurance is looking either for the optikon or for papers concerning it .  maybe quentin kept the details in his hat and just had a model of the instrument .  after all  shea said they were picking up metal objects .  right .        there was a bunch of metal junk in the pile     agreed shea .     they   d leave that in space if it were papers they were after .  so that   s what we want  an instrument that might be called an optikon .        even if all your theories were correct  mark  and we   re looking for an optikon  the search is absolutely hopeless now     said moore flatly .     i doubt that more than ten per cent of the debris would remain in orbit about vesta .  vesta   s escape velocity is practically nothing .  it was just a lucky thrust in a lucky direction and at a lucky velocity that put our section of the wreck in orbit .  the rest is gone  scattered .  all over the solar system in any conceivable orbit about the sun .        they   ve been picking up pieces     said brandon .     yes  the ten per cent that managed to make a vestan orbit out of it .  that   s all .     brandon wasn   t giving up .  he said thoughtfully     suppose it were there and they hadn   t found it .  could someone have beat them to it .     mike shea laughed .     we were right there  but we sure didn   t walk off with anything but our skins  and glad to do that much .  who else .        that   s right     agreed moore     and if anyone else picked it up  why are they keeping it a secret .        maybe they don   t know what it is .        then how do we go about      moore broke off and turned to shea     what did you say .     shea looked blank .     who  me .        just now  about us being there .     moore   s eyes narrowed .  he shook his head as though to clear it  then whispered     great galaxy .        what is it .     asked brandon tensely .     what   s the matter  warren .        i   m not sure .  you   re driving me mad with your theories  so mad  i   m beginning to take them seriously  i think .  you know  we did take some things out of the wreck with us .  i mean besides our clothes and what personal belongings we still had .  or a  least i did .        what .        it was when i was making my way across the outside of the wreckage  space  i seem to be there now  i see it so clearly  i picked up some items and put them in the pocket of my spacesuit .  i don   t know why  i wasn   t myself  really .  i did it without thinking .  and then  well  i held on to them .  souvenirs  i suppose .  i brought them back to earth .        where are they .        i don   t know .  we haven   t stayed in one place  you know .        you didn   t throw them out  did you .        no  but things do get lost when you move .        if you didn   t throw them out  they must be somewhere in this house .     .     if they didn   t get lost .  i swear i don   t recall seeing them in fifteen years .        what were they .     warren moore said     one was a fountain pen  as i recall  a real antique  the kind that used an ink spray cartridge .  what gets me  though  is that the other was a small field glass  not more than about six inches long .  you see what i mean .  a field glass .        an optikon     shouted brandon .     sure .        it   s just a coincidence     said moore  trying to remain level headed .     just a curious coincidence .     but brandon wasn   t having it .     a coincidence  nuts .  transspace couldn   t find the optikon on the wreck and they couldn   t find it in space because you had it all along .        you   re crazy .        come on  we   ve got to find the thing now .     moore blew out his breath .     well  i   ll look  if that   s what you want  but i doubt that i   ll find it .  okay  let   s start with the storage level .  that   s the logical place .     shea chuckled .     the logical place is usually the worst place to look .     but they all headed for the power ramp once more and the additional flight upward .   the storage level had a musty  unused odor to it .  moore turned on the precipitron .     i don   t think we   ve precipitated the dust in two years .  that shows you how often i   m up here .  now  let   s see  if it   s anywhere at all  it would be in with the bachelor collection .  i mean the junk i   ve been hanging on to since bachelor days .  we can start here .     moore started leafing through the contents of plastic collapsibles while brandon kept peering anxiously over his shoulder .  moore said     what do you know .  my college yearbook .  i was a sonist in those days  a real bug on it .  in fact  i managed to get a voice recording with the picture of every senior in this book .     he tapped its cover fondly .     you could swear there was nothing there but the usual trimensional photos  but each one has an imprisoned      he grew aware of brandon   s frown and said     okay  i   ll keep looking .     he gave up the collapsibles and opened a trunk of heavy  old fashioned woodite .  he separated the contents of the various compartments .  brandon said     hey  is that it .     he pointed to a small cylinder that rolled out on the floor with a small clunk .  moore said     i don   t  yes .  that   s the pen .  there it is .  and here   s the field glass .  neither one works  of course .  they   re both broken .  at least  i suppose the pen   s broken .  something   s loose and rattles in it .  hear .  i wouldn   t have the slightest idea about how to fill it so i can check whether it really works .  they haven   t even made ink spray cartridges in years .     brandon held it under the light .     it has initials on it .        oh .  i don   t remember noticing any .        it   s pretty worn down .  it looks like j . k . q .        q .   .        right  and that   s an unusual letter with which to start a last name .  this pen might have belonged to quentin .  an heirloom he kept for luck or sentiment .  it might have belonged to a great grandfather in the days when they used pens like this  a great grandfather called jason knight quentin or judah kent quentin or something like that .  we can check the names of quentin   s ancestors through multivac .     moore nodded .     i think maybe we should .  see  you   ve got me as crazy as you are .        and if this is so  it proves you picked it up in quentin   s room .  so you picked up the field glass there too .        now hold it .  i don   t remember that i picked them both up in the same place .  i don   t remember the scrounging over the outside of the wreck that well .     brandon turned the small field glass over and over under the light .     no initials here .        did you expect any .        i don   t see anything  in fact  except this narrow joining mark here .     he ran his thumbnail into the fine groove that circled the glass near its thicker end .  he tried to twist it unsuccessfully .     one piece .     he put it to his eye .     this thing doesn   t work .        i told you it was broken .  no lenses      shea broke in .     you   ve got to expect a little damage when a spaceship hits a good sized meteor and goes to pieces .        so even if this were it     said moore  pessimistic again     if this were the optikon  it would not do us any good .     he took the field glass from brandon and felt along the empty rims .     you can   t even tell where the lenses belonged .  there   s no groove i can feel into which they might have been seated .  it   s as if there never  hey .     he exploded the syllable violently .     hey what .     said brandon .     the name .  the name of the thing .        optikon  you mean .        optikon  i don   t mean .  fitzsimmons  on the tube  called it an optikon and we thought he said    an optikon .            well  he did     said brandon .     sure     said shea .     i heard him .        you just thought you heard him .  he said    anoptikon .     don   t you get it .  not    an optikon     two words     anoptikon     one word .        oh     said brandon blankly .     and what   s the difference .         a hell of a difference .      an optikon    would mean an instrument with lenses  but    anoptikon     one word  has the greek prefix    an     which means    no .     words of greek derivation use it for    no .     anarchy means    no government     anemia means    no blood     anonymous means    no name     and anoptikon means         no lenses     cried brandon .     right .  quentin must have been working on an optical device without lenses and this may be it and it may not be broken .     shea said     but you don   t see anything when you look through it .        it must be set to neutral     said moore .     there must be some way of adjusting it .     like brandon  he placed it in both hands and tried to twist it about that circumscribing groove .  he placed pressure on it  grunting .     don   t break it     said brandon .     it   s giving .  either it   s supposed to be stiff or else it   s corroded shut .     he stopped  looked at the instrument impatiently  and put it to his eye again .  he whirled  unpolarized a window and looked out at the lights of the city .     i   ll be dumped in space     he breathed .  brandon said     what .  what .     moore handed the instrument to brandon wordlessly .  brandon put it to his eyes and cried out sharply     it   s a telescope .     shea said at once     let me see .      they spent nearly an hour with it  converting it into a telescope with turns in one direction  a microscope with turns in the other .     how does it work .     brandon kept asking .     i don   t know     moore kept saying .  in the end he said     i   m sure it involves concentrated force fields .  we are turning against considerable field resistance .  with larger instruments  power adjustment will be required .        it   s a pretty cute trick     said shea .     it   s more than that     said moore .     i   ll bet it represents a completely new turn in theoretical physics .  it focuses light without lenses  and it can be adjusted to gather light over a wider and wider area without any change in focal length .  i   ll bet we could duplicate the five hundred inch ceres telescope in one direction and an electron microscope in the other .  what   s more  i don   t see any chromatic aberration  so it must bend light of all wavelengths equally .  maybe it bends radio waves and gamma rays also .  maybe it distorts gravity  if gravity is some kind of radiation .  maybe         worth money .     asked shea  breaking in dryly .     all kinds if someone can figure out how it works .        then we don   t go to trans space insurance with this .  we go to a lawyer first .  did we sign these things away with our salvage rights or didn   t we .  you had them already in your possession before signing the paper .  for that matter  is the paper any good if we didn   t know what we were signing anyway .  maybe it might be considered fraud .         as a matter of fact     said moore     with something like this  i don   t know if any private company ought to own it .  we ought to check with some government agency .  if there   s money in it      but brandon was pounding both fists on his knees .     to hell with the money  warren .  i mean  i   ll take any money that comes my way but that   s not the important thing .  we   re going to be famous  man  famous .  imagine the story .  a fabulous treasure lost in space .  a giant corporation combing space for twenty years to find it and all the time we  the forgotten ones  have it in our possession .  then  on the twentieth anniversary of the original loss  we find it again .  if this thing works  if anoptics become a great new scientific technique  they   ll never forget us .     moore grinned  then started laughing .     that   s right .  you did it  mark .  you did just what you set out to do .  you   ve rescued us from being marooned in oblivion .        we all did it     said brandon .     mike shea started us off with the necessary basic information .  i worked out the theory  and you had the instrument .        okay .  it   s late  and the wife will be back soon  so let   s get the ball rolling right away .  multivac will tell us which agency would be appropriate and who         no  no     said brandon .     ritual first .  the closing toast of the anniversary  please  and with the appropriate change .  won   t you oblige  warren .     he passed over the still half full bottle of jabra water .  carefully  moore filled each small glass precisely to the brim .     gentlemen     he said solemnly     a toast .     the three raised the glasses in unison .     gentlemen  i give you the silver queen souvenirs we used to have .      the billiard ball  james priss  i suppose i ought to say professor james priss  though everyone is sure to know whom i mean even without the title  always spoke slowly .  i know .  i interviewed him often enough .  he had the greatest mind since einstein  but it didn   t work quickly .  he admitted his slowness often .  maybe it was because he had so great a mind that it didn   t work quickly .  he would say something in slow abstraction  then he would think  and then he would say something more .  even over trivial matters  his giant mind would hover uncertainly  adding a touch here and then another there .  would the sun rise tomorrow  i can imagine him wondering .  what do we mean by    rise    .  can we be certain that tomorrow will come .  is the term    sun    completely unambiguous in this connection .  add to this habit of speech a bland countenance  rather pale  with no expression except for a general look of uncertainty  gray hair  rather thin  neatly combed  business suits of an invariably conservative cut  and you have what professor james priss was  a retiring person  completely lacking in magnetism .  that   s why nobody in the world  except myself  could possibly suspect him of being a murderer .  and even i am not sure .  after all  he was slow thinking  he was always slow thinking .  is it conceivable that at one crucial moment he managed to think quickly and act at once .  it doesn   t matter .  even if he murdered  he got away with it .  it is far too late now to try to reverse matters and i wouldn   t succeed in doing so even if i decided to let this be published .   edward bloom was priss   s classmate in college  and an associate  through circumstance  for a generation afterward .  they were equal in age and in their propensity for the bachelor life  but opposites in everything else that mattered .  bloom was a living flash of light  colorful  tall  broad  loud  brash  and self confident .  he had a mind that resembled a meteor strike in the sudden and unexpected way it could seize the essential .  he was no theroetician  as priss was  bloom had neither the patience for it  nor the capacity to concentrate intense thought upon a single abstract point .  he admitted that  he boasted of it .  what he did have was an uncanny way of seeing the application of a theory  of seeing the manner in which it could be put to use .  in the cold marble block of abstract structure  he could see  without apparent difficulty  the intricate design of a marvelous device .  the block would fall apart at his touch and leave the device .  it is a well known story  and not too badly exaggerated  that nothing bloom ever built had failed to work  or to be patentable  or to be profitable .  by the time he was forty five  he was one of the richest men on earth .  and if bloom the technician were adapted to one particular matter more than anything else  it was to the way of thought of priss the theoretician .  bloom   s greatest gadgets were built upon priss   s greatest thoughts  and as bloom grew wealthy and famous  priss gained phenomenal respect among his colleagues .  naturally it was to be expected that when priss advanced his two field theory  bloom would set about at once to build the first practical anti gravity device .  my job was to find human interest in the two field theory for the subscribers to tele news press  and you get that by trying to deal with human beings and not with abstract ideas .  since my interviewee was professor priss  that wasn   t easy .  naturally  i was going to ask about the possibilities of anti gravity  which interested everyone  and not about the two field theory  which no one could understand      anti gravity .     priss compressed his pale lips and considered .     i   m not entirely sure that it is possible  or ever will be .  i haven   t  uh  worked the matter out to my satisfaction .  i don   t entirely see whether the two field equations would have a finite solution  which they would have to have  of course  if      and then he went off into a brown study .  i prodded him .     bloom says he thinks such a device can be built .     priss nodded .     well  yes  but i wonder .  ed bloom has had an amazing knack at seeing the unobvious in the past .  he has an unusual mind .  it   s certainly made him rich enough .     we were sitting in priss   s apartment .  ordinary middle class .  i couldn   t help a quick glance this way and that .  priss was not wealthy .  i don   t think he read my mind .  he saw me look .  and i think it was on his mind .  he said     wealth isn   t the usual reward for the pure scientist .  or even a particularly desirable one .     maybe so  at that  i thought .  priss certainly had his own kind of reward .  he was the third person in history to win two nobel prizes  and the first to have both of them in the sciences and both of then unshared .  you can   t complain about that .  and if he wasn   t rich  neither was he poor .  but he didn   t sound like a contented man .  maybe it wasn   t bloom   s wealth alone that irked priss  maybe it was bloom   s fame among the people of earth generally  maybe it was the fact that bloom was a celebrity wherever he went  whereas priss  outside scientific conventions and faculty clubs  was largely anonymous .  i can   t say how much of all this was in my eyes or in the way i wrinkled the creases in my forehead  but priss went on to say     but we   re friends  you know .  we play billiards once or twice a week .  i beat him regularly .      i never published that statement .  i checked it with bloom  who made a long counterstatement that began    he beats me at billiards .  that jackass      and grew increasingly personal thereafter .  as a matter of fact  neither one was a novice at billiards .  i watched them play once for a short while  after the statement and counterstatement  and both handled the cue with professional aplomb .  what   s more  both played for blood  and there was no friendship in the game that i could see .   i said     would you care to predict whether bloom will manage to build an anti gravity device .        you mean would i commit myself to anything .  hmm .  well  let   s consider  young man .  just what do we mean by anti gravity .  our conception of gravity is built around einstein   s general theory of relativity  which is now a century and a half old but which  within its limits  remains firm .  we can picture it      i listened politely .  i   d heard priss on the subject before  but if i was to get anything out of him  which wasn   t certain  i   d have to let him work his way through in his own way .     we can picture it     he said     by imagining the universe to be a oat  thin  superflexible sheet of untearable rubber .  if we picture mass as being associated with weight  as it is on the surface of the earth  then we would expect a mass  resting upon the rubber sheet  to make an indentation .  the greater the mass  the deeper the indentation .     in the actual universe     he went on     all sorts of masses exist  and so our rubber sheet must be pictured as riddled with indentations .  any object rolling along the sheet would dip into and out of the indentations it passed  veering and changing direction as it did so .  it is this veer and change of direction that we interpret as demonstrating the existence of a force of gravity .  if the moving object comes close enough to the center of the indentation and is moving slowly enough  it gets trapped and whirls round and round that indentation .  in the absence of friction  it keeps up that whirl forever .  in other words  what isaac newton interpreted as a force  albert einstein interpreted as geometrical distortion .     he paused at this point .  he had been speaking fairly frequently  for him  since he was saying something he had said often before .  but now he began to pick his way .  he said     so in trying to produce anti gravity  we are trying to alter the geometry of the universe .  if we carry on our metaphor  we are trying to straighten out the indented rubber sheet .  we could imagine ourselves getting under the indenting mass and lifting it upward  supporting it so as to prevent it from making an indentation .  if we make the rubber sheet oat in that way  then we create a universe  or at least a portion of the universe  in which gravity doesn   t exist .  a rolling body would pass the non indenting mass without altering its direction of travel a bit  and we could interpret this as meaning that the mass was exerting no gravitational force .  in order to accomplish this feat  however  we need a mass equivalent to the indenting mass .  to produce antigravity on earth in this way  we would have to make sure of a mass equal to that of earth and poise it above our heads  so to speak .     i interrupted him .     but your two field theory         exactly .  general relativity does not explain both the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field in a single set of equations .  einstein spent half his life searching for that single set  for a unified field theory  and failed .  all who followed einstein also failed .  i  however  began with the assumption that there were two fields that could not be unified and followed the consequences  which i can explain  in part  in terms of the    rubber sheet    metaphor .     now we came to something i wasn   t sure i had ever heard before .     how does that go .     i asked .     suppose that  instead of trying to lift the indenting mass  we try to stiffen the sheet itself  make it less indentable .  it would contract  at least over a small area  and become flatter .  gravity would weaken  and so would mass  for the two are essentially the same phenomenon in terms of the indented universe .  if we could make the rubber sheet completely flat  both gravity and mass would disappear altogether .     under the proper conditions  the electromagnetic field could be made to counter the gravitational field  and serve to stiffen the indented fabric of the universe .  the electromagnetic field is tremendously stronger than the gravitational field  so the former could be made to overcome the latter .     i said uncertainly     but you say    under the proper conditions .      can those proper conditions you speak of be achieved  professor .        that is what i don   t know     said priss thoughtfully and slowly .     if the universe were really a rubber sheet  its stiffness would have to reach an infinite value before it could be expected to remain completely flat under an indenting mass .  if that is also so in the real universe  then an infinitely intense electromagnetic field would be required and that would mean anti gravity would be impossible .        but bloom says         yes  i imagine bloom thinks a finite field will do  if it can be properly applied .  still  however ingenious he is     and priss smiled narrowly     we needn   t take him to be infallible .  his grasp on theory is quite faulty .  he  he never earned his college degree  did you know that .     i was about to say that i knew that .  after all  everyone did .  but there was a touch of eagerness in priss   s voice as he said it and i looked up in time to catch animation in his eye  as though he were delighted to spread that piece of news .  so i nodded my head as if i were filing it for future reference .     then you would say  professor priss     i prodded again     that bloom is probably wrong and that anti gravity is impossible .     and finally priss nodded and said     the gravitational field can be weakened  of course  but if by anti gravity we mean a true zero gravity field  no gravity at all over a significant volume of space  then i suspect anti gravity may turn out to be impossible  despite bloom .     and i had  after a fashion  what i wanted .   i wasn   t able to see bloom for nearly three months after that  and when i did see him he was in an angry mood .  he had grown angry at once  of course  when the news first broke concerning priss   s statement .  he let it be known that priss would be invited to the eventual display of the antigravity device as soon as it was constructed  and would even be asked to participate in the demonstration .  some reporter  not i  unfortunately  caught him between appointments and asked him to elaborate on that and he said     i   ll have the device eventually  soon  maybe .  and you can be there  and so can anyone else the press would care to have there .  and professor james priss can be there .  he can represent theoretical science and after i have demonstrated antigravity  he can adjust his theory to explain it .  i   m sure he will know how to make his adjustments in masterly fashion and show exactly why i couldn   t possibly have failed .  he might do it now and save time  but i suppose he won   t .     it was all said very politely  but you could hear the snarl under the rapid flow of words .  yet he continued his occasional game of billiards with priss and when the two met they behaved with complete propriety .  one could tell the progress bloom was making by their respective attitudes to the press .  bloom grew curt and even snappish  while priss developed an increasing good humor .  when my umpteenth request for an interview with bloom was finally accepted  i wondered if perhaps that meant a break in bloom   s quest .  i had a little daydream of him announcing final success to me .  it didn   t work out that way .  he met me in his office at bloom enterprises in upstate new york .  it was a wonderful setting  well away from any populated area  elaborately landscaped  and covering as much ground as a rather large industrial establishment .  edison at his height  two centuries ago  had never been as phenomenally successful as bloom .  but bloom was not in a good humor .  he came striding in ten minutes late and went snarling past his secretary   s desk with the barest nod in my direction .  he was wearing a lab coat  unbuttoned .  he threw himself into his chair and said     i   m sorry if i   ve kept you waiting  but i didn   t have as much time as i had hoped .     bloom was a born showman and knew better than to antagonize the press  but i had the feeling he was having a great deal of difficulty at that moment in adhering to this principle .  i had the obvious guess .     i am given to understand  sir  that your recent tests have been unsuccessful .        who told you that .        i would say it was general knowledge  mr .  bloom .        no  it isn   t .  don   t say that  young man .  there is no general knowledge about what goes on in my laboratories and workshops .  you   re stating the professor   s opinions  aren   t you .  priss   s  i mean .        no i   m         of course you are .  aren   t you the one to whom he made that statement  that anti gravity is impossible .        he didn   t make the statement that flatly .        he never says anything flatly  but it was flat enough for him  and not as flat as i   ll have his damned rubber sheet universe before i   m finished .        then does that mean you   re making progress  mr .  bloom .        you know i am     he said with a snap .     or you should know .  weren   t you at the demonstration last week .        yes  i was .     i judged bloom to be in trouble or he wouldn   t be mentioning that demonstration .  it worked but it was not a world beater .  between the two poles of a magnet a region of lessened gravity was produced .  it was done very cleverly .  a mossbauer effect balance was used to probe the space between the poles .  if you   ve never seen an m e balance in action  it consists primarily of a tight monochromatic beam of gamma rays shot down the low gravity field .  the gamma rays change wavelength slightly but measurably under the influence of the gravitational field and if anything happens to alter the intensity of the field  the wavelength change shifts correspondingly .  it is an extremely delicate method for probing a gravitational field and it worked like a charm .  there was no question but that bloom had lowered gravity .  the trouble was that it had been done before by others .  bloom  to be sure  had made use of circuits that greatly increased the ease with which such an effect had been achieved  his system was typically ingenious and had been duly patented  and he maintained that it was by this method that anti gravity would become not merely a scientific curiosity but a practical affair with industrial applications .  perhaps .  but it was an incomplete job and he didn   t usually make a fuss over incompleteness .  he wouldn   t have done so this time if he weren   t desperate to display something .  i said     it   s my impression that what you accomplished at that preliminary demonstration was   .    g and better than that was achieved in brazil last spring .        that so .  well  calculate the energy input in brazil and here  and then tell me the difference in gravity decrease per kilowatt hour .  you   ll be surprised .        but the point is  can you reach zero g zero gravity .  that   s what professor priss thinks may be impossible .  everyone agrees that merely lessening the intensity of the field is no great feat .     bloom   s fist clenched .  i had the feeling that a key experiment had gone wrong that day and he was annoyed almost past endurance .  bloom hated to be balked by the universe .  he said     theoreticians make me sick .     he said it in a low  controlled voice  as though he were finally tired of not saying it  and he was going to speak his mind and be damned .     priss has won two nobel prizes for sloshing around a few equations  but what has he done with it .  nothing .  i have done something with it and i   m going to do more with it  whether priss likes it or not .     i   m the one people will remember .  i   m the one who gets the credit .  he can keep his damned title and his prizes and his kudos from the scholars .  listen  i   ll tell you what gripes him .  plain old fashioned jealousy .  it kills him that i get what i get for doing .  he wants it for thinking .     i said to him once  we play billiards together  you know      it was at this point that i quoted priss   s statement about billiards and got bloom   s counterstatement .  i never published either .  that was just trivia .     we play billiards     said bloom  when he had cooled down     and i   ve won my share of games .  we keep things friendly enough .  what the hell  college chums and all that  though how he got through  i   ll never know .  he made it in physics  of course  and in math  but he got a bare pass  out of pity  i think  in every humanities course he ever took .        you did not get your degree  did you  mr .  bloom .     that was sheer mischief on my part .  i was enjoying his eruption .     i quit to go into business  damn it .  my academic average  over the three years i attended  was a strong b .  don   t imagine anything else  you hear .  hell  by the time priss got his ph . d .   i was working on my second million .     he went on  clearly irritated      anyway  we were playing billiards and i said to him     jim  the average man will never understand why you get the nobel prize when i   m the one who gets the results .  why do you need two .  give me one .   he stood there  chalking up his cue  and then he said in his soft namby pamby way     you have two billions  ed .  give me one .     so you see  he wants the money .     i said     i take it you don   t mind his getting the honor .     for a minute i thought he was going to order me out  but he didn   t .  he laughed instead  waved his hand in front of him  as though he were erasing something from an invisible blackboard in front of him .  he said     oh  well  forget it .  all that is off the record .  listen  do you want a statement .  okay .  things didn   t go right today and i blew my top a bit  but it will clear up .  i think i know what   s wrong .  and if i don   t  i   m going to know .     look  you can say that i say that we don   t need infinite electromagnetic intensity  we will flatten out the rubber sheet  we will have zero gravity .  and when we get it  i   ll have the damnedest demonstration you ever saw  exclusively for the press and for priss  and you   ll be invited .  and you can say it won   t be long .  okay .        okay .      i had time after that to see each man once or twice more .  i even saw them together when i was present at one of their billiard games .  as i said before  both of them were good .  but the call to the demonstration did not come as quickly as all that .  it arrived six weeks less than a year after bloom gave me his statement .  and at that  perhaps it was unfair to expect quicker work .  i had a special engraved invitation  with the assurance of a cocktail hour first .  bloom never did things by halves and he was planning to have a pleased and satisfied group of reporters on hand .  there was an arrangement for trimensional tv  too .  bloom felt completely confident  obviously  confident enough to be willing to trust the demonstration in every living room on the planet .  i called up professor priss  to make sure he was invited too .  he was .     do you plan to attend  sir .     there was a pause and the professor   s face on the screen was a study in uncertain reluctance .      a demonstration of this sort is most unsuitable where a serious scientific matter is in question .  i do not like to encourage such things .     i was afraid he would beg off  and the dramatics of the situation would be greatly lessened if he were not there .  but then  perhaps  he decided he dared not play the chicken before the world .  with obvious distaste he said     of course  ed bloom is not really a scientist and he must have his day in the sun .  i   ll be there .        do you think mr .  bloom can produce zero gravity  sir .        uh .  .  . mr .  bloom sent me a copy of the design of his device and .  .  . and i   m not certain .  perhaps he can do it  if .  .  . uh .  .  . he says he can do it .  of course     he paused again for quite a long time     i think i would like to see it .     so would i  and so would many others .   the staging was impeccable .  a whole floor of the main building at bloom enterprises  the one on the hilltop  was cleared .  there were the promised cocktails and a splendid array of hors d   oeuvres  soft music and lighting  and a carefully dressed and thoroughly jovial edward bloom playing the perfect host  while a number of polite and unobtrusive menials fetched and carried .  all was geniality and amazing confidence .  james priss was late and i caught bloom watching the corners of the crowd and beginning to grow a little grim about the edges .  then priss arrived  dragging a volume of colorlessness in with him  a drabness that was unaffected by the noise and the absolute splendor  no other word world describe it  or else it was the two martinis glowing inside me  that filled the room .  bloom saw him and his face was illuminated at once .  he bounced across the floor  seized the smaller man   s hand and dragged him to the bar .     jim .  glad to see you .  what   ll you have .  hell  man  i   d have called it off if you hadn   t showed .  can   t have this thing without the star  you know .     he wrung priss   s hand .     it   s your theory  you know .  we poor mortals can   t do a thing without you few  you damned few few  pointing the way .     he was being ebullient  handing out the flattery  because he could afford to do so now .  he was fattening priss for the kill .  priss tried to refuse a drink  with some sort of mutter  but a glass was pressed into his hand and bloom raised his voice to a bull roar .     gentlemen .  a moment   s quiet  please .  to professor priss  the greatest mind since einstein  two time nobel laureate  father of the two field theory  and inspirer of the demonstration we are about to see  even if he didn   t think it would work  and had the guts to say so publicly .     there was a distinct titter of laughter that quickly faded out and priss looked as grim as his face could manage .     but now that professor priss is here     said bloom     and we   ve had our toast  let   s get on with it .  follow me  gentlemen .      the demonstration was in a much more elaborate place than had housed the earlier one .  this time it was on the top floor of the building .  different magnets were involved  smaller ones  by heaven  but as nearly as i could tell  the same m e balance was in place .  one thing was new  however  and it staggered everybody  drawing much more attention than anything else in the room .  it was a billiard table  resting under one pole of the magnet .  beneath it was the companion pole .  a round hole  about a foot across  was stamped out of the very center of the table and it was obvious that the zero gravity field  if it was to be produced  would be produced through that hole in the center of the billiard table .  it was as though the whole demonstration had been designed  surrealist fashion  to point up the victory of bloom over priss .  this was to be another version of their everlasting billiards competition and bloom was going to win .  i don   t know if the other newsmen took matters in that fashion  but i think priss did .  i turned to look at him and saw that he was still holding the drink that had been forced into his hand .  he rarely drank  i knew  but now he lifted the glass to his lips and emptied it in two swallows .  he stared at that billiard table and i needed no gift of esp to realize that he took it as a deliberate snap of fingers under his nose .  bloom led us to the twenty seats that surrounded three sides of the table  leaving the fourth free as a working area .  priss was carefully escorted to the seat commanding the most convenient view .  priss glanced quickly at the trimensional cameras which were now working .  i wondered if he were thinking of leaving but deciding that he couldn   t in the full glare of the eyes of the world .  essentially  the demonstration was simple  it was the production that counted .  there were dials in plain view that measured the energy expenditure .  there were others that transferred the m e balance readings into a position and a size that were visible to all .  everything was arranged for easy trimensional viewing .  bloom explained each step in a genial way  with one or two pauses in which he turned to priss for a confirmation that had to come .  he didn   t do it often enough to make it obvious  but just enough to turn priss upon the spit of his own torment .  from where i sat i could look across the table and see priss on the other side .  he had the look of a man in hell .  as we all know  bloom succeeded .  the m e balance showed the gravitational intensity to be sinking steadily as the electromagnetic field was intensified .  there were cheers when it dropped below the   .    g mark .  a red line indicated that on the dial .     the   .    g mark  as you know     said bloom confidently     represents the previous record low in gravitational intensity .  we are now lower than that at a cost in electricity that is less than ten percent what it cost at the time that mark was set .  and we will go lower still .     bloom  i think deliberately  for the sake of the suspense  slowed the drop toward the end  letting the trimensional cameras switch back and forth between the gap in the billiard table and the dial on which the m e balance reading was lowering .  bloom said suddenly     gentlemen  you will find dark goggles in the pouch on the side of each chair .  please put them on now .  the zero gravity field will soon be established and it will radiate a light rich in ultraviolet .     he put goggles on himself  and there was a momentary rustle as others went on too .  i think no one breathed during the last minute  when the dial reading dropped to zero and held fast .  and just as that happened a cylinder of light sprang into existence from pole to pole through the hole in the billiard table .  there was a ghost of twenty sighs at that .  someone called out     mr .  bloom  what is the reason for the light .        it   s characteristic of the zero gravity field     said bloom smoothly  which was no answer  of course .  reporters were standing up now  crowding about the edge of the table .  bloom waved them back .     please  gentlemen  stand clear .     only priss remained sitting .  he seemed lost in thought and i have been certain ever since that it was the goggles that obscured the possible significance of everything that followed .  i didn   t see his eyes .  i couldn   t .  and that meant neither i nor anyone else could even begin to make a guess as to what was going on behind those eyes .  well  maybe we couldn   t have made such a guess  even if the goggles hadn   t been there  but who can say .  bloom was raising his voice again .     please .  the demonstration is not yet over .  so far  we   ve only repeated what i have done before .  i have now produced a zero gravity field and i have shown it can be done practically .  but i want to demonstrate something of what such a field can do .  what we are going to see next will be something that has never been seen  not even by myself .  i have not experimented in this direction  much as i would have liked to  because i have felt that professor priss deserved the honor of      priss looked up sharply .     what  what         professor priss     said bloom  smiling broadly     i would like you to perform the first experiment involving the interaction of a solid object with a zero gravity field .  notice that the field has been formed in the center of a billiard table .  the world knows your phenomenal skill in billiards  professor  a talent second only to your amazing aptitude in theoretical physics .  won   t you send a billiard ball into the zero gravity volume .     eagerly he was handing a ball and cue to the professor .  priss  his eyes hidden by the goggles  stared at them and only very slowly  very uncertainly  reached out to take them .  i wonder what his eyes were showing .  i wonder  too  how much of the decision to have priss play billiards at the demonstration was due to bloom   s anger at priss   s remark about their periodic game  the remark i had quoted .  had i been  in my way  responsible for what followed .     come  stand up  professor     said bloom     and let me have your seat .  the show is yours from now on .  go ahead .     bloom seated himself  and still talked  in a voice that grew more organlike with each moment .     once professor priss sends the ball into the volume of zero gravity  it will no longer be affected by earth   s gravitational field .  it will remain truly motionless while the earth rotates about its axis and travels about the sun .  in this latitude  and at this time of day  i have calculated that the earth  in its motions  will sink downward .  we will move with it and the ball will stand still .  to us it will seem to rise up and away from the earth   s surface .  watch .     priss seemed to stand in front of the table in frozen paralysis .  was it surprise .  astonishment .  i don   t know .  i   ll never know .  did he make a move to interrupt bloom   s little speech  or was he just suffering from an agonized reluctance to play the ignominious part into which he was being forced by his adversary .  priss turned to the billiard table  looking first at it  then back at bloom .  every reporter was on his feet  crowding as closely as possible in order to get a good view .  only bloom himself remained seated  smiling and isolated .  he  of course  was not watching the table  or the ball  or the zero gravity field .  as nearly as i could tell through the goggles  he was watching priss .  perhaps he felt there was no way out .  or perhaps   with a sure stroke of his cue  he set the ball into motion .  it was not going quickly  and every eye followed it .  it struck the side of the table and caromed .  it was going even slower now as though priss himself were increasing the suspense and making bloom   s triumph the more dramatic .  i had a perfect view  for i was standing on the side of the table opposite from that where priss was .  i could see the ball moving toward the glitter of the zero gravity field and beyond it i could see those portions of the seated bloom which were not hidden by that glitter .  the ball approached the zero gravity volume  seemed to    hang on the edge for a moment  and then was gone  with a streak of light  the sound of a thunderclap  and the sudden smell of burning cloth .  we yelled .  we all yelled .  i   ve seen the scene on television since  along with the rest of the world .  i can see myself in the film during the fifteen second period of wild confusion  but i don   t really recognize my face .  fifteen seconds .  and then we discovered bloom .  he was still sitting in the chair  his arms still folded  but there was a hole the size of a billiard ball through forearm  chest  and back .  the better part of his heart  as it later turned out under autopsy  had been neatly punched out .  they turned off the device .  they called in the police .  they dragged off priss  who was in a state of utter collapse .  i wasn   t much better off  to tell the truth  and if any reporter then on the scene ever tried to say he remained a cool observer of that scene  then he   s a cool liar .   it was some months before i got to see priss again .  he had lost some weight but seemed well otherwise .  indeed  there was color in his cheeks and an air of decision about him .  he was better dressed than i had ever seen him to be .  he said     i know what happened now .  if i had had time to think  i would have known then .  but i am a slow thinker  and poor ed bloom was so intent on running a great show and doing it so well that he carried me along with him .  naturally  i   ve been trying to make up for some of the damage i unwittingly caused .        you can   t bring bloom back to life     i said soberly .     no  i can   t     he said  just as soberly .     but there   s bloom enterprises to think of  too .  what happened at the demonstration  in full view of the world  was the worst possible advertisement for zero gravity  and it   s important that the story be made clear .  that is why i have asked to see you .        yes .        if i had been a quicker thinker  i would have known ed was speaking the purest nonsense when he said that the billiard ball would slowly rise in the zero gravity field .  it couldn   t be so .  if bloom hadn   t despised theory so  if he hadn   t been so intent on being proud of his own ignorance of theory  he   d have known it himself .     the earth   s motion  after all  isn   t the only motion involved  young man .  the sun itself moves in a vast orbit about the center of the milky way galaxy .  and the galaxy moves too  in some not very clearly defined way .  if the billiard ball were subjected to zero gravity  you might think of it as being unaffected by any of those motions and therefore of suddenly falling into a state of absolute rest  when there is no such thing as absolute rest .     priss shook his head slowly .     the trouble with ed  i think  was that he was thinking of the kind of zero gravity one gets in a spaceship in free fall  when people float in mid air .  he expected the ball to float in mid air .  however  in a spaceship  zero gravity is not the result of an absence of gravitation  but merely the result of two objects  a ship and a man within the ship  falling at the same rate  responding to gravity in precisely the same way  so that each is motionless with respect to the other .     in the zero gravity field produced by ed  there was a flattening of the rubber sheet universe  which means an actual loss of mass .  everything in that field  including molecules of air caught within it  and the billiard ball i pushed into it  was completely massless as long as it remained within it .  a completely massless object can move in only one way .     he paused  inviting the question .  i asked     what motion would that be .        motion at the speed of light .  any massless object  such as a neutron or a photon  must travel at the speed of light as long as it exists .  in fact  light moves at that speed only because it is made up of photons .  as soon as the billiard ball entered the zero gravity field and lost its mass  it too assumed the speed of light at once and left .     i shook my head .     but didn   t it regain its mass as soon as it left the zero gravity volume .        it certainly did  and at once it began to be affected by the gravitational field and to slow up in response to the friction of the air and the top of the billiard table .  but imagine how much friction it would take to slow up an object the mass of a billiard ball going at the speed of light .  it went through the hundred mile thickness of our atmosphere in a thousandth of a second and i doubt that it was slowed more than a few miles a second in doing so  a few miles out of         of them .  on the way  it scorched the top of the billiard table  broke cleanly through the edge  went through poor ed and the window too  punching out neat circles because it had passed through before the neighboring portions of something  even as brittle as glass had a chance to split a splinter .     it is extremely fortunate we were on the top floor of a building set in a countrified area .  if we were in the city  it might have passed through a number of buildings and killed a number of people .  by now that billiard ball is off in space  far beyond the edge of the solar system and it will continue to travel so forever  at nearly the speed of light  until it happens to strike an object large enough to stop it .  and then it will gouge out a sizable crater .     i played with the notion and was not sure i liked it .     how is that possible .  the billiard ball entered the zero gravity volume almost at a standstill .  i saw it .  and you say it left with an incredible quantity of kinetic energy .  where did the energy come from .     priss shrugged .     it came from nowhere .  the law of conservation of energy only holds under the conditions in which general relativity is valid  that is  in an indented rubber sheet universe .  wherever the indentation is flattened out  general relativity no longer holds  and energy can be created and destroyed freely .  that accounts for the radiation along the cylindrical surface of the zero gravity volume .  that radiation  you remember  bloom did not explain  and  i fear  could not explain .  if he had only experimented further first  if he had only not been so foolishly anxious to put on his show         what accounts for the radiation  sir .        the molecules of air inside the volume .  each  assumes the speed of light and comes smashing outward .  they   re only molecules  not billiard balls  so they   re stopped  but the kinetic energy of their motion is converted into energetic radiation .  it   s continuous because new molecules are always drifting in  and attaining the speed of light and smashing out .        then energy is being created continuously .        exactly .  and that is what we must make clear to the public .  anti gravity is not primarily a device to lift spaceships or to revolutionize mechanical movement .  rather  it is the source of an endless supply of free energy  since part of the energy produced can be diverted to maintain the field that keeps that portion of the universe flat .  what ed bloom invented  without knowing it  was not just anti gravity  but the first successful perpetual motion machine of the first class  one that manufactures energy out of nothing .     i said slowly     anyone of us could have been killed by that billiard ball  is that right  professor .  it might have come out in any direction .     priss said     well  massless photons emerge from any light source at the speed of light in any direction  that   s why a candle casts light in all directions .  the massless air molecules come out of the zero gravity volume in all directions  which is why the entire cylinder radiates .  but the billiard ball was only one object .  it could have come out in any direction  but it had to come out in some one direction  chosen at random  and the chosen direction happened to be the one that caught ed .     that was it .  everyone knows the consequences .  mankind had free energy and so we have the world we have now .  professor priss was placed in charge of its development by the board of bloom enterprises  and in time he was as rich and famous as ever edward bloom had been .  and priss still has two nobel prizes in addition .  only .  .  .  i keep thinking .  photons smash out from a light source in all directions because they are created at the moment and there is no reason for them to move in one direction more than in another .  air molecules come out of a zero gravity field in all directions because they enter it in all directions .  but what about a single billiard ball  entering a zero gravity field from one particular direction .  does it come out in the same direction or in any direction .  i   ve inquired delicately  but theoretical physicists don   t seem to be sure  and i can find no record that bloom enterprises  which is the only organization working with zero gravity fields  has ever experimented in the matter .  someone at the organization once told me that the uncertainty principle guarantees the random emersion of an object entering in any direction .  but then why don   t they try the experiment .  could it be  then .  .  .  could it be that for once priss   s mind had been working quickly .  could it be that  under the pressure of what bloom was trying to do to him  priss had suddenly seen everything .  he had been studying the radiation surrounding the zero gravity volume .  he might have realized its cause and been certain of the speed of light motion of anything entering the volume .  why  then  had he said nothing .  one thing is certain .  nothing priss would do at the billiard table could be accidental .  he was an expert and the billiard ball did exactly what he wanted it to .  i was standing right there .  i saw him look at bloom and then at the table as though he were judging angles .  i watched him hit that ball .  i watched it bounce off the side of the table and move into the zero gravity volume  heading in one particular direction .  for when priss sent that ball toward the zero gravity volume  and the tri di films bear me out  it was already aimed directly at bloom   s heart .  accident .  coincidence .   .  .  . murder .   mirror image  the three laws of robotics   .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .    .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .    .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .   lije baley had just decided to relight his pipe  when the door of his office opened without a preliminary knock  or announcement  of any kind .  baley looked up in pronounced annoyance and then dropped his pipe .  it said a good deal for the state of his mind that he left it lie where it had fallen .     r .  daneel olivaw     he said  in a kind of mystified excitement .     jehoshaphat .  it is you  isn   t it .        you are quite right      said the tall  bronzed newcomer  his even features never flicking for a moment out of their accustomed calm .     i regret surprising you by entering without warning  but the situation is a delicate one and there must be as little involvement as possible on the part of the men and robots even in this place .  i am  in any case  pleased to see you again  friend elijah .     and the robot held out his right hand in a gesture as thoroughly human as was his appearance .  it was baley who was so unmanned by his astonishment as to stare at the hand with a momentary lack of understanding .  but then he seized it in both his  feeling its warm firmness .     but daneel  why .  you   re welcome any time  but  what is this situation that is a delicate one .  are we in trouble again .  earth  i mean .        no  friend elijah  it does not concern earth .  the situation to which i refer as a delicate one is  to outward appearances  a small thing .  a dispute between mathematicians  nothing more .  as we happened  quite by accident  to be within an easy jump of earth         this dispute took place on a starship  then .        yes  indeed .  a small dispute  yet to the humans involved astonishingly large .     baley could not help but smile .     i   m not surprised you find humans astonishing .  they do not obey the three laws .        that is  indeed  a shortcoming     said r .  daneel  gravely     and i think humans themselves are puzzled by humans .  it may be that you are less puzzled than are the men of other worlds because so many more human beings live on earth than on the spacer worlds .  if so  and i believe it is so  you could help us .     r .  daneel paused momentarily and then said  perhaps a shade too quickly     and yet there are rules of human behavior which i have learned .  it would seem  for instance  that i am deficient in etiquette  by human standards  not to have asked after your wife and child .        they are doing well .  the boy is in college and jessie is involved in local politics .  the amenities are taken care of .  now tell me how you come to be here .         as i said  we were within an easy j ump of earth     said r .  daneel     so i suggested to the captain that we consult you .        and the captain agreed .     baley had a sudden picture of the proud and autocratic captain of a spacer starship consenting to make a landing on earth  of all worlds  and to consult an earthman  of all people .     i believe     said r .  daneel     that he was in a position where he would have agreed to anything .  in addition  i praised you very highly  although  to be sure  i stated only the truth .  finally  i agreed to conduct all negotiations so that none of the crew  or passengers  would need to enter any of the earthman cities .        and talk to any earthman  yes .  but what has happened .        the passengers of the starship  eta carina  included two mathematicians who were traveling to aurora to attend an interstellar conference on neurobiophysics .  it is about these mathematicians  alfred ban humboldt and gennao sabbat  that the dispute centers .  have you perhaps  friend elijah  heard of one  or both  of them .        neither one     said baley  firmly .     i know nothing about mathematics .  look  daneel  surely you haven   t told anyone i   m a mathematics buff or         not at all  friend elijah .  i know you are not .  nor does it matter  since the exact nature of the mathematics involved is in no way relevant to the point at issue .        well  then  go on .        since you do not know either man  friend elijah  let me tell you that dr .  humboldt is well into his twenty seventh decade  pardon me  friend elijah .        nothing .  nothing     said baley  irritably .  he had merely muttered to himself  more or less incoherently  in a natural reaction to the extended life spans of the spacers .     and he   s still active  despite his age .  on earth  mathematicians after thirty or so .     daneel said  calmly     dr .  humboldt is one of the top three mathematicians  by long established repute  in the galaxy .  certainly he is still active .  dr .  sabbat  on the other hand  is quite young  not yet fifty  but he has already established himself as the most remarkable new talent in the most abstruse branches of mathematics .        they   re both great  then     said baley .  he remembered his pipe and picked it up .  he decided there was no point in lighting it now and knocked out the dottle .     what happened .  is this a murder case .  did one of them apparently kill the other .        of these two men of great reputation  one is trying to destroy that of the other .  by human values  i believe this may be regarded as worse than physical murder .        sometimes  i suppose .  which one is trying to destroy the other .        why  that  friend elijah  is precisely the point at issue .  which .        go on .        dr .  humboldt tells the story clearly .  shortly before he boarded the starship  he had an insight into a possible method for analyzing neural pathways from changes in microwave absorption patterns of local cortical areas .  the insight was a purely mathematical technique of extraordinary subtlety  but i cannot  of course  either understand or sensibly transmit the details .  these do not  however  matter .  dr .  humboldt considered the matter and was more convinced each hour that he had something revolutionary on hand  something that would dwarf all his previous accomplishments in mathematics .  then he discovered that dr .  sabbat was on board .        ah .  and he tried it out on young sabbat .        exactly .  the two had met at professional meetings before and knew each other thoroughly by reputation .  humboldt went into it with sabbat in great detail .  sabbat backed humboldt   s analysis completely and was unstinting in his praise of the importance of the discovery and of the ingenuity of the discoverer .  heartened and reassured by this  humboldt prepared a paper outlining  in summary  his work and  two days later  prepared to have it forwarded subetherically to the co chairmen of the conference at aurora  in order that he might officially establish his priority and arrange for possible discussion before the sessions were closed .  to his surprise  he found that sabbat was ready with a paper of his own  essentially the same as humboldt   s  and sabbat was also preparing to have it subetherized to aurora .        i suppose humboldt was furious .        quite .        and sabbat .  what was his story .        precisely the same as humboldt   s .  word for word .        then just what is the problem .        except for the mirror image exchange of names .  according to sabbat  it was he who had the insight  and he who consulted humboldt  it was humboldt who agreed with the analysis and praised it .        then each one claims the idea is his and that the other stole it .  it doesn   t sound like a problem to me at all .  in matters of scholarship  it would seem only necessary to produce the records of research  dated and initialed .  judgment as to priority can be made from that .  even if one is falsified  that might be discovered through internal inconsistencies .        ordinarily  friend elijah  you would be right  but this is mathematics  and not in an experimental science .  dr .  humboldt claims to have worked out the essentials in his head .  nothing was put in writing until the paper itself was prepared .  dr .  sabbat  of course  says precisely the same .        well  then  be more drastic and get it over with  for sure .  subject each one to a psychic probe and find out which of the two is lying .     r .  daneel shook his head slowly     friend elijah  you do not understand these men .  they are both of rank and scholarship  fellows of the imperial academy .  as such  they cannot be subjected to trial of professional conduct except by a jury of their peers  their professional peers  unless they personally and voluntarily waive that right .        put it to them  then .  the guilty man won   t waive the right because he can   t afford to face the psychic probe .  the innocent man will waive it at once .  you won   t even have to use the probe .        it does not work that way  friend elijah .  to waive the right in such a case  to be investigated by laymen  is a serious and perhaps irrecoverable blow to prestige .  both men steadfastly refuse to waive the right to special trial  as a matter of pride .  the question of guilt  or innocence  is quite subsidiary .        in that case  let it go for now .  put the matter in cold storage until you get to aurora .  at the neurobiophysical conference  there will be a huge supply of professional peers  and then         that would mean a tremendous blow to science itself  friend elijah .  both men would suffer for having been the instrument of scandal .  even the innocent one would be blamed for having been party to a situation so distasteful .  it would be felt that it should have been settled quietly out of court at all costs .        all right .  i   m not a spacer  but i   ll try to imagine that this attitude makes sense .  what do the men in question say .        humboldt agrees thoroughly .  he says that if sabbat will admit theft of the idea and allow humboldt to proceed with transmission of the paper  or at least its delivery at the conference  he will not press charges .  sabbat   s misdeed will remain secret with him  and  of course  with the captain  who is the only other human to be party to the dispute .        but young sabbat will not agree .        on the contrary  he agreed with dr .  humboldt to the last detail  with the reversal of names .  still the mirror image .        so they just sit there  stalemated .        each  i believe  friend elijah  is waiting for the other to give in and admit guilt .        well  then  wait .        the captain has decided this cannot be done .  there are two alternatives to waiting  you see .  the first is that both will remain stubborn so that when the starship lands on aurora  the intellectual scandal will break .  the captain  who is responsible for justice on board ship will suffer disgrace for not having been able to settle the matter quietly and that  to him  is quite insupportable .        and the second alternative .        is that one  or the other  of the mathematicians will indeed admit to wrongdoing .  but will the one who confesses do so out of actual guilt  or out of a noble desire to prevent the scandal .  would it be right to deprive of credit one who is sufficiently ethical to prefer to lose that credit than to see science as a whole suffer .  or else  the guilty party will confess at the last moment  and in such a way as to make it appear he does so only for the sake of science  thus escaping the disgrace of his deed and casting its shadow upon the other .  the captain will be the only man to know all this but he does not wish to spend the rest of his life wondering whether he has been a party to a grotesque miscarriage of justice .     baley sighed .     a game of intellectual chicken .  who   ll break first as aurora comes nearer and nearer .  is that the whole story now  daneel .        not quite .  there are witnesses to the transaction .         jehoshaphat .  why didn   t you say so at once .  what witnesses .     dr .  humboldt   s personal servant         a robot  i suppose .        yes  certainly .  he is called r .  preston .  this servant  r .  preston  was present during the initial conference and he bears out dr .  humboldt in every detail .        you mean he says that the idea was dr .  humboldt   s to begin with  that dr .  humboldt detailed it to dr .  sabbat  that dr .  sabbat praised the idea  and so on .        yes  in full detail .        i see .  does that settle the matter or not .  presumably not .        you are quite right .  it does not settle the matter  for there is a second witness .  dr .  sabbat also has a personal servant  r .  idda  another robot of  as it happens  the same model as r .  preston  made  i believe  in the same year in the same factory .  both have been in service for an equal period of time .     an odd coincidence  very odd .        a fact  i am afraid  and it makes it difficult to arrive at any judgment based on obvious differences between the two servants .        r .  idda  then  tells the same story as r .  preston .        precisely the same story  except for the mirror image reversal of the names .        r .  idda stated  then  that young sabbat  the one not yet fifty     lije baley did not entirely keep the sardonic note out of his voice  he himself was not yet fifty and he felt far from young     had the idea to begin with  that he detailed it to dr .  humboldt  who was loud in his praises  and so on .        yes  friend elijah .        and one robot is lying  then .        so it would seem .        it should be easy to tell which .  i imagine even a superficial examination by a good roboticist         a roboticist is not enough in this case  friend elijah .  only a qualified robopsychologist would carry weight enough and experience enough to make a decision in a case of this importance .  there is no one so qualified on board ship .  such an examination can be performed only when we reach aurora         and by then the crud hits the fan .  well  you   re here on earth .  we can scare up a robopsychologist  and surely anything that happens on earth will never reach the ears of aurora and there will be no scandal .        except that neither dr .  humboldt  nor dr .  sabbat  will allow his servant to be investigated by a robopsychologist of earth .  the earthman would have to      he paused .  lije baley said stolidly     he   d have to touch the robot .        these are old servants  well thought of         and not to be sullied by the touch of earthman .  then what do you want me to do  damn it .     he paused  grimacing .     i   m sorry  r .  daneel  but i see no reason for your having involved me .         i was on the ship on a mission utterly irrelevant to the problem at hand .  the captain turned to me because he had to turn to someone .  i seemed human enough to talk to  and robot enough to be a safe recipient of confidences .  he told me the whole story and asked what i would do .  i realized the next jump could take us as easily to earth as to our target .  i told the captain that  although i was at as much a loss to resolve the mirror image as he was  there was on earth one who might help .        jehoshaphat .     muttered baley under his breath .     consider  friend elijah  that if you succeed in solving this puzzle  it would do your career good and earth itself might benefit .  the matter could not be publicized  of course  but the captain is a man of some influence on his home world and he would be grateful .        you just put a greater strain on me .        i have every confidence     said r .  daneel  stolidly     that you already have some idea as to what procedure ought to be followed .        do you .  i suppose that the obvious procedure is to interview the two mathematicians  one of whom would seem to be a thief .        i   m afraid  friend elijah  that neither one will come into the city .  nor would either one be willing to have you come to them .        and there is no way of forcing a spacer to allow contact with an earthman  no matter what the emergency .  yes  i understand that  daneel  but i was thinking of an interview by closed circuit television .        nor that .  they will not submit to interrogation by an earthman .        then what do they want of me .  could i speak to the robots .        they would not allow the robots to come here  either .        jehoshaphat  daneel .  you   ve come .        that was my own decision .  i have permission  while on board ship  to make decisions of that sort without veto by any human being but the captain himself  and he was eager to establish the contact .  i  having known you  decided that television contact was insufficient .  i wished to shake your hand .     lije baley softened .     i appreciate that  daneel  but i still honestly wish you could have refrained from thinking of me at all in this case .  can i talk to the robots by television at least .        that .  i think  can be arranged .        something  at least .  that means i would be doing the work of a robopsychologist  in a crude sort of way .        but you are a detective  friend elijah  not a robopsychologist .        well  let it pass .  now before i see them  let   s think a bit .  tell me  is it possible that both robots are telling the truth .  perhaps the conversation between the two mathematicians was equivocal .  perhaps it was of such a nature that each robot could honestly believe its own master was proprietor of the idea .  or perhaps one robot heard only one portion of the discussion and the other another portion  so that each could suppose its own master was proprietor of the idea .        that is quite impossible  friend elijah .  both robots repeat the conversation in identical fashion .  and the two repetitions are fundamentally inconsistent .        then it is absolutely certain that one of the robots is lying .        yes .        will i be able to see the transcript of all evidence given so far in the presence of the captain  if i should want to .        i thought you would ask that and i have copies with me .        another blessing .  have the robots been cross examined at all  and is that cross examination included in the transcript .        the robots have merely repeated their tales .  cross examination would be conducted only by robopsychologists .        or by myself .        you are a detective  friend elijah  not a         all right  r .  daneel .  i   ll try to get the spacer psychology straight .  a detective can do it because he isn   t a robopsychologist .  let   s think further .  ordinarily a robot will not lie  but he will do so if necessary to maintain the three laws .  he might lie to protect  in legitimate fashion  his own existence in accordance with the third law .  he is more apt to lie if that is necessary to follow a legitimate order given him by a human being in accordance with the second law .  he is most apt to lie if that is necessary to save a human life  or to prevent harm from coming to a human in accordance with the first law .        yes .        and in this case  each robot would be defending the professional reputation of his master  and would lie if it were necessary to do so .  under the circumstances  the professional reputation would be nearly equivalent to life and there might be a near first law urgency to the lie .        yet by the lie  each servant would be harming the professional reputation of the other   s master  friend elijah .        so it would  but each robot might have a clearer conception of the value of its own master   s reputation and honestly judge it to be greater than that of the other   s .  the lesser harm would be done by his lie  he would suppose  than by the truth .     having said that  lije baley remained quiet for a moment .  then he said     a l right  then  can you arrange to have me talk to one of the robots  to r .  idda first  i think .        dr .  sabbat   s robot .        yes     said baley  dryly     the young fellow   s robot .        it will take me but a few minutes     said r .  daneel .     i have a micro receiver outfitted with a projector .  i will need merely a blank wall and i think this one will do if you will allow me to move some of these film cabinets .        go ahead .  will i have to talk into a microphone of some sort .        no  you will be able to talk in an ordinary manner .  please pardon me  friend elijah  for a moment of further delay .  i will have to contact the ship and arrange for r .  idda to be interviewed .        if that will take some time  daneel  how about giving me the transcripted material of the evidence so far .      lije baley lit his pipe while r .  daneel set up the equipment  and leafed through the flimsy sheets he had been handed .  the minutes passed and r .  daneel said     if you are ready  friend elijah  r .  idda is .  or would you prefer a few more minutes with the transcript .        no     sighed baley     i   m not learning anything new .  put him on and arrange to have the interview recorded and transcribed .     r .  idda  unreal in two dimensional projection against the wall  was basically metallic in structure  not at all the humanoid creature that r .  daneel was .  his body was tall but blocky  and there was very little to distinguish him from the many robots baley had seen  except for minor structural details .  baley said     greetings  r .  idda .        greetings  sir     said r .  idda  in a muted voice that sounded surprisingly humanoid .     you are the personal servant of gennao sabbat  are you not .        i am sir .        for how long  boy .        for twenty two years  sir .        and your master   s reputation is valuable to you .        yes  sir .        would you consider it of importance to protect that reputation .        yes  sir .        as important to protect his reputation as his physical life .        no  sir .        as important to protect his reputation as the reputation of another .     r .  idda hesitated .  he said     such cases must be decided on their individual merit  sir .  there is no way of establishing a general rule .      baley hesitated .  these spacer robots spoke more smoothly and intellectually than earth models did .  he was not at all sure he could outthink one .  he said     if you decided that the reputation of your master were more important than that of another  say  that of alfred barr humboldt  would you lie to protect your master   s reputation .        i would  sir .        did you lie in your testimony concerning your master in his controversy with dr .  humboldt .        no  sir .        but if you were lying  you would deny you were lying in order to protect that lie  wouldn   t you .        yes  sir .        well  then     said baley     let   s consider this .  your master  gennao sabbat  is a young man of great reputation in mathematics  but he is a young man .  if  in this controversy with dr .  humboldt  he had succumbed to temptation and had acted unethically  he would suffer a certain eclipse of reputation  but he is young and would have ample time to recover .  he would have many intellectual triumphs ahead of him and men would eventually look upon this plagiaristic attempt as the mistake of a hot blooded youth  deficient in judgment .  it would be something that would be made up for in the future .     if  on the other hand  it were dr .  humboldt who succumbed to temptation  the matter would be much more serious .  he is an old man whose great deeds have spread over centuries .  his reputation has been unblemished hitherto .  all of that  however  would be forgotten in the light of this one crime of his later years  and he would have no opportunity to make up for it in the comparatively short time remaining to him .  there would be little more that he could accomplish .  there would be so many more years of work ruined in humboldt   s case than in that of your master and so much less opportunity to win back his position .  you see  don   t you  that humboldt faces the worse situation and deserves the greater consideration .     there was a long pause .  then r .  idda said  with unmoved voice     my evidence was a lie .  it was dr .  humboldt whose work it was  and my master has attempted  wrongfully  to appropriate the credit .     baley said     very well  boy .  you are instructed to say nothing to anyone about this until given permission by the captain of the ship .  you are excused .     the screen blanked out and baley puffed at his pipe .     do you suppose the captain heard that  daneel .        i am sure of it .  he is the only witness  except for us .        good .  now for the other .        but is there any point to that  friend elijah  in view of what r .  idda has confessed .        of course there is .  r .  idda   s confession means nothing .        nothing .        nothing at all .  i pointed out that dr .  humboldt   s position was the worse .  naturally  if he were lying to protect sabbat  he would switch to the truth as  in fact  he claimed to have done .  on the other hand  if he were telling the truth  he would switch to a lie to protect humboldt .  it   s still mirror image and we haven   t gained anything .        but then what will we gain by questioning r .  preston .        nothing  if the minor image were perfect  but it is not .  after all  one of the robots is telling the truth to begin with  and one is lying to begin with  and that is a point of asymmetry .  let me see r .  preston .  and if the transcription of r .  idda   s examination is done  let me have it .   the projector came into use again .  r .  preston stared out of it  identical with r .  idda in every respect  except for some trivial chest design .  baley said     greetings  r .  preston .     he kept the record of r .  idda   s examination before him as he spoke .     greetings  sir     said r .  preston .  his voice was identical with that of r .  idda .     you are the personal servant of alfred ban humboldt are you not .        i am  sir .        for how long  boy .        for twenty two years  sir .        and your master   s reputation is valuable to you .        yes  sir .        would you consider it of importance to protect that reputation .        yes  sir .        as important to protect his reputation as his physical life .        no  sir .        as important to protect his reputation as the reputation of another .     r .  preston hesitated .  he said     such cases must be decided on their individual merit  sir .  there is no way of establishing a general rule .     baley said     if you decided that the reputation of your master were more important than that of another  say  that of gennao sabbat  would you lie to protect your master   s reputation .        i would  sir .        did you lie in your testimony concerning your master in his controversy with dr .  sabbat .        no  sir .        but if you were lying  you would deny you were lying  in order to protect that lie  wouldn   t you .        yes  sir .        well  then     said baley     let   s consider this .  your master  alfred barr humboldt  is an old man of great reputation in mathematics  but he is an old man .  if  in this controversy with dr .  sabbat  he had succumbed to temptation and had acted unethically  he would suffer a certain eclipse of reputation  but his great age and his centuries of accomplishments would stand against that and would win out .  men would look upon this plagiaristic attempt as the mistake of a perhaps sick old man  no longer certain in judgment .     if  on the other hand  it were dr .  sabbat who had succumbed to temptation  the matter would be much more serious .  he is a young man  with a far less secure reputation .  he would ordinarily have centuries ahead of him in which he might accumulate knowledge and achieve great things .  this will be closed to him  now  obscured by one mistake of his youth .  he has a much longer future to lose than your master has .  you see  don   t you  that sabbat faces the worse situation and deserves the greater consideration .     there was a long pause .  then r .  preston said  with unmoved voice     my evidence was as i      at that point  he broke off and said nothing more .  baley said     please continue  r .  preston .     there was no response .  r .  daneel said     i am afraid  friend elijah  that r .  preston is in stasis .  he is out of commission .        well  then     said baley     we have finally produced an asymmetry .  from this  we can see who the guilty person is .        in what way  friend elijah .        think it out .  suppose you were a person who had committed no crime and that your personal robot were a witness to that .  there would be nothing you need do .  your robot would tell the truth and bear you out .  if  however  you were a person who had committed the crime  you would have to depend on your robot to lie .  that would be a somewhat riskier position  for although the robot would lie  if necessary  the greater inclination would be to tell the truth  so that the lie would be less firm than the truth would be .  to prevent that  the crime committing person would very likely have to order the robot to lie .  in this way  first law would be strengthened by second law  perhaps very substantially strengthened .        that would seem reasonable     said r .  daneel .     suppose we have one robot of each type .  one robot would switch from truth  unreinforced  to the lie  and could do so after some hesitation  without serious trouble .  the other robot would switch from the lie  strongly reinforced  to the truth  but could do so only at the risk of burning out various positronic track ways in his brain and falling into stasis .        and since r .  preston went into stasis         r .  preston   s master  dr .  humboldt  is the man guilty of plagiarism .  if you transmit this to the captain and urge him to face dr .  humboldt with the matter at once  he may force a confession .  if so  i hope you will tell me immediately .        i will certainly do so .  you will excuse me  friend elijah .  i must talk to the captain privately .        certainly .  use the conference room .  it is shielded .      baley could do no work of any kind in r .  daneel   s absence .  he sat in uneasy silence .  a great deal would depend on the value of his analysis  and he was acutely aware of his lack of expertise in robotics .  r .  daneel was back in half an hour  very nearly the longest half hour of baley   s life .  there was no use  of course  in trying to determine what had happened from the expression of the humanoid   s impassive face .  baley tried to keep his face impassive .     yes  r .  daneel .     he asked .     precisely as you said  friend elijah .  dr .  humboldt has confessed .  he was counting  he said  on dr .  sabbat giving way and allowing dr .  humboldt to have this one last triumph .  the crisis is over and you will find the captain grateful .  he has given me permission to tell you that he admires your subtlety greatly and i believe that i  myself  will achieve favor for having suggested you .        good     said baley  his knees weak and his forehead moist now that his decision had proven correct     but jehoshaphat  r .  daneel  don   t put me on the spot like that again  will you .        i will try not to  friend elijah .  all will depend  of course  on the importance of a crisis  on your nearness  and on certain other factors .  meanwhile  i have a question         yes .        was it not possible to suppose that passage from a lie to the truth was easy  while passage from the truth to a lie was difficult .  and in that case  would not the robot in stasis have been going from a truth to a lie  and since r .  preston was in stasis  might one not have drawn the conclusion that it was dr .  humboldt who was innocent and dr .  sabbat who was guilty .        yes  r .  daneel .  it was possible to argue that way  but it was the other argument that proved right .  humboldt did confess  didn   t he .        he did .  but with arguments possible in both directions  how could you  friend elijah  so quickly pick the correct one .     for a moment  baley   s lips twitched .  then he relaxed and they curved into a smile .     because  r .  daneel  i took into account human reactions  not robotic ones .  i know more about human beings than about robots .  in other words  i had an idea as to which mathematician was guilty before i ever interviewed the robots .  once i provoked an asymmetric response in them  i simply interpreted it in such a way as to place the guilt on the one i already believed to be guilty .  the robotic response was dramatic enough to break down the guilty man  my own analysis of human behavior might not have been sufficient to do so .        i am curious to know what your analysis of human behavior was .        jehoshaphat  r .  daneel  think  and you won   t have to ask .  there is another point of asymmetry in this tale of mirror image besides the matter of true and false .  there is the matter of the age of the two mathematicians  one is quite old and one is quite young .        yes  of course  but what then .        why  this .  i can see a young man  flushed with a sudden  startling and revolutionary idea  consulting in the matter an old man whom he has  from his early student days  thought of as a demigod in the field .  i can not see an old man  rich in honors and used to triumphs  coming up with a sudden  startling and revolutionary idea  consulting a man centuries his junior whom he is bound to think of as a young whippersnapper  or whatever term a spacer would use .  then  too  if a young man had the chance  would he try to steal the idea of a revered demigod .  it would be unthinkable .  on the other hand  an old man  conscious of declining powers  might well snatch at one last chance of fame and consider a baby in the field to have no rights he was bound to observe .  in short  it was not conceivable that sabbat steal humboldt   s idea  and from both angles  dr .  humboldt was guilty .     r .  daneel considered that for a long time .  then he held out his hand .     i must leave now  friend elijah .  it was good to see you .  may we meet again soon .     baley gripped the robot   s hand  warmly     if you don   t mind  r .  daneel     he said     not too soon .
