   councilman accused .          beware water .          too late .         questions        councilman pursued .         out of the deep         the mountain of flesh         to the surface .          to the city .           minds meet          minds battle          the enemy .           the enemy .        foreword  this book was first published in       and the description of the surface of venus was in accordance with astronomic beliefs of the period .   since       however  astronomical knowledge of the inner solar system has advanced enormously because of the use of radar beams and rockets .   in the late     s  the quantity of radio waves received from venus made it seem that the surface of venus might be much hotter than had been thought .  on august           a rocket probe called  mariner ii  was launched in the direction of venus .  it skimmed by within        miles of venus on december          .  measuring the radio waves emitted by the planet  it turned out that the surface temperature everywhere was indeed considerably higher than the boiling point of water .   this meant that far from having a worldwide ocean  as described in this book  venus had no ocean at all .  all of venus s water is in the form of water vapor in its clouds  and the surface is exceedingly hot and is bone dry .  the atmosphere of venus is  moreover  denser than had been thought and is almost entirely carbon dioxide .   nor had it been known  in       how long it took venus to rotate on its axis .  in       radar beams bounced off venus s surface showed that it was turning once in every     days  eighteen days longer than its year  and in the  wrong  direction as compared with other planets .   i hope that the readers enjoy this story anyway  but i would not wish them to be misguided into accepting as fact some of the material which was  accurate  in      but which is now outdated .   isaac asimov november        chapter    through the clouds of venus  lucky starr and john bigman jones kicked themselves up from the gravity free space station no .    and drifted toward the planetary coaster that waited for them with its air lock open .  their movements had the grace of long practice under non gravity conditions  despite the fact that their bodies seemed thick and grotesque in the space suits they wore .   bigman arched his back as he moved upward and craned his head to stare once again at venus .  his voice sounded loudly in lucky s ear through the suit sf radio .   space .  look at that rock  will you .   every inch of big man s five foot two was tense with the thrill of the sight .   bigman had been born and bred on mars and had never in his life been so close to venus .  he was used to ruddy planets and rocky asteroids .  he had even visited green and blue earth .  but here  now  was something that was pure gray and white .   venus filled over half the sky .  it was only two thousand miles away from the space station they were on .  another space station was on the opposite side of the planet .  these two stations  acting as receiving depots for venus bound spaceships  streaked about the planet in a three hour period of revolution  following one another s tracks like little puppies forever chasing their tails .   yet from those space stations  close though they were          to venus  nothing could be seen of the planet s surface .  no continents showed  no oceans  no deserts or mountains  no green valleys .  whiteness  only brilliant whiteness  interspersed with shifting lines of gray .   the whiteness was the turbulent cloud layer that hovered eternally over all of venus  and the gray lines marked the boundaries where cloud masses met and clashed .  vapor moved downward at those boundaries  and below those gray lines  on venus s invisible surface  it rained .   lucky starr said   no use looking at venus  bigman .  you ll be seeing plenty of it  close up  for a while .  it s the sun you ought to be saying good by to .    bigman snorted .  to his mars accustomed eyes  even earth s sun seemed swollen and overbright .  the sun  as seen from venus s orbit  was a bloated monster .  it was two and a quarter times as bright as earth s sun  four times as bright as the familiar sun on bigman s mars .  personally  he was glad that venus s clouds would hide its sun .  he was glad that the space station always arranged its vanes in such a way as to block off the sunlight .   lucky starr said   well  you crazy martian  are you getting in .    bigman had brought himself to a halt at the lip of the open lock by the casual pressure of one hand .  he was still looking at venus .  the visible half was in the full glare of the sun  but at the eastern side the night shadow was creeping in  moving quickly as the space station raced on in its orbit .   lucky  still moving upward  caught the lip of the lock in his turn and brought his other space suited hand flat against bigman s seat .  under the gravity free conditions  bigman s little body went tumbling slowly inward  while lucky s figure bobbed outward .   lucky s arm muscle contracted  and he floated up and inward with an easy  flowing motion .  lucky had no cause for a light heart at the moment  but he was forced into a smile when he found bigman spread eagled in mid air  with the tip of one gauntleted finger against       the inner lock holding him steady .  the outer lock closed as lucky passed through .   bigman said   listen  you wombug  someday i m  walking out on you and you can get yourself an  other    air hissed into the small room  and the inner lock opened .  two men floated rapidly through  dodging big man s dangling feet .  the one in the lead  a stocky fellow with dark hair and a surprisingly large mustache  said   is there any trouble  gentlemen .    the second man  taller  thinner  and with lighter hair but a mustache just as large  said   can we help you .    bigman said loftily   you can help us by giving us room and letting us get our suits off .   he had flicked himself to the floor and was removing his suit as he spoke .  lucky had already shucked his .   the men went through the inner lock .  it  too  closed behind them .  the space suits  their outer surface cold with the cold of space  were frosting over as moisture from the warm air of the coaster congealed upon them .  bigman tossed them out of the coaster s warm  moist air on to the tiled racks  where the ice might melt .   the dark haired man said   let s see  now .  you two are william williams and john jones .  right .    lucky said   i m williams .   using that alias under ordinary conditions was second nature to lucky by now .  it was customary for council of science members to shun publicity at all times .  it was particularly advisable now with the situation on venus as confused and uncertain as it was .   lucky went on   our papers are in order  i believe  and our luggage is aboard .     everything s all right   the dark haired one said   i m george reval  pilot  and this is tor johnson  my co pilot .  we ll be taking off in a few minutes .  if there s anything you want  let us know .    the two passengers were shown to their small cabin  and lucky sighed inwardly .  he was never thoroughly comfortable in space except on his own speed cruiser       the shooting starr  now at rest in the space station s hangar .   tor johnson said in a deep voice   let me warn you   by the way  that once we get out of the space station s  orbit  we won t be in free fall any more .  gravity will  start picking up .  if you get space sick    bigman yelled   space sick .  you in planet goop  i could take gravity changes when i was a baby that you couldn t take right now .   he flicked his finger against the wall  turned a slow somersault  touched the wall again  and ended with his feet just a half inch above the floor .   try that someday when you feel real manly .     say   said the co pilot  grinning   you squeeze a lot of brash into half a pint  don t you .    bigman flushed instantly .   half a pint .  why  you  soup straining cobber   he screamed  but lucky s  hand was on his shoulder and he swallowed the rest of the sentence .   see you on venus   the little martian muttered darkly .   tor was still grinning .  he followed his chief into the control room toward the head of the ship .   bigman  his anger gone at once  said to lucky curiously   say  how about those mustaches .  never saw any so big .    lucky said   it s just a venusian custom  bigman .  i think practically everybody grows them on venus .     that so .   bigman fingered his lip  stroking its bareness .   wonder how i d look in one .     with one that big .   smiled lucky .   it would drown your whole face .    he dodged the punch bigman threw at him just as  the floor trembled lightly beneath their feet and the  venus marvel lifted off the space station .  the coaster  turned its nose into the contracting spiral trajectory   .  that would carry it  down  to venus .   lucky starr felt the beginnings of a long overdue relaxation flooding him as the coaster picked up speed .  his brown eyes were thoughtful  and his keen  fine featured face was in repose .  he was tall and looked       slim  but beneath that deceptive slimness were whipcord muscles .   life had already given much to lucky of both good and evil .  he had lost ms parents while still a child  lost them in a pirate attack near the very venus he was now approaching .  he had been brought up by his father s dearest friends  hector conway  now chief of the council of science  and augustus henree  section director of the same organization .   lucky had been educated and trained with but one thought in mind  someday he was to enter that very council of science  whose powers and functions made it the most important and yet least known body in the galaxy .   it was only a year ago  upon his graduation from the academy  that he had entered into full membership and become dedicated to the advancement of man and the destruction of the enemies of civilization .  he was the youngest member of the council and probably would remain so for years .   yet already he had won his first battles .  on the deserts of mars and among the dimlit rocks of the asteroid belt  he had met and triumphed over wrongdoing .   but the war against crime and evil is not a short term conflict  and now it was venus that was the setting for trouble  a trouble that was particularly disturbing since its details were misty .   chief of the council hector conway had pinched his lip and said   i m not sure whether it s a sirian conspiracy against the solar confederation  or just petty racketeering .  our local men there tend to view it seriously .    lucky said   have you sent any of our trouble shooters .   he was not long back from the asteroids  and he was listening to this with concern .   conway said   yes  evans .     lou evans .   asked lucky  his dark eyes lighting with pleasure .   he was one of my roommates at the academy .  he s good .         is he .  the venus office of the council has requested his removal and investigation on the charge of corruption .     what .   lucky was on his feet  horrified .   uncle hector  that s impossible .     want to go out there and look into it yourself .     do i .  great stars and little asteroids .  bigman and i will take off just as soon as we get the shooting starr flight ready .    and now lucky watched out the porthole thoughtfully  on the last leg of his flight .  the night shadow had crept over venus  and for an hour there was only blackness to be seen .  all the stars were hidden by venus s huge bulk .   then they were out in the sunlight again  but now the viewport was only gray .  they were too close to see the planet as a whole .  they were even too close to see the clouds .  they were actually inside the cloudy layer .   bigman  having just finished a large chicken salad sandwich  wiped his lips and said   space  i d hate to have to pilot a ship through all this muck .    the coaster s wings had snapped out into extended position to take advantage of the atmosphere  and there was a definite difference in the quality of the ship s motion as a result .  the buffeting of the winds could be felt and the plunging and lifting of the drafts that sink and rise .   ships that navigate space are not suitable for the treachery of thick atmosphere .  it is for that reason that planets like earth and venus  with deep layers of air enshrouding them  require space stations .  to those space stations come the ships of deep space .  from the stations planetary coasters with retractable wings ride the tricky ak currents to the planet s surface .   bigman  who could pilot a ship from pluto to mercury blindfolded  would have been lost at the first thickening wisp of an atmosphere .  even lucky  who in his intensive training at the academy had piloted coasters  would not have cared to take on the job in the blanketing clouds that surrounded them now .         until the first explorers landed on venus   lucky said   all mankind ever saw of the planet was the outer surface of these clouds .  they had weird notions about the planet then .    bigman didn t reply .  he was looking into the cello plex container to make sure there wasn t another chicken salad sandwich hiding there .   lucky went on .   they couldn t tell how fast venus was rotating or whether it was rotating at all .  they weren t even sure about the composition of venus s atmosphere .  they knew it had carbon dioxide  but until the late     s astronomers thought venus had no water .  when ships began to land  mankind found that wasn t so .    he broke off .  despite himself  lucky s mind returned once again to the coded spacegram he had received in mid flight  with earth ten million miles behind .  it was from lou evans  his old roommate  to .  whom he had subethered that he was on his way .   the reply was short  blunt  and clear .  it was   stay away .    just that .  it was unlike evans .  to lucky  a message like that meant trouble  big trouble  so he did not  stay away .   instead  he moved the micropile energy output up a notch and increased acceleration to the gasping point .   bigman was saying   gives you a funny feeling  lucky  when you think that once  long ago  people were all cooped up on earth .  couldn t get off it no matter what they did .  didn t know anything about mars or the moon or anywhere .  it gives me the shivers .    it was just at that point that they pierced the cloud barrier  and even lucky s gloomy thoughts vanished at the sight that met their eyes .   it was sudden .  one moment they were surrounded by what seemed an eternal milkiness  the next  there was only transparent air about them .  everything below was bathed in a clear  pearly light .  above was the gray undersurface of the clouds .   bigman said   hey  lucky  look .        venus stretched out below them for miles in every direction  and it was a solid carpet of blue green vegetation .  there were no dips or rises in the surface .  it was absolutely level  as though it had been planed down by a giant atomic siicer .   nor was there anything to be seen that would have been normal in an earthly scene .  no roads or houses  no towns or streams .  just blue green  unvarying  as far as could be seen .   lucky said   carbon dioxide does it .  it s the part of the air plants feed on .  on earth there s only three hun dredths of one per cent in the air  but here almost ten per cent of the air is carbon dioxide .    bigman  who had lived for years on the farms of mars  knew about carbon dioxide .  he said   what makes it so light with all the clouds .    lucky smiled .   you re forgetting  bigman .  the sun is over twice as bright here as on earth .   then as he looked out the port again  his smile thinned and vanished .    funny   he murmured .   suddenly  he turned away from the window .   bigman   he said   come with me to the pilot room .    in two strides he was out the cabin .  in two more  he was at the pilot room .  the door wasn t locked .  he pulled it open .  both pilots  george reval and tor johnson  were at their places  eyes glued to the controls .  neither turned as they entered .   lucky said   men    no response .   he touched johnson s shoulder  and the co pilot s arm twitched irritably  shaking off lucky s grip .   the young councilman seized johnson by either shoulder and called   get the other one  bigman .    the little fellow was already at work on that very job  asking no questions  attacking with a bantam s fury .   lucky hurled johnson from him .  johnson staggered back  righted himself  and charged forward .  lucky ducked a wild blow and brought a straight armed right       to the side of the other s jaw .  johnson went down  cold .  at nearly the same moment  bigman  with a quick and skillful twist of george reval s arm  flung him along the floor and knocked him breathless .   bigman dragged both pilots outside the pilot room and closed the door on them .  he came back to find lucky handling the controls feverishly .   only then did he ask for an explanation .   what hap pened .     we weren t leveling off   said lucky grimly .   i watched the surface  and it was coming up too fast .  it still is .    he strove desperately to find the particular control for the ailerons  those vanes that controlled the angle of flight .  the blue surface of venus was much closer .  it was rushing at them .   lucky s eyes were on the pressure gauge .  it measured the weight of air above them .  the higher it rose  the closer they were to the surface .  it was climbing less quickly now .  lucky s fist closed more tightly on the duorod  squeezing the forks together .  that must be it .  he dared not exert force too rapidly or the ailerons might be whipped off altogether by the screaming gale that flung itself past their ship .  yet there was only five hundred feet to spare before zero altitude .   his nostrils flaring  the cords in his neck standing out  lucky played those ailerons against the wind .    we re leveling   breathed bigman .   we re level  ing    but there wasn t room enough .  the blue green came up and up till it filled all the view in the port .  then  with a speed that was too great and an angle that was also too great  the venus marvel  carrying lucky starr and bigman jones  struck the surface of the planet venus .   chapter    under the sea dome  had the surface of venus been what it seemed to be at first glance  the venus marvel would have smashed to scrap and burned to ash .  the career of lucky starr would have ended at that moment .   fortunately  the vegetation that had so thickly met the eye was neither grass nor shrubbery  but seaweed .  the flat plain was no surface of soil and rock  but water  the top of an ocean that surrounded and covered all of venus .   the venus marvel  even so  hit the ocean with a thunderous rattle  tore through the ropy weeds  and boiled its way into the depths .  lucky and bigman were hurled against the walls .   an ordinary vessel might have been smashed  but the venus marvel had been designed for entering water at high speed .  its seams were tight  its form  streamlined .  its wings  which lucky had neither time nor knowledge to retract  were torn loose  and its frame groaned under the shock  but it remained seaworthy .   down  down it went into the green black murk of the venusian ocean .  the cloud diffused light from above was almost totally stopped by the tight weed cover .  the ship s artificial lighting did not go on  its          workings apparently put out of order by the shock of contact .   lucky s senses were whirling .   bigman   he called .   there was no answer  and he stretched out his arms  feeling .  his hand touched bigman s face .    bigman .   he called again .  he felt the little martian s chest  and the heart was beating regularly .  relief washed over lucky .   he had no way of telling what was happening to the ship .  he knew he could never find any way of controlling it in the complete darkness that enveloped them .  he could only hope that the friction of the water would halt the ship before it struck bottom .   he felt for the pencil flash in his shirt pocket   a little plastic rod some six inches long that  on activation by thumb pressure  became a solid glow of light that streamed out forward  its beam broadening without seeming to weaken appreciably .   lucky groped for bigman again and examined him gently .  there was a lump on the martian s temple  but no broken bones so far as lucky could tell .   bigman s eyes fluttered .  he groaned .   lucky whispered   take it easy  bigman .  we ll be all right .   he was far from sure of that as he stepped out into the corridor .  the pilots would have to be alive and cooperative if the ship were ever to see home port again .   they were sitting up  blinking at lucky s flash as he came through the door .    what happened .   groaned johnson .   one minute i  was at the controls  and then   there was no hostil  ity  only pain and confusion  in his eyes .   the venus marvel was back to partial normality .  it was limping badly  but its searchlights  fore and aft  had been restored to operation and the emergency batteries had been rigged up to supply them with all the power they would need for vital operations .  the churning of the propeller could be dimly heard  and the planetary coaster was displaying  adequately enough       its third function .  it was a vessel that could navigate  not only in space and in air  but under water as well .   george reval stepped into the control room .  he was downcast and obviously embarrassed .  he had a gash on his cheek  which lucky had washed  disinfected  and neatly sprayed with koagulum .   reval said   there are a few minor seepages  but i plugged them .  the wings are gone  and the main batteries are all junked up .  we ll need all sorts of repairs  but i guess we re lucky at that .  you did a good job  . mr .  williams .    lucky nodded briefly .   suppose you tell me what happened .    reval flushed .   i don t know .  i hate to say it  but i don t know .     how about you .   asked lucky  addressing the other .   tor johnson  his large hands nursing the radio back to life  shook his head .   reval said   the last clear thoughts i can remember were while we were still inside the cloud layer .  i remember nothing after that till i found myself staring at your flash .    lucky said   do you or johnson use drugs of any kind .    johnson looked up angrily .  he rumbled   no .  nothing .     then what made you blank out  and both at the same time  too .    reval said   i wish i knew .  look  mr .  williams  neither one of us is an amateur .  our records as coaster pilots are first class .   he groaned .   or at least we were first class pilots .  we ll probably be grounded after this .     we ll see   said lucky .    say  look   said bigman  testily   what s the use of talking about what s over and gone .  where are we now .  that s what i want to know .  where are we going .    tor johnson said   we re  way off our course .  i can tell you that much .  it will be five or six hours before we get out to aphrodite .          fat jupiter and little satellites .   said bigman  staring at the blackness outside the port in disgust .   five or six hours in this black mess .    aphrodite is the largest city on venus  with a population of over a quarter of a million .   with the venus marvel still a mile away  the sea about it was lit into green translucence by aphrodite s lights .  in the eerie luminosity the .  dark  sleek shapes of the rescue vessels  which had been sent out to meet them after radio contact had been established  could be plainly made out .  they slipped along  silent companions .   as for lucky and bigman  it was their first sight of one of venus s underwater domed cities .  they almost forgot the unpleasantness they had just passed through  in their amazement at the wonderful object before them .   from a distance it seemed an emerald green  fairyland bubble  shimmering and quivering because of the water between them .  dimly they could make out buildings and the structural webbing of the beams that held up the city dome against the weight of water overhead .   it grew larger and glowed more brightly as they approached .  the green grew lighter as the distance of water between them grew less .  aphrodite became less unreal  less fairylandish  but even more magnificent .   finally they slid into a huge air lock  capable of holding a small fleet of freighters or a large battle cruiser  and waited while the water was pumped out .  and when that was done  the venus marvel was floated out of the lock and into the city on a lift field .   lucky and bigman watched as their luggage was removed  shook hands gravely with reval and johnson  and took a skimmer to the hotel bellevue aphrodite .   bigman looked out of the curved window as their skimmer  its gyro wings revolving with stately dignity  moved lightly among the city s beams and over its rooftops .       he said   so this is venus .  don t know if it s worth going through so much for it  though .  i ll never forget that ocean coming up at us .    lucky said   i m afraid that was just the beginning .    bigman looked uneasily at his big friend .   you really think so .    lucky shrugged .   it depends .  let s see what evans has to tell us .    the green room of the hotel bellevue aphrodite was just that .  the quality of the lighting and the shimmer of it gave the tables and guests the appearance of being suspended beneath the sea .  the ceiling was an inverted bowl  below which there turned slowly a large aquarium globe  supported by cunningly placed lift beams .  the water in it was laced with strands of venusian seaweed and in among it writhed colorful  sea ribbons   one of the most beautiful forms of animal life on the planet .   bigman had come in first  intent on dinner .  he was annoyed at the absence of a punch menu  disturbed by the presence of actual human waiters  and resentful over the fact that he was told that diners in the green room ate a meal supplied by the management and only that .  he was mollified  slightly  when the appetizer turned out to be tasty and the soup  very good .   then the music started  the domed ceiling gradually came to glowing life  and the aquarium globe began its gentle spinning .   bigman s mouth fell open  his dinner was forgotten .    look at that   he said .   lucky was looking .  the sea ribbons were of different lengths  varying from tiny threads two inches long to broad and sinuous belts that stretched a yard or more from end to end .  they were all thin  thin as a sheet of paper .  they moved by wriggling their bodies into a series of waves that rippled down their full length .   and each one fluoresced  each one sparkled with colored light .  it was a tremendous display .  down the sides of each sea ribbon were little glowing spirals of      light  crimson  pink  and orange  a few blues and violets scattered through  and one or two striking whites among the larger specimens .  all were overcast with the light green wash of the external light .  as they swam  the lines of color snapped and interlaced .  to the dazzled eye they seemed to be leaving rainbow trails that washed and sparkled in the water  fading out only to be renewed in still brighter tints .   bigman turned his attention reluctantly to his dessert .  the waiter had called it  jelly seeds   and at first the little fellow had regarded the dish suspiciously .  the jelly seeds were soft orange ovals  which clung together just a bit but came up readily enough in the spoon .  for a moment they felt dry and tasteless to the tongue  but then  suddenly  they melted into a thick  sirupy liquid that was sheer delight .    space .   said the astonished bigman .   have you tried the dessert .     what .   asked lucky absently .    taste the dessert  will you .  it s like thick pineapple juice  only a million times better .   .   .   .  what s the matter .    lucky said   we have company .     aw  go on .   bigman made a move to turn in his seat as though to inspect the other diners .   lucky said quietly   take it easy   and that froze bigman .   bigman heard the soft steps of someone approaching their table .  he tried to twist his eyes .  his own blaster was in his room  but he had a force knife in his belt pocket .  it looked like a watch fob  but it could slice a man in two  if necessary .  he fingered it intensely .   a voice behind bigman said   may i join you  folks .    bigman turned in his seat  force knife palmed and ready for a quick  upward thrust .  but the man looked anything but sinister .  he was fat  but his clothes fit well .  his face was round and his graying hair was carefully combed over the top of his head  though his baldness showed anyway .  his eyes were little  blue  and full of      what seemed like friendliness .  of course  he had a large  grizzled mustache of the true venusian fashion .   lucky said calmly   sit down  by all means .   his attention seemed entirely centered on the cup of hot coffee that he held cradled in ms right hand .   the fat man sat down .  his hands rested upon the table .  one wrist was exposed  slightly shaded by the palm of the other .  for an instant  an oval spot on it darkened and turned black .  within it little yellow grains of light danced and flickered in the familiar patterns of the big dipper and of orion .  then it disappeared  and there was only an innocent plump wrist and the smiling  round face of the fat man above it .   that identifying mark of the council of science could be neither forged nor imitated .  the method of its controlled appearance by the exertion of will was just about the most closely guarded secret of the council .   the fat man said   my name is mel morriss .    lucky said   i rather thought you were .  you ve been described to me .    bigman sat back and returned his force knife to its place .  mel morriss was head of the venusian section of the council .  bigman had heard of him .  in a way he was relieved  and in another way he was just a little disappointed .  he had expected a fight   perhaps a quick dash of coffee into the fat man s face  the table overturned  and from then on  anything .   lucky said   venus seems an unusual and beautiful place .     you have observed our fluorescent aquarium .     it is very spectacular   said lucky .   the venusian councilman smiled and raised a finger .  the waiter brought him a hot cup of coffee .  morriss let it cool for a moment  then said softly   i believe you are disappointed to see me here .  you expected other company  i think .    lucky said coolly   i had looked forward to an informal conversation with a friend .     in fact   said morriss   you had sent a message to councilman evans to meet you here .         i see you know that .     quite .  evans has been under close observation for quite a while .  communications to him are intercepted .    their voices were low .  even bigman had trouble hearing them as they faced one  another  sipping coffee and allowing no trace of expression in their words .   lucky said   you are wrong to do this .     you speak as his friend .     i do .     and i suppose that  as your friend  he warned you to stay away from venus .     you know about that  too  i see .     quite .  and you had a near fatal accident in landing on venus .  am i right .     you are .  you re implying that evans feared some such event .     feared it .  great space  starr  your friend evans engineered that accident .    chapter    yeast .   lucky s expression remained impassive .  not by so  much as an eye flicker did he betray any concern .   details  please   he said .   morriss was smiling again  half his mouth hidden by his preposterous venusian mustache .   not here  i m afraid .     name your place  then .     one moment .   morriss looked at his watch .   in just about a minute  the show will begin .  there ll be dancing by sealight .     sealight .     the globe above will shine dim green .  people will get up to dance .  we will get up with them and quietly leave .     you sound as though we are in danger at the moment .    morriss said gravely   you are .  i assure you that since you entered aphrodite  our men have never let you out of their sight .    a genial voice rang out suddenly .  it seemed to come from the crystal centerpiece on the table .  from the direction in which other diners turned their attention  it obviously came from the crystal centerpiece on every table .   it said   ladies and gentlemen  welcome to the green         room .  have you eaten well .  for your added pleasure  the management is proud to present the magnetonic rhythms of tobe tobias and his      as the voice spoke  the lights went out and the remainder of its words were drowned in a rising sigh of wonder that came from the assembled guests  most of whom were fresh from earth .  the aquarium globe in the ceiling was suddenly a luminous emerald green and the sea ribbon glow was sharply brilliant .  the globe assumed a faceted appearance so that  as it turned  drifting shadows circled the room in a soft  almost hypnotic fashion .  the sound of music  drawn almost entirely from the weird  husky sound boxes of a variety of magnetonic instruments  grew louder .  the notes were produced by rods of various shapes being moved in skillful patterns through the magnetic field that surrounded each instrument .   men and women were rising to dance .  there was the rustle of much motion and the sibilance of laughing whispers .  a touch on lucky s sleeve brought first him  and then bigman  to their feet .   lucky and bigman followed morriss silently .  one by one  grim faced figures fell in behind them .  it was almost as though they were materializing out of the draperies .  they remained far enough away to look innocent  but each  lucky felt sure  had his hand near the butt of a blaster .  no mistake about it .  mel morriss of the venusian section of the council of science took the situation very much in earnest .   lucky looked about morriss s apartment with approval .  it was not lavish  although it was comfortable .  living in it  one could forget that a hundred yards above was a translucent dome beyond which was a hundred yards of shallow  carbonated ocean  followed by a hundred miles of alien  unbreathable atmosphere .   what actually pleased lucky most was the collection of book films that overflowed one alcove .   he said   you re a biophysicist  dr .  morriss .   automatically  he used the professional title .          morriss said   yes .     i did biophysical work myself at the academy   said lucky .    i know   said morriss .   i read your paper .  it was good work .  may i call you david  by the way .     it s my first name   conceded the earthman   but everyone calls me lucky .    bigman  meanwhile  had opened one of the film holders  unreeled a bit of the film  and held it to the light .  he shuddered and replaced it .   he said belligerently to morriss   you sure don t look like a scientist .     i imagine not   said morriss  unoffended .   that helps  you know .    lucky knew what he meant .  in these days  when science really permeated all human society and culture  scientists could no longer restrict themselves to their laboratories .  it was for that reason that the council of science had been born .  originally it was intended only as an advisory body to help the government on matters of galactic importance  where only trained scientists could have sufficient information to make intelligent decisions .  more and more it had become a crime fighting agency  a counterespionage system .  into its own hands it was drawing more and more of the threads of government .  through its activities there might grow  someday  a great empire of the milky way in which all men might live in peace and harmony .   so it came about that  as members of the council had to fulfill many duties far removed from pure science  it was better for their success if they didn t look par  ticularly like scientists   as long  that is  as they had the brains of scientists .   lucky said   would you begin  sir  by filling me in on the details of the troubles here .     how much were you told on earth .     the barest sketch .  i would prefer to trust the man on the scene for the rest .    morriss smiled with more than a trace of irony .   trust the man on the scene .  that s not the usual      attitude of the men in the central office .  they send their own trouble shooters  and men such as evans arrive .     and myself  too   said lucky .    your case is a little different .  we all know of your accomplishments on mars last year  and the good piece of work you ve just finished in the asteroids .      bigman crowed   you should have been with mm if you think you know allabout it .    lucky reddened slightly .  he said hastily   never mind now  bigman .  let s not have any of your yarns .    they were all in large armchairs  earth manufactured  soft and comfortable .  there was something about the reflected sound of their voices that  to lucky s practiced ear  was good evidence that the apartment was insulated and spy shielded .   morriss lit a cigarette and offered one to the others but was refused .   how much do you know about venus  lucky .    lucky smiled .   the usual things one learns in school .  just to go over a few things quickly  it s the second closest planet to the sun and is about sixty seven million miles from it .  it s the closest world to earth and can come to within twenty six million miles of the home planet .  it s just a little smaller than earth  with a gravity about five sixths earth normal .  it goes around the sun in about seven and a half months and its day is about thirty six hours long .  it s surface temperature is a little higher than earth s but not much  because of the clouds .  also because of the clouds  it has no seasons to speak of .  it is covered by ocean  which is  in turn  covered with seaweed .  its atmosphere is carbon dioxide and nitrogen and is unbreathable .  how is that  dr .  morriss .     you pass with high marks   said the biophysicist   but i was asking about venusian society rather than about the planet itself .     well  now  that s more difficult .  i know  of course    see david starr  space ranger  new york  signet        .    see lucky starr and the pirates of the asteroids  new york  signet        .       that humans live in domed cities in the shallower parts of the ocean  and  as i can see for myself  venusian city life is quite advanced   far beyond martian city life  for instance .    bigman yelled   hey .    morriss turned his little twinkling eyes on the martian .   you disagree with your friend .    bigman hesitated .   well  maybe not  but he doesn t have to say so .    lucky smiled and went on   venus is a fairly developed planet .  i think there are about fifty cities on it and a total population of six million .  your exports are dried seaweed  which i am told is excellent fertilizer  and dehydrated yeast bricks for animal food .     still fairly good   said morriss .   how was your dinner at the green room  gentlemen .    lucky paused at the sudden change of topic  then said   very good .  why do you ask .     you ll see in a moment .  what did you have .    lucky said   i couldn t say  exactly .  it was the house meal .  i should guess we had a kind of beef goulash with a rather interesting sauce and a vegetable i didn t recognize .  there was a fruit salad  i believe  before that and a spicy variety of tomato soup .    bigman broke in .   and jelly seeds for dessert .    morriss laughed hootingly .   you re all wrong  you know   he said .   you had no beef  no fruit  no tomatoes .  not even coffee .  you had only one thing to eat .  only one thing .  yeast .     what .   shrieked bigman .   for a moment lucky was startled also .  his eyes narrowed and he said   are you serious .     of course .  it s the green room s specialty .  they never speak of it  or earthmen would refuse to eat it .  later on  though  you would have been questioned thoroughly as to how you liked this dish or that  how you thought it might have been improved  and so on .  the green room is venus s most valuable experimental station .    bigman screwed up his small face and yelled vehe       mently   i ll have the law on them .  i ll make a council  case of it .  they can t feed me yeast without telling me   like i was a horse or a cow   or a    he ended in a flurry of sputtering .    i am guessing   said lucky   that yeast has some connection with the crime wave on venus .     guessing  are you .   said morriss  dryly .   then you haven t read our official reports .  i m not surprised .  earth thinks we are exaggerating here .  i assure you  however  we are not .  and it isn t merely a crime wave .  yeast  lucky  yeast .  that is the nub and core of everything on this planet .    a self propelled tender had rolled into the living room with a bubbling percolator and three cups of steaming coffee upon it .  the tender stopped at lucky first  then bigman .  morriss took the third cup  put his lips to it  then wiped his large mustache appreciatively .    it will add cream and sugar if you wish  gentlemen   he said .   bigman looked and sniffed .  he said to morriss with sharp suspicion   yeast .     no .  real coffee this time .  i swear it .    for a moment they sipped in silence  then morriss said   venus  lucky  is an expensive world to keep up .  our cities must make oxygen out of water  and that takes huge electrolytic stations .  each city requires tremendous power beams to help support the domes against billions of tons of water .  the city of aphrodite uses as much energy in a year as the entire continent of south america  yet it has only a thousandth the population .    we ve got to earn that energy  naturally .  we ve got to export to earth in order to obtain power plants  specialized machinery  atomic fuel  and so on .  venus s only product is seaweed  inexhaustible quantities of it .  some we export as fertilizer  but that is scarcely the answer to the problem .  most of our seaweed  however  we use as culture media for yeast  ten thousand and one varieties of yeast .        bigman s lip curled .   changing seaweed to yeast isn t much of an improvement .     did you find your last meal satisfactory .   asked morriss .    please go on  dr .  morriss   said lucky .   morriss said   of course  mr .  jones is quite cor     call me bigman .    morriss looked soberly at the small martian and said   if you wish .  bigman is quite correct in his low opinion of yeast in general .  our most important strains are suitable only for animal food .  but even so  it s highly useful .  yeast fed pork is cheaper and better than any other kind .  the yeast is high in calories  proteins  minerals  and vitamins .    we have other strains of higher quality  which are used in cases where food must be stored over long periods and with little available space .  on long space journeys  for instance  so called y rations are frequently taken .    finally  we have our top quality strains  extremely expensive and fragile growths that go into the menus of the green room and with which we can imitate or improve upon ordinary food .  none of these are in quantity production  but they will be someday .  i imagine you see the whole point of all this  lucky .     i think i do .     i don t   said bigman belligerently .   morriss was quick to explain .   venus will have a  monopoly on these luxury strains .  no other world will  possess them .  without venus s experience in zymocul   ture     in what .   asked bigman .    in yeast culture .  without venus s experience in that  no other world could develop such yeasts or maintain them once they did obtain them .  so you see that venus could build a tremendously profitable trade in yeast strains as luxury items with all the galaxy .  that would be important not only to venus  but to earth as well    to the entire solar confederation .  we are the most over       populated system in the galaxy  being the oldest .  if we could exchange a pound of yeast for a ton of grain  things would be well for us .    lucky had been listening patiently to morriss s lecture .  he said   for the same reason  it would be to the interest of a foreign power  which was anxious to weaken earth  to ruin venus s monopoly of yeast .     you see that  do you .  i wish i could persuade the rest of the council of this living and ever present danger .  if growing strains of yeast were stolen along with some of the knowledge of our developments in yeast culture  the results could be disastrous .     very well   said lucky   then we come to the important point  have such thefts occurred .     not yet   said morriss grimly .   but for six months now we have had a rash of petty pilfering  odd accidents  and queer incidents .  some are merely annoying  or even funny  like the case of the old man who threw half credit pieces to children and then went frantically to the police  insisting he had been robbed .  when witnesses came forward to show that he had given the money away  he nearly went mad with fury  insisting that he had done no such thing .  there are more serious accidents  too  like that in which a freight roller operator released a half ton bale of weed at the wrong time and killed two men .  he insisted later that he had blacked out .    bigman squealed excitedly   lucky .  the pilots on the coaster claimed they blacked out .    morriss nodded   yes  and i m almost glad it happened as long as the two of you survived .  the council on earth may be a bit readier to believe there is something behind all this .     i suppose   said lucky   you suspect hypnotism .    morriss drew his lips into a grim  humorless smile .   hypnotism is a mild word  lucky .  do you know of any hypnotist who can exert his influence at a distance over unwilling subjects .  i tell you that some person or persons on venus possesses the power of complete      mental domination over others .  they are exerting this power  practicing it  growing more adept in its use .  with every day it will grow more difficult to fight them .  perhaps it is already too late .    chapter    counglman accused .   bigman s eyes sparkled .   it s never too late once lucky gets going .  where do we start  lucky .    lucky said quietly   with lou evans .  i ve been waiting for you to mention him  dr .  morriss .    morriss s eyebrows drew together  his plump face contracted into a frown .   you re his friend .  you want to defend him  i know .  it s not a pleasant story .  it wouldn t be if it involved any councilman at all   but a friend at that .    lucky said   i am not acting out of sentiment only  dr .  morriss .  i knew lou evans as well as one man can know another .  i know he is incapable of doing anything to harm the council or earth .     then listen  and judge for yourself .  for most of evans s tour of duty here on venus  he accomplished nothing .  a  trouble shooter  they called him  which is a pretty word but means nothing .     no offense  dr .  morriss  but did you resent his arrival .     no  of course not .  i just saw no point in it .  we here have grown old on venus .  we have the experience .  what do they expect a youngster  new from earth  to accomplish .     a fresh approach is helpful sometimes .     nonsense .  i tell you  lucky  the trouble is that          earth headquarters don t consider our problem important .  their purpose in sending evans was to have him give it a quick glance  whitewash it  and return to tell them it was nothing .     i know the council on earth better than that .  you do  too .    but the grumbling venusian went on .   anyway  three weeks ago  this man evans asked to see some of the classified data concerning yeast strain growth .  the men in the industry objected .     objected .   said lucky .   it was a councilman s request .     true  but yeast strain men are secretive .  you don t make requests like that .  even councilmen don t .  they asked evans why he wanted the information .  he refused to tell them .  they forwarded his request to me  and i quashed it .     on what grounds .   demanded lucky .    he wouldn t tell me his reasons either  and while i m senior councilman on venus  nobody in my organization will have secrets from me .  but your friend lou evans then did something i had not expected .  he stole the data .  he used his position as councilman to get inside a restricted area in the yeast research plants  and he left with microfilms inside his boot .     surely he had a good reason .     he did   said morriss   he did .  the microfilms dealt with the nutrient formulas required for the nourishment of a new and very tricky strain of yeast .  two days later a workman making up one component of that mixture introduced a trace of mercury salt .  the yeast died  and six months  work was ruined .  the workman swore he d done no such thing  but he had .  our psychiatrists psychoprobed him .  by now  you see  we had a pretty good notion of what to expect .  he d had a blackout period .  the enemy still hasn t stolen the strain of yeast  but they re getting closer .  right .    lucky s brown eyes were hard .   i can see the obvious theory .  lou evans had deserted to the enemy  whoever he is .         sirians   blurted morriss .   i m sure of it .     maybe   admitted lucky .  the inhabitants of the planets of sirius had  for centuries now  been earth s most fervent enemies .  it was easy to blame them .   maybe .  lou evans deserted to them  let us say  and agreed to get data for them that would enable them to start trouble inside the yeast factories .  little  troubles at first  which would pave the way for larger troubles .     yes  that s my theory .  can you propose any other .   couldn t councilman evans himself be under mental domination .     not likely  lucky .  we have many cases in our files now .  no one who has suffered from mental domination has blacked out for longer than half an hour  and all gave clear indication under the psychoprobe of periods of total amnesia .  evans would have had to be under mental domination for two days to have done what he did  and he gave no signs of amnesia .     he was examined .     he certainly was .  when a man is found with classified material in his possession   caught in the act  as it were   steps have to be taken .  i wouldn t care if he were a hundred times a councilman .  he was examined  and i  personally  put him on probation .  when he broke it to send some message on his own equipment  we tapped his scrambler and made sure he d do it no more   or  at least  not without our intercepting whatever he sent or received .  the message he sent you was his last .  we re through playing with him .  he s under confinement now .  i m preparing my report for central headquarters  a thing i should have done before this  and i m requesting his removal from office and trial for corruption  or  perhaps  for treason .     before you do that   said lucky .    yes .     let me speak to him .    morriss rose  smiling ironically .   you wish to .  certainly .  i ll take you to him .  he s in this building .  in fact  i d like to have you hear his defense .        they passed up a ramp  quiet guards snapping to attention and saluting .   bigman stared at them curiously .   is this a prison or what .     it s a kind of prison on these levels   said morriss .   we make buildings serve many purposes on venus .    they stepped into a small room  and suddenly  quite without warning  bigman burst into loud laughter .   lucky  unable to repress a smile  said   what s the matter  bigman .     no   nothing much   panted the little fellow  his eyes moist .   it s just that you look so funny  lucky  standing there with your bare upper lip hanging out .  after all those mustaches i ve been watching  you look deformed .  you look as though someone had taken a whiffgun and blown off the mustache you should have had .    morriss smiled at that and brushed his own grizzled mustache with the back of his hand  self consciously and a little proudly .   lucky s smile expanded .   funny   he said   i was thinking exactly the same about you  bigman .    morriss said   we ll wait here .  they re bringing evans now .   his finger moved away from a small pushbutton signal .   lucky looked about the room .  it was smaller than morriss s own room  more impersonal .  its only furniture consisted of several upholstered chairs plus a sofa  a low table in the center of the room  and two higher tables near the false windows .  behind each of the false windows was a cleverly done seascape .  on one of the two high tables was an aquarium  on the other  two dishes  one containing small dried peas and the other  a black  greasy substance .   bigman s eyes automatically started following lucky s about the room .   he said  suddenly   say  lucky  what s this .   he half ran to the aquarium  bending low  peering into its depths .   look at it  will you .     it s just one of the pet v frogs the men keep about      here   said morriss .   it s a rather good specimen .  haven t you ever seen one .     no   said lucky .  he joined bigman at the aquarium  which was two feet square and about three feet deep .  the water in it was criss crossed with feathery fronds of weed .   bigman said   it doesn t bite or anything  does it .   he was stirring the water with a forefinger and bending close to peer inside .   lucky s head came down next to bigman s .  the v frog stared back at them solemnly .  it was a little creature  perhaps eight inches long  with a triangular head into which two bulging black eyes were set .  it rested on six little padded feet drawn up close to its body .  each foot had three long toes in front and one behind .  its skin was green and froglike  and there were frilly fins  which vibrated rapidly  running down the center line of its back .  in place of a mouth it had a beak  strong  curved and parrotlike .   as lucky and bigman watched  the v frog started rising in the water .  its feet remained on the floor of the aquarium  but its legs stretched out like extendible stilts  as its numerous leg joints straightened .  it stopped rising just as its head was about to pierce the surface .   morriss  who had joined them and was staring fondly at the little beast  said   it doesn t like to get out of the water .  too much oxygen in the air .  they enjoy oxygen  but only in moderation .  they re mild  pleasant little things .    bigman was delighted .  there was virtually no native animal life on mars  and living creatures of this sort were a real novelty to him .    where do they live .   he asked .   morriss put a finger down into the water and stroked the v frog s head .  the v frog permitted it  closing its dark eyes in spasmodic motions that might have meant delight  for all they could guess .   morriss said   they congregate in the seaweed in fairly large numbers .  they move around in it as though it were a forest .  their long toes can hold individual      stems  and their beaks can tear the toughest fronds .  they could probably make a mean dent in a man s finger  but i ve never known one of them to bite .  i m amazed you haven t seen one yet .  the hotel has a whole collection of them  real family groups  on display .  you haven t seen it .     we ve scarcely had the chance   said lucky dryly .   bigman stepped quickly to the other table  picked up a pea  dipped it into the black grease  and brought it back .  he held it out temptingly  and with infinite care the v frog s beak thrust out of the water and took the morsel from bigman s fingers .  bigman crowed his delight    did you see that .   he demanded .   morriss smiled fondly  as though at the tricks of a child .   the little imp .  they ll eat that all day .  look at him gobble it .    the v frog was crunching away .  a small black droplet leaked out of one side of its beak  and at once the little creature s legs folded up again as it moved down through the water .  the beak opened and the little black droplet was caught .    what is the stuff .   asked lucky .    peas dipped in axle grease   said morriss .   grease is a great delicacy for them  like sugar for us .  they hardly ever find pure hydrocarbon in their natural habitat .  they love it so  i wouldn t be surprised if they let themselves be captured just to get it .     how are they captured  by the way .     why  when the seaweed trawlers gather up their seaweed  there are always v frogs collected with it .  other animals  too .    bigman was saying eagerly   hey  lucky  let s you  and i get one    he was interrupted by a pair of guards  who entered stiffly .  between them stood a lanky  blond young man .   lucky sprang to his feet .   lou .  lou  old man .   he held out his hand  smiling .   for a moment it seemed as though the other might      respond .  a flicker of joy rose to the newcomer s eyes .   it faded quickly .  his arms remained stiffly and coldly at his side .  he said flatly   hello  starr .    lucky s hand dropped reluctantly .  he said   i haven t seen you since we graduated .   he paused .  what could one say next to an old friend .   the blond councilman seemed aware of the incongruity of the situation .  nodding curtly to the flanking guards  he said with macabre humor   there ve been some changes made since then .   then  with a spasmodic tightening of his thin lips  he went on   why did you come .  why didn t you stay away .  i asked you to .     i can t stay away when a friend s in trouble  lou .     wait till your help is asked for .    morriss said   i think you re wasting your time  lucky .  you re thinking of him as a councilman .  i suggest that he s a renegade .    the plump venusian said the word through clenched teeth  bringing it down like a lash .  evans reddened slowly but said nothing .   lucky said   i ll need proof to the last atom before i admit any such word in connection with councilman evans .   his voice came down hard on the word  councilman .    lucky sat down .  for a long moment he regarded his friend soberly  and evans looked away .   lucky said   dr .  morriss  ask the guards to leave .  i will be responsible for evans s security .    morriss lifted an eyebrow at lucky  then after an instant s thought  gestured to the guards .   lucky said   if you don t mind  bigman  just step into the next room  will you .    bigman nodded and left .   lucky said gently   lou  there are only three of us here now .  you  i  dr .  morriss  that s all .  three men of the council of science .  suppose we start fresh .  did you remove classified data concerning yeast manufacture from their place in the files .    lou evans said   i did .     then you must have had a reason .  what was it .         now look .  i stole the papers .  i say stole .  i admit that much .  what more do you want .  i had no reason for doing it .  i just did it .  now drop it .  get away from me .  leave me alone .   his lips were trembling .   morriss said   you wanted to hear his defense  lucky .  that s it .  he has none .    lucky said   i suppose you know that there was an accident inside the yeast plants  shortly after you took those papers  involving just the strain of yeast the papers dealt with .     i know all that   said evans .    how do you explain it .     i have no explanation .    lucky was watching evans closely  searching for some sign of the good natured  fun loving  steel nerved youth he remembered so well at the academy .  except for a new mustache  grown according to venusian fashion  the man lucky saw now resembled the memory as far as mere physical appearance was concerned .  the same long boned limbs  the blond hair cut short  the angular  pointed chin  the flat bellied  athletic body .  but otherwise .  evans s eyes moved restlessly from spot to spot  his lips quivered dryly  his fingernails were bitten and ragged .   lucky struggled with himself before he could put the next blunt question .  it was a friend he was talking to  a man he had known well  a .  man whose loyalty he never had questioned  and on whose loyalty he would have staked his own life without thought .   he said   lou  have you sold out .    evans said in a dull  toneless voice   no comment .     lou  i m asking you again .  first  i want you to know that i m on your side no matter what you ve done .  if you ve failed the council  there must be a reason .  tell us that reason .  if you ve been drugged or forced  either physically or mentally  if you ve been blackmailed or if someone close to you has been threatened  tell us .  for earth s sake  lou  even if you ve been tempted with offers of money or power  even if it s as crude as that  tell us .  there s no error you can      have made that can t be at least partially retrieved by frankness now .  what about it .    for a moment  lou evans seemed moved .  his blue  eyes lifted in pain to bis friend s face .   lucky   he  began   i    then the softness in him seemed to die  and he cried   no comment  starr  no comment .    morriss  arms folded  said   that s it  lucky .  that s his attitude .  only he has information and we want it  and  by venus  we ll get it one way or another .    lucky said   wait    morriss said   we can t wait .  get that through your head .  there is no tune .  no time at all .  these so called accidents have been getting more serious as they get closer to their objective .  we need to break this thing now .   and his pudgy fist slammed down on the arm of his chair  just as the communo shrilled its signal .   morriss frowned .   emergency signal .  what in  space    he flicked the circuit open  put the receiver to his ear .    morriss speaking .  what is it .   .  .  .  what .   .   .   .  what .    he let the receiver fall  and his face  as it turned toward lucky  was a doughy  unhealthy white .    there s a hypnotized man at lock number twenty three   he choked out .   lucky s lithe body tightened like a steel spring .   what do you mean by  lock  .  are you referring to the dome .    morriss nodded and managed to say   i said the accidents are getting more serious .  this time  the sea dome .  that man may   at any moment   let the ocean into   aphrodite .    chapter     beware water .    from the speeding gyrocar  lucky caught glimpses of the mighty dome overhead .  a city built under water  he reflected  requires engineering miracles to be practical .   there were domed cities in many places in the solar system .  the oldest and most famous were on mars .  but on mars  gravity was only two fifths of earth normal  and pressing down on the martian domes was only a rarefied  wispy atmosphere .   here on venus  gravity was five sixths earth normal  and the venusian domes were topped with water .  even though the domes were built in shallow sea so that their tops nearly broke surface at low tide  it was still a matter of supporting millions of tons of water .   lucky  like most earthmen  and venusians  too  for that matter   tended to take such achievements of mankind for granted .  but now  with lou evans returned to confinement and the problem involving him momentarily dismissed  lucky s agile mind was putting thoughts together and craving knowledge on this new matter .   he said   how is the dome supported  dr .  morriss .    the fat venusian had recovered some of his composure .  the gyrocar he was driving hurtled toward the threatened sector .  his words were still tight and grim .          he said   diamagnetic force fields in steel housings .  it looks as though steel beams are supporting the dome  but that s not so .  steel just isn t strong enough .  it s the force fields that do it .    lucky looked down at the city streets below  filled with people and life .  he said   have there ever been any accidents of this type before .    morriss groaned   great space  not like this .   .   .   .  we ll be there in five minutes .     are any precautions taken against accidents .   lucky went on stolidly .    of course there are .  we have a system of alarms and automatic field adjusters that are as foolproof as we can manage .  and the whole city is built in segments .  any local failure in the dome brings down sections of transite  backed by subsidiary fields .     then the city won t be destroyed  even if the ocean is let in .  is that right .  and this is well known to the populations .     certainly .  the people know they re protected  but still  man  a good part of the city will be rained .  there s bound to be some loss of life  and property damage will be terrific .  worse still  if men can be controlled into doing this once  they can be controlled into doing it again .    bigman  the third man in the gyrocar  stared anxiously at lucky .  the tall earthman was abstracted  and his brows were knit into a hard frown .   then morriss grunted   here we are .   the car decelerated rapidly to a jarring halt .   bigman s watch said two fifteen  but that meant nothing .  venus s night was eighteen hours long  and here under the dome there was neither day nor night .   artificial lights blossomed now as they always did .  buildings loomed clearly as always .  if the city seemed different in any way  it was in the actions of its inhabitants .  they were swirling out of the various sections of the city .  news of the crisis had spread by the mysterious magic of word of mouth  and they were flocking      to see the sight  morbidly curious  as though going to a show or a circus parade  or as men on earth would flock for seats at a magnetonic concert .   police held back the rumbling crowds and beat out a path for morriss and the two with him .  already a thick partition of cloudy transite had moved down  blocking off the section of the city that was threatened by deluge .   morriss shepherded lucky and bigman through a large door .  the noise of the crowd muffled and faded behind them .  inside the building a man stepped hastily toward morriss .    dr .  morriss   he began .   morriss looked up and snapped out hasty introductions .   lyman turner  chief engineer .  david starr of the council .  bigman jones .    then  at some signal from another part of the room  he dashed off  his heavy body making surprising speed .  he called out over his shoulder as he started   turner will take care of you two .    turner yelled    just a minute  dr .  morriss .   but the yell went unheard .   lucky gestured to bigman  and the little martian raced after the venusian councilman .    is he going to bring dr .  morriss back .   asked turner worriedly  stroking a rectangular box he carried suspended from a strap over one shoulder .  he had a gaunt face and red brown hair  a prominently hooked nose  a scattering of freckles  and a wide mouth .  there was trouble in his face .    no   said lucky .   morriss may be needed out there .  i just gave my friend the high sign to stick closely to him .     i don t know what good that will do   muttered the engineer .   i don t know what good anything will do .   he put a cigarette to his mouth and absently held one out to lucky .  lucky s refusal went unnoticed for a few moments  and turner stood there  holding the plastic container of smokes at arm s length  lost in a thoughtful world of his own .       lucky said   they re evacuating the threatened sector  i suppose .    turner took back his cigarettes with a start  then puffed strongly at the one between his lips .  he dropped it and pressed it out with the sole of his shoe .    they are   he said   but i don t know  .   .   .   and his voice faded out .   lucky said   the partition is safely across the city  isn t it .     yes  yes   muttered the engineer .   lucky waited a moment  then said   but you re not satisfied .  what is it you were trying to tell dr .  morriss .    the engineer looked hastily at lucky  hitched at the black box he carried and said   nothing .  forget it .    they were off by themselves in a corner of the room .  men were entering now  dressed in pressure suits with the helmets removed  mopping perspiring foreheads .  parts of sentences drifted to their ears     .   .   .  not more than three thousand people left .  we re using all the interlocks now  .   .   .      .   .   .  can t get to him .  tried everything .  his wife is on the etherics now  pleading with him  .   .   .     darn it  he s got the lever in his hand .  all he has to do is pull it and we re  .   .   .     if we could only get close enough to blast him down .  if we were only sure he wouldn t see us first and  .   .   .    turner seemed to listen to all of it with a grisly fascination  but he remained in the corner .  he lit another cigarette and ground it out .   he burst out savagely   look at that crowd out there .  it s fun to them .  excitement .  i don t know what to do .  i tell you  i don t .   he hitched the black box he carried into a more comfortable position and held it close .    what is that .   asked lucky peremptorily .  turner looked down  stared at the box as though he were seeing it for the first time  then said   it s my computer .  a special portable model i designed myself .   for a moment pride drowned the worry in his voice .   there s not another one in the galaxy like it .  i always      carry it around .  that s how i know    and he  stopped again .   lucky said in a hard voice .   all right  turner  what do you know .  i want you to start talking .  now .    the young councilman s hand came lightly to rest upon the engineer s shoulder  and then his grip began to tighten just a bit .   turner looked up  startled  and the other s calm  brown eyes held him .   what s your name again .   he said .    i m david starr .    turner s eyes brightened .   the man they call  lucky  starr .     that s right .     all right  then  i ll tell you  but i can t talk loudly .  it s dangerous .    he began whispering  and lucky s head bent toward him .  both were completely disregarded by the busily hurrying men who entered and left the room .   turner s low words flooded out now as though he were glad to be able to get rid of them .  he said   the walls of the city dome are double  see .  each wall is made of transite  which is the toughest  strongest sili cone plastic known to science .  and it s backed by force beams .  it can stand immense pressures .  it s completely insoluble .  it doesn t etch .  no form of life will grow on it .  it won t change chemically as a result of anything in the venusian ocean .  in between the two parts of the double wall is compressed carbon dioxide .  that serves to break the shock wave if the outer wall should give way  and of course the inner wall is strong enough to hold the water by itself .  finally  there s a honeycomb of partitions between the walls so that only small portions of the in between will be flooded in case of any break .     it s an elaborate system   said lucky .    too elaborate   said turner bitterly .   an earthquake  or a venusquake  rather  might split the dome in two  but nothing else can touch it .  and there are no venus quakes in this part of the planet .   he stopped to light       still another cigarette .  his hands were trembling .   what s more  every square foot of the dome is wired to instruments that continually measure the humidity between the walls .  the slightest crack anywhere and the needles of those instruments jump .  even if the crack is microscopic and completely invisible  they jump .  then bells ring and sirens sound .  everyone yells   beware water .     he grinned crookedly .   beware water .  that s a laugh .  i ve been on the job ten years  and in all that time the instruments registered only five times .  in every case repairs took less than an hour .  you phi a diving bell on the affected part of the dome  pump out the water  fuse the transite  add another gob of the stuff  let it cool .  after that  the dome is stronger than before .  beware water .  we ve never had even a drop leak through .    lucky said   i get the picture .  now get to the point    the point is overconfidence  mr .  starr .  we ve partitioned off the dangerous sector  but how strong is the partition .  we always counted on the outer wall s going gradually  springing a small leak .  the water would trickle in  and we always knew that we would have plenty of time to get ready for it .  no one ever thought that someday a lock might be opened wide .  the water will come in like a fat steel bar moving a mile a second .  it will hit the sectional transite barrier like a spaceship at full acceleration .     you mean it won t hold .     i mean no one has ever worked out the problem .  no one has ever computed the forces involved   until half an hour ago .  then i did  just to occupy my time while all this is going on .  i had my computer .  i always have it with me .  so i made a few assumptions and went to work .     and it won t hold .     i m not certain .  i don t know how good some of my assumptions are  but i think it won t hold .  i think it won t .  so what do we do .  if the barrier doesn t hold  aphrodite is done .  the whole city .  you and i and a      quarter of a million people .  everybody .  those crowds outside that are so excited and thrilled are doomed once that man s hand pulls downward on the switch it holds .    lucky was staring at the man with horror .   how long have you known this .    the engineer blurted in immediate self defense    half an hour .  but what can i do .  we can t put subsea suits on a quarter of a million people .  i was thinking of talking to morriss and maybe getting some of the important people in town protected  or some of the women and children .  i wouldn t know how to pick which ones to save  but maybe something should be done .  what do you think .     i m not sure .    the engineer went on  harrowed .   i thought maybe i could put on a suit and get out of here .  get out of the city altogether .  there won t be proper guards at the exits at a time like this .    lucky backed away from the quivering engineer  his eyes narrowed .   great galaxy .  i ve been blind .    and he turned and dashed out of the room  his mind tingled with a desperate thought .   chapter    too late .   bigman felt dizzily helpless in the confusion .  hanging as closely as he could to the coattails of the restless morriss  he found himself trotting from group to group  listening to breathless conversations which he did not always understand because of his ignorance about venus .   morriss had no opportunity to rest .  each new minute brought a new man  a new report  a new decision .  it was only twenty minutes since bigman had run off after morriss  and already a dozen plans had been proposed and discarded .   one man  just returned from the threatened sector  was saying with pounding breath   they ve got the spy rays trained on him  and we can make him out .  he s just sitting with the lever in his hand .  we beamed his wife s voice in at him through the etherics  then through the public address system  then through loudspeaker from outside .  i don t think he hears her .  at least he doesn t move .    bigman bit his lip .  what would lucky do if he were here .  the first thought that had occurred to bigman was to get behind the man   poppnoe  his name was   and shoot him down .  but that was the first thought everyone had had  and it had been instantly discarded .  the man at the lever had closed himself off  and the dome control          chambers were carefully designed to prevent any form of tampering .  each entrance was thoroughly wired  the alarms being internally powered .  that precaution was now working in reverse   to aphrodite s peril rather than its protection .   at the first clang  at the first signal gleam  bigman was sure  the lever would be driven home and venus s ocean would charge inward upon aphrodite .  it could not be risked while evacuation was incomplete .   someone had suggested poison gas  but morriss had shaken his head without explanations .  bigman thought he knew what the venusian must be thinking .  the man at the lever was not sick or mad or malevolent  but under mental control .  that fact meant that there were two enemies .  the man at the lever  considered by himself  might weaken from the gas past the point where he would be physically capable of pulling the lever  but before that the weakening would be reflected in his mind  and the  men in control would work their tool s arm muscles quickly enough .    what are they waiting for  anyway .   growled mor  .  riss under his breath  while the perspiration rolled down his cheeks in streams .   if i could only train an atom cannon at the spot .    bigman knew why that was impossible  too .  an atom cannon trained to hit the man from the closest approach possible would require enough power to go through a quarter mile of architecture and would damage the dome enough to bring on the very danger they were trying to avoid .   he thought  where is lucky  anyway .  aloud he said   if you can t get this fellow  what about the controls .     what do you mean .   said morris .    i mean  gimmick the lever .  it takes power to open the lock  doesn t it .  what if the power is cut .     nice thought  bigman .  but each lock has its own emergency power generator on the spot .     can t it be closed off from anywhere .     how .  he s closed off in there  with every cubic foot set off with alarms .        bigman looked up and  in vision  seemed to see the mighty ocean that covered them .  he said   this is a closed in city  like on mars .  we ve got to pump air all over .  don t you do that  too .    morriss brought a handkerchief to his forehead and wiped it slowly .  he stared at the little martian .   the ventilating ducts .     yes .  there s got to be one to that place with the lock  doesn t there .     of course .     and isn t there someplace along the line where a wire can be wrenched loose or cut or something .     wait a while .  a microbomb shoved along the duct   instead of the poison gas we were talking about    that s not sure enough   said bigman impatiently .   send a man .  you need big ducts for an underwater city  don t you .  won t they hold a man .     they re not as big as all that   said morriss .   bigman swallowed painfully .  it cost him a great deal to make the next statement .   i m not as big as all that  either .  maybe i ll fit .    and morriss  staring down wide eyed at the pint size martian  said   venus .  you might .  you might .  come with me .    from the appearance of the streets of aphrodite  it seemed as though not a man or woman or child in the city was sleeping .  just outside the transite partition and surrounding the  rescue headquarters  building  people choked every avenue and turned them into black masses of chattering humanity .  chains had been set up  and behind them policemen with stunguns paced restlessly .   lucky  having emerged from rescue headquarters at what amounted to a dead run  was brought up sharply by those chains .  a hundred impressions burst in on him .  there was the brilliant sign in lucite curlicues  set high in aphrodite s sky with no visible support .  it turned slowly and said  aphrodite  beauty spot of venus  welcomes you .   close by  a line of men were moving on in file .  they      were carrying odd objects   stuffed brief cases  jewel boxes  clothes slung over their arms .  one by one  they were climbing into skimmers .  it was obvious who and what they were  escapees from within the threatened zone  passing through the lock with whatever they could carry that seemed most important to them .  the evacuation was obviously well under way .  there were no women and children in the line .   lucky shouted to a passing policeman   is there a skimmer i can use .    the policeman looked up .   no  sir  all being used .    lucky said impatiently   council business .     can t help it .  every skimmer in town is being used for those guys .   his thumb jerked toward the moving file of men in the middle distance .    it s important .  i ve got to get out of here .     then you ll have to walk   said the policeman .   lucky gritted his teeth with vexation .  there was no way of getting through the crowd on foot or on wheels .  it had to be by air and it had to be now .    isn t there anything available i can use .  anything .   he was scarcely speaking to the policeman  more to his own impatient self  angry at having been so simply duped by the enemy .   but the policeman answered wryly   unless you want to use a hopper .     a hopper .  where .   lucky s eyes blazed .    i was just joking   said the policeman .    but i m not .  where s the hopper .    there were several in the basement of the building they had left .  they were disassembled .  four men were impressed to help and the best looking machine was assembled in the open .  the nearest of the crowd watched curiously  and a few shouted jocularly   jump it  hopper .    it was the old cry of the hopper races .  five years ago it had been a fad that had swept the solar system  races over broken  barrier strewn courses .  while the craze lasted  venus was most enthusiastic .  probably half the houses in aphrodite had had hoppers in the basement .       lucky checked the micropile .  it was active .  he started the motor arid set the gyroscope spinning .  the hopper straightened immediately and stood stiffly upright on its single leg .   hoppers are probably the most grotesque forms of transportation ever invented .  they consist of a curved body  just large enough to hold a man at the controls .  there was a four bladed rotor above and a single metal leg  rubber tipped  below .  it looked like some giant wading bird gone to sleep with one leg folded under its body .   lucky touched the leap knob and the hopper s leg retracted .  its body sank till it was scarcely seven feet from the ground while the leg moved up into the hollow tube that pierced the hopper just behind the control panel .  the leg was released at the moment of maximum retraction with a loud click  and the hopper sprang thirty feet into the air .   the rotating blades above the hopper kept it hovering for long seconds at the top of its jump .  for those seconds  lucky could get a view of the people now immediately below him .  the crowd extended outward for half a mile  and that meant several hops .  lucky s lips tightened .  precious minutes would vanish .   the hopper was coming down now  its long leg extended .  the crowd beneath the descending hopper tried to scatter  but they didn t have to .  four jets of compressed air blew men aside just sufficiently  and the leg hurtled down harmlessly to the ground .   the foot hit concrete and retracted .  for a flash lucky could see the startled faces of the people about him  and then the hopper was moving up again .   lucky had to admit the excitement of hopper racing .  as a youngster  he d participated in several .  the expert  hop rider  could twist his curious mount in unbelievable patterns  finding leg room where none seemed to exist .  here  in the domed cities of venus  the races must have been tame compared to the bone breakers in the vast  open arenas of rocky  broken ground on earth .   in four hops lucky had cleared the crowd .  he cut      the motors  and in a series of small  dribbling jumps the hopper came to a halt .  lucky leaped out .  air travel might still be impossible  but now he could commandeer some form of groundcar .  but more time would be lost .   bigman panted and paused for a moment to get his breath .  things had happened quickly  he had been rushed along in a tide that was still whirling him onward .   twenty minutes before  he had made his suggestion to morriss .  now he was enclosed in a tube that tightened about his body and drenched him with darkness .   he inched along on his elbows again  working his way deeper .  momentarily he would stop to use the small flash whose pinpoint illumination showed him milky walls ahead  narrowing to nothing .  in one sleeve  against his wrist  he held a hastily scrawled diagram .   morriss had shaken his hand before bigman had half clambered  half jumped  into the opening at one side of a pumping station .  the rotors of the huge fan had been stilled  the air currents stopped .   morriss had muttered   i hope that doesn t set him off   and then he had shaken hands .   bigman had grinned back after a fashion  and then he crawled his way into the darkness while the others left .  no one felt it necessary to mention the obvious .  bigman was going to be on the wrong side of the transite barrier  the side from which the others were now retreating .  if  at any time  the lever at the dome lock plunged down  the incoming water would crush the duct and the walls through which it ran as though they were all so much cardboard .   bigman wondered  as he squirmed onward  whether he would hear a roar first  whether the surging water would make any hint of its presence known before striking him .  he hoped not .  he wanted not even a second of waiting .  if the water came in  he wanted its work done quickly .   he felt the wall begin to curve .  he stopped to consult      his map  ms small flash lighting the space about him with a cool gleam .  it was the second curve shown in the map they had drawn for him  and now the duct would curve upward .   bigman worked himself over to his side and bent around the curve to the damage of his temper and the bruising of his flesh .    sands of mars .   he muttered .  his thigh muscles ached as he forced his knees against either side of the duct to keep himself from slipping downward again .  inch by inch he clawed his way up the gentle slope .   morriss had copied the map off the hieroglyphic charts held up before a visiphone transmitter in the public works department of aphrodite .  he had followed the curving colored lines  asked for an interpretation of the markings and symbols .   bigman reached one of the reinforcing struts that stretched diagonally across the duct .  he almost welcomed it as something he could seize  close his hands about  use to take some of the pressure off his aching elbows and knees .  he pressed his map back up his sleeve and held the strut with his left hand .  his right hand turned his small flash end for end and placed the butt against one end of the strut .   the energy of the enclosed micropile  which ordinarily fed electricity through the small bulb of the flash and turned it into cold light  could also  at another setting of the control  set up a short range force field through its opposite end .  that force field would slice instantaneously through anything composed of mere matter that stood in its way .  bigman set that control and knew that one end of the strut now hung loose .   he switched hands .  he worked his slicer to the other end of the strut .  another touch  and it was gone .  the strut was loose in his fingers .  bigman worked it past his body  down to his feet  and let it go .  it slid and clattered down the duct .   the water still held off .  bigman  panting and squirming  was distantly aware of that .  he passed two more struts  another curve .  then the slope leveled off  and      finally he reached a set of baffles plainly marked on the map .  in all  the ground he had covered was probably less than two hundred yards  but how much time had it taken him .   and still the water held off .   the baffles  blades jutting alternately from either side of the duct to keep the air stream turbulent  were the last landmark .  he sliced off each blade with a rapid sweep of his flash butt  and now he had to measure nine feet from the farthest blade .  again he used his flash .  it was six inches long and he would have to lay it along the wall  end over end  eighteen times .   twice it slipped  and twice he had to turn back to the slightly ragged marking of the last sheared baffle blade  scrambling backward and swearing  sands of mars .   in a whisper .   the third time the eighteenth measure landed truly .  bigman kept his finger on the spot .  morriss had said the desired place would be almost directly over his head .  bigman turned on his flash  ran his finger along the curved inner surface of the duct  twisted on to his back .   using his slicer end and holding it  as nearly as he could judge in the dark  some quarter of an inch from actual contact  the force field must not slice in too far   he made a circle with it .  cleaved metal fell on him  and he pushed it to one side .   he turned his flash on the exposed wiring and studied it .  inches farther in would be the interior of a room not a hundred feet from where the man sat at the lock .  was he still sitting there .  obviously  he had not yet pulled the lever  what was he waiting for .   or bigman would now be very water logged  very dead .  had he been stopped then  somehow .  taken into custody  perhaps .   a wry grin forced itself onto bigman s face as he thought that perhaps he was squirming through the interior of a metal worm for nothing .   he was following the wiring .  somewhere here should be a relay .  gently he pulled at the wires  first one  then another .  one moved and a small  black  double cone      came into view .  bigman sighed his relief .  he gripped the flash with his teeth  freeing both hands .   gingerly  very gingerly  he twisted the two halves of the cone in opposite directions .  the magnoclasps yielded  and the two halves moved apart  exposing the contents .  they consisted of a break relay  two gleaming contacts  one encased in its field selector and separated from the other by a nearly imperceptible gap .  at an appropriate stimulus  such as the pulling of a small lever  the field selector set up the energies that would pull down the other contact  send energy streaming across the point of closure  and open a lock in the dome .  it would all happen in a millionth of a second .   bigman  sweating and half expecting the final moment to come now  now  with his task a second from completion  fumbled in his vest pocket and withdrew a lump of insulating plastic .  it was already soft from the warmth of his body .  he kneaded it a moment and then brought it down delicately upon the point where the two contacts nearly met .  he held it there while he counted three  then withdrew it .   the contacts might close now  but between them there would be a thin film of this plastic  and through it the flow of current could not pass .   the lever could be pulled now  the lock would not open .   laughing  bigman scrambled backward  made his way over the remnants of the baffle  passed the struts he had cut away  slid down the slopes .   .   .     bigman searched desperately for lucky through the confusion that now flooded all the city .  the man at the lever was in custody  the transite barrier had been lifted  and the population was flooding back  angry  for the most part  at the city administration for allowing the whole thing to happen  into the homes they had abandoned .  to the crowds who had so ghoulishly waited for disaster  the removal of fear was the signal for a high holiday .       at the end morriss appeared from nowhere and placed a hand on bigman s sleeve .   lucky s calling .    bigman  startled  said   where from .     from my room in the council offices .  i ve told him what you ve done .    bigman flushed with pleasure .  lucky would be proud .  he said   i want to talk to him .    but lucky s face on the screen was grim .  he said   congratulations  bigman  i hear you were terrific .     it was nothing   grinned bigman .   but where ve you been .    lucky said   is dr .  morriss there .  i don t see him .    morriss squeezed his face into the viewer .   here i am .     you ve captured the man at the lever  according to the news i hear .     we did .  we absolutely did  thanks to bigman   said morriss .    then let me make a guess .  when you closed in on him  he did not try to pull the lever .  he simply gave himself up .     yes   said morriss  frowning .   but what makes you guess that .     because the whole incident at the lock was a smoke screen .  the real damage was slated to happen at this end .  when i realized that  i left .  i tried to come back here .  i had to use a hopper to get through the crowd and a groundcar the rest of the way .     and .   asked morriss anxiously .    and i was too late .   said lucky .   chapter    questions  the day was over .  the crowd had dispersed .  the city had taken on a quiet  almost sleepy atmosphere  with only an occasional knot of two or three still discussing the events of the past several hours .   and bigman was annoyed .   with morriss he had left the scene of the recent danger and zoomed out to council headquarters .  there morriss had had his conference with lucky  a conference to which bigman was not allowed entry and from which the venusian had emerged looking grimly angry .  lucky remained calm but uncommunicative .   even when they were alone again  lucky said merely   let s get back to the hotel .  i need sleep  and so do you after your own little game today .    he hummed the council march under his breath  as he always did when he was completely abstracted  and signaled a passing tollcar .  the car stopped automatically when the sight of his outstretched hand with fingers spread wide registered on its photoelectric scanners .   lucky pushed bigman in before him .  he turned the dials to indicate the co ordinate position of the hotel bellevue aphrodite  put in the proper combination of coins  and let the machine s computer take over .  with ms foot he adjusted the speed lever to low .           the tollcar drifted forward with a pleasantly smooth motion .  bigman would have found it both comforting and restful if he had been in a less itchingly curious state of mind .   the little martian flicked a glance at his large friend .  lucky seemed interested only in rest and thought .  at least he leaned back on the upholstery and closed his eyes  letting the motion rock him while the hotel seemed to approach and then become a large mouth  which swallowed them as the tollcar automatically found the entrance to the receiving dock of the hotel s garage .   only when they were in their own room did bigman reach the point of explosion .  he cried   lucky  what s it all about .  i m going nuts trying to figure it out .    lucky stripped off his shirt and said   actually  it s only a matter of logic .  what kind of accidents occurred as a result of men s being mentally dominated before today .  what kind did morriss mention .  a man giving away money .  a man dropping a bale of weed .  a man placing poison in a nutrient mixture for yeast .  in each case  the action was a small one  but it was an action .  it was something done .     well .   said bigman .    all right  what did we have today .  it wasn t something small at all  it was something big .  but it wasn t action .  it was exactly the opposite of action  a man put his hand on a dome lock lever and then did nothing .  nothing .    lucky vanished into the bathroom and bigman could hear the needle shower and lucky s muffled gasps under its invigorating jets .  bigman followed at last  muttering savagely under his breath .    hey   he yelled .   lucky  his muscled body drying in churning puffs of warm air  said   don t you get it .     space  lucky  don t be mysterious  will you .  you know i hate that .     but there s nothing mysterious .  the mentalists have changed their entire style  and there must be a reason .        don t you see the reason for having a man sit at a dome lock lever and do nothing .     i said i didn t .     well  what was accomplished by it .     nothing .     nothing .  great galaxy .  nothing .  they only get half the population of aphrodite and practically every official  out to the threatened sector in double speed time .  they get me out there and you and morriss .  most of the city was left bare  including council headquarters .  and i was such a lunk that it was only when turner  the city s chief engineer  mentioned how easy it would be to get out of the city with the police force disrupted that it occurred to me what was happening .     i still don t see it .  so help me  lucky  i m going   hold it  boy   lucky seized bigman s threatening fists in one large palm .   here it is  i got back to council headquarters as fast as possible and found that lou evans had already gone .     where did they take him .     if you mean the council  they didn t take him anywhere .  he escaped .  he knocked down a guard  seized a weapon  used his council wrist mark to get a subship and escaped to sea .     was that what they were really after .     obviously .  the threat to the city was strictly a feint .  as soon as evans was safely out into the ocean  the man at the lock was released from control and  naturally  he surrendered .    bigman s mouth worked .   sands of mars .  all that stuff in the ventilating duct was for nothing .  i was fifty kinds of cobbered fool .     no  bigman  you weren t   said lucky  gravely .   you did a good job  a terrific job  and the council is going to hear about it .    the little martian flushed  and for a moment pride left no room in him for anything else .  lucky took the opportunity to get into bed .   then bigman said   bat lucky  that means i      mean  if councilman evans got away by a trick of the mentalists  then he s guilty  isn t he .     no   said lucky vehemently   he isn t .    bigman waited  but lucky had nothing more to say on the subject and instinct told bigman to let the matter die .  it was only after he had burrowed into the cool plastex sheets  having undressed and washed in his turn  that he tried again .    lucky .     yes  bigman .     what do we do next .     go after lou evans .     we do .  what about morriss .     i m in charge of the project now .  i had chief councilman conway put that across all the way from earth .    bigman nodded in the darkness .  that explained why he himself had not been able to attend the conference .  friend though he might be of lucky starr a dozen times over  he was not a member of the council of science .  and  in a situation where lucky would have to move in over a fellow councilman s head and call in the authority of earth and central headquarters to back him  non councilmen were strictly not wanted as witnesses .   but now the old lust for action was beginning to stir in him .  it would be into an ocean now  the vastest  most alien ocean on the inner planets .  he said excitedly   how early do we leave .     as soon as the ship they re outfitting is ready .  only first we see turner .     the engineer .  what for .     i have the records on the men involved in the vari  ous mentalist incidents in the city up to today  and i  want to know about the man at the lock dome  too .   turner is the man who s likely to know most about him .   but before we see turner     yes .     before that  you martian peanut  we sleep .  now shut up .        turner s dwelling place turned out to be a rather large apartment house that seemed suited for people high in the administrative scheme of things .  bigman whistled softly when they passed into the lobby  with its paneled walls and trimensional seascapes .  lucky led the way into a trundle and pressed turner s apartment number .   the trundle lifted them five floors  then took to the horizontal  skittering along on directed force beams and stopping outside the back entrance to turner s apartment .  they stepped out  and the trundle went off with a whirr  disappearing behind a turn in the corridor .   bigman watched it wonderingly .   say  i never saw one of those before .     it s a venusian invention   said lucky .   they re introducing them into new apartment houses on earth now .  you can t do anything about the old apartment houses  though  unless you redesign the building to give each apartment a special trundle served entrance .    lucky touched the indicator  which promptly turned red .  the door opened  and a woman looked out at them .  she was slight of build  young and quite pretty  with blue eyes and blond hair drawn softly backward and over her ears in the venusian fashion .    mr .  starr .     that s right  mrs .  turner   said lucky .  he hesitated a trifle over the title  she was almost too young to be a housewife .   but she smiled at them in friendly fashion .   won t  you come in .  my husband s expecting you  but h   hasn t had more than two hours  sleep and he s not  quite    they stepped in  and the door closed behind them .     lucky said   sorry to have to trouble you so early  but it s an emergency  and i doubt that we ll bother mr .  turner long .     oh  that s all right .  i understand .   she stepped fussily about the room  straightening objects that required no straightening .   bigman looked about curiously .  the apartment was      completely feminine   colorful  frilly  almost fragile .  then  embarrassed to find his hostess s eyes upon him  he said clumsily   it s a very nice place you have here  miss   uh   ma am .    she dimpled and said   thank you .  i don t think lyman is very fond of the way i have it arranged  but he never objects  and i just love little doodads and whatnots .  don t you .    lucky spared bigman the necessity of answering by saying   have you and mr .  turner been living here very long .     just since we got married .  less than a year .  it s a darling apartment house  just about the nicest in aphrodite .  it s got completely independent utilities  its own coaster garage  a central communo .  it even has chambers underneath .  imagine .  chambers .  not that anyone ever uses them .  even last night .  at least i think no one did  but i can t say  because i just slept right through all the excitement .  can you imagine .  i didn t even hear about it till lyman came home .     perhaps that was best   said lucky .   you missed a fright .     i missed excitement  you mean   she protested .   everyone in the apartment was out in the thick of it  and i slept .  slept all through it .  no one woke me .  i think that was terrible .     what was terrible .   came a new voice  and lyman turner stepped into the room .  his hair was rumpled  there were creases on his homely face and sleep in his eyes .  he had his precious computer under his arm and put it down under the chair when he sat down .    my missing the excitement   said his young wife .   how are you  lyman .     all right  considering .  and never mind missing the excitement .  i m glad you did .   .   .   .  hello  starr .  sorry to delay you .     i ve only been here a few moments   said lucky .   mrs .  turner flew to her husband and pecked quickly at his cheek .   i d better leave you men alone now .    turner patted his wife s shoulder  and his eyes fol       lowed her affectionately as she left .  he said   well  gentlemen  sorry you find me as you do  but i ve had a rough time of it in the last few hours .     i quite realize that .  what s the situation with the dome now .    turner rubbed his eyes .   we re doubling the men at each lock  and we re making the controls a little less self contained .  that rather reverses the engineering trend of the last century .  we re running power lines to various spots in the city so that we can shut the power off from a distance just in case any such thing ever happens again .  and  of course  we will strengthen the transite barriers shielding the different sections of the city .   .   .   .  does either of you smoke .     no   said lucky  and bigman shook his head .   turner said   well  would you toss me a smoke from the dispenser  the thing that looks like a fish .  that s right .  it s one of my wife s notions .  there s no holding her back when it comes to getting these ridiculous gadgets  but she enjoys it .   he flushed a little .   i haven t been married long  and i still pamper her  i m afraid .    lucky looked curiously at the odd fish  carved out of a stonelike  green material  from whose mouth a lighted cigarette had appeared when he pressed its dorsal fin .   turner seemed to relax as he smoked .  his legs crossed  and one foot moved back and forth in slow rhythm over his computer case .   lucky said   anything new on the man who started it all .  the man at the lock .     he s under observation .  a madman  obviously .     does he have a  . record of mental imbalance .     not at all .  it was one of the things i checked into .  as chief engineer  you know  the dome personnel are under me .     i know .  it s why i came here to you .     well  i wish i could help  but the man was just an ordinary employee .  he s been on our rolls for some seven months and never gave any trouble before .  in fact  he had an excellent record  quiet  unassuming  diligent .         only seven months .     that s right     is he an engineer .     he has a rating as engineer  but actually his work consisted largely of standing guard at the lock .  after all  traffic passes in and out of the city .  the lock must be opened and closed  bills of lading checked  records kept .  there s a lot more to managing the dome than just engineering .     did he have any actual engineering experience .     just an elementary college course .  this was his first job .  he s quite a young man .    lucky nodded .  he said casually   i understand there have been a whole series of queer accidents in the city lately .     have there .   turner s weary eyes stared at lucky  and he shrugged .   i rarely get a chance to look at the news etheric tapes .    the communo buzzed .  turner lifted it and held it to his ear for a moment .   it s for you  starr .    lucky nodded .   i left word i d be here .   he took the communo but did not bother to activate the screen or to raise the sound above the ear contact stage .  he said   starr at this end .    then he put it down and stood up .   we ll be going now  turner .    turner rose  too .   all right .  if i can help you in the future  call on me any time .     thank you .  give our respects to your wife  will you .    outside the building bigman said   what s up .     our ship is ready   said lucky  flagging down a groundcar .   they got in  and again bigman broke the silence .   did you find out anything from turner .     a thing or two   said lucky curtly .   bigman stirred uneasily and changed the subject .   i hope we find evans .     i hope so  too .     sands of mars  he s in a spot .  the more i think of it        the worse it seems .  guilty or not  it s rough having a request for removal on grounds of corruption sent in by a superior officer .    lucky s head turned and he looked down at bigman .   morriss never sent any report on evans to central headquarters .  i thought you understood that from yesterday s conversation with him .     he didn t .   said bigman incredulously .   then who did .     great galaxy .   said lucky .   surely it s obvious .  lou evans sent that message himself  using morriss s name .    chapter    councilman pursued .   lucky handled the trim subsea craft with grow  ing expertness as he learned the touch of the controls and began to get the feel of the sea about them .   the men who had turned the ship over to them had worriedly suggested a course of instruction as to its management  but lucky had smiled and confined himself to a few questions while bigman exclaimed with bigman ian braggadocio   there isn t anything that moves that lucky and i can t handle .   braggadocio or not  it was very nearly true .   the ship  named the hilda  drifted now with the engines cut off .  it penetrated the inky blackness of the venusian ocean with smooth ease .  they were navigating blind .  not once had the ship s powerful beams been turned on .  radar  instead  plumbed the abyss ahead more delicately and more informatively than light possibly could .   along with the radar pulses went the selected microwaves designed to attain maximum reflection from the metal alloy that formed the outer hull of a subship .  their range in the hundreds of miles  the microwaves plunged their probing ringers of energy this direction and that  seeking the particular design of metal that would send them careening back in their tracks .   so far  no reflecting message had come back  and the          hilda settled down in the ooze  half a mile of water above it  and motionless except for a slow rocking with the mighty sway of venus s globe girdling oceanic currents .   for the first hour bigman had been scarcely aware of the microwaves and the object of their search .  he had been lost in the spectacle to be seen from the portholes .   venusian subsea life is phosphorescent  and the black ocean depths were dotted with colored lights thicker than the stars in space  larger  brighter  and most of all  moving .  bigman squashed his nose against the thick glass and stared  fascinated .   some of the life forms were little round splotches  whose movement was a slow ripple .  others were darting lines .  still others were sea ribbons of the type lucky and bigman had seen in the green room .   lucky joined him after a while .  he said   if i remem  ber my xenozoology     your what .     that s the study of extraterrestrial animals  bigman .  i ve just been looking through a book on venusian life .  i left it on your bunk in case you want to look at it .     never mind .  i ll take it second hand from you .     all right .  we can start with those little objects .  i think that represents a school of buttons .     buttons .   said bigman .  then   sure  i see what you mean .    there were a whole series of yellow ovals of light moving across the black field visible through the porthole .  each had black markings on it in the form of two short parallel lines .  they moved in brief spurts  settled down for a few moments  then moved again .  the dozens in view all moved and rested simultaneously  so that bigman had the queerly swimming sensation that the buttons weren t moving at all  but that every half minute or so the ship itself lurched .   lucky said   they re laying eggs  i think .   he was silent for a long moment  then said   most of these things i can t make out .  wait .  that must be a scarlet      patch there .  see it .  the dark red thing with the irregular outline .  it feeds on buttons .  watch it .    there was a scurrying among the yellow blotches of light as they became aware of the swooping predator  but a dozen buttons were blotted out by the angry red of the scarlet patch .  then the patch was the only source of light in the porthole s field of vision .  on all sides of it  buttons had scattered away .    the patch is shaped like a large pancake turned down at the edge   said lucky   according to the book .  it s hardly anything but skin with a small brain in the center .  it s only an inch thick .  you can tear it through and through in a dozen places without bothering it .  see how irregular the one we re watching is .  arrowfish probably chewed it up a bit .    the scarlet patch moved now  drifting out of sight .  there v as little left where it had been except for one or two faint  dying glimmers of yellow .  little by little  buttons began moving back again .   lucky said   the scarlet patch just settles down to the bottom  holding on to the ooze with its edges and digesting and absorbing whatever it covers .  there s another species called the orange patch which is a lot more aggressive .  it can shoot a jet of water with enough force to stagger a man  even though it s only a foot wide and not much more than paper thin .  the big ones are a lot worse .     how big do they get .   asked bigman .    i haven t the slightest idea .  the book says there are occasional reports of tremendous monsters   arrowfish a mile long  and patches that can cover aphrodite city .  no authentic cases  though .     a mile long .  i ll bet there aren t any authentic cases .    lucky s eyebrows lifted .   it s not as impossible as all that .  these things here are only shallow water specimens .  the venusian ocean is up to ten miles deep in spots .  there s room in it for a lot of things .    bigman looked at him doubtfully .   listen  you re try        ing to sell me a bale of space dust .   he turned abruptly and moved away .   i think i ll look at the book after all .    the hilda moved on and took a new position  while the microwaves shot out  searching and searching .  then again it moved .  and again .  slowly lucky was screening the underwater plateau on which the city of aphrodite stood .   he waited grimly at the instruments .  somewhere down here his friend lou evans must be .  evans s ship could navigate neither air nor space  nor any ocean depth of more than two miles  so he must be confined to the relatively shallow waters of the aphrodite plateau .   the first answering flash caught his eye even as he repeated the must to himself for the second time .  the microwave feedback froze the direction finder in place  and the return pip was brightening the entire receiving field .   bigman s hand was on lucky s shoulder instantly .   that s it .  that s it .     maybe   said lucky .   and maybe it s some other ship  or maybe it s only a wreck .     get its position  lucky .  sands of mars  get its position .     i m doing it  boy  and we re moving .    bigman could feel the acceleration  hear the churning of the propeller .   lucky leaned closely over the radio transmitter and its unscrambler  and his voice was urgent .   lou .  lou evans .  lucky starr at this end .  acknowledge signals .  lou .  lou evans .    over and over again  the words pushed out along the ether .  the returning microwave pip grew brighter as the distance between the two ships grew less .   no answer .   bigman said   that ship we re pipping isn t moving  lucky .  maybe it is a wreck .  if it were the councilman  he d either answer or try to get away from us  wouldn t he .     sh .   said lucky .  his words were quiet and urgent as      he spoke into the transmitter   lou .  there s no point in  trying to hide .  i know the truth .  i know why you sent  the message to earth in morriss s name asking for your  own recall .  and i know who you think the enemy is .   lou evans .  acknowledge    the receiver crackled  static ridden .  sounds came through the unscrambler and turned into intelligible words   stay away .  if you know that  stay away .    lucky grinned his relief .  bigman whooped .    you ve got him   shouted the little martian .    we re coming in to get you   said lucky into the transmitter .   hold on .  we ll lick it  you and i .    words came back slowly   you don t   understand        i m trying to   then  almost in a shriek   for  earth s sake  lucky  stay away .  don t get any closer .    no more came through .  the hilda bored toward the position of evans s ship relentlessly .  lucky leaned back  frowning .  he murmured   if he s that afraid  why doesn t he run .    bigman didn t hear .  he was saying jubilantly   terrific  lucky .  that was terrific the way you bluffed him into talking .     i wasn t bluffing  bigman   said lucky  grimly .   i know the key fact involved in this whole mess .  so would you  if you stopped to think about it .    bigman said shakily   what are you getting at .     do you remember when dr .  morriss and you and i entered the small room to wait for lou evans to be brought to us .  do you remember the first thing that happened .     no .     you started laughing .  you said i looked queer and deformed without a mustache .  and i felt exactly the same way about you .  i said so .  remember .     oh  sure .  i remember .     did it occur to you to wonder why that was .  we d been watching men with mustaches for hours .  why was it that the thought suddenly occurred to both of us at that particular time .     i don t know .          suppose the thought had occurred to someone else who had telepathic powers .  suppose the sensation of surprise flooded from his mind to ours .     you mean the mentalist  or one of them  was in the room with us .     wouldn t that explain it .     but it s impossible .  dr .  morriss was the only other  man lucky .  you don t mean dr .  morriss .     morriss had been staring at us for hours .  why should he be suddenly amazed at our not having mustaches .     well  then  was someone hiding .     not hiding   said lucky .   there was one other living creature in the room  and it was in plain view .     no   cried bigman .   oh  no .   he burst into laughter .   sands of mars  you can t mean the v frog .     why not .   said lucky calmly .   we re probably the first men without mustaches it ever saw .  it was surprised .     but it s impossible .     is it .  they re all over the city .  people collect them  feed them  love them .  now do they really love v frogs .  or do the v frogs inspire love by mental control so as to get themselves fed and taken care of .     space  lucky .   said bigman .   there s nothing surprising about people liking them .  they re cute .  people don t have to be hypnotized into thinking that .     did you like them spontaneously  bigman .  nothing made you .     i m sure nothing made me like them .  i just liked them .     you just liked them .  two minutes after you saw your first v frog  you fed it .  remember that .     nothing wrong with that  is there .     ah  but what did you feed it .     what it liked .  peas dipped in axle g   the little  fellow s voice faded out .    exactly .  that grease swelled like axle grease .  there was no mistaking what it was .  how did you come to dip the pea in it .  do you always feed axle grease to pet ani       mals .  did you ever know any animal that ate axle grease .     sands of mars .   said bigman weakly .    isn t it obvious that the v frog wanted some  and that since you were handy it maneuvered you into delivering some   that you weren t quite your own master .    bigman muttered   i never guessed .  but it s so clear when you explain it .  i feel terrible .     why .     it s a hateful thing  having an animal s thoughts rolling around inside your head .  it seems unsanitary .   his puckish little face screwed up in an expression of revulsion .   lucky said   unfortunately  it s worse then unsanitary .    he turned back to the instruments .   the interval between pip and return disclosed the distance between the two ships to be less than half a mile when  with surprising suddenness  the radar screen showed  unmistakably  the shadow of evans s ship .   lucky s voice went out over the transmitter .   evans  you re in sight now .  can you move .  is your ship disabled .    the answer came back clearly in a voice torn with emotion .   earth help me  lucky  i did my best to warn you .  you re trapped .  trapped as i m trapped .    and as though to punctuate the councilman s wail  a blast of force struck the subship hilda  knocking it to one side and jarring its main motors out of commission .   chapter    out of the deep  in bigman s memory afterward  the events of the next hours were as though viewed through the reverse end of a telescope  a faraway nightmare of confused events .   bigman had been slammed against the wall by the sudden thrust of force .  for what seemed long moments  but was probably little more than a second in actuality  he lay spread eagled and gasping .   lucky  still at the controls  shouted   the main generators are out .    bigman was struggling to ms feet against the crazy slope of the deck .   what happened .     we were hit .  obviously .  but i don t know how badly .    bigman said   the lights are on .     i know .  the emergency generators have cut in .     how about the main drive .     i m not sure .  it s what i m trying to test .    the engines coughed hoarsely somewhere below and behind .  the smooth purr was gone  and in its place a consumptive rattle sounded that set bigman s teeth on edge .   the hilda shook herself  like a hurt animal  and turned upright .  the engines died again .   the radio receiver was echoing mournfully  and now          bigman gathered his senses sufficiently to try to reach it .    starr   it said .   lucky starr .  evans at this end .  acknowledge signals .    lucky got there first .   lucky speaking .  what hit us .     it doesn t matter   came the tired voice .   it won t bother you any more .  it will be satisfied to let you sit here and die .  why didn t you stay away .  i asked you to .     is your ship disabled  evans .     it s been stalled for twelve hours .  no light  no power   just a little juice i can pump into the radio  and that s fading .  air purifiers are smashed  and the air supply is low .  so long  lucky .     can you get out .     the lock mechanism isn t working .  i ve got a subsea suit  but if i try to cut my way out  i ll be smashed .    bigman knew what lou evans meant  and he shuddered .  locks on subsea vessels were designed to let water into the interlock chamber slowly  very slowly .  to cut a lock open at the bottom of the sea in an attempt to get out of a ship would mean the entry of water under hundreds of tons of pressure .  a human being  even inside a steel suit  would be crushed like an empty tin can under a pile driver .   lucky said   we can still navigate .  i m coming to get you .  we ll join locks .     thanks  but why .  if you move  you ll be hit again  and even if you aren t  what s the difference whether i die quickly here or a little more slowly in your ship .    lucky retorted angrily   we ll die if we have to  but not one second earlier than we have to .  everyone has to die someday  there s no escaping that  but quitting isn t compulsory .    he turned to bigman .   get down into the engine room and check the damage .  i want to know if it can be repaired .    in the engine room  fumbling with the  hot  micro pile by means of long distance manipulators  which luckily were still in order  bigman could feel the ship       inching painfully along the sea bottom and could hear the husky rasping of the motors .  once he heard a distant boom  followed by a groaning rattle through the framework of the hilda as though a large projectile had hit sea bottom a hundred yards away .   he felt the ship stop  the motor noise drop to a hoarse rumble .  in imagination  he could see the hilda s lock extension bore out and close in on the other hull  welding itself tightly to it .  he could sense the water between the ships being pumped out of that tube between them and  in actual fact  he saw the lights in the engine room dim as the energy drain on the emergency generators rose to dangerous heights .  lou evans would be able to step from his ship to the hilda through dry air with no need of artificial protection .   bigman came up to the control room and found lou evans with lucky .  his face was drawn and worn under its blond stubble .  he managed a shaky smile in bigman s direction .   lucky was saying   go on  lou .    evans said   it was the wildest hunch at first  lucky .  i followed up each of the men to whom one of these queer accidents had happened .  the one thing i could find in common was that each was a v frog fancier .  everyone on venus is  more or less  but each one of these fellows kept a houseful of the creatures .  i didn t quite have the nerve to make a fool of myself advancing the theory without some facts .  if i only had .   .   .   .  anyway  i decided to try to trap the v frogs into exhibiting knowledge of something that existed in my own mind and in as few others as possible .    lucky said   and you decided on the yeast data .     it was the obvious thing .  i had to have something that wasn t general knowledge or how could i be even reasonably sure they got the information from me .  yeast data was ideal .  when i couldn t get any legitimately  i stole some .  i borrowed one of the v frogs at headquarters  put it next to my table  and looked over the papers .  i even read some of it aloud .  when an accident happened in a yeast plant within two days later      involving the exact matter i had read about  i was positive the v frogs were behind the mess .  only          only .   prompted lucky .    only i hadn t been so smart   said evans .   i d let them into my mind .  i d laid down the red carpet and invited them in  and now i couldn t get them out again .  guards came looking for the papers .  i was known to have been in the buildings  so a very polite agent was sent to question me .  i returned the papers readily and tried to explain .  i couldn t .     you couldn t .  what do you mean by that .     i couldn t .  i was physically unable to .  the proper words wouldn t come out .  i was unable to say a word about the v frogs .  i even kept getting impulses to kill myself  but i fought them down .  they couldn t get me to do something that far from my nature .  i thought then  if i can only get off venus  if i can only get far enough away from the v frogs  i d break their hold .  so i did the one thing i thought would get me instantly recalled .  i sent an accusation of corruption against myself and put morriss s name to it .     yes   said lucky grimly   that much i had guessed .     how .   evans looked startled .    morriss told us his side of your story shortly after we got to aphrodite .  he ended by saying that he was preparing his report to central headquarters .  he didn t say he had sent one   only that he was preparing one .  but a message had been sent  i knew that .  who else besides morriss knew the council code and the circumstances of the case .  only you yourself .    evans nodded and said bitterly   and instead of calling me home  they sent you .  is that it .     i insisted  lou .  i couldn t believe any charge of corruption against you .    evans buried his head in his hands .   it was the worst thing you could have done   lucky .  when you sub ethered you were coming  i begged you to stay away  didn t i .  i couldn t tell you why .  i was physically incapable of that .  but the v frogs must have realized from my thoughts what a terrific character you were .  they       could read my opinion of your abilities and they set about having you killed .     and nearly succeeded   murmured lucky .    and will succeed this time .  for that i am heartily sorry  lucky  but i couldn t help myself .  when they paralyzed the man at the dome lock  i was unable to keep myself from following the impulse to escape  to get out to sea .  and  of course  you followed .  i was the bait and you were the victim .  again  i tried to keep you away  but i couldn t explain  i couldn t explain .   .   .   .    he drew a deep  shuddering breath .   i can speak about it now  though .  they ve lifted the block in my mind .  i suppose we re not worth the mental energy they have to expend  because we re trapped  because we re as good as dead and they fear us no longer .    bigman  having listened this far in increasing confusion  said   sands of mars  what s going on .  why are we as good as dead .    evans  face still hidden in his hands  did not answer .   lucky  frowning and thoughtful  said   we re under an orange patch  a king size orange patch out of the venusian deeps .     a patch big enough to cover the ship .     a patch two miles in diameter .   said lucky .   two miles across .  what slapped the ship into almost a smashup and what nearly hit us a second time when we were making our way over to evans s ship was a jet of water .  just that .  a jet of water with the force of a depth blast .     but how could we get under it without seeing it .    lucky said   evans guesses that it s under v frog mental control  and i think he s right .  it could dim its fluorescence by contracting the photo cells in its skin .  it could raise one edge of its cape to let us in  and now  here we sit .     and if we move or try to blast our way out  the patch will let us have it again  and a patch never misses .    lucky thought  then said suddenly   but a patch does miss .  it missed us when we were driving the hilda      toward your ship and then we were only going at quarter speed .   he turned to bigman  his eyes narrowed .   big man  can the main generators be patched .    bigman had almost forgotten the engines .  he recov  ered and said   oh the micropile alignment hasn t  been knocked off  so it can be fixed if i can find all the equipment i need .     how long will it take .    hours  probably .     then get to work .  i m getting out into the sea .   evans looked up  startled   what do you mean .    i m going after that patch .   he was at the sea suit locker already  checking to make certain the tiny force field linings were in order and well powered and that the oxygen cylinders were full .   it was deceptively restful to be out in the absolute dark .  danger seemed far away .  yet lucky knew well enough that below him was the ocean bottom and that on every other side  up and all around  was a two mile wide inverted bowl of rubbery flesh .   his suit s pump jetted water downward  and he rose slowly with his weapon drawn and ready .  he could not help but marvel at the subwater blaster he held .  inventive as man was on his home planet of earth  it seemed that the necessity for adapting to the cruel environment of an alien planet multiplied his ingenuity a hundredfold .   once the new continent of america had burst forth into a brilliance that the ancestral european homelands could never duplicate  and now venus was showing her ability to earth .  there were the city domes  for instance .  nowhere on earth could force fields have been woven into steel so cleverly .  the very suit he wore could not resist the tons of water pressure for a moment without the microfields that webbed its interior braces  always provided those tons were introduced sufficiently slowly  .  in many other respects that suit was a marvel of engineering .  its jet device for underwater traveling  its efficient oxygen supply  its compact controls  were all admirable .        and the weapon he held .   but immediately his thoughts moved to the monster above .  that was a venusian invention  too .  an invention of the planet s evolution .  could such things be on earth .  not on land  certainly .  living tissue cduldn t support the weight of more than forty tons against earth s gravity .  the giant brontosauri of earth s meso zoic age had legs like treetrunks  yet had to remain in the marshes so that water could help buoy them up .   that was the answer  water s buoyancy .  in the oceans any size of creature might exist .  there were the whales of earth  larger than any dinosaur that ever lived .  but this monstrous patch above them must weigh two hundred million tons  he calculated .  two million large whales put together would scarcely weigh that .  lucky wondered how old it was .  how old would a thing have to be to grow as large as two million whales .  a hundred years .  a thousand years .  who could tell .   but size could be its undoing  too .  even under the ocean .  the larger it grew  the slower its reactions .  nerve impulses took time to travel .   evans thought the monster refrained from hitting them with another water jet because  having disabled them  it was indifferent to their further fate  or rather the v frogs who manipulated the giant patch were .  that might not be so .  it might be rather that the monster needed time to suck its tremendous water sac full .  it needed time to aim .   furthermore  the monster could scarcely be at its best .  it was adapted to the deeps  to layers of water six miles or more high above it .  here its efficiency must necessarily be cut down .  it had missed the hilda on its second try  probably because it had not fully recovered from the previous stroke .   but now it was waiting  its water sac was slowly filling  and as much as it could in the shallow water surrounding it  it was gathering its strength .  he  lucky      pounds of man against two hundred million tons of monster  would have to stop it .   lucky looked upward .  he could see nothing .  he      pressed a contact on the inner lining in the left middle finger of the sheathed force field reinforced mitten that gauntleted his hand  and a jab of pure white light poured out of the metal fingertip .  it penetrated upward hazily and ended in nothingness .  was that the monster s flesh at the far end .  or just the petering out of the light beam .   three times the monster had jetted water .  once and evans s ship had been smashed .  a second time and lucky s ship had been mauled .   but not as badly  was the creature getting weaker .   a third time  prematurely  and the stroke had been a miss .   he raised his weapon .  it was bulky  with a thick handgrip .  within that grip was a hundred miles of wire and a tiny generator that could put out huge voltages .  he pointed it upward and squeezed his fist .   for a moment  nothing   but he knew the hair thin wire was squirting out and upward through the carbonated ocean water .   .   .   .   then it hit and lucky saw the results .  for in the moment that the wire made contact  a flash current of electricity screamed along it at the speed of light and flayed the obstruction with the force of a bolt of lightning .  the hairlike wire gleamed brilliantly and vaporized steaming water into murky froth .  it was more than steam  for the alien water writhed and bubbled horribly as the dissolved carbon dioxide gassed out .  lucky felt himself bobbing in the wild currents set up .   above all that  above the steaming and bubbling  above the water s churning and the line of thin fire that reached upward  there was a fireball that exploded .  where the wire had touched living flesh there was a blaze of furious energy .  it burned a hole ten feet wide and as many feet deep into the living mountain above him .   lucky smiled grimly .  that was only a pin prick in comparison to the monster s vast bulk  but the patch would feel it  or at least in ten minutes or so  it would feel it .  the nerve impulses must first travel their slow way along the curve of its flesh .  when the pain reached       the creature s tiny brain  it would be distracted from the helpless ship on the ocean floor and turn upon its new tormentor .   but  lucky thought grimly  the monster would not  find him .  in ten minutes  he would have changed  position .  in ten minutes  he  lucky never completed the thought .  not one minute after his bolt had struck the creature  it struck back .   not one minute had passed when lucky s shocked and tortured senses told him that he was being driven down  down  down  in a turbulent jet of madly driving water .  .  .  .   chapter     the mountain of flesh  the shock sent lucky s senses reeling .  any suit of ordinary metal would have bent and smashed .  any man of ordinary mettle would have been carried senseless down to the ocean floor  there to be smashed into concussion and death .   but lucky fought desperately .  struggling against the mighty current  he brought his left arm up to his chest to check the dials that indicated the state of the suit machinery .   he groaned .  the indicators were all lifeless things  their delicate workings jarred into uselessness .  still  his oxygen supply seemed unaffected  his lungs would have told him of any drop in pressure   and his suit obviously wasn t leaking .  he could only hope that its jet action was still in order  there was no use trying blindly to find his way out of the stream by main force .  he almost certainly lacked the power .  he would have to wait and gamble on one important thing  the stream of water lost velocity rapidly as it penetrated downward .  water against water was a high friction action .  at the rim of the jet  turbulence would grow and eat inward .  a cutting stream five hundred feet across as it emerged from the creature s blowpipe might be only fifty feet wide when it hit      bottom  depending upon its original velocity and the distance to the ocean floor .   and that original velocity would have slowed  too .  that did not mean that the final velocity was anything to deride .  lucky had felt its force against the ship .   it all depended on how far from the center of the water gush he was  on how near a bulls eye the creature scored .   the longer he waited  the better his chances   provided he did not wait too long .  with his metal gloved hand on the jet controls  lucky let himself be flung downward  trying to wait calmly  striving to guess how close to solid bottom he was  expecting each moment the one last concussion he would never feel .   and then  when he had counted ten  he flung his suit s jets open .  the small  high speed propellers on either shoulder blade ground in harsh vibration as they threw out water at right angles to the main current .  lucky could feel his body take on a new direction of fall .   if he was dead center  it wouldn t help .  the energy he could pump up would not suffice to overcome the mighty surge downward .  if he was well off center  however  his velocity would  by now  have slowed considerably and the growing zone of turbulence might not be far off .   and as he thought that  he felt his body bob and yank with nauseating violence  and he knew he was safe .   he kept  his own jets in operation  turning their force downward now and  as he did so  he turned his finger light in the direction of the ocean floor .  he was just in time to see the ooze  some fifty feet below  explode and obscure everything with its muck .   he had made his way out of the stream with but seconds to spare .   he was hurrying upward now  as fast as the jet motors of his suit would carry him .  he was in desperate haste .  in the darkness within his helmet  darkness within darkness within darkness  his lips were pressed into a narrow line and his eyebrows pulled down low .   he was doing his best not to think .  he had thought      enough in those few seconds in the water spout .  he had underestimated the enemy .  he had assumed it was the gigantic patch that was aiming at him  and it wasn t .  it was the v frogs on the water s surface that controlled the patch s body through its mind .  the v frogs had aimed .  they did not have to follow the patch s sensations in order to know it had been hit .  they needed only to read lucky s mind  and they needed only to aim at the source of lucky s thoughts .   so it was no longer a matter of pin pricking the monster into moving away from the hilda and lumbering down the long underwater declivity to the deeps that had spawned it .  the monster had to be killed outright .   and quickly .   if the hilda would not take another direct blow  neither would lucky s own suit .  the indicators were gone already  the controls might go next .  or the liquid oxygen containers might suffer damage to their tiny force field generators .   up and still up went lucky  up to the only place of safety .  although he had never seen the monster s blowpipe  it stood to reason that it must be an extensible and flexible tube that could point this way and that .  but the monster could scarcely point it at its own undersurface .  for one thing  it would do itself damage .  for another  the force of the water it expelled would prevent that blowpipe from bending at so great an angle .   lucky had to move up then  close to the animal s undersurface  to where its weapon of water could not reach  and he had to do it before the monster could fill its water sac for another blow .   lucky flashed his light upward .  he was reluctant to do so  feeling instinctively that the light would make him an easy target .  his mind told him his instinct was wrong .  the sense that was responsible for the monster s rapid response to his attack was not sight .   fifty feet or less above  the light ended on a rough  grayish surface  streaked with deep corrugations .  lucky scarcely attempted to brake his rush .  the monster s skin was rubbery and his own suit hard .  even as he thought      that  he collided  pressing upward and feeling the alien flesh give .   for a long moment  lucky drew deep gasps of relief .  for the first time since leaving the ship  he felt moderately safe .  the relaxation did not last  however .  at any time the creature could turn its attack  or the small mind master that controlled it could  on the ship .  that must not be allowed to happen .   lucky played his finger flash about his surroundings with a mixture of wonder and nausea .   here and there in the undersurface of the monster were holes some six feet across into which  as lucky could see by the flow of bubbles and solid particles  water was rushing .  at greater intervals were slits  which opened occasionally into ten foot long fissures that emitted frothing gushes of water .   apparently this was the way the monster fed .  it poured digestive juices into the portion of the ocean trapped beneath its bulk  then sucked in water by the cubic yard to extract the nutriment it contained  and still later expelled water  debris  and its own wastes .   obviously  it could not stay too long over any one  spot of the ocean or the accumulation of its own waste  products would make its environment unhealthy .  of its  own account it would not have lingered here so long  but  with the v frogs driving it  lucky moved jerkily through no action of his own and  in surprise  turned the beam of light on a spot closer to himself .  in a moment of stricken horror  he realized the purposes of those deep corrugations he had noticed in the monster s undersurface .  one such was forming directly to one side of him and was sucking inward  into the creature s substance .  the two sides of the corrugation rubbed against one another  and the whole was obviously a grinding mechanism whereby the monster broke up and shredded particles of food too large to be handled directly by its intake pores .   lucky did not wait .  he could not risk his battered suit against the fantastic strength of the monster s      muscles .  the walls of his suit might hold  but portions of the delicate working mechanisms might not .   he swung his shoulder so as to turn the suit s jets directly against the flesh of the monster and gave them full energy .  he came loose with a sharp smacking sound  then veered round and back .   he did not touch the skin again  but hovered near it and traveled along it  following the direction against gravity  mounting upward  away from the outer edges of the thing  toward its center .   he came suddenly to a point where the creature s undersurface turned down again in a wall of flesh that extended as far as his light would reach on either side .  that wall quivered and was obviously composed of thinner tissue .   it was the blowpipe .   lucky was sure that was what it was   a gigantic cavern a hundred yards across  out of which the fury of rushing water emerged .  cautiously lucky circled it .  undoubtedly this was the safest place one could be  here at the very base of the blowpipe  and yet he picked his way gingerly .   he knew what  he was looking for  however  and he left the blowpipe .  he moved away in the direction in which the monster s flesh mounted still higher  until he was at the peak of the inverted bowl  and there it was .   at first  lucky was aware only of a long drawn out rumble  almost too deep to hear .  in fact  it was vibration that attracted his attention  rather than any sound .  then he spied the swelling in the monster s flesh .  it writhed and beat  a huge mass  hanging thirty feet downward and perhaps as big around as the blowpipe .   that must be the center of the organism  its heart  or whatever passed for its heart  must be there .  that heart must beat in powerful strokes  and lucky felt dizzy as he tried to picture it .  those heartbeats must last five minutes at a time  during which thousands of cubic yards of blood  or whatever the creature used  must be forced through blood vessels large enough to hold the      hilda .  that heartbeat must suffice to drive the blood a mile and back .   what a mechanism it must be  thought lucky .  if one could only capture such a thing alive and study its physiology .   somewhere in that swelling must also be what brain the monster might have .  brain .  perhaps what passed for its brain was only a small clot of nerve cells without which the monster could live quite well .   perhaps .  but it couldn t live without its heart .  the heart had completed one beat .  the central swelling had contracted to almost nothing .  now the heart was relaxing for another beat five minutes or more from now  and the swelling was expanding and dilating as blood rushed into it .   lucky raised his weapon and with his light beam full on that giant heart  he let himself sink down .  it might be best not to be too close .  on the other hand  he dared not miss .   for a moment a twinge of regret swept him .  from a scientific standpoint it was almost a crime to kill this mightiest of nature s creatures .   was that one of his own thoughts or a thought imposed upon him by the v frogs on the ocean surface .   he dared wait no longer .  he squeezed the handgrip of his weapon .  the wire shot out .  it made contact  and lucky s eyes were blinded by the flash of light in which the near wall of the monster s heart was burnt through .   for minutes the water boiled with the death throes of the mountain of flesh .  its entire mass convulsed in its gigantic writhings .  lucky  thrown this way and that  was helpless .   he tried to call the hilda  but the answer consisted of erratic gasps  and it was quite obvious that the ship  too  was being flung madly about .   but death  when it comes  must finally penetrate the last ounce of even a hundred million ton life .  eventually a stillness came upon the water .       and lucky moved downward slowly  slowly  weary nearly to death .   he called the hilda again .   it s dead   he said .   send out the directional pulse and let me follow it down .    lucky let bigman remove his sea suit and managed a smile as the little martian looked worriedly up at him .    i never thought i d see you again  lucky   said bigman  gulping noisily .    if you re going to cry   said lucky   turn your head away .  i didn t get in out of the ocean just to get all wet in here .  how are the main generators coming along .     they ll be all right   put in evans   but it will still take time .  the knocking around just at the end there ruined one of the welding jobs .     well   said lucky   we ll just have to get on with it .   he sat down with a weary sigh .   things didn t go quite as i expected .     in what way .   demanded evans .    it was my notion   said lucky   to pin prick the monster into moving off us .  that didn t work  and i had to kill him .  the result is that its dead body has settled down around the hilda like a collapsed tent .    chapter     to the surface .    you mean we re trapped .   said bigman  with horror .    you can put it that way   said lucky coolly .   you can also say that we re safe  if you want to .  certainly we re safer here than anywhere on venus .  nobody can do anything to us physically with that mountain of dead meat over us .  and when the generators are repaired  we ll just force our way out .  bigman  get at those generators  and evans  let s pour ourselves some coffee and talk this thing over .  there might not be another chance for a quiet chat .    lucky welcomed this respite  this moment when there was nothing to be done but talk and think .   evans  however  was upset .  his china blue eyes crinkled at the corners .   lucky said   you look worried .     i am worried .  what in space and time do we do .    lucky said   i ve been thinking about that .  it seems to me that all we can do is get the v frog story to someone who s safe from any mental control by them .     and who s that .     no one on venus .  that s for sure .    evans stared at his friend .   are you trying to tell me that everyone on venus is under control .             no  but anyone might be .  after all  there are different ways in which the human mind can be manipulated by these creatures .   lucky rested one arm over the back of the pilot swivel and crossed his legs .   in the first place  complete control can be taken for a short period of time over a man s mind .  complete control .  during that interval a human being can be made to do things contrary to his own nature  things that endanger his own life and others   the pilots on the coaster  for instance  when bigman and i first landed on venus .    evans said grimly   that type of thing hasn t been my trouble .     i know .  that s what morriss failed to realize .  he was sure you weren t under control simply because you showed no signs of amnesia .  but there s a second type of control that you suffered from .  it s less intense  so a person retains his memory .  however  just because it s less intense  a person cannot be forced to do anything against his own nature  you couldn t be forced to commit suicide  for instance .  still  the power lasts longer   days rather than hours .  the v frogs make up in time what they lose in intensity .  well  there must be still a third kind of control .     and that is .     a control that is still less intense than the second type .  a control that is so mild the victim isn t even aware of it  yet strong enough so that the victim s mind can be rifled and picked of its information .  for instance  there s lyman turner .     the chief engineer on aphrodite .    .   that s right .  he s a case in point .  can you see that .  consider that there was a man at the dome lock yesterday who sat there with a lever in his hand  endangering the whole city  yet he was so tightly protected all around  so netted about with alarms that no one could approach him without warning until bigman forced a passage through a ventilator shaft .  isn t that odd .     no .  why is it odd .     the man had only been on the job a matter of months he wasn t even a real engineer .  his work was      more like that of a clerk or an office boy .  where did he get the information to protect himself so .  how could he possibly know the force and power system in that section of the dome so thoroughly .    evans pursed his lips and whistled soundlessly .   hey  that is a point .     the point didn t strike turner .  i interviewed him on just that matter before getting on the hilda .  i didn t tell him what i was after  of course .  he himself told me about the fellow s inexperience  but the incongruity of the matter never struck him .  yet who would have the necessary information .  who but the chief engineer .  who better than he .     right .  right .     well  then  suppose turner was under very gentle  control .  the information could be lifted out of his  brain .  he could be very gently soothed into not seeing  anything out of the way in the situation .  do you see  what i mean .  and then morriss     morriss  too .   said evans  shocked .    possibly  he s convinced it s a matter of sirians after yeast .  he can see it as nothing else .  is that a legitimate misjudgment or is he being subtly persuaded .  he was ready to suspect you  lou   a little too ready  one councilman ought to be a little less prepared to suspect another .     space .  then who s safe  lucky .    lucky stared at his empty coffee cup and said   no one on venus .  that s my point .  we ve got to get the story and the truth somewhere else .     and how can we .     a good point .  how can we .   lucky starr brooded over that .   evans said   we can t leave physically .  the hilda is designed for nothing but ocean .  it can t navigate the air  let alone space .  and if we go back to the city to get something inore suitable  we d never leave it again .     i think you re right   said lucky   but we don t have to leave venus in the flesh .  our information is all that has to leave .         if you mean ship s radio   said evans   that s out  too .  the set we ve got on this tub is strictly intra venus .  it s not a subetheric  so it can t reach earth .  down here  as a matter of fact  the instrument won t reach above the ocean .  its carrier waves are designed to be reflected down from the ocean surface so that they can get distance .  besides that  even if we could transmit straight up  we couldn t reach earth .     i don t see that we have to   said lucky .   there s something between here and earth that would do just as well .    for a moment  evans was mystified .  then he said   you mean the space stations .     surely .  two space stations circle venus .  earth may be anywhere from thirty to fifty million miles away  but the stations may be as close as two thousand miles to this point .  yet there can t be v frogs on the stations  i m sure .  morriss said they dislike free oxygen  and one could scarcely rig up special carbon dioxide chambers for v frogs considering the economy with which space stations must be run .  now  if we could get a message out to the stations for relay to central headquarters on earth  we d have it .     that s it  lucky   said evans  excitedly .   it s our way out .  their mental powers can t possibly reach two  thousand miles across space to   but then his face  turned glum once more .   no  it won t do .  the subship radio still can t reach past the ocean surface .     maybe not from here .  but suppose we go up to the surface and transmit from there directly into the atmosphere .     up to the surface .     well .     but they are there .  the v frogs .     i know that .     we ll be put under control .     will we .   said lucky .   so far they ve never tackled anyone who s known about them  known what to expect and made up his mind to resist it .  most of the victims were completely unsuspecting .  in your case you      actually invited them into your mind  to use your own phrase .  now i am not unsuspecting  and i don t propose to issue any invitations .     you can t do it  i tell you .  you don t know what it s like .     can you suggest an alternative .    before evans could answer  bigman entered  rolling down his sleeves .   all set   he said .   i guarantee the generators .    lucky nodded and stepped to the controls  while evans remained in his seat  his eyes clouded with uncertainty .   there was the churning of the motors again  rich and sweet .  the muted sound was like a song  and there was that strange feeling of suspension and motion under one s feet that was never felt on a spaceship .   the hilda moved through the bubble of water that had been trapped under the collapsing body of the giant patch and built up speed .   bigman said uneasily   how much room do we have .     about half a mile   said lucky .    what if we don t make it .   muttered bigman .   what if we just hit it and stick  like an ax in a tree stump .     then we pull out and try again   said lucky .   there was silence for a moment  and evans said in a low voice   being closed in under here  under the patch    it s like being in a chamber .   he was mumbling  half to himself .    in a what .   said lucky .    in a chamber   said evans  still abstracted .   they build them on venus .  they re little transite domes under sea floor level  like cyclone cellars or bomb shelters on earth .  they re supposed to be protection against incoming water in case of a broken dome  say by venus quake .  i don t know that a chamber has ever been used  but the better apartment houses always advertise that they have chamber facilities in case of emergency .         lucky listened to him  but said nothing .   the engine pitch rose higher .    hold on .   said lucky .   every inch of the hilda trembled  and the sudden  almost irresistible deceleration forced lucky hard against the instrument panel .  bigman s and evans s knuckles went white and their wrists strained as they gripped the guard rails with all their strength .   the ship slowed but did not stop .  with the motors straining and the generators protesting in a squeal that made lucky wince in sympathy  the hilda plowed through skin and flesh and sinew  through empty bloodvessels and useless nerves that must have resembled two foot thick cables .  lucky  jaw set and grim  kept the drive rod nailed at maximum against the tearing resistance .   the long minutes passed and then  in a long churn of triumphant engine  they were through   through the monster and out once more into the open sea .   silently and smoothly the hilda rose through the murky  carbon dioxide saturated water of venus s ocean .  silence held the three  a silence that seemed enforced by the daring with which they were storming the very fortress of venus s hostile life form .  evans had not said a word since the patch had been left behind .  lucky had locked ship s controls and now sat on the pilot swivel with fingers softly tapping his knee .  even the irrepressible bigman had drifted glumly to the rear port with its bellying  wide angle field of vision .   suddenly bigman called   lucky  look there .    lucky strode to bigman s side .  together they gazed in silence .  over half the field of the port there was only the starry light of small phosphorescent creatures  thick and soft  but in another direction there was a wall  a monstrous wall glowing in smears of shifting color .    do you suppose that s the patch  lucky .   asked bigman .   it wasn t shining that way when we came down here  and anyway  it wouldn t shine after it was dead  would it .         lucky said thoughtfully   it is the patch in a way  bigman .  i think the whole ocean is gathering for the feast .    bigman looked again and felt a little ill .  of course .  there were hundreds of millions of tons of meat there for the taking  and the light they viewed must be the light of all the small creatures of the shallows feeding on the dead monster .   creatures darted past the port  moving always in the same direction .  they moved sternward  toward the mountainous carcass the hilda had left behind .   pre eminent among them were arrow fish of all sizes .  each had a straight white line of phosphorescence that marked its backbone  it wasn t a backbone really  but merely an unjointed rod of horny substance  .  at one end of that white line was a pale yellow v that marked the head .  to bigman it looked indeed as though a countless swarm of animated arrows were swarming past the ship  but in imagination he could see their needle rimmed jaws  cavernous and ravenous .    great galaxy .   said lucky .    sands of mars .   murmured bigman .   the ocean will be empty .  every blasted thing in the ocean is gathering to this one spot .    lucky said   at the rate those arrow fish must be gorging themselves  the thing will be gone in twelve hours .    evans s voice sounded from behind them .   lucky  i want to speak to you .    lucky turned .   sure .  what is it  lou .     when you first suggested going to the surface  you asked if i could propose an alternative .     i know .  you didn t answer .     i can answer now .  i m holding it  in fact  and the answer is that we re going back to the city .    bigman called   hey  what s the idea .    lucky had no need to ask that question .  his nostrils flared  and inwardly he raged at himself for those minutes he had spent at the porthole when all his heart        mind  and soul should have been concentrated on the business at hand .   for in evans s clenched fist  as it lifted from his side  was lucky s own blaster  and in evans s narrowed eyes  there was hard determination .    we re going back to the city   repeated evans .   chapter     to the city .   lucky said   what s wrong  lou .    evans gestured impatiently with his blaster .   put the engines in reverse  start bottomward  and turn the ship s bow toward the city .  not you  lucky .  you let bigman go to those controls  then you get in line with him  so i can watch both of you and the controls  too .    bigman had his hands half upraised  and his eyes turned to look at lucky .  lucky kept his hands at his side .   lucky said flatly   suppose you tell me what s biting you .     nothing s biting me   said evans .   nothing at all .  it s what s biting you .  you went out and killed the monster  then came back and started talking about going to the surface .  why .     i explained my reasons .     i don t believe your reasons .  if we surface  i know the v frogs will take over our minds .  i ve had experience with them  and because of that i know the v frogs have taken over your mind .     what .   exploded bigman .   are you nuts .     i know what i m doing   said evans  watching lucky warily .   if you look at this thing coolly  bigman  you ll see that lucky must be under v frog influence .  don t forget  he s my friend  too .  i ve known him longer            than you have  bigman  and it bothers me to have to do this  but there s no way out .  it must be done .    bigman stared uncertainly at both men  then said in a low voice   lucky  have the v frogs really got you .     no   said lucky .    what do you expect him to say .   demanded evans with heat .   of course they have him .  to kill the monster  he had to jet upward to its top .  he must have gone fairly close to the surface where the v frogs were waiting  close enough for them to snatch him .  they let him kill the monster .  why not .  they would be glad to trade control of the monster for control of lucky  so lucky came back babbling of the need to go to the surface  where we ll all be among them  all trapped   the only men who know the truth helpless .     lucky .   quavered bigman  his tone pleading for reassurance .   lucky starr said calmly   you re quite wrong  lou .  what you re doing now is only the result of your own captivity .  you ve been under control before  and the v frogs know your mind .  they can enter it at will .  maybe they ve never entirely left it .  you re doing only what you re being made to do .    evans s grip on his blaster hardened .   sorry  lucky  but it won t do .  let s get the ship back to the city .    lucky said   if you re not under control  lou   if you re mind free   then you ll blast me down if i try to force us up to the surface  won t you .    evans did not answer .   lucky said   you ll have to .  it will be your duty to the council and to mankind to do so .  on the other hand  if you are under mental control  you may be forced to threaten me  to try to make me change ship s course  but i doubt that you can be forced to kill rne .  actually murdering a friend and fellow councilman would be too much against your basic ways of thought .     so give me your blaster .    lucky advanced toward the other  hand outstretched .   bigman stared in horror .         evans backed away .  he said hoarsely   i m warning you  lucky .  i ll shoot .     i say you won t shoot .  you ll give me the blaster .    evans was back against the wall .  his voice rose craz ily .   i ll shoot .  i ll shoot .    bigman cried   lucky  stop .    but lucky had already stopped and was backing away .  slowly  very slowly  he backed .   the life had suddenly gone out of evans s eyes  and he was standing now  a carved stone image  finger firm on trigger .  evans s voice was cold .   back to the city .    lucky said   get the ship on the city course  bigman .    bigman stepped quickly to the controls .  he muttered   he s really under now  isn t he .    lucky said   i was afraid it might happen .  they ve shifted him to intense control to make sure he shoots .  and he will  too  no question about it .  he s in amnesia now .  he won t remember this part afterward .     can he hear us .   bigman remembered the pilots on the coaster in which they had landed on venus and their apparent complete disregard of the external world about them .    i don t think so   said lucky   but he s watching the controls and if we deviate from city direction  he ll shoot .  make no mistake about that .     then what do we do .    words again issued from between evans s pale  cold lips   back to the city .  quickly .    lucky  motionless  eyes fixed on the unwavering muzzle of his friend s blaster  spoke softly and quickly to bigman .   bigman acknowledged the words by the slightest of nods .   the hilda moved back along the path it had come  back toward the city .   lou evans  councilman  stood against the wall  white faced and stern  his pitiless eyes shifting from lucky to bigman to the controls .  his body  frozen into utter       obedience to those who controlled his mind  did not even feel the need of shifting the blaster from one hand to the other .   lucky strained his ears to hear the low sound of aphrodite s carrier beam as it sounded steadily on the hilda s direction finder .  the beam radiated in all directions on a definite wave length from the topmost point of aphrodite s dome .  the route back to the city became as obvious as though aphrodite were in plain sight and a hundred feet away .   lucky could tell by the exact pitch of the beam s low whine that they were not approaching the city directly .  it was a small difference indeed  and one that was not at all obvious to the ear .  to evans s controlled ears  it might pass unnoticed .  fervently  lucky hoped so .   lucky tried to follow evans s blank glare when his eyes rested on the controls .  he was certain that it was the depth indicator that those eyes rested upon .  it was a large dial  a simple one that measured the water pressure .  at the distance evans stood it was simple enough to tell that the hilda was not nosing surfaceward .   lucky felt certain that  should the depth indicator needle vary in the wrong direction  evans would blast without a moment s hesitation .   try as he might to think as little as possible about the situation  to allow as few specific thoughts as possible to be picked up by the waiting v frogs  he could not help but wonder why evans did not shoot them out of hand .  they had been marked for death under the giant patch  but now they were only being herded back to aphrodite .   or would evans shoot them down just as soon as the v frogs could overcome some last scruple in the captive s subjected mind .   the carrier beam moved a little further off pitch .  again lucky s eyes flickered quickly in evans s direction .  was he imagining it  or did a spark of something  not emotion  exactly  but something  show in evans s eyes .   a split second later it was obviously more than       imagination  for there was a definite tightening of evans s biceps  a small lifting of his arm .   he was going to shoot .   and even as the thought passed quickly through lucky s mind and his muscles tensed involuntarily and uselessly for the coming of the blast  the ship crashed .  evans  caught unaware  toppled backward .  the blaster slithered from his sprawling fingers .   lucky acted instantly .  the same shock that threw evans back threw him forward .  he rode that shock and came down upon the other  clutching for his wrist and seizing it with steely fingers .   but evans was anything but a pigmy  and he fought with the unearthly rage that was imposed upon him .  he doubled his knees above him  caught lucky in the thighs  and heaved .  the still rocking ship fortuitously added its roll to the force of evans s thrust and the captive councilman was on top .   evans s fist pounded  but lucky s shoulder fended the blow .  he raised his own knees and caught evans in an iron scissors hold just below the hips .   evans s face distorted with pain .  he twisted  but lucky writhed with him and was on top once more .  he sat up  his legs maintaining their hold  increasing it .   lucky said   i don t know if you can hear or under  stand me  lou    evans paid no regard .  with one last contortion of his body  he flung himself and lucky into the air  breaking lucky s hold .   lucky rolled as he hit the floor and came lithely to his feet .  he caught evans s arm as the latter rose and swung it over his shoulder .  a heave and evans came crashing down on his back .  he lay still .    bigman .   said lucky  breathing quickly and brushing back his hair with a quick motion of his hand .    here i am   said the little fellow  grinning and swinging turner s blaster lightly .   i was all set  just in case .     all right .  put that blaster away  bigman  and look       lou over .  make sure there are no bones broken .  then tie him up .    lucky was at the controls now  and with infinite caution he backed the hilda off the remnants of the carcass of the giant patch he had killed hours before .   lucky s gamble had worked .  he had hoped that the v frogs with their preoccupation with mentalities would have no real conception of the physical size of the patch  that with their lack of experience of subsea travel  they would not realize the significance of the slight off course route bigman had taken .  the whole gamble had been in the quick phrase which lucky had spoken to bigman as the latter had turned the ship back to the city under the threat of evans s blaster .    afoul of the patch   he had said .   again the hilda s course changed .  its nose lifted upward .   evans  bound to his bunk  stared with weary shame facedness at lucky .   sorry .     we understand  lou .  don t brood about it   said lucky lightly .   but we can t let you go for a while .  you see that  don t you .     sure .  space  put more knots  n me .  i deserve it .  believe me  lucky  most of it i don t even remember .     look  you better get some sleep  fella   and lucky s fist punched evans lightly hi the shoulder .   we ll wake you when we hit surface  if we have to .    to bigman  a few minutes later  he said quietly   round up every blaster on the ship  bigman  every weapon of every sort .  look through stores  the bunk lockers  everywhere .     what are you going to do .     dump them   said lucky succinctly .    what .     you heard me .  you might go under .  or i might .  if we do  i don t want anything with which we can expect a repetition of what has just happened .  against the v frogs  physical weapons are useless  anyway .    one by one  two blasters  plus the electric whips from       each sea suit  passed through the trash ejector .  the ejector s hinged opening stood flush with the wall just next to the first aid cupboard  and through it the weapons were puffed through one way valves into the sea .   it makes me feel naked   muttered bigman  staring out through the port as though to catch sight of the vanished weapons .  a dim phosphorescent streak flashed across  marking the passing of an arrow fish .  that was all .   the water pressure needle dropped slowly .  they had been twenty eight hundred feet under to begin with .  they were less than two thousand now .   bigman continued peering intently out the port .  lucky glanced at him .   what are you looking for .    i thought   said bigman   it would get lighter as we got up toward the top .     i doubt it   said lucky .   the seaweed blankets the surface tightly .  it will stay black till we break through .    think we might meet up with a trawler  lucky .    i hope not .    they were fifteen hundred feet under now .  bigman said with an effort at lightness  a visible attempt to change the current of his own thoughts   say  lucky  how come there s so much carbon dioxide in the air on venus .  i mean  with all these plants .  plants are supposed to turn carbon dioxide into oxygen  aren t they .     on earth they are .  however  if i remember my course in xenobotany  venusian plant life has a trick all its own .  earth plants liberate their oxygen into the air  venusian plants store theirs as high oxygen compounds in their tissues .   he talked absently as though he himself was also using speech as a guard against too deep thinking .   that s why no venusian animal breathes .  they get all the oxygen they need in their food .     what do you know .   said bigman in astonishment .    in fact  their food probably has too much oxygen  for them  or they wouldn t be so fond of low oxygen       food  like the axle grease you fed the v frog .  at least  that s my theory .    they were only eight hundred feet from the surface now .   lucky said   good navigation  by the way .  i mean the way you rammed the patch  bigman .     it s nothing   said bigman  but he flushed with pleasure at the approval in lucky s words .   he looked at the pressure dial .  it was five hundred feet to the surface .   silence fell .   and then there came a grating and scraping sound from overhead  a sudden interruption in their smooth climb  a laboring of their engines  and then a quick lightening of the view outside the porthole  together with an eye blinking vision of cloudy sky and rolling water surface oozing up between shreds and fibers of weed .  the water was pockmarked with tiny splashings .    it s raining   said lucky .   and now  i m afraid  we ll have to sit tight and wait till the v frogs come for us .    bigman said blankly   well   well  here they  are .    for moving into view just outside the porthole  staring solemnly into the ship out of dark  liquid eyes  its long legs folded tightly down and its dexterous toes clasping a seaweed stem in a firm grip  was a v frog .   chapter     minds meet  the hilda rode high in the tossing waters of the venusian ocean .  the splatter of strong  steady rain drummed its sound upon the outer hull in what was almost an earthlike rhythm .  to bigman  with his martian background  rain and ocean were alien  but to lucky it brought memories of home .   bigman said   look at the v frog  lucky .  look at it .     i see it   said lucky calmly .   bigman swept the glass with his sleeve and then found himself with his nose pressing against it for a better look .   suddenly he thought  hey  i better not get too close .   he sprang back  then deliberately put the little finger of each hand into the corners of his mouth and drew them apart .  sticking his tongue out  he crossed his eyes and wiggled his fingers .   the v frog stared at him solemnly .  it had not budged a muscle since it had first been sighted .  it merely swayed solemnly with the wind .  it did not seem to mind  or even to be aware of  the water that splashed about it and upon it .   bigman contorted his face even more horribly and went  a a gh  at the creature .             lucky s voice sounded over his shoulder .   what are you doing  bigman .    bigman jumped  took his hands away  and let his face spring back into its own pixy ish appearance .  he said  grinning   i was just showing that v frog what i thought of it .     and it was just showing you what it thought of you .    bigman s heart skipped a beat .  he heard the clear disapproval in lucky s voice .  in such a crisis  at a time of such danger  he  bigman  was making faces like a fool .  shame came over him .   he quavered   i don t know what got into me  lucky .     they did   said lucky  harshly .   understand that .  the v frogs are feeling you out for weak points .  however they can do it  they ll crawl into your mind  and once there they may remain past your ability to force them to leave .  so don t follow any impulse until you ve thought it out .     yes  lucky   muttered bigman .    now  what next .   lucky looked about the ship .  evans was sleeping  tossing fitfully and breathing with difficulty .  lucky s eyes rested on him for a bare moment  then turned away .   bigman said almost timidly   lucky .     well .     aren t you going to call the space station .    for a moment lucky stared at his little partner without comprehension .  then slowly the lines between his eyes smoothed away and he whispered   great galaxy .  i d forgotten .  bigman  i d forgotten .  i never once thought of it .    bigman cocked a thumb over his shoulder  pointing at the port into which the v frog was still owlishly gazing .   you mean  it       .     i mean they .  space  there may be thousands of them out there .    half in shame bigman admitted to himself the nature of his own feelings  he was almost glad that lucty had been trapped by the creatures as well as he .  it relieved       him of some of the blame that might otherwise attach  to him .  in fact  lucky had no right  bigman stopped his thoughts  appalled .  he was working himself into a resentment against lucky .  that wasn t he .  that was they .   savagely he orced all thought from his mind and concentrated on luqky  whose fingers were now on the transmitter  working them into the careful adjustment required to reach finely out into space .   and then bigman s head snapped back at a sudden new and strange sound .   it was a voice  flat  without intonation .  it said   do .  not tamper with your machine of far reaching sound .  we do not wish it .    bigman turned .  his mouth fell open and  for a moment  stayed so .  he said   who said that .  where is it .    lucky said   easy  bigman .  it was inside your head .     not the v frog .   said bigman despairingly .    great galaxy  what else can it be .    and bigman turned to stare out the port again  at the clouds  the rain  and the swaying v frog .   once before in his life lucky had felt the minds of alien creatures impressing  their thoughts upon him .  that had been on the day he had met the immaterial energy beings that dwelt within the hollow depths of mars .  there his mind had been laid open  but the entry of thought had been painless  even pleasant .  he had known his own helplessness  yet he had also been deprived of all fear .   now he faced something different .  the mental fingers inside his skull had forced their way in and he felt them with pain  loathing  and resentment .   lucky s hand had alien away from the transmitter  and he felt no urge to return to it .  he had forgotten it again .   the voice sounded a second time .   make air vibrations with your mouth .         lucky said   you mean  speak .  can you hear our thoughts when we do not speak .     only very dimly and vaguely .  it is very difficult unless we have studied your mind well .  when you speak  your thoughts are sharper and we can hear .     we hear you without trouble   said lucky .    yes .  we can send our thoughts powerfully and with strength .  you cannot .     have you heard all i ve said so far .     yes .     what do you wish of me .     in your thoughts we have detected an organization of your fellow beings far off  beyond the end  on the other side of the sky .  you call it the council .  we wish to know more about it .    inwardly lucky felt a small spark of satisfaction .  one question  at least  was answered .  as long as he represented only himself  as an individual  the enemy was content to kill him .  but in recent hours the enemy had discovered he had penetrated too much of the truth  and they were concerned about it .   would other members of the council learn as easily .  what was the nature of this council .   lucky could understand the curiosity of the enemy  the new caution  the sudden desire to learn a little more from lucky before killing him .  no wonder the enemy had forborne forcing evans to kill him even when the blaster was pointed and lucky was helpless  forborne just an instant too long .   but lucky buried further thought on the subject .  they might  as they said  be unable to clearly hear unspoken thoughts .  then again  they might be lying .   he said abruptly   what do you have against my people .    the flat  emotionless voice said   we cannot say what is not so .    lucky s jaw hardened at that .  had they picked up his last thought concerning their lying .  he would have to be careful  very careful .   the voice continued .   we do not think well of your       people .  they end life .  they eat meat .  it is bad to be intelligent and to eat meat .  one who eats meat must end life to live  and an intelligent meat eater does more harm than a mindless one since he can think of more ways to end life .  you have little tubes that can end the lives of many at one time .     but we do not kill v frogs .     you would if we let you .  you even kill each other in large groups and small .    lucky avoided comment on the last remark .  he said  instead   what is it you want of my people  then .     you grow numerous on venus   said the voice .   you spread and take up room .     we can take only so much   reasoned lucky .   we can build cities only in the shallow waters .  the deeps will always remain yours  and they form nine parts of the ocean s ten .  besides that  we can help you .  if you have the knowledge of mind  we have the knowledge of matter .  you have seen our cities and the machines of shining metal that go through air and water to worlds on the other side of the sky .  with this power of ours  think how we can help you .     there is nothing we need .  we live and we think .  we are not afraid and we do lot hate .  what nore can we need .  what should we do with your cities and your metal and your ships .  how can it make life better for us .     well  then  do you intend to kill us all .     we do not desire to end life .  it is enough for us if we hold your minds so that we will know you will do no harm .    lucky had a quick vision  his own .  implanted .   of a race of men on venus living and moving under the direction of the dominant natives  gradually being cut off from all connection with earth  the generations growing more and more into complacent mental slaves .   he said  in words whose confidence he did not entirely fel   men cannot allow themselves to be controlled mentally .     it is the only way  and you must help us .          we will not .     you have no choice .  you must tell us of these lands beyond the sky  of the organization of your people  of what they will do against us  and how we may guard ourselves .     there is no way you can make me do that    is there not .   asked the voice .   consider  then .  if you will not speak the information we require  we will then ask vou to descend back into the ocean in your machine of shining metal  and there at the bottom you will open your machine to the waters .     and die .   said lucky grimly .    the end of your lives would be necessary .  with your knowledge it would not be safe to allow you to mingle with your fellows .  you might speak to them and cause them to attempt reprisals .  that would not be good .     then i have nothing to lose by not telling you .     you have much to lose .  should you refuse what we ask  we would have to delve into your mind by force .  that is not efficient .  we might miss much of value .  to diminish that danger  we would have to take your mind apart bit by bit  and that would be unpleasant for you .  it would be much better for us and for you if you were to help us freely .     no .   lucky shook his head .   a pause .  the voice began again   although your people are given to ending life  they fear having their own lives end .  we will spare you that fear if you help us .  when you descend into the ocean to your life s end  we will remove fear from your mind .  if  however  you do not choose to help us  we will force you into life s end anyhow  but we will not remove fear .  we will intensify it .     no   said lucky  more loudly .   another pause  a longer one .  then the voice said   we do not ask your knowledge out of fear for our own safety  but to make it unnecessary for ourselves to take measures of an unpleasant nature .  if we are left with but uncertain knowledge as to how to guard ourselves against your people from the other side of the sky  then        we will be forced to put an end to the threat by ending life for all your people on this world .  we will let the ocean into their cities as we have already almost done to one of them .  life will end for your people like the quenching of a flame .  it will be snuffed out  and life will burn no more .    lucky laughed wildly .   make me .   he said .    make you .     make me speak .  make me dive the ship .  make me do anything .     you think we cannot .     i know you cannot .     look about you  then  and see what we have already accomplished .  your fellow creature who is bound is in our hands .  your fellow creature who stood at your side is in our hands .    lucky whirled .  in all this time  through all this conversation  he had not heard bigman s voice once .  it was as though he had completely forgotten bigman s existence .  and now he saw the little martian lying twisted and crumpled at his feet .   lucky dropped to his knees  a vast and fearful dismay parching his throat .   you ve killed him .     no  he lives .  he is not even badly hurt .  but  you see  you are alone now .  you have none to help you now .  they could not withstand us  and neither can you .    white faced  lucky said   no .  you will not make me do anything .     one last chance .  make your choice .  do you choose to help us  so that life may end peacefully and quietly for you .  or will you refuse to help us  so that it must end in pain and sorrow  to be followed  perhaps  by life s end for all your people in the cities below the ocean .  which is it to be .  come  your answer .    the words echoed and re echoed within lucky s mind as he prepared to stand  alone and unfriended  against the buffets of a mental power he did not know how to fight save by an unbending stubbornness of will .   chapter     minds battle  how does one set up a barrier against mental attack .  lucky had the desire to resist  but there were no muscles he could flex  no guard he could throw up  no way he could return violence .  he must merely remain as he was  resisting all those impulses that flooded his mind which he could not surely tell to be his own .   and how could he tell which were his own .  what did he himself wish to do .  what did he himself wish most to do .   nothing entered his mind .  it was blank .  surely there had to be something .  he had not come up here without a plan .   up here .   then he had come up .  originally  he had been down .   far down in the recesses of his mind  he thought  that s it .   he was in a ship .  it had come up from the sea bottom .  it was on the surface of the water now .  good .  what next .   why at the surface .  dimly he could remember it was safer underneath .   he bent his head with great difficulty  closed his eyes and opened them again .  his thoughts were very thick .            he had to get word somewhere  .   .   .  somewhere  .   .   .  about something .   he had to get word .   get word .   and he broke through .  it was as though somewhere miles inside of himself he had put a straining shoulder to a door and it had burst open .  there was a clear flash of purpose  and he remembered something he had forgotten .   ship s radio and the space station  of course .   he said  huskily   you haven t got me .  do you hear that .  i remember  and i ll keep on remembering .    there was no answer .   he shouted aloud  incoherently .  his mind was faintly occupied with the analogy of a man fighting an overdose of a sleeping drug .  keep the muscles active  he thought .  keep walking .  keep walking .   in his case  he had to keep his mind active  he had to keep the mental fibers working .  do something .  do something .  stop  and they ll get you .   he continued shouting  and sound became words   i ll do it .  i ll do it .   do what .  he could feel it slipping from him again .   feverishly  he repeated to himself   radio to station  .  .  .   .  radio to station  .   .   .   but the sounds were becoming meaningless .   he was moving now .  his body turned clumsily as though his joints were wood and nailed in place  but it was turning .  he faced the radio .  he saw it clearly for a moment  then it wavered and became foggy .  he bent his mind to the task  and it was clear again .  he could see the transmitter  see the range setting toggle and the frequency condensers .  he could recall and understand its workings .   he took a dragging step toward it and a sensation as of red hot spikes boring into his temples overwhelmed him .   he staggered and fell to his knees  then  in agony  rose again .        through pain hazed eyes  he could still make out the radio .  first one of his legs moved  then another .   the radio seemed a hundred yards away  hazy  surrounded by a bloody mist .  the pounding in lucky s head increased with each step .   he fought to ignore the pain  to see only the radio  to think only of the radio .  he forced his legs to move against a rubbery resistance that was entangling them and dragging him down .   finally  he put out his arm  and when his fingers were still six inches away from the ultrawave  lucky knew that his endurance was at an end .  try as he might  he could drive his exhausted body no closer .  it was all over .  it was ended .   the hilda was a scene of paralysis .  evans lay unconscious on his cot  bigman was crumpled on the floor  and though lucky remained stubbornly upright  his trembling fingertips were the only sign of life in him .   the cold voice in lucky s mind sounded once again in its even  inexorable monotone   you are helpless  but you will not lose consciousness as did your companions .  you will suffer this pain until you decide to submerge your ship  tell us what we wish to know  and end your life .  we can wait patiently .  there is no way you can resist us .  there is no way you can fight us .  no bribe .  no threat .    lucky  through the endless torture  felt a striving within his sluggish  pain soaked mind  the stirring of something new .   no bribe .  no threat .   no bribe .   even through the misty semiconsciousness  the spark in his mind caught fire .   he abandoned the radio  turned his thoughts away  and instantly the curtain of pain lifted a fraction .  lucky took a faltering step away from the radio  and it lifted a bit more .  he turned away completely .   lucky tried not to think .  he tried to act automatically and without foreplanning .  they were concentrating on       preventing his reaching the radio .  they must not realize the other danger they faced .  the pitiless enemy must not deduce his intentions and try to stop him .  he would have to act quickly .  they must not stop him .   they must not .   he had reached the first aid wall chest and flung open its door .  he could not see clearly  and he lost precious seconds in fumbling .   the voice said   what is your decision .   and the fierceness of pain began to clamp down upon the young councilman once more .   lucky had it   a squat jar of bluish silicone .  his fingers groped through what seemed deadening cotton for the little catch that would shut off the paramagnetic microfield that held the jar s lid closed and airtight .   he scarcely felt the little nudge as one fingernail caught the catch .  he scarcely saw the lid move to one side and fall off .  he scarcely heard it hit the floor with the sound of metastic against metal .  fuzzily  he could see that the jar was open  and hazily  he lifted bis arm toward the trash ejector .   the pain had returned in all its fury .   his left arm had lifted the hinged opening of the ejector  his right arm tremblingly raised the precious jar to the six inch opening .   his arm moved for an eternity .  he could no longer see .  a red haze covered everything .   he felt his arm and the jar it held strike the wall .  he pushed  but it would move no farther .  the fingers on his left hand inched down from where they held the opening of the trash ejector  and touched the jar .   he daren t drop it now .  if he did  he would never in his life find the strength to pick it up again .   he had it in both hands  and together both hands pulled at it .  it inched upward  while lucky hovered closer and closer to the edge of unconsciousness .   a nd then the jar was gone .   a million miles away  it seemed  he could hear the whistle of compressed air  and he knew the jar had been ejected into the warm venusian ocean .        for a moment the pain wavered and then  in one giant stroke  lifted completely .   lucky righted himself carefully and stepped away from the wall .  his face and body were drenched in perspiration  and his mind still reeled .   as fast as his still faltering steps could take him  he moved to the radio transmitter  and this time nothing stopped him .   evans sat in a chair with his head buried in his arms .  he had gulped thirstily at water and kept saying over and over again   i don t remember a thing .  i don t remember a thing .    bigman  bare to the waist  was mopping at his head and chest with a damp cloth  and a shaky grin carne to his face .   i do .  i remember everything .  one minute i was standing there listening to you talking to the voice  lucky  and then with no warning i was flat on the floor .  i couldn t feel a thing  i couldn t turn my head  i couldn t even blink my eyes  but i could hear everything that was going on .  i could hear the voice and what you said  lucky .  i saw you start for the radio  .   .   .    he puffed his breath out and shook his head .    i never made it that first time  you know   said lucky quietly .    i couldn t tell .  you passed out of my field of vision  and after that all i could do was lie there and wait to hear you start sending .  nothing happened  and i kept thinking they must have you  too .  in my mind  i could see all three of us lying in living death .  it was all over  and i couldn t nudge a thumbnail .  it was all i could do just to breathe .  then you moved back past my eyes again  and i wanted to laugh and cry and yell all at tht same time  but all i could do was lie there .  i could just about make you out  lucky  clawing at the wall .  i couldn t tell what on venus you were doing  but a few minutes later it was all over .  wow .    evans said wearily   and we re really heading back for aphrodite now  lucky .  no mistake .     we re heading back unless the instruments are lying         and i don t think they are   said lucky .   when we do get back and we can spare the time  we ll all of us get a little medical attention .     sleep .   insisted bigman .   that s all i want .  just two days of solid sleep .     you ll get that  too   said lucky .   but evans  more than the other two  was haunted by the experience .  it showed quite plainly in the way he huddled in his own arms and slouched  almost cowered  in his chair .  he said   aren t they interfering with us in any way at all any more .   there was the lightest emphasis on the word they .    i can t guarantee that   said lucky   but the worst of the affair is over in a way .  i reached the space station .     you re sure .  there s no mistake .     none at all .  they even relayed me to earth and i spoke to conway directly .  that part is settled .     then it s all settled   crowed bigman joyously .   earth is prepared .  it knows the truth about the v frogs .    lucky smiled  but offered no comment .   bigman said   just one thing  lucky .  tell me what happened .  how did you break their hold .  sands of mars .  what did you do .    lucky said   nothing that i ought not to have thought of long hi advance and saved us all a great deal of needless trouble .  the voice told us that all they needed in life was to live and to think .  you recall that  bigman .  it said later on that we had no way of threatening them and no way of bribing them .  it was only at the last moment that i realized you and i knew better .     i know better .   said bigman blankly .    certainly you do .  you found out two minutes after you saw your first v frog  that life and thought is not all they need .  i told you on the way to the surface that venusian plants stored oxygen so that venusian animals got their oxygen from their food and didn t have to breathe .  in fact  i said  they probably get too much oxy        gen and that s why they re so fond of low oxygen food like hydrocarbons .  like axle grease  for instance .  don t you remember .    bigman s eyes were widening .   sure .     just think how they must crave hydrocarbon .  it must be like the craving of a child for candy .    bigman said once again   sure .     now the v frogs had us under mental control  but to maintain us under such control  they had to concentrate .  what i had to do was distract them  at least to distract those that were nearest the ship  and whose power over us was strongest .  so i threw out the obvious thing .     but what .  don t play cute  lucky .     i threw out an open jar of petroleum jelly  which i got out of the medicine cabinet .  it s pure hydrocarbon  of much higher grade than the axle grease .  they couldn t resist .  even with so much at stake  they couldn t resist .  those nearest to the jar dived for it .  others farther away were in mental rapport  and their minds turned instantly to hydrocarbon .  they lost control of us  and i was able to put through the call .  that was all .     well  then   said evans   we re through with them .     if it comes to that   said lucky   i m not at all cer  tain .  there are a few things    he turned away  frowning  his lips clamped shut  as though he had already spoken too much .   the dome glimmered gorgeously outside the port  and bigman felt his heart lift at the sight .  he had eaten  even napped a bit  and his ebullient spirits bubbled as ever now .  lou evans had recovered considerably from his own despondency .  only lucky had not lost his look of wariness .   bigman said   i tell you the v frogs are demoralized  lucky .  look here  we ve come back through a hundred miles of ocean  nearly  and they haven t touched us once .  well  have they .    lucky said   right now  i m wondering why we don t get an answer from the dome .          evans frowned in his turn .   they shouldn t take this long .    bigman looked from one to the other .   you don t think anything can be wrong inside the city  do you .    lucky waved his hand for silence .  a voice came in over the receiver  low and rapid .    identification  please .    lucky said   this is the council chartered subship hilda  out of aphrodite  returning to aphrodite .  david starr in charge and speaking .     you will have to wait .     for what reason  please .     the locks are all in operation in the moment .    evans frowned and muttered   that s impossible  lucky .    lucky said   when will one be free .  give me its location  and direct me to its vicinity by ultrasignal .     you will have to wait .    the connection remained open  but the man at the other end spoke no more .   bigman said indignantly   get councilman morriss  lucky .  that ll get some action .    evans said hesitantly   morriss thinks i m a traitor .  do you suppose he could have decided that you ve thrown in with me  lucky .     if so   said lucky   he d be anxious to get us into the city .  no  it s my thought that the man we ve been speaking to is under mental control .    evans said   to stop us from getting in .  are you serious .     i m serious .     there s no way they can stop us from getting hi in  the long run unless they   evans paled and moved  to the porthole in two rapid strides .   lucky  you re right .  they re bringing a cannon blaster to bear .  they re going to blow us out of the water .    bigman was at the porthole  too .  there was no mistake about it .  a section of the dome had moved to one side  and through it  somewhat unreal as seen through water  was a squat tube .        bigman watched the muzzle lower and center upon  them  with fascinated horror .  the hilda was unarmed .  it could never gain velocity fast enough to escape being blasted .  there seemed no way out of instant death .   chapter     the enemy .   but even as bigman felt his stomach constrict at the prospect of imminent destruction  he could hear lucky s even voice speaking forcefully into the transmitter    subship hilda arriving with cargo of petroleum  .   .  .   subship hilda arriving with cargo of petroleum  .   .   .   subship hilda arriving with cargo of petroleum  .   .   .   subship hilda    an agitated voice broke through from the other end .    clement heber at lock control at this end .  what is  wrong .  repeat .  what is wrong .  clement heber    bigman yelled   they re withdrawing the blaster  lucky .    lucky let out his breath in a puff  but only in that way did he show any sign of tension .  he said into the transmitter   subship hilda reporting for entrance to aphrodite .  please assign lock .  repeat .  please assign lock .     you may have lock number fifteen .  follow directional signal .  there seems to be some confusion here .    lucky rose and said to evans   lou  take the controls and get the ship into the city as fast as you can .   he motioned bigman to follow him to the other room .    what   what   bigman spluttered like a leaky  popgun .   lucky sighed and said   i thought the v frogs would            try to arrange to have us kept out  so i was all set with the petroleum trick .  but i didn t think things would get so bad they would point a cannon at us .  that made it really tough .  i wasn t as sure as all that that the petroleum notion would work .     but how did it .     hydrocarbon again .  petroleum is hydrocarbon .  my word came over the open radio and the v frogs who had the dome guards under control were distracted .     how come they knew what petroleum was .     i pictured it in my mind  bigman  with every bit of imagination i had .  they can read minds when you sharpen the mental pictures by speaking  you know .    but never mind all that .   his voice dropped to a whisper .   if they re ready to blow us out of the ocean  if they re ready for something as crudely violent as that  they re desperate  and we re desperate  too .  we ve got to bring this to an end right away  and we ve got to do the right thing .  one mistake at this stage could be fatal .     from his shirt pocket lucky had undipped a scriber  and he was writing rapidly on a piece of foil .   he held it out to bigman .   that s what you re to do when i give the word .    bigman s eyes widened   but lucky     sh .  don t refer to any of this in words .    bigman nodded   but are you sure you re right .     i hope so .   lucky s handsome face was drawn with anxiety .   earth knows about the v frogs now  so they ll never win over humanity  but they may still do damage here on venus .  we ve got to prevent that somehow .  now do you understand what you re to do .     yes .     in that case  .   .   .   lucky rolled the foil together and kneaded it with his strong fingers .  the pellet that remained he returned to his shirt pocket .   lou evans called out   we re in the lock  lucky .  in five minutes we ll be in the city .    lucky said   good .  get morriss on the radio .         they were in council headquarters in aphrodite again  the same room  bigman thought  in which he had first met lou evans  the same room in which he had first seen a v frog .  he shuddered at the thought of those mental tendrils infiltrating his mind for the first time without his knowledge .   that was the one way in which the room was different now .  the aquarium was gone  the dishes of peas and of axle grease were gone  the tall tables stood bare at the false window .   morriss had pointed that out mutely as soon as they entered .  his plump cheeks sagged and the lines of strain about his eyes were marked .  his pudgy handshake was uncertain .   carefully bigman put what he was carrying on top of one of the tables .   petroleum jelly   he said .   lou evans sat down .  so did lucky .   morriss did not .  he said   i got rid of the v frogs in this building .  that was all i could do .  i can t ask people to do away with their pets without a reason .  and i couldn t give the reason  obviously .     it will be enough   said lucky .   throughout this discussion  though  i want you to keep your eyes on the hydrocarbon .  keep its existence firmly in your mind .     you think that will help .   asked morriss .    i think it will .    morriss stopped his pacing immediately before lucky .  his voice was a sudden bluster .   starr  i can t believe this .  the v frogs have been in the city for years .  they ve been here almost since the city was built .     you ve got to remember   began lucky .    that i m under their influence .   morriss reddened .   that isn t so .  i deny it .      there s nothing to be ashamed of  dr .  morriss   said lucky  crisply .   evans was under their control for days  and bigman and i have been controlled  too .  it is possible to be honestly unaware that your mind has been continuously picked .     there s no proof of it  but never mind   said morriss       violently .   suppose you re right .  the question is  what can we do .  how do we fight them .  sending men against them will be useless .  if we bring in a fleet to bombard venus from space  they may force the dome locks open and drown every city on venus in revenge .  we could never kill every v frog on venus anyway .  there are eight hundred million cubic miles of ocean for them to hide in  and they can multiply fast if they want to .  now your getting word to earth was essential  i admit  but it still leaves us with many important problems .     you re right   admitted lucky   but the point is  i  didn t tell earth everything .  i couldn t until i was certain  i knew the truth .  i    the intercom signal flashed  and morriss barked .   what is it .     lyman turner for his appointment  sir   was the answer .    one second .   the venusian turned to lucky and said in a low voice   are you sure we want him .     you had this appointment about strengthening the transite partitions within the city  didn t you .     yes  but     and turner is a victim .  the evidence would seem to be clear there .  he is the one highly placed official beside ourselves who would definitely seem to be one .  we would want to see him  i think .    morriss said into the intercom   send him up .    turner s gaunt face and hooked nose made up a mask of inquiry as he entered .  the silence in the room and the way the others stared at him would have filled even a far less sensitive man with foreboding .   he swung his computer case to the floor and said   is anything wrong  gentlemen .    slowly  carefully  lucky gave him the bare outline of the matter .   turner s thin lips parted .  he said  weakly   you  mean  my mind      how else would the man at the lock have known the exact manner in which to keep out intruders .  he was       unskilled and untrained  yet he barricaded himself in with electronic perfection .     i never thought of that .  i never thought of that .   turner s voice was almost an incoherent mumble .  how could i have missed it .     they wanted you to miss it   said lucky .    it makes me ashamed .     you have company in that  turner .  myself  dr .   morriss  councilman evans     then what do we do about it .    lucky said   exactly what dr .  morriss was asking when you arrived .   it will need all our thought .  one of the reasons i suggested you be brought into this gathering is that we may require your computer .     oceans of venus  i hope so   said turner fervently .    if i could do something to make up for   and he  put his hand to his forehead as though half in fear that he had a strange head on his shoulders  one not his own .   he said   are we ourselves now .    evans put in   we will be as long as we concentrate on that petroleum jelly .     i don t get it .  why should that help .     it does .  never mind how for the moment   said lucky .   i want to get on with what i was about to say when you arrived .    bigman swung back to the wall and perched himself on the table where the aquarium once stood .  he stared idly at the open jar on the other table as he listened .   lucky said   are we sure the v frogs are the real menace .     why  that s your theory   said morriss with surprise .    oh  they re the immediate means of controlling the minds of mankind  granted  but are they the real enemy .  they re pitting their minds against the minds of earthmen and proving formidable opponents  yet individual v frogs seem quite unintelligent .     how so .     well  the v frog you had in this place did not have the good sense to keep out of our minds .  he broadcast       his surprise at our being without mustaches .  he ordered bigman to get him peas dipped in axle grease .  was that intelligent .  he gave himself away immediately .    morriss shrugged .   maybe not all v frogs are intelligent .     it goes deeper than that .  we were helpless in their mental grip out on the ocean surface .  still  because i guessed certain things  i tried a jar of petroleum jelly on them  and it worked .  it scattered them .  mind you  their entire campaign was at stake .  they had to keep us from informing earth concerning them .  yet they ruined everything for one jar of petroleum jelly .  again  they almost had us when we were trying to re enter aphrodite .  the cannon was coming to an aim when the mere mention of petroleum spoiled their plans .    turner stirred in his seat .   i understand what you mean by the petroleum now  starr .  everyone knows the v frogs have a craving for grease of all sorts .  the craving is just too strong for them .     too strong for beings sufficiently intelligent to battle earthmen .  would you abandon a vital victory  turner  for a steak or a wedge of chocolate cake .     of course i wouldn t  but that doesn t prove a v frog wouldn t .     it doesn t  i grant you .  the v frog mind is alien to us and we can t suppose that what works with us must work with them .  still  the matter of their being diverted by hydrocarbon is suspicious .  it makes me compare v frogs with dogs rather than with men .     in what way .   demanded morriss .    think about it   said lucky .   a dog can be trained to do many seemingly intelligent things .  a creature who had never seen or heard of a dog before  watching a seeing eye dog guide a blind master in the days before son o taps  would have wondered whether the dog or the man was the more intelligent .  but if he passed by them with a meaty bone and noted that the dog s attention was instantly diverted  he would suspect the truth .    turner said  his pale eyes nearly bulging   are you       trying to say that v frogs are just the tools of human beings .     doesn t that sound probable  turner .  as dr .  mor riss said just a while ago the v frogs have been in the city for years  but it s only a matter of the last few months that they ve been making trouble .  and then the trouble started with trivialities  like a man giving away money in the streets .  it is almost as though some men learned how to use the v frogs  natural capacity for telepathy as tools with which to inflict their thoughts and orders on human minds .  it is as though they had to practice at first  learn the nature and limitations of their tools  develop their control  until the time came when they could do big things .  eventually  it would be not the yeast that they were after but something more  perhaps control of the solar confederation  even of the entire galaxy .     i can t believe it   said morriss .    then i ll give you another piece of evidence .  when we were out in the ocean  a mental voice   presumably that of a v frog   spoke to us .  it tried to force us to give it some information and then commit suicide .     well .     the voice arrived via a v frog  but it did not originate with one .  it originated with a human being .    lou evans sat bolt upright and stared incredulously at lucky .   lucky smiled .   even lou doesn t believe that  but it s so .  the voice made use of odd concepts such as  machines of shining metal  instead of  ships .   we were supposed to think that v frogs were unfamiliar with such concepts  and the voice had to stimulate our minds into imagining we heard round about expressions that meant the same thing .  but then the voice forgot itself .  i remember what i heard it say .  i remember it word for word   life will end for your people like the quenching of a flame .  it will be snuffed out and life will burn no more .     morriss stolidly said again   well .     you still don t see it .  how could the v frogs use a       concept like the  quenching of a flame  or  life will burn no more  .  if the voice pretends to be that of a v frog with no concept of such a thing as a ship  how could it have one of fire .    they all saw it  now  but lucky drove on furiously .   the atmosphere of venus is nitrogen and carbon dioxide .  there is no oxygen .  we all know that .  nothing can burn in venus s atmosphere .  there can be no flame .  in a million years no v frog could possibly have seen a fire  and none of them can know what it is .  even granted that some might have seen fire and flame within the city domes  they could have no understanding of its nature any more than they understood our ships .  as i see it  the thoughts we received originated with no v frog  but with a man who used the v frog only as a channel to reach from his own mind to ours .     but how could that be done .   asked turner .    i don t know   said lucky .   i wish i did .  certainly it would take a brilliant mind to find a way .  a man would have to know a great deal about the workings of a nervous system and about the electrical phenomena associated with it .   lucky looked coldly at morriss .   it might take  for instance  a man who specialized in biophysics .    and all eyes turned on the venusian councilman  from whose round face the blood was draining until his grizzled mustache seemed scarcely visible against his pale skin .   chapter     the enemy .   morriss managed to say   are you trying to    and his voice ground hoarsely to a halt .    i m not making any definite statement   said lucky smoothly .   i have merely made a suggestion .    morriss looked helplessly about  turning from face to face of the four other men in the room  watching each pair of eyes meet his in fixed fascination .   he choked out   this is mad  absolutely insane .  i  was the first to report all this   this   trouble on venus .   find the original report in council headquarters .  my  name is on it .  why should i call in the council if i  were and my motive .  eh .  my motive .    councilman evans seemed uneasy .  from the quick glance he shot in turner s direction  bigman guessed that this form of inter council squabble in front of an outsider was not to his liking .   still  evans said   it would explain the effort dr .  morriss made to discredit me .  i was an outsider  and i might stumble on the truth .  i had found half of it  certainly .    morriss was breathing heavily .   i deny that t ever did such a thing .  all this is a conspiracy of some sort against me  and it will go hard in the end for any of you who join in this .  i will have justice .     are you implying that you wish a council trial .              asked lucky .   do you want to plead your case before a meeting of the assembled central committee of the council .    what lucky was referring to  of course  was the procedure ordained for the trial of councilmen accused of high treason against the council and the solar confederation .  in all the history of the council  not one man had ever had to stand such a trial .   at its mention  whatever shreds of control morriss had used to restrain his feelings vanished .  roaring  he scrambled to his feet and hurtled blindly at lucky .   lucky rolled nimbly up and over the arm of the chair he occupied and  at the same time  gestured quickly at bigman .   it was the signal that bigman was waiting for .  bigman proceeded to follow the instructions lucky had given him on board the hilda when they were passing through the lock of aphrodite s dome .   a blaster bolt shot out .  it was at low intensity but its ionizing radiations produced the pungent odor of ozone in the air .   matters remained so for a moment .  all motion ceased .  morriss  his head against the overturned chair  made no move to get up .  bigman remained standing  like a small statue  with his blaster still held against his hip as though he had been frozen in the act of shooting .   and the target of the blaster bolt lay destroyed and in ruins upon the floor .   lou evans found his breath first  but it was only for  a sharp exclamation   what in space    lyman turner whispered   what have you done .    morriss  panting from his recent effort  could say nothing  but he rolled his eyes mutely at bigman .   lucky said   nice shot  bigman   and bigman grinned .   and in a hundred fragments lyman turner s black computer case lay smashed and  for the most part  disintegrated .        turner s voice rose .   my computer .  you idiot .  what have you done .    lucky said sternly   only what he had to do  turner .  now  everyone quiet .    he turned to morriss  helped that plump personage to his feet  and said   all my apologies  dr .  morriss  but i had to make certain that turner s attention was completely misdirected .  i had to use you for that purpose .    morriss said   you mean you don t suspect me of     of     not for one minute   said lucky .   i never did .    morriss moved away  his eyes hot and angry   then suppose you explain  starr .    lucky said   before this conference  i never dared tell anyone that i thought some man was benind the v frogs .  i couldn t even state it in my message to earth .  it seemed obvious to me that if i were to do so  the real enemy might be desperate enough to take some action   such as actually flooding one of the cities   and hold the possibility ol a repetition over the heads of all of us as blackmail .  as long as he did not know that i went past the v frog in my suspicions  i hoped he would hold off and play for time or  at most  try to kill only my friends and myself .    at this conference i could speak of the matter because i believed the man in question to be present .  however  i dared not take action against him without proper preparation for fear that he might place us under control despite the presence of the petroleum and for fear that his actions thereafter would be drastic .  first i had to distract his attention thoroughly to make sure that  for a few seconds at least  he would be too absorbed in the surface activities of the group to detect  via his v frog tools  the strong emotions that might be leaking out of bigman s mind and mine .  to be sure  there are no v frogs in the building  but he might well be able to use the v frogs in other parts of the city as he was able to use v frogs out on the ocean s surface miles away from aphrodite .         to distract him then  i accused you  dr .  morriss .  i couldn t warn you in advance because i wanted your emotions to be authentic   and they were admirably so .  your attack on me was all that was needed .    morriss withdrew a large handkerchief from a sleeve pocket and mopped his glistening forehead .   that was pretty drastic  lucky  but i think i understand .  turner is the man  then .     he is   said lucky .   turner was on his knees  scrabbling among the fused and shattered shards of his instrument .  he looked up with hate filled eyes   you ve destroyed my computer .     i doubt that it was a computer   said lucky .   it was too inseparable a companion of yours .  when i first met you  you had it with you .  you stated you were using it to compute the strength of the inner barriers of the city against the threatened flood .  right now you have it with you presumably to help you if you should require new computations for your discussions with dr .  morriss on the strength of those same inner barriers .    lucky paused  then went on with a hard calmness in  his voice .   but i came to see you in your apartment  the morning after the threatened flood .  i was merely  planning to ask you some questions that involved no  computing and you knew that .  yet you had your com  puter with you .  you could not bring yourself to leave it  in the next room .  it had to be with you  at your feet .   why .    turner said desperately .   it was my own construction .  i was fond of it .  i always carried it with me .     i should judge it weighed some twenty five pounds .  rather heavy  even for affection .  could it be that it was the device you used to maintain touch with the v frogs at all tunes .     how do you intend to prove that .   flashed back turner .   you said i myself was a victim .  everyone here is witness to that .     yes   said lucky   the man who  despite inexperience  so expertly barricaded himself at the dome lock        got his information from you .  but was that information stolen from your mind or did you yourself donate it freely .    morriss said angrily   let me put the question directly  lucky .  are you or are you not responsible for the epidemic of mental control  turner .     of course i m not   cried turner .   you can t do anything just on the say so of a young fool who thinks he can make guesses and have them stick because he s on the council .    lucky said   tell me  turner  do you remember that night when a man sat at one of the dome locks with a lever in his hand .  do you remember it well .     quite well .     do you remember coming to me and telling me that if the locks were opened the inner transite barrier would not hold and that all of aphrodite would be flooded .  you were quite frightened .  almost panicky .     all right .  i was .  i still am .  it s something to be panicky about .   he added  with his lip curling   unless you re the brave lucky starr .    lucky ignored that .   did you come to me with that information in order to add a little to the already existing confusion  to make sure that we were all disconcerted long enough for you to maneuver lou evans out of the city in order that he might be safely killed in the ocean .  evans was hard to handle  and he had learned too much concerning the v frogs .  perhaps  also  you were trying to frighten me out of aphrodite and off venus .    turner said   this is all ridiculous .  the inner barriers are inadequate .  ask morriss .  he s already seen my figures .    morriss noded reluctantly .   i m afraid turner is right there .     no matter   said lucky .   let s consider that settled .  there was a real danger  and turner was justifiably panicked .   .   .   .  you are married  turner .    turner s eyes flicked uneasily to lucky s face and away again .   so .          your wife is pretty and considerably younger than yourself .  you have been married for not quite a year .     what is that intended to prove .     that you probably have a deep affection for her .  immediately after marriage you move into an expensive apartment to please her  you allow her to decorate it according to her tastes even though your own taste differs .  surely you wouldn t neglect her safety  would you .     i don t understand .  what are you talking about .     i think you know .  the one time i met your wife she told toe that she had slept through the entire excitement the night before .  she seemed quite disappointed that she had .  she also told me what a fine apartment house she lived in .  she said it even possessed  chambers .   unfortunately  that meant nothing to me at the time  or i might have seen the truth then and there .  it was only later  at the bottom of the ocean  that lou evans casually mentioned chambers and told me what they were .   chambers  is a word used on venus to denote special shelters built to withstand the full force of the ocean in case a quake breaks a city dome .  now do you know what fm talking about .    turner was silent .   lucky went on .   if you were so frightened of city wide catastrophe that night  why didn t you think of your wife .  you spoke of rescuing people  of escaping the city .  did you never consider your wife s safety .  there were chambers in the basement of her apartment house .  two minutes and she would have been safe .  you had only to call her  give her one word of warning .  but you didn t .  you let her sleep .    turner mumbled something .   lucky said   don t say you forgot .  that s completely unbelievable .  you might have forgotten anything  but not your wife s safety .  let me suggest an alternative explanation .  you were not worried about your wife because you knew she was in no real danger .  you knew she was in no real danger because you knew the lock in the dome would never be opened .   lucky s       voice was hard with anger .   you knew the lock in the dome would never be opened because you yourself were in mental control of the man at the lever .  it was your very fondness for your wife that betrayed you .  you could not bring yourself to disturb her sleep merely in order to make your phony act more plausible .    turner said suddenly   i m not saying anything more without a lawyer .  what you have isn t evidence .    lucky said   it s enough to warrant a full council investigation  though .   .  .  .  dr .  morriss  would you have him taken in custody in preparation for flight under guard to earth .  bigman and i will go with him .  we ll see that he gets there safely .    at the hotel again  bigman said worriedly   sands of mars  lucky  i don t see how we re going to get proof against turner .  all your deductions sound convincing and all that  but it isn t legal proof .    lucky  with a warm yeast dinner inside himself  was able to relax for the first time since he and bigman had penetrated the cloud barrier that encircles venus .  he said   i don t think the council will be mainly interested in legal proof or in getting turner executed .     lucky .  why not .  that cobber     i know .  he s a murderer several times over .  he definitely had dictatorial ambitions  so he s a traitor  too .  but more important than either of those things is the fact that he created a work of genius .    bigman said   you mean his machine .     i certainly do .  we destroyed the only one in existence  probably  and we ll need him to build another .  there are many questions we d like answered .  how did turner control the v frogs .  when he wanted lou evans killed  did he instruct the v frogs in detail  tell them every step of the procedure  order them to bring up the giant patch .  or did he simply say   kill evans   and allow the v frogs to do their jobs like trained dogs in whatever way they thought best .    then  too  can you imagine the use to which an instrument such as that can be put .  it may offer us an       entirely new method of attack on mental diseases  a new way of combating criminal impulses .  it may even  conceivably  be used to prevent wars in the future or to defeat the enemies of earth quickly and bloodlessly if a war is forced upon us .  just as the machine was dangerous in the hands of one ambition riddled man  it can be very useful and beneficial in the hands of the council .    bigman said   do you think the council will argue him into building another machine .     i think so  and with proper safeguards  too .  if we offer him pardon and rehabilitation  with an alternative of life imprisonment with no chance of ever seeing his wife again  i think he ll agree to help .  and  of course  one of the first uses of the machine would be to investigate turner s own mind  help cure it of his abnormal desire for power  and save for the service of humanity a first class brain .    the next day they would be leaving venus  heading once again for earth .  lucky thought with pleasant nostalgia of the beautiful blue sky of his home planet  the open air  the natural foods  the space and scope of land life .  he said   remember  bigman  it is easy to  protect society  by executing a criminal  but that will not bring back his victims .  if one can cure him instead and use him to make life better and brighter for that society  how much more has been accomplished .
