     the magic fishbone  a holiday romance from the pen of miss alice rainbird aged   .   by  charles dickens             london  constable and co .  ltd .              foreword  the story contained herein was written by charles dickens in      .  it is the second of four stories entitled  holiday romance  and was published originally in a children s magazine in america .  it purports to be written by a child aged seven .  it was republished in england in  all the year round  in      .  for this and four other christmas pieces dickens received         .    holiday romance  was published in book form by messrs chapman   hall in       with  edwin drood  and other stories .   for this reprint the text of the story as it appeared in  all the year round  has been followed .               illustration  several of the children were growing out of their clothes   there was once a king  and he had a queen  and he was the manliest of his sex  and she was the loveliest of hers .  the king was  in his private profession  under government .  the queen s father had been a medical man out of town .   they had nineteen children  and were always having more .  seventeen of these children took care of the baby  and alicia  the eldest  took care of them all .  their ages varied from seven years to seven months .   let us now resume our story .   one day the king was going to the office  when he stopped at the fishmonger s to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail  which the queen  who was a careful housekeeper  had requested him to send home .  mr pickles  the fishmonger  said   certainly  sir  is there any other article  good morning .    the king went on towards the office in a melancholy mood  for quarter day was such a long way off  and several of the dear children were growing out of their clothes .  he had not proceeded far  when mr pickles s errand boy came running after him  and said   sir  you didn t notice the old lady in our shop .     what old lady .   enquired the king .   i saw none .    now  the king had not seen any old lady  because this old lady had been invisible to him  though visible to mr pickles s boy .  probably because he messed and splashed the water about to that degree  and flopped the pairs of soles down in that violent manner  that  if she had not been visible to him  he would have spoilt her clothes .   just then the old lady came trotting up .  she was dressed in shot silk of the richest quality  smelling of dried lavender .    king watkins the first  i believe .   said the old lady .    watkins   replied the king   is my name .     papa  if i am not mistaken  of the beautiful princess alicia .   said the old lady .    and of eighteen other darlings   replied the king .    listen .  you are going to the office   said the old lady .   it instantly flashed upon the king that she must be a fairy  or how could she know that .    you are right   said the old lady  answering his thoughts   i am the good fairy grandmarina .  attend .  when you return home to dinner  politely invite the princess alicia to have some of the salmon you bought just now .     it may disagree with her   said the king .   the old lady became so very angry at this absurd idea  that the king was quite alarmed  and humbly begged her pardon .    we hear a great deal too much about this thing disagreeing  and that thing disagreeing   said the old lady  with the greatest contempt it was possible to express .   don t be greedy .  i think you want it all yourself .    the king hung his head under this reproof  and said he wouldn t talk about things disagreeing  any more .    be good  then   said the fairy grandmarina   and don t .  when the beautiful princess alicia consents to partake of the salmon  as i think she will  you will find she will leave a fish bone on her plate .  tell her to dry it  and to rub it  and to polish it till it shines like mother of pearl  and to take care of it as a present from me .     is that all .   asked the king .    don t be impatient  sir   returned the fairy grandmarina  scolding him severely .   don t catch people short  before they have done speaking .  just the way with you grown up persons .  you are always doing it .    the king again hung his head  and said he wouldn t do so any more .    be good then   said the fairy grandmarina   and don t .  tell the princess alicia  with my love  that the fish bone is a magic present which can only be used once  but that it will bring her  that once  whatever she wishes for  provided she wishes for it at the right time .  that is the message .  take care of it .     illustration  hoity toity me .    the king was beginning   might i ask the reason   .   when the fairy became absolutely furious .    will you be good  sir .   she exclaimed  stamping her foot on the ground .   the reason for this  and the reason for that  indeed .  you are always wanting the reason .  no reason .  there .  hoity toity me .  i am sick of your grown up reasons .    the king was extremely frightened by the old lady s flying into such a passion  and said he was very sorry to have offended her  and he wouldn t ask for reasons any more .    be good then   said the old lady   and don t .    with those words  grandmarina vanished  and the king went on and on and on  till he came to the office .  there he wrote and wrote and wrote  till it was time to go home again .  then he politely invited the princess alicia  as the fairy had directed him  to partake of the salmon .  and when she had enjoyed it very much  he saw the fish bone on her plate  as the fairy had told him he would  and he delivered the fairy s message  and the princess alicia took care to dry the bone  and to rub it  and to polish it till it shone like mother of pearl .    illustration  he saw the fish bone on her plate   and so when the queen was going to get up in the morning  she said   o  dear me  dear me  my head  my head .   and then she fainted away .   the princess alicia  who happened to be looking in at the chamber door  asking about breakfast  was very much alarmed when she saw her royal mamma in this state  and she rang the bell for peggy  which was the name of the lord chamberlain .  but remembering where the smelling bottle was  she climbed on a chair and got it  and after that she climbed on another chair by the bedside and held the smelling bottle to the queen s nose  and after that she jumped down and got some water  and after that she jumped up again and wetted the queen s forehead  and  in short  when the lord chamberlain came in  that dear old woman said to the little princess   what a trot you are .  i couldn t have done it better myself .     illustration   but that was not the worst of the good queen s illness .  o  no .  she was very ill indeed  for a long time .  the princess alicia kept the seventeen young princes and princesses quiet  and dressed and undressed and danced the baby  and made the kettle boil  and heated the soup  and swept the hearth  and poured out the medicine  and nursed the queen  and did all that ever she could  and was as busy busy busy  as busy could be .  for there were not many servants at that palace  for three reasons  because the king was short of money  because a rise in his office never seemed to come  and because quarter day was so far off that it looked almost as far off and as little as one of the stars .   but on the morning when the queen fainted away  where was the magic fish bone .  why  there it was in the princess alicia s pocket .  she had almost taken it out to bring the queen to life again  when she put it back  and looked for the smelling bottle .   after the queen had come out of her swoon that morning  and was dozing  the princess alicia hurried up stairs to tell a most particular secret to a most particularly confidential friend of hers  who was a duchess .  people did suppose her to be a doll  but she was really a duchess  though nobody knew it except the princess .    illustration   this most particular secret was a secret about the magic fish bone  the history of which was well known to the duchess  because the princess told her everything .  the princess kneeled down by the bed on which the duchess was lying  full dressed and wide awake  and whispered the secret to her .  the duchess smiled and nodded .  people might have supposed that she never smiled and nodded  but she often did  though nobody knew it except the princess .   then the princess alicia hurried downstairs again  to keep watch in the queen s room .  she often kept watch by herself in the queen s room  but every evening  while the illness lasted  she sat there watching with the king .  and every evening the king sat looking at her with a cross look  wondering why she never brought out the magic fish bone .  as often as she noticed this  she ran up stairs  whispered the secret to the duchess over again  and said to the duchess besides   they think we children never have a reason or a meaning .   and the duchess  though the most fashionable duchess that ever was heard of  winked her eye .    alicia   said the king  one evening when she wished him good night .    yes  papa .     what is become of the magic fish bone .     in my pocket  papa .     i thought you had lost it .     o  no  papa .     or forgotten it .     no  indeed  papa .    and so another time the dreadful little snapping pug dog next door made a rush at one of the young princes as he stood on the steps coming home from school  and terrified him out of his wits and he put his hand through a pane of glass  and bled bled bled .  when the seventeen other young princes and princesses saw him bleed bleed bleed  they were terrified out of their wits too  and screamed themselves black in their seventeen faces all at once .  but the princess alicia put her hands over all their seventeen mouths  one after another  and persuaded them to be quiet because of the sick queen .  and then she put the wounded prince s hand in a basin of fresh cold water  while they stared with their twice seventeen are thirty four put down four and carry three eyes  and then she looked in the hand for bits of glass  and there were fortunately no bits of glass there .  and then she said to two chubby legged princes who were sturdy though small   bring me in the royal rag bag  i must snip and stitch and cut and contrive .   so those two young princes tugged at the royal rag bag and lugged it in  and the princess alicia sat down on the floor with a large pair of scissors and a needle and thread  and snipped and stitched and cut and contrived  and made a bandage and put it on  and it fitted beautifully  and so when it was all done she saw the king her papa looking on by the door .    illustration    alicia .     yes  papa .     what have you been doing .     snipping stitching cutting and contriving  papa .     where is the magic fish bone .     in my pocket  papa .     i thought you had lost it .     o  no  papa .     or forgotten it .     no  indeed  papa .    after that  she ran up stairs to the duchess and told her what had passed  and told her the secret over again  and the duchess shook her flaxen curls and laughed with her rosy lips .    illustration   well .  and so another time the baby fell under the grate .  the seventeen young princes and princesses were used to it  for they were almost always falling under the grate or down the stairs  but the baby was not used to it yet  and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye .  the way the poor little darling came to tumble was  that he slid out of the princess alicia s lap just as she was sitting in a great coarse apron that quite smothered her  in front of the kitchen fire  beginning to peel the turnips for the broth for dinner  and the way she came to be doing that was  that the king s cook had run away that morning with her own true love who was a very tall but very tipsy soldier .  then  the seventeen young princes and princesses  who cried at everything that happened  cried and roared .  but the princess alicia  who couldn t help crying a little herself  quietly called to them to be still  on account of not throwing back the queen up stairs  who was fast getting well  and said   hold your tongues  you wicked little monkeys  every one of you  while i examine baby .   then she examined baby  and found that he hadn t broken anything  and she held cold iron to his poor dear eye  and smoothed his poor dear face  and he presently fell asleep in her arms .  then  she said to the seventeen princes and princesses   i am afraid to lay him down yet  lest he should wake and feel pain  be good  and you shall all be cooks .   they jumped for joy when they heard that  and began making themselves cooks  caps out of old newspapers .  so to one she gave the salt box  and to one she gave the barley  and to one she gave the herbs  and to one she gave the turnips  and to one she gave the carrots  and to one she gave the onions  and to one she gave the spice box  till they were all cooks  and all running about at work  she sitting in the middle smothered in the great coarse apron  nursing baby .  by and by the broth was done  and the baby woke up smiling like an angel  and was trusted to the sedatest princess to hold  while the other princes and princesses were squeezed into a far off corner to look at the princess alicia turning out the saucepan full of broth  for fear  as they were always getting into trouble  they should get splashed and scalded .  when the broth came tumbling out  steaming beautifully  and smelling like a nosegay good to eat  they clapped their hands .  that made the baby clap his hands  and that  and his looking as if he had a comic toothache  made all the princes and princesses laugh .  so the princess alicia said   laugh and be good  and after dinner we will make him a nest on the floor in a corner  and he shall sit in his nest and see a dance of eighteen cooks .   that delighted the young princes and princesses  and they ate up all the broth  and washed up all the plates and dishes  and cleared away  and pushed the table into a corner  and then they in their cooks  caps  and the princess alicia in the smothering coarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true love that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier  danced a dance of eighteen cooks before the angelic baby  who forgot his swelled face and his black eye  and crowed with joy .    illustration  the dance of the eighteen cooks   and so then  once more the princess alicia saw king watkins the first  her father  standing in the doorway looking on  and he said   what have you been doing  alicia .     cooking and contriving  papa .     what else have you been doing  alicia .     keeping the children light hearted  papa .     where is the magic fish bone  alicia .     in my pocket  papa .     i thought you had lost it .     o  no  papa .     or forgotten it .     no  indeed  papa .    the king then sighed so heavily  and seemed so low spirited  and sat down so miserably  leaning his head upon his hand  and his elbow upon the kitchen table pushed away in the corner  that the seventeen princes and princesses crept softly out of the kitchen  and left him alone with the princess alicia and the angelic baby .    what is the matter  papa .     i am dreadfully poor  my child .     have you no money at all  papa .     illustration   what is the matter  papa .      none my child .     is there no way left of getting any  papa .     no way   said the king .   i have tried very hard  and i have tried all ways .    when she heard those last words  the princess alicia began to put her hand into the pocket where she kept the magic fish bone .    papa   said she   when we have tried very hard  and tried all ways  we must have done our very very best .     no doubt  alicia .     when we have done our very very best  papa  and that is not enough  then i think the right time must have come for asking help of others .   this was the very secret connected with the magic fish bone  which she had found out for herself from the good fairy grandmarina s words  and which she had so often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend the duchess .   so she took out of her pocket the magic fish bone that had been dried and rubbed and polished till it shone like mother of pearl  and she gave it one little kiss and wished it was quarter day .  and immediately it was quarter day  and the king s quarter s salary came rattling down the chimney  and bounced into the middle of the floor .   but this was not half of what happened  no not a quarter  for immediately afterwards the good fairy grandmarina came riding in  in a carriage and four  peacocks   with mr pickles s boy up behind  dressed in silver and gold  with a cocked hat  powdered hair  pink silk stockings  a jewelled cane  and a nosegay .  down jumped mr pickles s boy with his cocked hat in his hand and wonderfully polite  being entirely changed by enchantment   and handed grandmarina out  and there she stood in her rich shot silk smelling of dried lavender  fanning herself with a sparkling fan .    alicia  my dear   said this charming old fairy   how do you do  i hope i see you pretty well  give me a kiss .    the princess alicia embraced her  and then grandmarina turned to the king  and said rather sharply    are you good .     illustration   alicia  my dear  .  .  .  how do you do .     the king said he hoped so .    i suppose you know the reason  now  why my god daughter here   kissing the princess again   did not apply to the fish bone sooner .   said the fairy .   the king made her a shy bow .    ah .  but you didn t then .   said the fairy .   the king made her a shyer bow .    any more reasons to ask for .   said the fairy .   the king said no  and he was very sorry .    be good then   said the fairy   and live happy ever afterwards .    then  grandmarina waved her fan  and the queen came in most splendidly dressed  and the seventeen young princes and princesses  no longer grown out of their clothes  came in newly fitted out from top to toe  with tucks in everything to admit of its being let out .  after that  the fairy tapped the princess alicia with her fan  and the smothering coarse apron flew away  and she appeared exquisitely dressed  like a little bride  with a wreath of orange flowers and a silver veil .  after that  the kitchen dresser changed of itself into a wardrobe  made of beautiful woods and gold and looking glass  which was full of dresses of all sorts  all for her and all exactly fitting her .  after that  the angelic baby came in  running alone  with his face and eye not a bit the worse but much the better .  then  grandmarina begged to be introduced to the duchess  and  when the duchess was brought down many compliments passed between them .   a little whispering took place between the fairy and the duchess  and then the fairy said out loud   yes .  i thought she would have told you .   grandmarina then turned to the king and queen  and said   we are going in search of prince certainpersonio .  the pleasure of your company is requested at church in half an hour precisely .   so she and the princess alicia got into the carriage  and mr pickles s boy handed in the duchess who sat by herself on the opposite seat  and then mr pickles s boy put up the steps and got up behind  and the peacocks flew away with their tails spread .    illustration  she appeared exquisitely dressed  like a little bride   prince certainpersonio was sitting by himself  eating barley sugar and waiting to be ninety .  when he saw the peacocks followed by the carriage  coming in at the window  it immediately occurred to him that something uncommon was going to happen .    prince   said grandmarina   i bring you your bride .    the moment the fairy said those words  prince certainpersonio s face left off being stickey  and his jacket and corduroys changed to peach bloom velvet  and his hair curled  and a cap and feather flew in like a bird and settled on his head .  he got into the carriage by the fairy s invitation  and there he renewed his acquaintance with the duchess  whom he had seen before .   in the church were the prince s relations and friends  and the princess alicia s relations and friends  and the seventeen princes and princesses  and the baby  and a crowd of the neighbours .  the marriage was beautiful beyond expression .  the duchess was bridesmaid  and beheld the ceremony from the pulpit where she was supported by the cushion of the desk .   grandmarina gave a magnificent wedding feast afterwards  in which there was everything and more to eat  and everything and more to drink .  the wedding cake was delicately ornamented with white satin ribbons  frosted silver and white lilies  and was forty two yards round .   when grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple  and prince certainpersonio had made a speech  and everybody had cried hip hip hip hurrah .  grandmarina announced to the king and queen that in future there would be eight quarter days in every year  except in leap year  when there would be ten .  she then turned to certainpersonio and alicia  and said   my dears  you will have thirty five children  and they will all be good and beautiful .  seventeen of your children will be boys  and eighteen will be girls .  the hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally .  they will never have the measles  and will have recovered from the whooping cough before being born .    on hearing such good news  everybody cried out  hip hip hip hurrah .   again .    it only remains   said grandmarina in conclusion   to make an end of the fish bone .    so she took it from the hand of the princess alicia  and it instantly flew down the throat of the dreadful little snapping pug dog next door and choked him  and he expired in convulsions .   the end   illustration              printed at the arden press  letchworth  england .   first impression  twelve thousand copies  sept .  mcmxi
